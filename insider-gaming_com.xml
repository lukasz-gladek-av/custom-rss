<p>Resident Evil is one of those franchises that everyone knows worldwide. From the claustrophobic confines of the Spencer Mansion to a cold, isolated village in Romania, to a scorching setting in Africa, fans have seen and done it all. Thankfully, Capcom continues to make new games, and with new projects being developed, let’s tap into the past and rank the main Resident Evil Games.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming is not ranking <em>every </em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> game, as we’ll be here all day. No one wants to know if the mess that is Umbrella Corps has enough T-Virus in the tank to fend off competition from Operation Raccoon City! No, 10 Resident Evil games are the subject of this ranked list, and it’s predominantly what are considered the mainline games in the series.</p>



<p>Controversy and cold takes are sure to ensue.</p>







<h2 id="h-every-resident-evil-mainline-game-ranked">Every Resident Evil Mainline Game Ranked</h2>



<h3 id="h-10-resident-evil-zero">10. Resident Evil Zero</h3>

<p>There are always two immediate bones of contention for a Resident Evil ranked list: Who comes out on top, and who collects the Wooden Spoon. For my money, Resident Evil Zero earns the cutlery because it just isn’t that good, and one of the main reasons it’s <strong>borderline unplayable is the inventory system</strong>, which decided to do away with the traditional, magic inventory box system and have items be strewn around the game—leading to excessive backtracking.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Resident Evil Requiem On Xbox Game Pass?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Billy and Rebecca’s storage space is so small that you’d think every item you were carrying was the size of a grandfather clock. It takes ‘survival horror’ to an exaggerated degree, and it doesn’t help that Zero has uninspired enemies and bosses and doesn’t boast a compelling story. Only a remake, making necessary gameplay improvements, could improve its future standing.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-resident-evil-6">9. Resident Evil 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>You thought this would be last, didn’t you? Resident Evil 6 is <em>hilarious</em>. <strong>It’s so unhinged and unashamedly bonkers that you have no choice but to laugh at how outlandish and unserious it is</strong>. It’s no secret that Capcom’s fourth and fifth numbered games veered away from the intense survival horror aspects of the originals, but Resident Evil 6 goes so far off the beaten path that it ends up in Narnia.</p>



<p>The idea of multiple campaigns and the chance to use several iconic fan-favorites is a wonderful idea, but the execution is woefully hit and miss (mostly miss). Leon’s campaign is the clear standout, paying homage to Resident Evil’s roots, and it can be unironically enjoyable. If you cut Jake’s and Chris’ campaigns and extended Leon’s and Ada’s, there would actually be a pretty good Resi game here. Instead, it’s seen as the catalyst for change—causing Capcom to go back to the drawing board afterward, and if you want to have this in the number ten spot, I don’t blame you.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-resident-evil-3-remake">8. Resident Evil 3 Remake</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Do you go with the remake or the original? Another question that applies to several entries on this Resident Evil games ranked list. For convenience and relevance, the remakes are getting the nod, which is why the Resident Evil 3 Remake ranks so low. There are just better games, for one thing, but the remake loses a lot of the heart and soul of the original—and content.</p>



<p><strong>The Nemesis encounters are terrifying</strong>, but few and far between, and feel quite inorganic. Also, why is one of gaming’s most distinguishable enemies wearing a giant bin liner? Jill is fantastic, and so is the narrative, and Nemesis will still make you change your underwear after every showdown. You might enjoy the original more, but here, the Resi 3 Remake comes in at number eight.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-resident-evil-village">7. Resident Evil Village</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>If Resident Evil 7: Biohazard was the game to get the franchise back on the rails, Village quickly gets bored and taps into the franchise’s bad aspects again. <strong>Village pretty much peaks once you finish up the Castle Beneviento</strong> portion of the game, and given how much hype there was for Lady Dimitrescu, her role is more stunted than it should’ve been.</p>



<p>Village looks and feels spectacular and leans more heavily into Resident Evil 4 for inspiration. You’re not short of action, but the game feels linear, and the story is somewhat disjointed. There’s also too much action again—we won’t even touch on Chris Redfield’s Call of Duty action sequence at the end of the game. Resident Evil Village is fine and fun, but it’s a definite step back.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-resident-evil-5">6. Resident Evil 5</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It needs to be said: <strong>This is the most underrated Resident Evil game</strong>, and it’s not even close. Five unfairly gets the flak for being the first true ‘non-Resident Evil game.’ Indeed, the sun-scorched tropics of Africa don’t scream dark, despair, and desperation, but the intense Manjini sequences instil a different breed of scares and tension.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-trophies-achievement-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Trophy List</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s antiquated control scheme shows its age, though, making some battles far harder than they need to be and frustrating. Lots of Resident Evil 5 involves fighting multiple enemies in tight spaces, and the tank-like controls can leave you wanting to punch more than just boulders. I also have to say how much I love getting the tiniest scratch, only for Sheva to blast me with a full First Aid Spray. Still, the game’s mission structure is a blast, and there’s some seriously good gameplay here—plus a decent story with appearances from Wesker and Jill.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-resident-evil-7-biohazard">5. Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of my biggest complaints with Resident Evil games is that they have a tendency to fall flatter than a pancake toward the end. The first two-thirds of Resident Evil 7 are nothing short of exceptional, and it’s unbelievable how much tension and panic the new first-person perspective adds. Jack Baker’s dynamic AI keeps you on your toes, and it has some of the best boss battles in Resident Evil history. If you really want to hate yourself, play this in VR!</p>



<p>So, where does it go wrong? Ethan Winters is the most boring and non-descript hero (he improves in Village), the delicate pacing descends into a tired slog of combat once you reach the ship, and the final boss fight and ending overall are just such a letdown from the game’s promising early hours. If you savor the first huge chunk of the title, you have the most survival-horror-driven entry since Resident Evil 3, and it might be the best atmosphere Capcom has ever delivered.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-resident-evil">4. Resident Evil</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It would be a crime to put this any lower. The original 1996 Resident Evil is the type of game that should adorn the hallways of any video game museum or archive. Its influence is immeasurable, and it managed to create a disgustingly tense and titillating experience with limited 90s gaming tech. However, this entry is based on the 2002 GameCube remake, as it remains the optimal way to enjoy it—for now.</p>



<p>The methodical pacing ensures you get a nice snippet of Zombie action with limited supplies before finding items, solving puzzles, and SNAKE-ing your way through the Spencer Mansion and beyond. The story is subpar as it’s finding its feet, and the legendary dialogue is so bad it’s…well, bad. Regardless, many of the games you play in 2026 have likely been influenced by Resident Evil in one way or another, and it remains a classic and staple of the survival horror genre it created.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-resident-evil-code-veronica-x">3. Resident Evil Code: Veronica X</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Resident Evil Code: Veronica was a system-selling monster that dwarfed many of its contemporaries at the time. Then, Resident Evil Code: Veronica X made some subtle additions, making it the most complete way to play Code: Veronica. There’s something special about getting a Chris and Claire story, and unlike Resident Evil 7 and 8, this is one of the best stories that actually gets better the further you progress.</p>



<p>Writing this list in 2026 is tricky because there’s a common complaint about the older games that rears its head again: Controls. It was a deliberate design choice by Capcom early on that grows very tiresome in subsequent releases—which is why recent games have been a delight with their freeing movement. The story really pulls its weight here and makes Code Veronica worth playing again…and again.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-resident-evil-4-remake">2. Resident Evil 4 Remake</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now for bone of contention number two: Resident Evil 4 or Resident Evil 2? It all depends on what YOU are looking for in a Resident Evil game. As this is Insider Gaming’s list (and my thoughts), I prefer brains over braun, which is why Resident Evil 4 takes the second spot. The remake highlights why the fourth mainline game was so groundbreaking at the time and still holds up. It seamlessly blends action, survival sequences, and epic boss fights, and delivers a compelling (and kooky) story throughout its extended duration.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How Long To Beat Resident Evil Requiem?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s much longer than most Resident Evil games, giving you real value for money. Nearly everything about it is memorable: The opening village siege, the cart ride, the monster on the lake—it’s Resident Evil heritage. While the game is action-oriented, there’s still plenty of horror. Seeing a Garrador fills my body with panic, and hearing a Regenrator is still enough to make me want to turn the game off.</p>



<p>Babysitting Ashley does hurt the pacing, I’m not gonna lie. It’s one aspect of the game I always hate and dread, but regardless, this is a masterpiece.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-resident-evil-2-remake">1. Resident Evil 2 Remake</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another masterpiece is Resident Evil 2: I haven’t a single bad thing to say about this game. When it was revealed that Capcom was remaking Resident Evil 2 with a new third-person camera, the Resi community went into overdrive. Yet, the remake keeps everything that made the original game so amazing, and I would argue betters it.</p>



<p>The puzzles are perfect, every location feels meaningful and suspenseful, and Leon Kennedy is such a likable protagonist. Where Nemesis feels sporadic and watered down in the Resident Evil 3 Remake, Tyrant (more commonly known as Mr. X) is a constant menace that keeps you on your toes from start to finish. With potentially four unique playthroughs to experience as Leon and Claire, there’s content for days. Capcom nailed the Resident Evil 2 Remake, and it brings home the bacon for this list.</p>

If you agree (or presumably disagree) with any of these placements, head there and share your opinion—it’s all a bit of fun at the end of the day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New details have been revealed for Forza Horizon 6’s campaign structure, giving players a clear picture of what to expect from the open-world progression system when the game launches in May 2026.</p>







<p>The latest blog from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/playground-games/" id="87661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Playground Games</a> outlines how the campaign in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/forza-horizon-6/" id="2895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a> blends exploration and Festival challenges across a sprawling Japan setting. Rather than jumping in as an established festival Superstar like in previous titles, players begin their journey as a tourist with ambitions of joining the Horizon Festival and eventually becoming a Legend.</p>



<h2 id="h-campaign-focuses-on-growth-amp-exploration">Campaign Focuses On Growth &amp; Exploration</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Unreal graphics. Image by Playground Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Playground Games’ campaign approach emphasises progression through performance and discovery. To qualify for the Festival, you must complete Horizon Qualifiers and the Invitational to earn your first Wristband, unlocking access to curated races around Japan. As you earn more Wristbands by competing in Festival events, PR Stunts, and skills challenges, you will challenge increasingly demanding races featuring faster cars and varied terrain.</p>



<p>Progression isn’t limited to structured Festival competitions. Forza Horizon 6 also offers Discover Japan, a more free-form experience where you earn Stamps by photographing landscapes, completing side activities like Touge Battles or night street races, and exploring cultural hotspots. These activities reward cars, credits, and cosmetic items tracked in the game’s new Collection Journal.</p>







<p>Both paths—Festival Wristbands and Discover Japan—feed into campaign advancement, giving players flexibility in how they approach their journey. Reaching the highest tier grants access to exclusive locations like Legend Island, featuring intense events such as an extended Goliath race looping the full map.</p>



<p>The campaign is designed to play solo or in co-op with friends, with options to customise race conditions, vehicle selection, weather, and more once certain progression milestones are unlocked.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-pricing-details/</link>
            <guid>1443970</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New details have been revealed about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a>‘s Ringside Pass.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 has revamped the DLC process with a new Ringside Pass system. This is more akin to the Battle Pass in Fortnite than to the old WWE DLC model. Ringside Pass Season 1 will go live on March 6, when the game hits Early Access.</p>



<p>Players can purchase the premium track of the Ringside Pass via a premium pass, but they will still need to grind through and play the game to attain the unlockables instead of having the ability to unlock everything outright, as was the case in the past when players purchased premium editions of the game.</p>







<h2>WWE 2K26 Ringside Pass Tier Skips Priced Similarly to NBA 2K</h2>



<p>A new video from Smacktalks on YouTube reveals further details about Season 1 of WWE 2K26’s Ringside Pass. The season will be centered around the AAA Lucha Libre Mexican wrestling promotion and feature four new superstars: Psycho Clown, Lady Flammer, Mr. Iguana, and El Hijo Del Vikingo. There will also be new arenas and championships based around AAA.</p>



<p>However, it was also revealed that players can purchase tier skips. However, it was noted to be priced similarly to NBA 2K, which is $1.99 per tier. Therefore, it would cost nearly $80 ($77.61) to skip all premium-tier options in Season 1.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-ringside-pass-seasons-don-t-expire">Ringside Pass Seasons Don’t Expire</h2>



<p>In some good news, players don’t have to rush to grind through and unlock everything, as the Ringside Pass Seasons do not expire. Therefore, players can still unlock everything at their leisure.</p>



<p>One of the game’s developers is confident that fans will enjoy the new DLC system overall. They believe that this allows for more content for the players. Read their full comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-dev-confident-fans-will-like-new-ringside-pass/" id="175166">here</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will provide more news regarding WWE 2K26 leading up to Early Access. Early Access is a little more than a week away, launching on March 6. The game will be available to the global public on March 13.</p>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shrouded-sky-update-notes-arc-raiders/</link>
            <guid>1443919</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">Embark Studios</a> has unveiled what’s coming in the Shrouded Sky update with a full blog post that details <strong>all</strong>. This includes a new player project to build a Weather Monitoring Station, the previously revealed Hurricane map condition, <strong>two </strong>new minor ARC threats, a free Raider Deck, and <strong>more</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s the most substantial update we’ve had so far in 2026, and it’s the second of the four segments on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a> roadmap released earlier this year.</p>



<p>Check out everything you need to know about Shrouded Sky below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-the-shrouded-sky-update">What’s Coming in the Shrouded Sky Update?</h2>



<p>The heart of Shrouded Sky revolves around the new Hurricane map condition, which presents inclement weather that impacts <strong>everything</strong>. That includes visibility, physics, movement, and environmental hazards. It’s a major map condition that will change how you interact with every environment it lands on.</p>



<p>That’s also where the new Weather Monitoring System comes into play. This is the Shrouded Sky player project, and it requires users to collect specific materials (not yet revealed) to build the system itself and ‘earn your Raider some rewards’. We’ll have the latest on what’s needed for that tomorrow.</p>



<p>What we thought was one minor ARC enemy has become <strong>two </strong>new ARC threats. Embark Studios has unveiled <strong>two </strong>ARC enemies, one that flies and another that buzzes around the floor, and both look equally troublesome. Here’s their blurb:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Firefly is a floating nightmare: an armored flying machine that emits a jet of flame, burning your Raider to a crisp unless you can move quickly or find cover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Comet is a spherical ARC machine that calmly patrols the surface, until it comes across an unsuspecting Raider. You better not let this one get too close – once it sees you, it will lock on with a frightening focus before exploding with a seismic boom.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure></figure>







<p>Those looking for sweet rewards can bust their way through the new free Raider Deck, which is themed around the medical profession this time around. It’s called ‘Surgeon’, and it’s reminiscent of an old-timey doctor or nurse get-up. As always, you’ll get these cosmetics by completing the Raider Deck, made accomplishable by completing <strong>Feats</strong>.</p>



<p>Facial hair is also confirmed to arrive with Shrouded Sky on <strong>February 24</strong>, giving players everywhere a way to adorn their Raiders with a thick scruff. From the word go, you can get stubble, but a full beard can only be unlocked via the Surgeon Raider Deck. In the store, ‘stubble beard’ and ‘thick moustache’ will be available from tomorrow.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Dam Battlegrounds has received a major overhaul, and the team at Embark Studios has added the Controlled Access Zone, a high-value loot area. Presently, we don’t know where that is.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, the rest of the update is comprised of cosmetics bundles, quality-of-life improvements, and some other balancing tweaks.</p>

<p>Iconic Capcom, PlatinumGames, and now Clovers dev Hideki Kamiya has commented on Resident Evil Requiem’s leaks, which arose after the game’s physical street date was broken by well over a week.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is 2026’s first major AAA game. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a>‘s franchise returns to a decimated Raccoon City. The hype has been huge, and the expectations are bigger than a skyscraper made entirely of El Gigantes. Unfortunately, countless buyers were able to get their hands on the game early, and it began a huge wave of Requiem spoilers.</p>







<h2 id="h-hideki-kamiya-not-happy-with-resident-evil-requiem-spoilers">Hideki Kamiya Not Happy With Resident Evil Requiem Spoilers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s not uncommon for a game’s physical street date to be broken, resulting in copies of the game being distributed days before launch, but Resident Evil Requiem went out roughly 10 days or more before launch. Leaks were inevitable, and social media was flooded with story spoilers and much more very quickly.</p>

</ul>



<p>Hideki Kamiya has shared his thoughts on the leaks and used a previous experience to summarize his thoughts. Here’s what he said, according to Google Translate:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I remember back with Bio2, the late-game plot twist got totally scooped by some photo weekly mag, right… For your own selfish satisfaction, you’re trampling all over the feelings of users who were looking forward to it, and the feelings of the creators who poured their all into making it—a detestable act that destroys everyone’s happiness and deserves a thousand deaths… May you be cursed to never play games again…</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Kamiya directed Resident Evil 2, the first Devil May Cry, and Bayonetta, and has attached his talents to many other projects. Needless to say, he’s not someone you should want to disrespect.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie Outlines Plans To Counter Cheaters In Marathon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-outlines-plans-to-counter-cheaters-in-marathon/</link>
            <guid>1443862</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bungie has detailed its plans to combat cheating in its upcoming extraction shooter Marathon, outlining a firm strategy designed to safeguard competitive integrity ahead of the game’s March 5, 2026, release.</p>







<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> team confirmed that the title will rely on dedicated server-side systems and integrated anti-cheat tools to detect and prevent illicit behaviour. And if those safeguards fail, the studio says offenders can expect swift and serious consequences rather than leniency.</p>



<h2 id="h-cheaters-will-be-given-no-second-chances">Cheaters Will Be Given ‘No Second Chances’</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s</a> stance appears uncompromising: players caught cheating will face decisive enforcement with little opportunity for repeat offences. This contrasts with the more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-confirm-punishment-for-dupe-exploits/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-confirm-punishment-for-dupe-exploits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forgiving approach</a> seen in rival extraction shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, whose developer Embark Studios has historically leaned toward lighter penalties. Bungie’s stricter policy is intended to reassure players that losses during raids should come from legitimate gameplay, not unfair exploits.</p>



<p>Still, the studio’s primary goal is prevention rather than punishment. Structural design choices aim to reduce cheating opportunities altogether. Because Marathon uses authoritative servers that control player movement, actions, and loot, it should be significantly more resistant to common client-side hacks.</p>







<p>Additional protections include a Fog of War system that limits how much information each player’s client can access at any given time. By restricting what data is visible locally, Bungie hopes to curb tools such as wallhacks or loot-tracking cheats before they can function effectively.</p>



<p>Bungie also addressed technical disruptions, noting that players disconnected mid-run will be able to rejoin matches. If server-side issues prevent that, the studio says it will attempt to restore lost gear to affected players.</p>



<p>For more information pertaining to Marathon’s network and security, check out the article in full <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2025964053194330548" id="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2025964053194330548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>
