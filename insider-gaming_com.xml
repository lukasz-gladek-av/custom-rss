<p>Donkey Kong and his pal Diddy are two of Nintendo’s longest-serving mascots. The duo is due to hit screens again in Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, and the release date is close.</p>



<p>Nintendo has decided to halt production of new Donkey Kong for now games in favor of ports. Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze was released 11 years ago now—representing the most recent “new” DK game. It was ported to Switch in 2018, and Nintendo has decided to go even further back and port <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong: Country Returns</a> to Switch as well.</p>



<p>I’m not sure if this is a case of the Switch being at the end of its lifecycle ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Regardless, it never hurts to see Donkey Kong again! The big, lumbering mammoth of a monkey is here, and Country Returns on the Switch likewise.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Make way for Donkey. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Donkey Kong Country Returns release date for Nintendo Switch is January 16.</strong></p>



<p>Yep, get your fingers out and start counting. The HD port of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Donkey-Kong-Country-Returns-HD-2590475.html?nsuid=70010000084603#Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Country Returns</a> is gearing up to grace the Switch mere days from now. I’d say it looked pretty decent back in the day on the Wii, but a 2024 Switch release is worlds apart. </p>



<p>It’s also getting extra levels featured in the 3DS port, along with all the original features:</p>



<ul>
<li>Over 80+ levels</li>



<li>9 Worlds</li>



<li>Boss Battles</li>



<li>Lots of collectibles</li>



<li>Time Attack levels</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Local co-op</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-switch-release-time">Donkey Kong Country Returns Switch Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>We expect Donkey Kong Country Returns on Switch to release at midnight everywhere.</strong></p>



<p>If games get a special release time, it’s usually announced ahead of launch. So far, we haven’t seen anything to suggest otherwise, so a midnight launch in your region is probably likely. Different timezones get to play Country Returns HD first—something I suffer from being in the UK—and DK fans will be going bananas for release day.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-donkey-kong-country-returns-switch-platforms">All Donkey Kong Country Returns Switch Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Yep, Nintendo Switch is the only platform Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is coming to.</strong></p>



<p>Not too much to add here if you don’t already know. Donkey Kong is one of Nintendo’s most cherished brands and lives on its consoles. You can play Country Returns on Wii and 3Ds, but the spruced-up, all-encompassing port is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch. </p>



<hr>



<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is one of several games being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-games-releasing-in-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released in January 2025</a>. It’s a fairly quiet month, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-nintendo-switch-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest Nintendo games coming out in 2025</a> are sure to shake the foundations a bit.</p>



<p>Let us know if you are picking up a copy of Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on Switch. Plus, what do you think, is it time for Nintendo to pull their finger out and announce a new Donkey Kong entry?</p>

<p>Transformers Reactivate gameplay leaked online after Splash Damage announced the game would be canceled.</p>



<p>Uploading by the X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/DpzLuna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@DpzLuna</a>, six and half minutes of footage reveal what the game would have been like. According to the watermarks, the footage was captured on March 28, 2023. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>







<p>The footage shows the player driving around in a car and seamessly transforming into a transformer to battle enemies.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, Splash Damage announced that Transformers Reactivate would be canceled and that a number of roles at the company are at risk of redundancy. Splash Damage said the company would “refocus” on some of its other projects.</p>



<p>“While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more,” they said. “We’re now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.”</p>



<p>Transformers Reactivate was first announced on December 8, 2022, and little about the game has been heard since then.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear how many roles at Splash Damage have been affected, but Insider Gaming has contacted Splash Damage for comment.</p>
