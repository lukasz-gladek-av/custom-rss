<p>Use these Roblox Rope Battles monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Coins, Diamonds and much more.</p>



<p>Rope Battles is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-forge-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that sounds rather simple as players are placed in an intense combat arena where they use ropes, traps, items and whatever they can find to battle others. While it sounds like a rather easy game, players need to strategically master various rope techniques, timing, and special abilities to outmanoeuvre opponents. The main objective of the game is to create the ultimate rope fighter and battle against friends or other players to test your skills.</p>



<p>Progression in Rope Battles revolves around improving your fighter and collecting the game’s two main currencies: Coins and Diamonds. Like most Roblox games, they are the player’s main resources within the Rope Battles universe and allow them to improve their fighter by buying new ropes, items and more. And so, because earning coins (and diamonds) purely through playing can be slow, redeeming official codes is a major boost — codes give you free Coins, sometimes Diamonds, or even spins.</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Crash Bots is a fairly straightforward process with no prerequisite steps. However, for players who may be new to the Roblox ecosystem, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to redeeming Crash Bots codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Rope Battles on Roblox.</li>



<li>Click the Code button in the upper-right corner of the screen.</li>



<li>Enter a code into the pop-up text box.</li>



<li>Press Claim and enjoy your rewards.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-rope-battles-codes">How To Get More Rope Battles Codes</h2>



<p>Rope Battles codes can usually be found on the game’s official Discord server, on the Roblox game page, and sometimes on the developer’s social media pages. That includes the Reworld Makers community on Roblox, which you’ll need to join to access some codes. However, keeping track of the various sources can be time-consuming, especially with no system in place to tell users when the codes expire.</p>



<p>Thus, we suggest bookmarking this guide in your browser, as we refresh it as soon as new Rope Battles codes are released and remove expired codes once they are no longer valid.</p>

<h2 id="h-budapest-major-playoff-predictions-are-set">Budapest Major Playoff Predictions Are Set</h2>



<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major will run from December 11 – 14 and will feature a single-elimination bracket featuring eight of the best Counter-Strike teams in the business. Leading up to the grand final, every match will be a typical best-of-three run, while the grand final itself is more meaty with a best-of-five requirement.</p>



<p>The confirmed matches to start the Budapest Major playoffs have been locked in:</p>



<p><strong>December 11</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Vitality vs. The MongolZ</li>

</ul>



<p><strong>December 12</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>MOUZ vs. FaZe</li>



<li>FURIA vs. Natus Vincere</li>
</ul>



<p>In terms of predictions, both Team Spirit and FURIA found a spot in the playoffs from flawless runs through the tournament’s third stage. They’re the favorites to scoop the trophy and the half-million-dollar prize. </p>



<p>In terms of the next stage, it’s easy to see the teams that are <strong>most likely </strong>going to make it through. It’</p>



<p>It’s a solid bet to assume that the semifinals will consist of Vitality, Team Spirit, FaZe, and FURIA. Looking even further, it’s easy to see a Team Spirit vs. FaZe Clan final, but only time will tell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Season 3 of Prime Video’s Fallout may be filming as soon as Summer 2026, should one executive’s hopes come true. Its second season is only weeks away and, with a third season <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-3-already-announced-before-season-2-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already in production</a>, fans seemingly won’t have to wait long to return to the wasteland.</p>



<p>In the world of great adaptations, none came more of a surprise than Prime Video’s Fallout. Based on the post-apocalyptic worlds from Bethesda, the series goes its own route yet keeps the action, heart, and comedy of the games. Released in 2024, the series was a smash hit with fans and critics. In fact, it was nominated for several Emmys, including Best Drama and Best Drama Actor for Walton Goggins. A second season <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-renewed-for-season-2-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was quickly greenlit</a>, now set in the vibrant New Vegas. With its release on December 17th, fans already can’t wait to see more. Fortunately, it seems filming is happening sooner than expected.</p>







<h2 id="h-prime-video-fallout-s-creator-hoping-to-be-shooting-season-3-in-summer-2026">Prime Video Fallout’s Creator ‘Hoping to be Shooting’ Season 3 in Summer 2026</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In an interview for IGN, series creator Jonathan Nolan and showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet chatted about Season 2. At the tail-end of the interview, <a href="https://youtu.be/7Xes4q43OcI?si=PdsmZGkkQfDQUtRM&amp;t=1073">at around 17:50</a>, a question about Season 3 and possible locales was asked. In response, Jonathan Nolan stated,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Well, I say with regards to production, we’re hoping to be shooting again next summer</strong>,” says Nolan in the interview. “<strong>We’ll see if that all comes together, best laid plans and all</strong>. I’m excited that, though the scope of the show feels undiminished season on season, Geneva and Graham and our incredibly talented cast and crew were able to work quickly enough to get back on the air in a reasonable amount of time. I think what’s happened with television, in terms of taking longer and longer from season to season, is kind of an unfortunate trend. You don’t want the show to lose any of its scope, but we know that <strong>we like to be back on the air as soon as we can</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite Nolan’s comment, it seems a Summer 2026 filming date is not yet set in stone, so nothing is confirmed just yet. A third season was greenlit back in March 2025 after filming wrapped on the second season and seemingly started production then. If it does film in Summer 2026, fans could see the third season release as soon as Spring 2027, if all goes well. It’s too soon to say where the story will go with it, but given how well the first season did, it seems it’ll be in good hands. Either way, the December 17th release for Prime Video’s Fallout can’t come soon enough.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Spear Fishing monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Gems, Coins and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spear Fishing, as the name hints, is a fishing-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-forge-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> simulation. Your only job is to hunt down the rarest sea creatures in the water areas using Harpoons, Baits, Fish Basket, and Spear Guns. To kill Mythic, Legendary, and even Epic creatures, in some cases, you’ll need the finest tools. However, one must spend a large number of Coins and Gems to purchase them. This is when the active Spear Fishing codes come into action, as they can be redeemed for free Gems and Coins. This guide features all active codes, the code redemption process, tips for investing the free resources, and more.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-reward-code-pay2win/</link>
            <guid>1375732</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, has trolled the Escape from Tarkov community with a code appropriately named ‘PAY2WIN’. On social media, the prolific developer posted an image featuring some of the most valuable items in Escape from Tarkov, announcing that a code would drop soon, suggesting that those very items would be obtainable.</p>



<p>When the code dropped, it was with a tongue-in-cheek reference: ‘PAY2WIN’. However, upon redeeming the code, players quickly learned that they’d been hilariously duped.</p>







<h2 id="h-pay2win-was-a-joke-all-along">PAY2WIN Was a Joke All Along</h2>



<p>The code that Nikita Buyanov was teasing led users to believe they’d be getting <strong>stacks</strong> of stuff in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>This image included an FLIR optic, an Altyn helmet, stacks of Bitcoins, and a THICC case, amongst other things. However, shortly after, Nikita revealed the code, PAY2WIN, and users quickly set about redeeming it in the game’s launcher.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The bundle was ultimately unveiled as one of the worst stacks of items you’d ever hope to get in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This includes some of the most useless weapons, such as the TOZ and the Blicky, one of the smallest backpacks, a pack of croutons, a fuze (but no grenade), and a replica helmet. You literally couldn’t have asked for a worse bundle.</p>



<p>It’s not often that the Escape from Tarkov developers crack a joke like this, but they’ve admittedly given away quite a lot of stuff recently with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-escape-from-tarkov-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more reward codes</a>.</p>



<p>It’s often pointed out that ‘free is free’, but perhaps this bundle isn’t even worth anything!</p>







<p>Did you redeem the code in Escape from Tarkov? Let us know if you’re happy with your little Blicky on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
