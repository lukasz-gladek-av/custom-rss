<p>Nintendo has finally acknowledged the slew of Nintendo Switch 2 leaks that have been hitting the internet.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s acknowledgment came following this week’s CES event in Las Vegas, where accessory manufacturer Genki revealed Nintendo’s Switch 2 models. Genki has revealed since the leaks that the images were created based on leaked information and not on seeing Switch 2.</p>



<p>However, the leaks have seemingly struck a nerve with Nintendo, who have acknowledged them in a rare occurrence. Speaking with Japanese website <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sankei</a>, Nintendo said that “these images and videos are not official.”</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2, however, has quickly become one of the biggest open secrets in the entire industry, with almost everything to do with the console, including accessories, logos, specifications, and more leaking online.</p>



<p>As for when Nintendo will reveal the Nintendo Switch 2, it remains to be seen, but the sheer amount of leaks surrounding the console should indicate that it will be sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>Regardless of its reveal and impending release, Nintendo will be hoping that the Switch’s successor is as successful as the original, which has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 146 million units</a> at the time of writing.</p>



<p>In comparison to other Nintendo consoles, the Wii U has sold 13.56 million units, the Wii has sold 101.63 million units, the DS with 154.02 million, the Game Boy Advance has sold 81.51 million units, the Game Boy has sold 118.69 million units, the GameCube sold 21.74 million units, Nintendo 64 sold 32.93 million units, the SNES sold 49.10 million units and the NES sold 61.91 million units.</p>

<p>Donnie Yen has taken to an interview with Polygon to confirm that the Sleeping Dogs movie that was announced in 2017 is officially dead in the water. Sleeping Dogs was released in 2012 as a spiritual successor to the True Crime games, and it allowed players to explore an open-world rendition of Hong Kong.</p>



<p>The game was universally praised and highly enjoyable, scoring great reviews before being ultimately overshadowed by GTA 5 just one year later. In the recent interview, Donnie Yen, who was set to star as protagonist Wei Shen, confirmed that it’s ‘an unfortunate thing’ that the project has failed.</p>

<h2 id="h-sleeping-dogs-lie">Sleeping Dogs Lie</h2>



<p>In the interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Donnie Yen explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights.</p>



<p>I waited for years. Years. And I really want to do it. I have all these visions in my head, and unfortunately… I don’t know, you know how Hollywood goes, right? I spent many, many years on it. It was an unfortunate thing.</p>



<p>Well, on to better things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since being ‘announced’ in 2017, almost nothing was mentioned about the live-action adaptation of Sleeping Dogs. It comes as a surprise that it was canned, and it’s likely someone, somewhere is kicking themselves. Right now, live-action representations of video games are going like gangbusters, soaring up the charts and winning awards worldwide.</p>



<p>The likes of Fallout and The Last of Us are testaments to that fact.</p>



<p>When the news dropped that Donnie Yen would be serving as the frontman in Sleeping Dogs, fans everywhere were slightly confused. After all, Wei Shen was originally played by Will Yun Lee, who served as the voice, face, and motion capture artist for the character – and Lee is also a renowned actor.</p>



<p>Regardless of those creative decisions, the Sleeping Dogs movie will never see the light of day.</p>
