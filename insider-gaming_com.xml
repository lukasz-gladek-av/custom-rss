<p>Highguard didn’t arrive with much hype, its build-up was even less prominent, and the final result can only be considered a disaster that resulted in substantial layoffs for Highguard developer Wildlight Entertainment.</p>



<p>The final game announcement for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" id="163455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a>. Whereas millions of players were hoping for a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bloodborne/" id="1320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloodborne</a>, or something earth-shatteringly big, Geoff Keighley couldn’t contain his excitement as Highguard was finally revealed.</p>



<p>Highguard’s Steam player base plummeted by over 95% in just over two weeks. The downward decline has had detriental effects, but it was hard to see anything else happening.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-wasn-t-highguard-a-success">Why Wasn’t Highguard A Success? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>The mounts are cool at least. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard was a decent game at launch with next-to-no redeeming qualities or innovative features. In a saturated market of live-service shooters and free-to-play games, Highguard didn’t have anywhere near enough content at launch to suggest it could last, and the frosty reception to Highguard’s TGA 2025 reveal ultimately caused the title’s instant downfall.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards 2025</h3>



<p>Geoff Keighley has a reputation for hyping things up that don’t always deliver, and there’s nothing wrong with that. One person’s view won’t resonate with everyone, maybe not at all. But giving Highguard the sign-off slot for TGA 2025 meant the game had to dazzle and deliver.</p>



<p>Expectations for The Game Awards, Summer Game Fest, and other mega showcases are usually unrealistically high. Players want EVERYTHING and usually don’t get anything they want. When a baying audience is clinging on for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/half-life-3/" id="2259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half-Life 3</a> or an announcement to end all, Highguard was not seen as it. Social media (for the most part) wasn’t giving Highguard much of a chance, getting the game off to a bad start.</p>







<p>From December 11 (TGA 2025) until a few days before launch, Highguard’s socials were like a ghost town. YouTube, X, you name it; no gameplay footage, no new trailers, and nothing from Wildlight. Some viewed this as a deliberate marketing strategy designed to build intrigue and curiosity close to its debut.</p>



<p>There’s a thought that had Highguard been highly anticipated, the gaming community would have accepted it. Instead, it cast more negative light on Highguard, even bringing doubt about its future. Finally, on January 23, a gameplay showcase was announced—taking place minutes before the servers went online. It was a bold strategy.</p>



<p>Further clarification arrived when it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard was meant to be a ‘Shadowdrop’, but Geoff Keighley wanted it at The Game Awards</a>. In hindsight, a shadowdrop possibly could’ve helped the game’s fortunes by not giving people time to make up their mind in advance.</p>



<h3 id="h-highguard-s-release-amp-reception">Highguard’s Release &amp; Reception</h3>



<p>It was go time, and anyone interested in Highguard finally got to see what the fuss was all about. The early signs were good, as the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-website-crashes-after-games-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard website crashed after the game’s launch</a>. People flocked to the F2P shooter like birds to bread, but opinions formulated very quickly.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-receives-mostly-negative-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Mostly Negative” reviews bombarded Steam</a>, and complaints about the shooter were quite common:</p>



<ul>
<li>The maps were too big.</li>



<li>The loot phase of the match was boring.</li>



<li>Action was fairly limited outside of the Raid phase.</li>



<li>Wardens were fairly generic.</li>



<li>PC performance issues.</li>



<li>The price of microtransactions.</li>



<li>Highguard’s identity was lacking by being too many games wrapped into one perfect package.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-post-launch">Post-Launch</h3>



<p>A steep and instant player drop-off prompted the developer to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-update-target-games-biggest-gripe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">target the game’s biggest gripes</a>. Credit to Wildlight, they addressed the nature of big maps and small teams with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-5v5-raid-mode-added-permanently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">permanent addition of a 5v5 Raid Mode</a>.</p>



<p>With Episode 1 underway and a full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-2026-roadmap-all-episode-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard 2026 Roadmap</a>, the team must have thought the game had a chance. Barely two weeks later, the game’s all-time Steam peak of <strong>97,249</strong> turned into a <strong>3,580</strong> 24-hour peak by mid-February.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-amp-wildlight-entertainment-layoffs-explained">Highguard &amp; Wildlight Entertainment Layoffs, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>On February 11, it was reported and confirmed that Wildlight Entertainment had to “part ways with a number of our team members” as part of mass layoffs caused by Highguard’s unsuccessful start.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming wishes nothing but the best for any developers laid off from Wildlight Entertainment. It’s not clear how many people have succumbed to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard’s mass layoffs</a>, but Alex Graner,&nbsp;a senior-level designer at&nbsp;Wildlight, said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAAC6BrrgBpUHb8knP90WlCSh1NG5KV8KkS30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> post that it was <strong>he and “most of the team at Wildlight.”</strong></p>



<p>An official Wildlight statement has since said it is: “Keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.” So, if you are enjoying Highguard, its development looks to be continuing for now.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</p><p>We're proud of the team, talent, and the product we've created together. We're also grateful…</p></div>— Wildlight Entertainment (@WildlightEnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/WildlightEnt/status/2021745168387596450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Like Concord, XDefiant, the relaunched MultiVersus, and so many other live-service games before it, you have to wonder how long Highguard has left. If the player exodus continues, its future could be bleak.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-for-free-but-huge-tick-box/</link>
            <guid>1433482</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone is in eager anticipation of the impending release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. It will arguably be the biggest single-game release in history, shifting millions of copies in the first few hours alone, and it’s set to break the internet, render countless gamers incapable of working, and dominate social and streaming feeds for weeks to come.</p>



<p>In case you had concerns about <strong>buying </strong>Grand Theft Auto 6 later this year, there is a method you can use to get GTA 6 <strong>for free</strong>, but it involves one hell of a requirement.</p>



<p>You need to have a baby on November 19, 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-s-not-a-joke-says-norwegian-firm">It’s Not a Joke, Says Norwegian Firm</h2>



<p>In Norway, an electronics firm named Komplett has kick-started a marketing campaign built around rewarding budding parents with a free copy of GTA 6.</p>



<p>If you conceive<strong> around now</strong>, you’ll likely be celebrating the birth of your child around the release date of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is set (at the moment) for November 19, 2026. If your baby is born <strong>on that day</strong>, Komplett will help you usher in your bouncing bundle of joy by giving you a free copy of GTA 6, arguably the most anticipated game ever made.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1r20w92/a_norwegian_electronic_store_is_giving_away_gta_6/">‘Gaming’ subreddit</a>, one user posted an image of an advertisement spotted at a railway station in Norway. It was a shot of rose petals on a ruffled bed, with the caption:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>GTA 6 dropping in 9 months 😉</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUngTvzDXsD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an Instagram post</a> surfaced from the company, bearing the caption:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>this is actually not a joke, GTA 6 will be released in 9 months (🤞) and if you have a baby on the release date, you’ll get the game for free from us</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a marketing stunt that could pay off in dividends for the firm, as every man and their dog wants to secure a copy of Grand Theft Auto 6, and what better way to do that than to get it <strong>for free</strong>? Coincidentally, GTA 6 will be released almost nine months to the day after Valentine’s Day.</p>



<p>What’s ironic is that you’ll most likely be knee-deep in diapers and formula, and will have much bigger concerns than scoping out the jiggle physics or the deepest secrets of Leonida in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>

<p>Team Vitality has stepped up ahead of the Esports World Cup and secured a crack squad in the Call of Duty: Warzone space. It’s yet another roster the organization is fielding, all with the intention of having the best chances possible of snatching the lion’s share of the Club Championship prize.</p>



<p>The trio signed by Team Vitality features Sage, blazt, and skullface, all of whom have secured accolades aplenty in the Call of Duty: Warzone space and are ready for their next challenge under the Vitality banner.</p>







<h2 id="h-vitality-picks-up-killer-warzone-team-for-ewc">Vitality Picks Up Killer Warzone Team for EWC</h2>



<p>Leading the Team Vitality squad into the fray at the Esports World Cup this summer will be Ethan ‘Ebatez’ Bates, a former 100 Thieves coach with skin in the game. The championship-grade roster should have no issues competing on the grandest stage in esports in Riyadh this summer.</p>



<p>Sage was previously signed with Virtus and finished in <strong>third place </strong>at last year’s Esports World Cup. He also had a close finish at the 2024 Global Finals of the World Series of Warzone, but <strong>won </strong>the 2023 Global Finals, alongside Shifty and Biffle.</p>



<p>Blazt, one of the most recognizable names in Call of Duty, has been around the houses over the last decade. His path has taken him under the banners of compLexity, G2 Esports, the Los Angeles Guerrillas, 100 Thieves, and now, Team Vitality. He’ll be looking to redeem a fourth-place finish at last year’s Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>Skullface is arguably entering the pack with something major to prove. It has been a while since his last big win, but he came <strong>second </strong>at the 2024 World Series of Warzone after clutching up and securing the top spot in 2022’s tournament.</p>



<p>On paper, it’s a pretty good squad, and every player there has <strong>years </strong>of Warzone experience to pull from.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s enough for Team Vitality to land a big win at the Esports World Cup this summer? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-about-gothic-1-remake">About Gothic 1 Remake</h2>



<p>In an effort to find magic ore to strengthen their defenses, the king of the Kingdom of Myrtana ordered prisoners to work in the Khorinis mines. To ensure that no one could escape, he erected a magical barrier around the mines. However, something went wrong, trapping everyone inside and turning the mines into a lawless land.</p>



<p>The Gothic 1 Remake is an open-world RPG set in a distinct colony. The developers have rebuilt the game from the ground up while maintaining the original experience’s unique sense of unrestricted exploration and rewarding progression. The remake enhances the original by introducing more detailed questlines, improved NPC routines and interactions, new traversal abilities, and a fully modernized combat system.</p>
