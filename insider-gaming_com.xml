            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday, and as the week comes to a close, I’ve got another round of NYT Connections hints and solutions to help you usher in the weekend. Today’s puzzle was tricky, but I persevered to bring you the hints you need to wrap this NYT Connections puzzle up much faster.</p>



<p>It’s time for the weekend! Let’s get into the NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-24">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 24)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #866:</p>



<ul>
<li>BAYWATCH</li>



<li>HIGHLIGHT</li>



<li>RAINBOW</li>



<li>HERRING</li>



<li>PRIME</li>



<li>SUNSET</li>



<li>BOLD</li>



<li>PEACOCK</li>



<li>COOTIE</li>



<li>HEYDAY</li>



<li>KALEIDOSCOPE</li>



<li>UNDERLINE</li>



<li>ZENITH</li>



<li>KINGPIN</li>



<li>STRIKETHROUGH</li>



<li>PINNACLE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words mark the peak of something — think career highs, golden eras, or when someone was “in their prime.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These are all formatting options — the kind you’d find in a word processor or messaging app.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are vibrant by nature — often used metaphorically to describe something dazzling or full of variety.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word ends with something you might wear or carry — but the full word itself isn’t necessarily about fashion.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 24.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-24-866">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 24 (#866)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– HEYDAY, PINNACLE, PRIME, ZENITH</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BOLD, HIGHLIGHT, STRIKETHROUGH, UNDERLINE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – KALEIDOSCOPE, PEACOCK, RAINBOW, SUNSET</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BAYWATCH, COOTIE, HERRING, KINGPIN</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is bringing back some fan-favorite Black Ops 2 maps for Season One of the game.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, Black Ops 7 continues the Black Ops series name, as well as its story. Players will finally reunite with the Mason family from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2</a> and witness another mind-bending narrative, now with friends. However, it seems the story isn’t the only thing coming back, as two remastered maps from Black Ops 2 are returning for the new entry, as said by Activision.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-2-s-standoff-and-meltdown-return-as-season-one-maps-in-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 2’s Standoff and Meltdown Return as Season One Maps in Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Season 01 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> will be the biggest post-launch content drop in our history, and we're just getting started. Get your first look in our new Dev Talk:</p><p>✅ 7 signature 6v6 maps<br>✅ 7 new &amp; fan-favorite weapons (Maddox! 😍)<br>✅ 3 Zombies maps<br>✅ S01 remasters confirmed<br>✅ MP… <a href="https://t.co/VoKWLqycLW">pic.twitter.com/VoKWLqycLW</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1981421047376465996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1981421047376465996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Dev Talk</a> with the team at Treyarch, the team revealed two Black Ops 2 maps returning for Black Ops 7 as part of Season One: Meltdown and Standoff. Each map will be remastered and available as part of the next batch of maps, though a release date was not given. Standoff did join Black Ops: Cold War’s roster of maps during Season Three, acting as both a Multiplayer map and Zombies map. However, Meltdown has not been in the series since Black Ops 2 back in 2012, so fans will be excited to return to the nuclear powerplant.</p>



<p>The Season One roadmap for Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was revealed today</a> as part of the Dev Talk. Seven maps, including Meltdown and Standoff, will will release during the season, with more to come later. Three other Zombies maps, two being Survival, are also coming in Season One. The team is calling the new season its biggest yet and based on what we can tell, it sure seems to be. Either way, both new and returning players are in for a treat when it releases on November 14th.</p>



<p>Are you excited to return to Standoff and Meltdown? Any maps you hope make a return for Black Ops 7? Will you be getting the game at launch?
