<p>A new announcement by ARC Raiders reveals the Expedition Project, a new way to incorporate optional progression wipes. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders is all set to release on October 30, 2025, and the developers recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-delay-explained-embark-game-not-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> why things went silent at the studio: they had dipped into the PvP pot for the game’s future. Now, they have provided players with new details about the progression wipe system, and that it isn’t mandatory. </p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-expedition-project-makes-wipes-optional">ARC Raiders Expedition Project Makes Wipes Optional </h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy blog post</a> by ARC Raiders design director Virgil, it was revealed how the game will handle progression wipes. The developers had already stated that they do not intend to do mandatory wipes and have stuck to their words. They understand the benefits of global wipes, as they provide experienced players with a fresh game; however, it doesn’t cater to players who don’t have much time to play. </p>



<p>The game features a ‘Projects’ feature that players can access at level 20. The first major project in this section is the Expedition Project, and once players complete it, they can reset their character. After completing a reset, players can do it again by completing another one of these projects. Expedition Project will operate on a roughly 8-week cycle, during which players can make progress towards their project. </p>



<p>Once the 8 weeks are complete, players will have the option to finalize the project for an additional week. If they have fulfilled all the project’s requirements, they can finalise it. If the player’s project isn’t ready during this window, their progress will be retained, and they can continue working on it until the next finalisation window. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-will-be-kept-and-removed-in-arc-raiders-progression-wipes">What Will Be Kept and Removed in ARC Raiders Progression Wipes</h2>



<p>Anything that is related to the character’s progress will be wiped, including levels, skills, items/inventory, workshop, crafting capabilities, etc. Any cosmetics earned or purchased, achievements, rankings, etc., will be retained. “Anything rooted solely in the metagame or involving real money will be preserved.” After completing their Expedition Project, players will be able to skip most of the onboarding and tutorial steps, which include unlocking certain features, maps, etc. </p>



<h2 id="h-benefits-of-completing-expedition-projects">Benefits of Completing Expedition Projects</h2>



<p>Players who complete Expedition Projects in ARC Raiders will receive some benefits and rewards; these are yet to be finalised, but these are the type of rewards players can expect: Permanent account unlocks for each completed Expedition, unique cosmetic rewards for completed Expeditions, account “buffs” that are applied for the duration of the following Expedition cycle, And sequential completions of the Expedition Project increase the magnitude of these buffs, up to a limit.</p>



<p>In other news, here’s why ARC Raiders was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-ban-arc-raiders-black-ops-7-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">censored in Black Ops 7.</a> What are your thoughts on ARC Raiders featuring optional progression wipes?

<p>The next game in the nearly 30-year-old Age of Empires franchise is in development, and it will seemingly be using Unreal Engine. That would see the company leave the Essence Engine and Bang Engine, which had been used for Age of Empires 4 and Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition, respectively, behind. </p>



<p>According to multiple job postings on Microsoft’s website, Xbox Game Studios is “hard at work continuing the great legacy of Age of Empires”. As the work continues on the franchise, World’s Edge, the studio behind Age of Empires 4 and the definitive editions of the second and third games, is looking for two positions that specifically call out using Unreal Engine. </p>



<p>The two roles—Pricing Unreal Engineer and Senior Unreal Engineer—require those with <strong>“a background in&nbsp;all aspects of&nbsp;Unreal Engine&nbsp;game&nbsp;development&nbsp;and experience&nbsp;leading external resources.”</strong></p>



<p>No other details on what the future could look like for Age of Empires, but the direction it’s going in, at least when it comes to the tech stack, seems clear. </p>



<p>What do you hope for from the next installment in Age of Empires, seemingly Age of Empires 5?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nearly 100 past and present employees at Mindseye developer Build a Rocket Boy have signed an open letter against the studio for its “longstanding disrespect and mistreatment” of staff.</p>



<p>Published on <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/">Friday by the IWGB Game Workers</a>, this letter directly calls out several issues employees claim to have faced from management, including founder Leslie Benzies. </p>



<p>After the poorly received launch of Mindseye, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-developerbegins-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Build a Rocket Boy laid off</a> what the union says was 250-300 people because of their refusal to <strong>“listen to your workforce’s years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade.”</strong></p>



<p>The letter says that there was a “lack of transparency and communication”. The employees believe that <strong>“information has been sparse and vague, with you (Benzies) often making radical changes to the way we worked with little or no input from those affected.”</strong></p>



<p>The letter also mentions the studio implementing a mandatory eight hours of overtime per week for every employee in the four months leading up to the game’s launch. Time Off In Lieu was given to the staff at seven hours per every eight worked, but, they say that many employees have yet to be able to use any of the time off because of <strong>“continued requests for extra “high-priority” work, even after launch.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding layoffs, the letter calls what has happened a “disastrous handling”. It’s alleged that employees were given wrong information, including being grouped with the wrong internal teams, and given wrong notice periods, which may have seen a number of employees wrongfully dismissed.</p>



<p>The employees, both current and former, are demanding a public apology for the mistreatment as well as <strong>“proper compensation”</strong> for those who were let go. They are also asking for a meaningful and documented effort to improve conditions within the company that includes acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union, a commitment to using external partners for future redundancies, and the option for remaining employees on redundancy notice to either work the rest of their time or take Payment in Lieu of Notice.</p>



<p>The letter closes with calling out Benzies and co-CEO Mark Gerhard, saying, “you often refer to your employees as ‘family’. But we ask you to consider; is this really how you treat your own?”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Build a Rocket Boy for comment on the letter. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that the open beta’s maps were intentionally smaller than the ones we get at launch. </p>



<p>With Battlefield 6 launching today, players will be going straight in to check out the maps that weren’t available during the game’s open beta weekends. Some players are so excited, they have already started recreating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty maps</a> in the game’s Portal mode. Now, the developers have revealed why they opted for smaller maps in BF6’s open beta. </p>

<p>In a new interview in <a href="https://www.pcgamer-magazine.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer Magazine’s 415 issue</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-devs-say-the-plan-was-to-launch-with-bigger-maps-all-along-and-that-the-betas-notoriously-smaller-maps-were-intentionally-smaller-than-the-ones-we-know-are-coming-in-the-full-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>), the design director for Battlefield 6, Salim Fasahat, explained why the game’s open beta had smaller maps. Fasahat first stated, &nbsp;“They were intentionally smaller than the ones we know are coming.” He added that there were a few reasons behind this decision, including gaining a better understanding of different modes, the scale at which they can operate, which types of maps work, and more. </p>



<p>Fasahat added that the smaller BF6 maps made it “easier to test and focus on gun play.” The whole team is “super excited to have people explore all of those maps.” For those wondering, Manhattan Bridge, Saints Quarter, New Sobek City, Mirak Valley, and Operation Firestorm were not available in the Open Beta. The maps that players have already tested include Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, Liberation Peak, and Empire State. </p>



<p>In other news, the developers of Battlefield 6 have confirmed that the game will not use <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-use-anything-made-by-generative-ai-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generative AI</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve%E2%80%99s-next-steamvr-headset-has-reportedly-entered-mass-production.1321822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve is getting closer to pulling back the curtain and releasing its next SteamVR headset to the world. According to one Chinese analyst group, the next headset has reportedly entered mass production. </p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/valves-next-headset-reportedly-enters-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a>, XR Research Institute claims that a production of 400,000-600,000 headsets is happening for the device that has been codenamed “Deckard”. There’s even the belief that the headset, which is expected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-new-vr-headset-might-have-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to be called the Valve Frame</a>, could be announced and released before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Adding to the legitimacy of the claim, Valve insider Brad Lynch says that Deckard DV1 and DV2 models recently appeared in the SteamVR Beta. According to Lynch, <strong>“DV units are the final stages before the model (PV) that consumers will buy.”</strong></p>



<p>No other details regarding pricing or specs are currently known. What is expected, however, is that the headset will launch alongside the new “Roy” controllers being developed for the device.</p>



<p>The SteamVR headset isn’t the only piece of tech Valve has been working on. During the summer, what appears to be Valve’s next attempt at a console, Valve Fremont, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared for the first time</a> on the benchmarking website Geekbench. The appearance on the site suggests a device featuring a six-core/12 thread processor running at 3.2 GHz with 8GB of DDR5 memory and a custom AMD RX 7600 GPU. Those specs, however, can always change between now and when the device officially launches. </p>



<p>What do you think of a new SteamVR headset coming from Valve as soon as this year? When do you think it’ll be officially announced?

<p>During a new interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a>, the VP general manager of Dice and Criterion, Rebecka Coutaz, spoke about Battlefield 6 and generative AI. Coutaz first stated that players will not see GenAI in BF6; however, it was used in the preparatory stages to provide “more time and more space to be creative.” The VP added that GenAI “is very seducing”, but at the moment there is no way to incorporate it into the daily work that the developer does. </p>



<p>Coutaz discussed GenAI further, stating that they can “break the magic with AI,” enabling them to be more innovative and creative. According to the VP, GenAI is “not anything to be scared of in our industry”. The gaming industry is “an environment at the bleeding edge of technology,” where teams are accustomed to change. The only challenge is how they can productively incorporate them into their workflows, which helps them take their games to the next level.  </p>
