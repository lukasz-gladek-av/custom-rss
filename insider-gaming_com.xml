<p>Donkey Kong Land 2 is the latest Game Boy title <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1861215895873298613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">now playable</a> through the Nintendo Switch Online membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Land 2 is a platformer released for Nintendo Game Boy in 1996. It is a sequel to Donkey Kong Land, sometimes called Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong’s Quest. This game features Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong as the playable characters, both with different gameplay mechanics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game’s main characters have different movement systems, and players can control only one at a time. With Diddy Kong, players will be able to ride train tracks, cartwheel their enemies and swing on grappling hooks. On the other hand, Dixie Kong can float in the air using her Helicopter Spin and throw barrels at enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The end goal of Donkey Kong Land 2 is saving Donkey Kong from K. Rool, and players must go through 40 levels filled with traps, collectables, Kremlings, barrels, and bananas to do that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2K has announced a ‘Complete Sunset’ of their launcher, removing it from every Epic Games Store and Steam game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sunset of the 2K Launcher was <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JB9YXRZ3YFJBHS1QPZ5DP40N" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> on November 18; however, a follow-up update on November 25 led to its complete removal from Steam. The “2K Launcher Beta” created for Sid Meier’s Civilization V was also removed. Players will see that their 2KLauncher folder has been turned into a text file called 2kLauncherRemoved.tx, which can now be deleted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players might still find the 2K Launcher pop-up even after this update, and there are some troubleshooting procedures that they can follow to remove it entirely. The first method is closing and reopening Steam completely. Next, rebooting the PC is always a good idea. Also, for Epic Games, you will need the game to be updated to its most recent version. Check out this <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/32209414429203--2K-Launcher-Removing-2K-Launcher-Files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">guide</a> to learn how to remove all the additional launcher files.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After 2K Launcher’s shutdown, games like Bioshock Remastered, Bioshock 2 Remastered, Bioshock Infinite, The Quarry, and Marvel’s Midnight Suns will launch directly when you click Play. Other games like Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition, Civilisation V, and more will use Steam and Epic’s launchers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a new PGA Tour 2K game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been confirmed for 2025</a>.

<p>Marvel Rivals’ ambition is matched by its star-studded roster, list of iconic maps, and excitable community eager to play. However, one big question circling Marvel Rivals is if the shooter is free to play, or if you need to pay a fixed price to get your heroic groove on.</p>



<p>Fans of the MCU—and Marvel in general—can rest easy as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals release date</a> is nearly upon us. An ensemble shooter with a list of playable characters so almighty it’s enough to make your eyes water—I’m not crying, you are. Marvel Rivals takes the hero shooter literally by supplying a roster chock-full of some of the most notable superheroes and villains in media.</p>



<p>Several successful alpha and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-beta-surprises-players-with-thor-and-another-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beta tests</a> have set the scene, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-roadmap-reveals-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> ahead is promising, and it’s nearly time to say “Action!” and let the chaos unfold. No doubt you want to play Marvel Rivals, so let’s see if greatness requires a gratuity.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-marvel-rivals">How Much is Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There is a God, and I’m not talking about Thor. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is a free-to-play</strong>, third-person shooter, meaning, <strong>you don’t have to pay a penny to play NetEase Games’ shooter</strong>—a free download and a stable internet connection are the only requirements.</p>



<p>The live-service model continues to be a trendsetter for many shooters and fellow online multiplayer platforms. It’s no surprise to see Marvel Rivals adopt the F2P formula with contemporaries such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suicide Squad</a> showing how a <em>paid</em>, live-service title can fail.</p>



<p>So, if you want to enjoy all Marvel Rivals has to offer without spending a single penny, you go right ahead. Of course, Rivals has an abundance of microtransactions and Season Passes filled with content for players who want to more out of the shooter, but it’s entirely optional.</p>



<p>Thankfully, every current character is available at launch, and according to the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/news/20240821/40185_1174687.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official site</a>, “<strong>All heroes will be unlocked and free-to-play at launch and beyond</strong>, ensuring every player can fully immerse themselves in the experience of becoming their favorite Super Hero without any barriers!”</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-marvel-rivals-for-free">How to Play Marvel Rivals for Free</h2>



<p>Once Marvel Rivals releases, it’s likely all you have to do is go to your platform’s storefront, search for the game, and <strong>press to download it</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s sure to be as simple as this. Like Fortnite, Warzone, Overwatch 2, or any other free-to-play title, Marvel Rivals is a quick and easy download. Here are the steps you probably need to follow to download the Marvel shooter:</p>



<ol>
<li>Load up your PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, or PC.</li>



<li>Go to the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, or Steam.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>Marvel Rivals</strong>.</li>



<li>Once it’s live, press the download option.</li>



<li>Make sure you have room for the file size.</li>



<li>When it’s installed, press on Marvel Rivals to play for free!</li>
</ol>

<p>According to a new report, Sony and Kadokawa have been discussing a partnership for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since Sony sent a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-confirms-acquisition-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter of intent</a> to Kadokawa, the entire gaming community has been wondering whether this acquisition will go through, and now new information has come to light. According to a <span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-26/sony-s-pursuit-of-kadokawa-anime-looks-like-a-great-takeover-idea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg report</a></span>, Sony and Kadokawa have been “testing the waters for a potential combination for years.” However, the issue seems to be the “degree of commitment.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the report states, Kadokawa wants Sony to acquire them completely or not purchase anything at all. On the other hand, Sony only wants ownership of assets related to anime and video games, which will help build their IP portfolio. The Kadokawa group has several game developers under its banner, including heavy hitters like FromSoftware, Spike Chunsoft, Gotcha Gotcha Games, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sony is developing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-developing-playstation-handheld-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Handheld</a> that will rival the likes of Switch and Xbox. Also, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-sales-better-ps4-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro sold better than the PlayStation 4 Pro</a> in the same period.
