Smilegate is the studio behind games such as Lost Ark and Crossfire.</p>



<p>“This collaboration with Smilegate was borne from a mutual respect and a philosophical alignment with founder Kwon, and the great passion he and his team bring to making AAA games,” Houser said via press release. “We both want to build interesting worlds and new player experiences.”</p>



<p>Joonhoo Sung, Smilegate’s CEO, added: “We are thrilled to collaborate with the developers behind globally renowned series that have millions of fans worldwide. Together with Absurd Ventures, Smilegate aims to deliver games that players across the globe will love. This partnership marks a critical milestone in Smilegate’s journey toward becoming a global IP powerhouse.”</p>

<p>It has been confirmed by ESL FACEIT that IEM Dallas will run alongside DreamHack Dallas in Texas in May 2025.</p>



<p>From May 23 – 25, the world’s most prolific Counter-Strike teams will descend on Texas to take part in IEM Dallas, one of the most prestigious events in the CS2 esports calendar.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full story.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-iem-going-to-texas">IEM Going to Texas</h2>



<p>This year’s IEM Dallas event was a monumental spectacle, with the event going down to the wire between G2 Esports and Team Vitality. It ended up being a win for G2, putting an end to a cold period that had lasted since the team won at IEM Cologne in August 2023. </p>



<p>It effectively kickstarted a spree for G2, with the team going on to win big at the BLAST Fall Final and then the BLAST World Final later in the year. The squad also wound up in second place in Counter-Strike’s tournament at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>In a press release, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ESL FACEIT Group, the leading esports and video game entertainment company, today announced DreamHack Dallas and Intel® Extreme Masters (IEM) Dallas 2025 will jointly return to Texas’ Key Bailey Hutchison Convention Center on May 23-25. </p>



<p>The pair of events will rally tens of thousands of gaming and esports fans to witness top-tier competition, hundreds of their favorite creators, dozens of indie titles, and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tickets will go on sale from December 5 – are you interested in heading to IEM Dallas? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>GSC has released a small update for STALKER 2 that addresses some issues with memory leaks, controls, AI, and missions.

<p>Bethesda Game Studios has just released ‘The Gleaming Depths’ update on Fallout 76. This super-sized patch stands as the largest endgame update the game has ever received, and it introduces a string of new features – including the game’s first ‘raid’ – to give late-game players more of a point in playing.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about everything coming in Fallout 76’s last major update in 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-gleaming-depths">Enter The Gleaming Depths</h2>



<p>The most important thing being delivered in this update is The Gleaming Depths, an all-new raid that’s designed to push players to new heights in terms of a solid, in-game challenge. It’s built to be tackled by a team of four players, all overseeing a unique role, such as Healer, Tank, or DPS.</p>



<p>Bethesda has finally introduced 4-Star Legendary Items into Fallout 76 with The Gleaming Depths update. Players will need to complete challenges in the new raid to unlock the top-most Legendary mods that boast powerful attributes.</p>



<p>Pets are also being brought into the game in The Gleaming Depths update. These C.A.M.P. items are open to everyone, but they’re locked to these ‘bases’ in-game. They won’t follow you around, but they can be customised slightly and interacted with, if that’s your kind of thing.</p>



<p>Following this update, you’ll also be able to assign yourself a title, using a series of prefixes and suffixes earned through quests and events to denote what kind of player you are in the Appalachian wasteland.</p>



<p>And of course, The Gleaming Depths update marks the arrival of Season 19 – The Scientific Forge. This update offers a boon for Enclave fans, as the entire scoreboard full of rewards is focused on the mysterious, malicious faction.</p>



<p>Finally, the team has worked to bring about hundreds of bug fixes, perk adjustments, and optimisations to the game. It’s one hell of an update.</p>



<p>Here are the install sizes for <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/5jYSbvocrji7E0eDJRJl9z/fallout-76-the-gleaming-depths-release-notes?linkId=100000315193526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gleaming Depths update</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC (Steam)</strong>: 18.6 GB</li>



<li><strong>PC (Microsoft Store)</strong>: 36.4 GB</li>



<li><strong>Xbox</strong>: 38.9 GB</li>



<li><strong>PlayStation</strong>: 37.6 GB</li>
</ul>
