<p>Nearly 11 years after its release, Hideo Kojima has taken to X to express his feelings over the negative feedback that Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes received when it was released.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-legacy-video-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> is one of the finest auteurs of his generation across all mediums. His calculated approach to cinematic presentation and innovation has accompanied the director across his multi-decade career. Metal Gear Solid is arguably his crowning achievement, and many of the entries are some of the most heralded releases in the annals of gaming history.</p>



<p>One entry has proved divisive. Although it‚Äôs looked upon more favorably in hindsight, Ground Zeroes was the subject of much criticism when it first launched.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It‚Äôs still an incredible game. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes was considered a ‚ÄúPrologue to the new gameplay‚Äù of Metal Gear Solid Phantom Pain, and it was originally supposed to be part of The Phantom Pain. However, as <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kojima</a> puts it in his statement on X: ‚ÄúThe PS4 was released and there were only a few titles out, so just GZ was released ahead of the others.‚Äù</p>



<p>Kojima and Konami opted to release it as a standalone piece of bite-sized action, and Ground Zeroes looked and played incredibly‚Äîthanks to the new and improved Fox Engine. But its brief runtime was an inescapable negative at the time. </p>



<p>Reflecting, Kojima has said: ‚ÄúAlthough the episodes were short, we threw in as many gameplay elements as possible. Although it is recognized now, 11 years later, there was online negativity at the time saying, ‚ÄúSelling a demo version at a low price?‚Äù and it received the lowest rating in the MGS series.‚Äù</p>



<div><article><p><span>Already 11 years agoüòÖ

This was originally planned to demonstrate the FOX engine and the gameplay of an open world infiltration game. I thought of it as an episode connecting PW and MGSV TPP, to be a bridge for both generations (console and handheld). We were considering </span></p></article></div>



<p>It‚Äôs clear that Hideo Kojima is proud of the work, and it‚Äôs fair because Ground Zeroes was a great‚Äîif not compact‚ÄîMGS experience. The original plan would happen sometime later as Metal Gear Solid V: Definitive Experience was released. It bundles Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain into one complete MGS package.</p>



<p>Kojima has moved on from MGS with Death Stranding. A successor‚Äî<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a>‚Äîis due to release in 2025. Whereas the MGS series moves on without Kojima in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater</a>.</p>

<p>Inzoi is shaping up to be one of the most fire releases of 2025. Its blend of life-simulation mechanics and lifelike graphics combine to create one of the most unique experiences, but Mac users are wondering if they‚Äôre being excluded.</p>



<p>You‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find anyone to argue with The Sims being <em>the </em>life-sim series. Its lifetime revenue and sales are head and shoulders into the sky in the hundreds of millions. It‚Äôs a tough task for newcomers, but we know there‚Äôs a lot of interest in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-inzoi-come-out-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a>‚Äîa new life simulator game headed by Inzoi Studio and Krafton.</p>



<p>Inzoi‚Äôs more realistic take on graphics is already a huge plus in its favor. However, for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-inzoi-platforms-is-it-coming-to-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi‚Äôs platforms</a> and the game‚Äôs availability, we need to see if everything is as rosy.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-inzoi-playable-on-mac">Is Inzoi Playable on Mac?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Create a virtual paradise space. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Inzoi is not playable on Mac when it launches in Early Access as it stands.</strong></p>



<p>The current platforms locked in for <a href="https://playinzoi.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> are PCs (not Macs), PlayStation, and Xbox‚Äîalthough the latter two ports are only arriving much later on. Even though PCs and Macs are considered similar formats, there‚Äôs still a world of difference between them, and Macs usually get the short end of the stick.</p>



<p>If you want to play Inzoi anytime soon, you need to invest in a PC. Make sure you check out the different levels of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ail-inzoi-pc-system-requirements-minimum-recommended-best-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system requirements for Inzoi</a> before you do to ensure you meet its PC Specs.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-inzoi-on-mac">Why Isn‚Äôt Inzoi on Mac?</h2>



<p><strong>There are two possible reasons for Inzoi not being on Mac: The game starting out in Early Access, or Macs struggling to run Inzoi.</strong></p>



<p>If you check out the system requirements above, you can see even the minimum requirements are tough. I would wager there‚Äôs concerns at Inzoi Studio about the game running on Macs. This is one big possibility for the lack of a Mac presence.</p>



<p>The other reason is a Mac version may arrive later down the line. To reiterate, <strong>even the PlayStation and Xbox are missing out initially</strong>. Many Early Access games opt for a PC-only release at launch. Once Inzoi starts finalizing its official debut, we may hear more about a Mac version.</p>



<hr>



<p>As always, we‚Äôll update you if there are any developments regarding an Inzoi Mac port. Leave a comment to let us know your thoughts on Invoi, and head to our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to discuss it with other users.</p>

<p>History looks to be repeating itself as a recently registered domain name suggests Persona 4 Reload is on the way‚Äîand this is more than likely a remake from the ground up of 2008‚Äôs Persona 4.</p>



<p>Persona remakes have been creeping out over recent years. But it makes complete sense if you‚Äôre Atlus. The series has sold millions of copies and its popularity continues to rise. This is why Persona 3 received a remake in 2024 with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-dlc-details-new-trailer-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Persona 3 Reload</a>.</p>



<p>Now, a year later, a domain name suggests Persona 4 Reload is on its way, and it could be announced soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-persona-4-reload-remake-could-be-announced-in-2025">Persona 4 Reload Remake Could be Announced in 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Bringing back a classic. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>YouTuber and social media personality <a href="https://x.com/ScrambledFaz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@ScrambledFaz</a> found the domain ‚Äú<strong>p4re.jp</strong>‚Äù registered on March 20.</p>



<p>They discovered the listing featuring the domain name‚Äôs creation date and name. It doesn‚Äôt directly spell out ‚ÄúPersona 4 Reload,‚Äù but a brief history lesson tells us this is probably the case.</p>



<p>As told by Faz, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/persona-3-remake-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">p3re. jp was registered in 2023</a>, and we got an official Persona 3 Reload announcement a few weeks later. This looks to be a carbon copy of these events, only this time we‚Äôre swapping the 3 for a 4.</p>



<div><article><p><span>p4re. jp was registered a few hours ago.

2 years ago, p3re. jp was registered. 3 months later Persona 3 Reload was revealed</span></p></article></div>



<p>This has to go down as speculation for now, but it‚Äôs very realistic speculation at least! Persona 3 Reload was lauded by fans of the series and critics and went on to become Atlus‚Äôs fastest-selling game at the time.</p>



<p>If Persona 4 Reload comes to fruition, it‚Äôs hard to see it not having similar results.</p>

<p>Jack Black became ‚Äúthe most passionate player‚Äù on set, logging over 100 hours on Minecraft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/a-minecraft-movie-game-microsoft-1236341672/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, Torfi Frans √ìlafsson, Mojang‚Äôs senior director of original content, revealed some details about Jack Black playing Minecraft. √ìlafsson had purchased Xboxes and set up private Minecraft servers for the cast and crew to enjoy the game. Within the group, Jack Black turned out to be the most passionate player, gathering over 100 hours of gameplay time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>√ìlafsson added that Jack Black ‚Äúwas just completely manic‚Äù in Minecraft, and he is obsessed with ‚Äòlapis lazuli‚Äô ‚Äúbecause he liked the way it sounds‚Äù. Jack Black also insists on talking about Lapis Lazuli in the movie. For those wondering, Lapis Lazuli is a blue mineral ore in the game that can be used for enchanting items, creating blue dye and other purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-jack-black-almost-played-a-talking-pig-in-a-minecraft-movie">Jack Black Almost Played a Talking Pig in A Minecraft Movie</h2>



<p>During the same interview, √ìlafsson revealed that Jack Black was not going to play Steve originally; instead, his character was a ‚Äútalking pig‚Äù. However, ‚Äúvery, very, very late in the development‚Äù, the crew realised that they ‚Äúneeded an expert and host‚Äù; hence, they decided that Black would play Steve instead. √ìlafsson elaborated, ‚ÄúThis is not my Steve or your Steve ‚Äî this is Jack Black‚Äôs Steve‚Äù.&nbsp;</p>
