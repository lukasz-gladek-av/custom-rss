<p>Gray Zone Warfare, the realistic tactical shooter (with extraction elements), continues to turn heads since entering early access in April 2024. It launched to a boom that saw the game sell 500,000 copies in just four days, with many players familiar with games like Escape from Tarkov getting in on the action.</p>



<p>Since being released in early access, Gray Zone Warfare has maintained a steady course, with developer MADFINGER Games working to polish the product and push out a major update, Night Ops. Recently, the team confirmed that the game has sold one million copies – and a further 500,000 ‘edition upgrades’ have been secured.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>MADFINGER transitioned into the tactical shooter space a while ago, producing Gray Zone Warfare in April 2024 as the fruit of its labour. The game is years in the making, and it offers an unparalleled open-world tactical shooter experience, casting players into the dangerous, fictional world of Lamang and forcing them to survive against all odds.</p>



<p>It was one of the best-selling games on Steam in 2024, where it’s exclusively available. The ongoing performance of the title allowed it to hit the one million sales milestone relatively quickly, notching up the number just eight months after launch. That’s not bad going for a game with no pre-existing fanbase made by a company new to the genre.</p>



<p>I sat down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with MADFINGER’s CEO at Gamescom</a>, learning about what’s next for the game. He has preached multiple times that the game is ‘only 20% finished’ and that there’s plenty on the horizon, and being privy to some of those plans, I can say for sure that there’s a lot in the pipeline for this tactical shooter.</p>



<p>If you’re not enjoying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-flea-market-locked-for-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Tarkov wipe</a> or if you want a more unique extraction experience mixed in with a persistent world, unbound by timers, then check out Gray Zone Warfare – you won’t regret it.</p>

<p>Robin ‘ropz’ Kool has officially left FaZe Clan after three years on the organisation’s Counter-Strike roster. On social media, the superstar competitor penned an emotional message to fans and followers as he departed on amicable terms from FaZe Clan.</p>



<p>The Counter-Strike pro player’s next steps are undefined at present – or at least, they’re unconfirmed to the wider public. Most recently, the 25-year-old player found a second-place finish at the Perfect World Shanghai Major, falling in the grand final against Team Spirit in an emotional series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-moving-on">Moving On</h2>



<p>Ropz <a href="https://x.com/ropz/status/1874247750922977693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to social media</a> to post an emotional message, prompting responses from hundreds of his peers across the industry:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a 12 year old boy who dreamt of being in FaZe. That boy was me. Fast forward a decade, I am proud for not only reaching that dream, but also creating history within it. </p>



<p>Today I am officially leaving FaZe to start another journey. It was an absolute joy and pleasure to represent this team alongside all the amazing people, who became like family to me. Memories for a lifetime, one of the best 3 years of my life. </p>



<p>No words will do justice to how much this meant for me and how special everything was, this was a decision I made against my heart and a part of me will always love this team and organisation. </p>



<p>Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a relatively short time, ropz became one of Counter-Strike’s winningest players, racking up approximately $1.5 million in winnings since entering the scene in earnest with mousesports in 2017. His first big win was at the ESG Tour in Mykonos, Greece in 2017, where he netted a $120,000 prize with mousesports after defeating Team Liquid in a close GF.</p>



<p>Following that win, the player was instrumental in both mousesports and FaZe Clan’s success, storming to victory in the likes of:</p>



<ul>
<li>Intel Grand Slam</li>



<li>PGL Major Antwerp</li>



<li>IEM Cologne/Katowice</li>



<li>Thunderpick World Championship</li>



<li>ESL Pro League</li>



<li>CS Asia Championship</li>
</ul>



<p>Except for a BLAST Premier event, ropz has claimed almost every prize possible in the Counter-Strike space. He has ranked in the HLTV Top 20 Players seven times and has picked up half a dozen MVP awards for his efforts. </p>



<p>And it all began when ropz kickstarted a career as a Call of Duty content creator.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/2024-steam-awards-winners-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As 2024 came to a close, one final awards ceremony concluded – The 2024 Steam Awards, hosted by Valve. The community-picked winners were awarded their trophies after several days of voting, but for the most part, the awards handed out were mostly predictable.</p>



<p>For instance, Black Myth Wukong secured Game of the Year, after soaring to lofty heights and shattering player count records on the platform earlier this year. It couldn’t be Astro Bot, so why not have Black Myth Wukong pick up the prize?</p>



<p>Read on to see all the winners from The 2024 Steam Awards.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-the-winners-from-the-2024-steam-awards">All The Winners From The 2024 Steam Awards</h2>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown you’re looking for:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Game of the</strong> <strong>Year: </strong>Black Myth Wukong</li>



<li><strong>VR Game of the Year: </strong>Metro Awakening</li>



<li><strong>Labor of Love Award: </strong>Elden Ring</li>



<li><strong>Best Game on Steam Deck: </strong>God of War Ragnarok</li>



<li><strong>Better with Friends Award: </strong>Helldivers II</li>



<li><strong>Outstanding Visual Style: </strong>Silent Hill 2</li>



<li><strong>Most Innovative Gameplay: </strong>Liar’s Bar</li>



<li><strong>Best Game You Suck At Award: </strong>Black Myth Wukong</li>



<li><strong>Best Soundtrack: </strong>Red Dead Redemption</li>



<li><strong>Outstanding Story-Rich Game: </strong>Black Myth Wukong</li>



<li><strong>Sit Back and Relax Award: </strong>Farming Simulator 25</li>
</ul>



<p>Black Myth Wukong cleaned up at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards/2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The 2024 Steam Awards</a>, continuing an award spree that was most recently fuelled by two wins at The Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley early in December. It beat Space Marine II, STALKER 2, Balatro, and Helldivers II to the ultimate prize.</p>



<p>There were some deserving wins here, though. Metro Awakening winning the VR Game of the Year award is a solid shout – it might not be the ‘next game’ in the series that fans were hoping for, but as a standalone VR title, it’s nothing short of stellar and deeply authentic.</p>



<p>Elden Ring’s Labor of Love award was handed out mostly because of Shadow of the Erdtree, which was so popular upon release earlier this year that it became a contender for Game of the Year awards at The Game Awards (and other showcases). </p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption’s Best Soundtrack trophy seems strange when compared to the competition, but it’s a popularity vote at best. It wasn’t a good year for gaming OSTs, it looks like.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/russia-gaming-consoles-putin-cant-compete/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/russia%E2%80%99s-gaming-consoles-can%E2%80%99t-compete-with-xbox-and-playstation.1072095/</guid>

<p>Earlier this year, it was revealed that Putin had ordered Russian tech manufacturers to work on ‘homegrown’ gaming consoles. The goal is for the country to compete against PlayStation and Xbox in the home console stakes, but it seems that things aren’t going as planned. </p>



<p>In a recent update posted by Habr.com, it was stated that the ‘Skolkovo Foundation’, tasked with developing the core foundation of the consoles, is having some technical issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-something-truly-breakthrough">‘Something Truly Breakthrough’</h2>



<p>In a quote <a href="https://habr.com/en/news/869822/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picked up by Habr.com</a> (and circulated by Tom’s Hardware), it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I hope that my colleagues will approach this task with full responsibility and come up with something truly breakthrough. After all, it is obvious to everyone: Elbrus processors are not yet at the stage of development that would ensure equal competition with PS5 and Xbox, which means that the solution must be non-standard.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was a quote taken from Anton Gorelkin, the Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy. His reference to ‘Elbrus’ is a nod to a Russian-developed processor unit. The transparency of the statement confirms that the tech the country has created isn’t yet on par with the hardware created by Xbox and PlayStation.</p>



<p>The Elbrus processor has been pieced together by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies, but it’s not a patch on the hardware being created by the likes of Intel and AMD. </p>



<p>Gorelkin repeated the desire to create something sovereign, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/putin-russia-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per Putin’s wishes</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This platform should primarily serve the goals of promoting and popularizing domestic video game products, expanding their audience beyond PCs and mobile gaming.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The most recent reports suggest that the Russians are working on two consoles, one a ‘not very powerful’ device and the other a cloud-based streaming-focused unit with a $45 price tag. In a first-look image published just days ago, it was revealed that the $45 unit features an Xbox-styled controller with a small remote and a USB dongle.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/27/12/2024/673f81ca9a79477d7dd76e72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">article by RBC.ru</a>, the goal of the hyper-cheap gaming solution was detailed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The MTS console will operate on the principle of cloud gaming on its own MTS Fog Play system — a platform for so-called foggy gaming. The system was originally designed to allow owners of “weak” computers to play games with high system requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In August, it was confirmed that Tango Gameworks had been ‘saved’ after being acquired by KRAFTON, the super-sized publisher behind games like PUBG, InZOI, and Dark and Darker. In a recent social media post, the Tango Gameworks team—which faced closure before being acquired—announced a small rebrand.</p>



<p>Tango Gameworks will henceforth be known as ‘Tango Gameworks Inc.’ under the KRAFTON banner.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-and-better-for-it">Back and Better For It</h2>



<p>When KRAFTON acquired Tango Gameworks, it was on a knife-edge after being shut down by Microsoft. KRAFTON swooped in at the final hour and saved Tango, securing the Hi-Fi Rush label (amongst others) and saving the studio from decimation at the hands of Microsoft.</p>



<p>Back then, the team at KRAFTON said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of this strategic agreement, KRAFTON intends to collaborate with Xbox and ZeniMax to ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the&nbsp;Hi-Fi Rush IP&nbsp;and explore future projects.</p>



<p>KRAFTON intends to support the Tango Gameworks team to continue its commitment to innovation and delivering fresh and exciting experiences for fans.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On social media, the team posted:</p>











<p>This was the team’s first post on social media since announcing the firm’s shutdown in May 2024.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known what the team at Tango Gameworks Inc. will focus on next, but IPs like Ghostwire Tokyo and The Evil Within were previously created by the studio. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-ps-plus-premium-games-you-need-to-play/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-ps-plus-premium-games-you-need-to-play-in-2025.1072080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-ps-plus-premium-games-you-need-to-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PS Plus Premium in 2025 should be another year of classic titles in an ever-growing library. Month by month the Premium tier becomes more tantalizing, and I’ve picked out some of the best games you definitely to try out in 2025. </p>



<p>I’ve gone through periods of being subscribed to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps-plus-24-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS Plus</a> Premium, then downgrading my subscription, and eventually coming back to try many new games I’ve missed. Sony’s most expensive tier in the three-tiered PS Plus model isn’t for everyone, I get it. If you have a proclivity to game and miss the classics—or want to try out titles from yesteryear—Premium was born for this.</p>



<p>Narrowing this down to seven was difficult. I could probably come up with a second new list of recommendations, but these might be the best of the best. I’ve factored in variety, impact on gaming, and personal bias: You should find <em>plenty </em>to love.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-ps-plus-premium-games-to-play-in-2025">7 PS Plus Premium Games to Play in 2025</h2>



<p>The volatility of PS Plus Premium’s catalog does mean this list isn’t stable. Therefore, I encourage you to download these games and play them as quickly. <strong>Games are removed from the service regularly</strong>, and it isn’t a one-way influx of new titles. Check our list, read it twice, and find out which ones are naughty and nice—only joking, they’re all nice.</p>



<h3 id="h-ape-escape">Ape Escape</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Timeless. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Did you know 1999’s <strong>Ape Escape was the first software to require a DualShock controller</strong>? It’s a regurgitated fact, but one I find fascinating to this day. The accessory was mandatory to tame the madness of monkeys. 2024’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a> celebrated Ape Escape by dedicating a full level to the classic franchise, and the OG title has aged quite well. It’s still funny, possesses charm, and will keep you entertained for a few hours. </p>



<h3 id="h-dark-chronicle-dark-cloud-2">Dark Chronicle / Dark Cloud 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t sleep on this. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>The confusion on my face was palpable as I opened this as a gift on Christmas Day nearly twenty years ago. Yet, it became one of my favorite gifts as I sank countless hours into the surprising JRPG. Known as Dark Cloud 2 in America and Dark Chronicle elsewhere, Level-5’s release switches between two main characters and features a blend of dungeon-dwelling combat and city-building mechanics. It’s unique and still has cool ideas seldom seen in modern JRPGs.</p>



<h3 id="h-dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Just no. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Capcom decided to see what happens if you take classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-confirm-new-resident-evil-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a>-style gameplay but swap zombies with dinosaurs. The result is a legendary survival-horror game fans have been begging to get the remake treatment for years. Like old-school Resi, the main character Regina has to survive, find supplies, and fight off enemies, but try not to become dinosaur chow. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-fans-dino-crisis-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dino Crisis fans are desperate for a new title</a>, but until this happens, play the original on PS Plus Premium.</p>



<h3 id="h-doom">DOOM</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Where it all began. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>I joined the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-can-run-the-original-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a> train a bit later than most—thanks to 2012’s BFG Edition—and I’ve been hooked ever since. I get passionate talking about my love for DOOM. PS Plus Premium has the first releases—which would go on to define the first-person genre for the next 30-plus years—and almost every FPS game you’ve played has likely been influenced by DOOM’s badassery. The guns, the music, the demons, the levels; DOOM is in the GOAT category, and all journeys start somewhere.</p>



<h3 id="h-god-of-war-3-remastered">God of War 3 Remastered</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Kratos isn’t scared, I promise you. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>My favorite God of War game turns on a dime. 2018’s reboot and 2022’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-receives-a-ps5-pro-enhanced-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ragnarok</a> are masterpieces in their own right, but there’s something about GOW 3 Remastered that hits differently. I understand recent GOW fans have probably never had the chance to experience the wonders of Kratos’ true origins. His heartbreaking and hellacious bloody and violent story culminates in a Greek tragedy of epic proportions in God of War 3. Do yourself a favor and play the whole trilogy, and you can appreciate the spectacle and grandeur that sets the scene for the “Dad of Boy” Norse deviation.</p>



<h3 id="h-jak-and-daxter-the-precursor-legacy">Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Platforming perfection. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>This might be a hot take, but I feel <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-jak-and-daxter-movie-is-planned-at-sony-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jak and Daxter</a> died after its first release. Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is one of the games I’ve fully completed the most times. Naughty Dog’s first crack at something other than Crash Bandicoot results in one of gaming’s memorable double acts. Jak is a mute but strong protagonist, and Daxter, is a scene-stealing, anything-but-silent Ottsel. The Precursor Legacy elevated the 3D platformer genre to new heights on the PS2 and is the franchise’s highlight—before it takes a literal dark turn in Jak 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You feel like a lawyer. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>HOLD IT! You don’t think this entry deserves to be on the list? OBJECTION! I think it does, so TAKE THAT! Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy is about the finest example of the PS Plus Premium package I can think of. I’d never in my life stopped for a second to think about the Phoenix Wright series and one day, cycling through Premium’s offerings, I saw the trilogy. I gambled, downloaded it, and 30 hours later, myself and my fiancé couldn’t get enough. Its interactive storytelling hybrid is utterly gripping—as is every case—and it’s great to see how the mechanics innovate and are reinvented with each sequel.</p>



<h3 id="h-syphon-filter">Syphon Filter</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Ahead of its time. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Had Konami’s Metal Gear Solid 1 not come out a year earlier, I think the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-syphon-filter-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Syphon Filter</a> would’ve received more attention and love—not that it hasn’t already. Syphon Filter’s blend of espionage action and well-designed levels mesh seamlessly. Its “Danger” system, use of gadgets, and varied mission parameters ensure Syphon Filter is another release well ahead of its time—it simply can’t compete with MGS1’s story. Nevertheless, Syphon Filter—and its main two sequels—are on PS Plus Premium, with trophies, and there’s a reason they were symbolic of the PS1 era.</p>

<p>The next 12 months are shaping up to be some of the best for Microsoft and the Xbox Series X|S systems since they launched in 2020. While there have been some great games over the last four years — Forza Horizon 5 and STALKER 2, just to name a couple —  for the latest Microsoft consoles, it’s been a bit hit or miss for the most part of this generation. In 2025, that appears to be changing. So, let’s look at the biggest Xbox games expected to release in 2025.</p>



<p>Whether it’s an Xbox exclusive or an anticipated multiplatform title, there’s no shortage of games coming that will leave you wondering how you are going to find the time (and money) for everything.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-playstation-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8 Biggest PlayStation Games Coming in 2025</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-biggest-xbox-exclusives-of-2025">Biggest Xbox Exclusives Of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-avowed">Avowed</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Avowed is the upcoming first-person RPG developed by Obsidian Entertainment, set in the high-fantasy world of Eora, the same universe Pillars of Eternity. The game was originally scheduled to release in October 2024, but was pushed to February 18, 2025 by Xbox Game Studios in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-wasnt-due-to-game-quality-phil-spencer-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">order to let the game breath</a> more rather than releasing it so close to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. </p>



<p>The game will feel familiar to fans of Skyrim and other fantasy RPGs, with various abilities and skills to help you experience the world how you like. For those concerned about the game being first-person, fear not. Avowed will have the option to play in third person. It will also be available day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<h3 id="h-south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>From the developers of We Happy Few and Contrast, South of Midnight takes players to the deep south of the United States. The game sees you play Hazel who becomes a Weaver after a storm hits her home of Prospero. According to Compulsion Games, a Weaver is a “magical  mender of broken bonds and spirits”. </p>



<p>“Imbued with these new abilities, Hazel will confront and subdue dangerous creatures, untangle the webs of her own family’s shared past and -if she’s lucky – find her way to a place that feels like home,”  the game’s description reads.</p>



<p>No release date has been announced, but the game is planned to release in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fable">Fable</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Officially announced in 2020, Fable has been in development for nearly a decade. Not only is it the fourth main installment of the series, but it’s also serving as a reboot for the franchise.</p>



<p>Developer Playground Games has released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEQRwpMYPaw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a couple trailers</a> for the game so far, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FiBmVBaY0g&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">each more promising</a> than the last. The game also features Richard Ayoade as a giant who doesn’t seem too fond of the main character, or heroes in general.</p>



<p>Fable is scheduled for 2025 — rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-on-fables-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have it scheduled for late 2025</a> — and will be available on day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A prequel set 14 years before the original game, Gears of War: E-Day centers around young versions of Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago. The game’s story — that we know so far — has players deal with the locust horde during Emergence Day. Not much else is known about the game’s features, but that should be coming over the coming months.</p>



<p>Gears of War: E-Day hasn’t been confirmed for a 2025 release, but <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1801291340569071619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the latest rumors</a> are pointing to the possibility. This is one Xbox exclusive, however, that could be come in 2026 instead.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-xbox-games-of-2025">Biggest Xbox Games Of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-gta-6">Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Did you think this would be a list of biggest games and not include GTA 6? The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-most-anticipated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most anticipated game of the year</a> — and likely the last decade or more — GTA 6 is currently planned for a 2025 despite countless rumors of an eventual delay to 2026.</p>



<p>It’s been nearly 12 years since the last game in the series was released, and, based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-world-record-broken/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer alone</a>, GTA 6 could go down as the biggest launch in video game history. The anticipation for the game isn’t just with fans, either. Even those in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">industry are making decisions</a> about their releases around what Rockstar decides to do</p>



<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">First revealed by Insider Gaming</a>, DOOM: The Dark Ages is a prequel to 2016’s DOOM. A single-player game, DOOM: The Dark Ages “tells the epic cinematic origin story of the DOOM Slayer’s rage.” According to developer id Software, the game sees you control DOOM Slayer as he tries to protect a kingdom against the demons from Hell.</p>



<p>Not much else is known about the game at the moment, but that should be coming over the next few months. And for those on PlayStation 5 who were worried about not getting the next DOOM game, it should be noted that the game will launch on PS5 the same day.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another game from Obsidian Entertainment coming in 2025, The Outer Worlds 2 was first announced at E3 2021. At the time, the developers bluntly stated that there was nothing else ready to be shown to players. Three years later, and fans got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer at The Game Awards 2024</a> along with a confirmed 2025 release window.</p>



<p>The game took “three times longer to make” and will be at least “two times bigger” according to the fun gameplay reveal trailer. Like the first, The Outer Worlds 2 will be a first-person RPG that takes players to the new Arcadia colony where a factional war has broken out that you have to navigate. In addition to launching on Xbox, the game will be available on PS5 and Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>By the time it launches in 2025, it’ll have been six years since Borderlands 3 was released. While fans have gotten Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands and New Tales from the Borderlands in between, it still felt like something was missing. With Borderlands 4, players will explore a brand new location with four new vault hunters along with a cast of returning characters.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-borderlands-4-trailer-first-look-at-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first look at gameplay</a> was shown at The Game Awards 2024 that should quench the thirst for Borderlands content until Gearbox starts giving more deep dives into the game. One thing to expect is less <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“toilet humor”</a> this time around, according to one of the game’s developers. Borderlands 4 is set to release in 2025, and Take-Two has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-will-not-release-close-to-each-other/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that it won’t release</a> around GTA 6.</p>

<p>An area of development for two of Hideo Kojima’s upcoming games have been delayed. In a post on social media, Kojima said that both OD and Physint have been impacted by the current <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sag-aftra-strike-with-video-game-voice-and-performance-artists-to-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG-AFTRA strike</a>.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his post</a>, Kojima gave players an update on where things stand with his three main projects — Death Stranding 2, OD, and Physint. Regarding Death Stranding 2, he says that the team “started to play and build up the game” over the summer after working on music production, Japanese voice recording, and more. For the other two games, however, there have been hiccups. </p>



<p>First, with OD, Kojima says that game development continued along with actor and environment scanning. In the second half of the year, though, scanning and filming was suspended due to the strike. For Physint, casting was suspended because of the strike.</p>



<p>Kojima said that the hold is to resume next year. That’s as long as a deal reached, of course. The current <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG-AFTRA strike began in July</a> after 18 months of negotiations over AI protections for video game actors. As of publishing, there is no update on where the talks stand.</p>



<p>What do you think of the SAG-AFTRA strike leading to delays for Kojima’s OD and Physint? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1364/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
