<p>Over the past four months, Polish game developer CD Projekt Red has hired over 50 new employees to work on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-wont-let-the-witcher-4-cyberpunk-2077/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> and other titles. The new entry in the iconic Witcher series is the only project currently in production, but CDPR has boosted the working numbers of almost all its other project departments.</p>



<h2 id="h-cdpr-has-been-increasing-the-size-of-almost-all-its-project-teams">CDPR Has Been Increasing the Size of Almost All its Project Teams</h2>



<p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/03/cd-projekt-group-presentation-fy-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> its earnings statement for the 2024 fiscal year today, highlighting the continuing success of Cyberpunk 2077 and the excitement built around The Witcher 4’s announcement. CDPR states that The Witcher 4 had the most watched trailer from The Game Awards’ slate of game premieres and had the most press coverage (measured in total article appearances and headlines).</p>



<p>Between the end of November (just a couple weeks before The Game Awards) and the end of this past February, CDPR brought on 57 new employees. 11 of those employees joined the already massive team working on The Witcher 4, increasing the total number to 411.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>However, the project that got the largest increase to its total size is the team working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-project-orion-2077-warm-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orion, the codename for Cyberpunk sequel</a> project. Over the last four months, that team increased by 20, growing from 64 to 84 employees. Prior to the start of this hiring wave, CDPR says they reached 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077 sold, and over 8 million copies sold of the critically acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion.</p>



<p>Fans shouldn’t expect the Cyberpunk sequel, or realistically any major CDPR release, anytime soon. The Witcher 4 is still in production, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-witcher-multiplayer-game-has-development-rebooted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the multiplayer Witcher project known as Sirius</a> is still in pre-production, and the Witcher remake, the Cyberpunk sequel, and a new IP project codenamed Hadar are still in their concept phases. There are also some unannounced projects in the works, including one from Fool’s Theory, who are also working on the Witcher remake.</p>
