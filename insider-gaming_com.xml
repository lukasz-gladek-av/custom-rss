<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally releasing on September 4, 2025. That may be two years after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silksong-delayed-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was originally promised</a> for release, but the news doesn’t come with any less hype surrounding it.</p>



<p>But why did it take so long for Silksong, the sequel to the highly successful Hollow Knight, to release? According to Team Cherry, it’s because they were having too much fun building the game.</p>



<p>In a new feature story from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, Team Cherry Co-Founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen spoke about what it was like creating the game, the delays, the pending release, and more.</p>



<p>The lengthy gap between Hollow Knight and Silksong wasn’t the result of any sort of studio struggles. Instead, the project grew far larger than originally planned. What began as a small expansion centered on Hornet evolved into a full-scale sequel with multiple towns, a deep quest system, and a world even bigger than the original.</p>



<p>Team Cherry’s small size meant progress naturally took longer, but the developers say the process was consistently joyful. Their creative workflow encouraged them to experiment and add new ideas, which kept expanding the scope of the game.</p>



<p><strong>“We’re very fortunate that we have a development method that is so enjoyable,</strong>” Gibson told Schreier. “<strong>Not exactly sure how we stumbled into that. Everything comes together quickly. You can see results fast. Ideas turn into something that exist in the game almost immediately before your eyes, and that’s very satisfying. And that allows you to go off on those tangents and meet weird characters because someone’s off-handedly mentioned a weird character as an idea and the other person’s laughed, and that’s enough.</strong>“</p>



<p>Unlike many studios, Team Cherry wasn’t pressured to rush out a release. Hollow Knight’s massive success—over 15 million copies sold—provided financial freedom, allowing them to polish Silksong extensively and ensure the entire game met the same high standard.</p>



<p>After releasing regular updates, the studio went quiet to focus on the game, believing regular updates would only frustrate fans. The end result is the game they wanted to make, even if it took years longer than expected.</p>



<p>Now, Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming in September. However, that’s not the end for the game. Both Gibson and Pellen say they already are working on plans for what’s next for the game.</p>



<p><strong>“Launching it is obviously quite exciting,”</strong> Pellen said. <strong>“What comes after for us is equally as exciting.”</strong></p>



<p>In his hands-on preview of the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Andy Highton said</a> that Silksong is “the game you’ve been waiting for is worth the wait.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight was easily one of the biggest reveals for Gamescom 2025. Fortunately, Insider Gaming had the chance to try the preview build of the upcoming LEGO Batman game at the event, and here are our early impressions on the preview build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight took the audience by storm at Opening Night Live, showcasing the Caped Crusader in a brand-new light, featuring iconic moments from his cinematic and comic universes while adding the beloved LEGO touch.&nbsp;It features a vast, open-world Gotham City and a narrative experience that begins with Batman’s origins and culminates in his transformation into a living legend. </p>



<h2 id="h-it-s-arkham-but-in-lego">It’s Arkham, But in LEGO</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The preview build at Gamescom allowed players to take on the roles of Batman and Commissioner Gordon as they worked together to take down crime and explore Gotham City. Both characters were unique in their functional abilities, with Batman more attuned to hand-to-hand combat, whereas Gordon focused on ranged attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both combat and movement styles are unique for the characters, each having two side abilities to choose from: Batman has a batarang that can stun enemies and the batclaw, which can grapple enemies. Gordon, on the other hand, has two types of guns: one that shoots pellets and the other that glues the enemy into a mold.&nbsp;The game also features a variety of gadgets that aid in puzzle solving; however, we have yet to see them in action. </p>



<p>The combat takes huge inspiration from the Arkham games, featuring various types of unique takedowns, stealth mechanics, and even a dodge ability that lets you vault over your enemies. Vast hordes of enemies will surround players during most situations, and they are spread across the city, breaking all kinds of laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even for a preview build, gameplay feels solid, and the developers have done a great job in finalizing the combat and traversal mechanics, allowing you to really get into the shoes of Batman.&nbsp;</p>

<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://legobatmangame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TT Games</a> has also successfully captured the essence of Gotham City. The dark and gritty vibe is on point. Moreover, there are various ways to traverse the city, including batmobiles, gliding, batclaws, and more. Just like the Arkham games, players can perch over rooftops, use the focus bar to build momentum, and transition straight into a glide to explore the city from the heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world itself is pretty extensive, not only featuring iconic locations that you may remember from the comics and the movies, but also featuring a plethora of puzzles spread across the city. Players have a lot to do in the game even when they aren’t playing the story mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts </h2>



<p>Overall, my early impressions of the game are that the developers are doing many things the right way. The gameplay and exploration are on point, and I was left wanting more as soon as my time was up. Now all we need to see is how TT games approach the story, different levels, and characters for the final build. However, given their current situation, it seems highly promising and has massive potential.&nbsp;</p>
