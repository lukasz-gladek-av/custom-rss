<p>Use these Roblox Anime Final Quest monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including cash, draws and much more.</p>



<p>Anime Final Quest is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-universal-tower-defense-codes/">Roblox</a> action RPG where players take on story missions, fight enemies inspired by popular anime worlds, and build a powerful roster of characters. Instead of running a business or placing structures, players spend their time clearing stages, defeating enemies, and tackling bosses to unlock stronger fighters. Team composition matters heavily, as different characters bring unique skills and strengths to battles.</p>







<p>Progression in this Roblox game depends on resources earned through quest completion, daily activities, and special events. These materials are primarily used for character summons, enhancements, and evolutions that increase overall team power. While steady play rewards consistent progress, redeemable codes provide a shortcut by granting free currency and bonuses, allowing players to summon more characters and strengthen their lineup without sinking hours into repetitive grinding.</p>

<p>Anime Final Quest codes are most commonly shared through the game’s official Discord server, the Roblox game page, and occasionally on the developer’s social media channels. The Discord community is particularly active, with developers frequently posting new codes. Therefore, the best place to find new codes is the Anime Final Quest Discord. However, tracking all these platforms can be challenging, especially since there’s no alert system to notify players when codes expire.</p>



<p>Therefore, we recommend bookmarking this guide in your browser, as it is regularly updated with the latest codes and removes expired ones promptly, ensuring you always have access to valid codes.</p>

<p>During a new interview, Bloober Team’s CEO revealed some minor details about their Nintendo-exclusive game, Project M. </p>



<p>Bloober Team’s CEO discussed several topics, including bringing Cronos: The New Dawn to Nintendo Switch 2, considering the possibility of their other games coming to the new console, and more. He also revealed that the mysterious Project M is only possible on Nintendo hardware. </p>



<h2 id="h-project-m-has-a-twist-that-no-horror-game-has-explored-yet">Project M has a Twist that No Horror Game has Explored Yet</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/bloober-team-nintendo-switch-2-interview-ports-ue5-remake-ceo-piotr-babieno/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Insider</a>, Bloober Team’s CEO, Piotr Babieno, was asked what players should expect from the Nintendo-exclusive horror game, Project M. Babieno responded, stating that it is very tough for him “not to reveal what Project M truly is—but for now, it’s still too early to talk about it.” However, the developers are confident that they will be able to share the first details “very soon”. </p>



<p>Babieno provided some additional details before wrapping up the Project M topic. The CEO revealed that fans of Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Limbo, and Eternal Darkness will feel immediately at home with this game. Project M will introduce “a bold twist,” which is something that “no horror game has explored before.” Lastly, the “vision” for this game “could only exist on Nintendo hardware”, concluded the Bloober CEO. </p>



<p>In other news, Cronos: The New Dawn will receive an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-getting-a-new-difficulty-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easier difficulty option</a> in early 2026.

<p>Use these Roblox Realistic Car Driving monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash and much more.</p>



<p>Realistic Car Driving puts you behind the wheel in an immersive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-universal-tower-defense-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience where your driving skills actually matter. Unlike arcade-style games, this simulator emphasizes authentic vehicle physics, challenging players to master realistic handling across diverse terrains and weather conditions. From city streets to off-road trails, each environment demands different techniques as you build your automotive collection. The game revolves around earning cash through various activities – winning races, completing time trials, and participating in driving challenges. </p>







<p>This currency is crucial for expanding your garage with vehicles ranging from everyday commuters to exotic supercars. What keeps players engaged is the depth of progression. Beyond simply acquiring vehicles, you’ll spend hours fine-tuning performance parts, adjusting suspension settings, and applying cosmetic modifications at the customization shops. Although cash is earned through regular gameplay, the fastest way to jump ahead is by redeeming promo codes — developers regularly release codes that grant free cash so players can buy more expensive cars and accelerate their progression instead of grinding.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li>Boot Realistic Car Driving on Roblox</li>

<li>Select Codes from the given list</li>

<li>Click on Redeem to claim the freebie</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-realistic-car-driving-codes">How To Get More Realistic Car Driving Codes</h2>



<p>Realistic Car Driving codes are typically released through the game’s official community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Discord server and the creator’s (Ferdi26) social media pages, where developers post updates and announcements regularly. Codes often come out around game milestones, major updates, or special events.</p>



<p>But if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops. Furthermore, the developers don’t announce expiration dates for codes, making it challenging to know how long each one will remain active. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s developer, Sandfall Interactive, is not tempted to scale up after winning Game of the Year. </p>



<p>Sandall Interactive’s Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 ended up winning Game of the Year for 2025, and also ended up breaking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an all-time The Game Awards record</a>, which proves how much of a success the title was this year. However, the developers are not looking to expand things instantly, and will keeo things as is for the time being. </p>

<p>During a new interview with Edge Magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/we-love-making-games-more-than-we-love-managing-clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-says-its-good-to-have-limitations-so-the-rpg-studio-wont-scale-up-for-any-future-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s director, Guillaume Broche, was asked whether their next project would become a “large-scale production”. Broche responded, stating, “No, I think it’s good to have limitations when you are creative,” and that it’s the “best way to be the best version of yourself.” </p>



<p>The director added that there is the potential to “scale up now” as the studio has “a lot more money”; however, “I would say it’s not tempting for us because even the management team and myself, we’d have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves.”</p>



<p>Broche continued, stating that the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 dev team loves “making games more than we love managing” and wants to continue working on games.&nbsp;These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again,” concluded Broche. </p>

<p>A new report reveals that the director of ‘Chernobyl’ is being brought on to helm the upcoming Netflix Assassin’s Creed series.</p>



<p>Things have been progressing rather quickly for Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series lately. Just last month, players were informed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toby Wallace from Euphoria</a> has been cast as the lead in the show. There was also a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-setting-ancient-rome-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> in November that spoke about the setting of the upcoming series. Now we know who will direct the show, and Netflix has locked in a major name. </p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-series-is-centered-on-a-secret-war-between-two-shadowy-factions">Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series is ‘Centered on a Secret War Between Two Shadowy Factions’</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/assassins-creed-netflix-directed-johan-renck-1236610672/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> reveals that Johan Renck, the Swedish director behind HBO’s highly rated ‘Chernobyl’ series, will be at the helm for Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed. Renck has also directed series like ‘The Last Panther’ and episodes of popular shows like ‘Breaking Bad,’ ‘The Walking Dead,’ ‘Vikings,’ ‘Bates Motel’ and more. </p>



<p>Additionally, Roberto Patino and David Wiener will be the creators, showrunners, and executive producers for Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed adaptation. Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, Matt O’Toole, and Genevieve Jones of Ubisoft Film &amp; Television will be coming on as executive producers. </p>



<p>The plot of the upcoming adaptation hasn’t been revealed, but we do have some idea now, thanks to the logline. It states that the series will focus on a secret war between two shadowy factions. One of these factions is “set on determining mankind’s future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will.” We all know which two factions the series has always revolved around. ‘</p>



<p>Additionally, the logline also says that Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series will follow the characters “across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity’s destiny.” </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-first-nintendo-switch-game-nearly-done/</link>
            <guid>1390798</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In February 2023, Microsoft inked a 10-year deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms. The deal was signed amidst Microsoft’s landmark acquisition of Activision Blizzard, but fast-forward to today, and the Nintendo space is still without a Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>According to one insider, that might be about to change. In a recent claim posted to social media, it was suggested that Call of Duty is ‘a few months’ away from launching on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-call-of-duty-coming-to-switch">When is Call of Duty Coming to Switch?</h2>



<p>According to Windows Central’s Jez Corden, the first Call of Duty ‘Switch version’ is set to land on the platform in ‘a few months’. Corden explained that the spanner in the works concerned the lack of developer kits for the Nintendo Switch 2, which has been a pretty public issue since <strong>before </strong>the console launched in June.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first CoD Switch version is nearly done and launching in a few months</p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Corden didn’t explain which Call of Duty title is being ported to Nintendo Switch 2, leaving it up to fans to surmise what’s on the way. There’s a lengthy line-up to pick from. It could be Call of Duty Warzone, which would promote the fastest adoption on Nintendo Switch 2, or it could be a recent release like Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Fans aren’t too sure about Black Ops 7 being released on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
