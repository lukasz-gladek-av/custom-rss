<p>The anticipated The Lord of the Rings MMO from Amazon Games might have been canceled. At least, that’s what a former employee’s post on social media would suggest.</p>



<p>In a now-deleted post on LinkedIn, a former developer confirmed that they had been laid off from Amazon Games and specifically mentioned The Lord of the Rings MMO.</p>



<p><strong>“This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y’all would have loved it),”&nbsp;</strong>the post read. <strong>“It’s always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this — I’ve been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I’ve ever met here.”</strong></p>



<p>While that doesn’t outright confirm the game’s been shelved, the wording used in the post strongly suggests that’s the case. On top of that, sources who spoke to Insider Gaming are also of the belief that the game isn’t going to move forward, with one saying that the game is “likely done.” However, they wouldn’t outright confirm that it’s completely dead due to the IP involved.</p>



<p>Neither Amazon Games nor Embracer has responded to multiple requests for comment on the claims from the former employee along with what sources have said.</p>



<p>If this is the end for the MMO from Amazon, it likely won’t be the end for The Lord of the Rings as a video game franchise. Insider Gaming recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported that a new third-person action game</a> is in development with investment from the Abu Dhabi Investment Office. </p>

<p>Fortnite has confirmed the long-rumored companion feature is returning to the game, with Epic Games announcing new ‘Sidekicks’ will be included in the Battle Pass for Chapter 6’s The Simpsons-themed mini-season.</p>



<p>Long-standing leaks have teased the return of pets, which first began to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pets-are-reportedly-being-reworked-to-be-a-bit-more-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emerge in May</a>, and there have been several teases since. </p>



<p>Now, though, the news is official and, rather than waiting for Chapter 7 in December to relaunch the new feature, sidekicks are coming this weekend.</p>

<p>As the days continue to tick down towards the start of the final stage of Chapter 6, with a mini-season themed around The Simpsons, <a href="https://t.co/Iv2lOOSXhP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games has confirmed</a> the first Sidekick in the upcoming Battle Pass—which is now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-battle-passes-will-now-be-included-in-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription</a>.</p>



<p>The first Sidekick to launch, Peels, is a banana-styled dog that matches the fan-favorite Peely character, which will be available to earn in the Battle Pass. At this stage, however, it’s unclear whether it will be a free reward or part of the Premium Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Additional Sidekicks will become available in the Item Shop from November 7, including Bonesy, Spike, and Lil’ Raptor, while images show Sidekicks for Fishstick and a pug in a hoodie will also come at some point.</p>



<p>Sidekicks will come alongside earnable Sidekick Points (SP) that can be spent on cosmetics to customize your Sidekick, with teases so far showing various colors, items, and apparel that can be unlocked.</p>



<p>The return of the Sidekick feature opens lots of doors for Fortnite’s collabs in the future, potentially bringing fan-favorite characters into the game in a different form.</p>



<p>Expect Sidekicks to have an even bigger role from Chapter 7 onwards, which will kick-off in December to mark the start of another year of content in the game.</p>
