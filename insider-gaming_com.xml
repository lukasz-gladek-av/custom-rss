<p>The Finals burst onto the scene with its unique blend of map destruction, arcade-like gameplay, and blaring sounds and visuals, but let’s look at The Finals’ player count in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s so hard for new shooters in the live-service online multiplayer sphere to stand out. Call of Duty rules the roost, and the likes of Marvel Rivals, Fortnite, and Overwatch own large market share segments. So it was quite the feat for The Finals when it arrived in 2023 to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge acclaim and hefty player numbers</a>. This was despite reservations and emerging details of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-finals-use-of-ai-isnt-going-away-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI use in The Finals</a>.</p>



<p>The first few weeks of a hyped multiplayer title are usually the best. Everyone checks in to see what it’s about, how it plays, and numbers eventually dwindle. So we’re here to analyze The Finals’ player count numbers to see how it’s faring.</p>

<p><strong>Using Steam Charts, we can see February 2025 had an average of 11,760 players in The Finals—reaching a peak of 19,499 users.</strong></p>



<p>The first thing to note about The Finals player count numbers is <strong>this doesn’t factor in PlayStation or Xbox users</strong>. There’s no reliable piece of software capable of telling us this data, and it’s been this way for years. It’s baffling—given this age of technology—but this is the reality.</p>



<p>Any official figures come from <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2073850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Finals’ Steam Charts page</a>, and this has the game’s monthly figures going back to its December 2023 launch. The Finals achieved its <strong>all-time peak of 242,399 players</strong> during its debut month. Compared to its most recent month (as of writing), its <strong>recent monthly peaks are nearly 90% down since launch</strong>.</p>



<p>It took just two months for The Finals player count numbers to see a huge drop-off. From December 2023 to February 2024, the shooter went from <strong>120,211 players on averag</strong>e to <strong>24,848</strong>. </p>



<p>March 2024 saw an average of <strong>21,712</strong> in-game users, and the monthly average has <strong>never gotten back over 20K</strong>.</p>



<p>This makes it all sound negative, but for a relatively new shooter in a feisty market, it’s doing well. The last few months have seen a <strong>peak</strong> of nearly 20,00 players or more, and it continues to tick along. Remember, this doesn’t include PlayStation or Xbox figures, meaning there’s still a fair few thousands logging in each month.</p>



<p>The start of 2025 has been slightly worrying though. <strong>The Finals has dipped below 12K</strong>, and continues to dwindle month by month. With more seasons and content on the way, these figures should receive a new boost every so often.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-finals-worth-playing-in-2025">Is The Finals Worth Playing in 2025?</h2>



<p><strong>The Finals’ gameplay and nuances make it worth playing in 2025, but it could depend on Battlefield 6’s success.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a> showed no matter how tight your game is, if there’s not enough content, players don’t like it, or other games are doing it better, people won’t play. I think The Finals has a terrific niche in its <strong>level destructibility</strong>—a unique selling point mastered only by the Battlefield series.</p>



<p>EA’s Battlefield has been absent and fairly anonymous for several years, due to the failings of Battlefield 2042. But Battlefield 6 AKA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2025</a> is currently testing the waters with its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-first-playtest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> program. Pre-release footage has already shown destruction is the name of the game, and EA and DICE want their crown back.</p>



<p>The Finals is free-to-play, which always makes it a great bargain. However, with more games coming out, and Battlefield on the way, Embark might have to do something special if The Finals’ player count monthly numbers continue to diminish, and Battlefield 6 makes a huge splash. </p>



<p><strong>I recommend playing The Finals while you can, because it might not be around forever given today’s toxic and volatile climate.</strong></p>

<p>We have the 2025 player count figures for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-are-playing-warzone-right-now-player-count-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Warzone</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-player-count-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s numbers</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-player-count-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> players this year too.</p>



<p>I’ve been quite surprised by The Finals’ success and longevity so far. Do you think it has the potential to reach the next level? Or is it solid enough to maintain The Finals player count enough to help it stay in a crowded online scene? Drop a comment and share your thoughts.</p>
