<p>According to a reliable insider, the Gears of War collection will not feature PvP but include campaign co-op.</p>



<p>Yesterday, new details about the Gears of War collection surfaced through Detective Seeds on <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1897139827772170355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. Their post stated that the game was seemingly added to the PlayStation Store backend, revealing new information about it. The leaker reported that the game will arrive in mid-2025 (August) and will not include multiplayer PvP content; the focus will be only on the campaign. A reliable insider has now corroborated the information about the Gears of War collection not featuring multiplayer PvP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jez Corden took to <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1897334037204946947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> later to reveal what he knows about Gears of War Collection’s PvP status. In his recent thread on X, Corden stated, “I, too, have heard no multiplayer.” In the same thread, Corden was asked whether the collection would include campaign co-op, and he replied, “Yeah, co-op, but not PvP, is what I heard.”&nbsp;Corden has <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1897535168300163490" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that he is “looking into the Gears collection rumors” to find something concrete. </p>



<p><span>In his recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7FO40pCi8Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video</a>, another leaker, eXtas1s, also revealed some details about the Gears of War Collection and E-Day</span>. According to him, the Gears of War collection will be revealed during the Xbox Showcase later this year, and the game will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC on Day One. Gears of War E-Day is reportedly scheduled for 2026 but has a “slim” chance of being postponed to 2025.&nbsp;</p>
