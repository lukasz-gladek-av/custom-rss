            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The idea of LEGO Pokémon prices allegedly being expensive is as shocking as being unable to catch Mewtwo first go with a Poké Ball—it’s not. A new leak claims to have gotten wind of the first LEGO Pokémon date and prices, and while not official, it seems there will be at least one monstrous set.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-mario-kart-spiny-shell-set-promo-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a> acquiring the right to use the Pokémon license is a win for all. MEGA has done a great job with its range of products over the years—my house proudly displays a giant Gyarados, Eevee, and a Poke Ball! But it’s certainly exciting to see what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Pokémon</a> is in the works.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-pokemon-reportedly-arrives-in-2026-and-will-be-expensive">LEGO Pokémon Reportedly Arrives in 2026 And Will Be Expensive</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Welcome changes. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the popular and reliable <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LegoLeak</a> subreddit, the new LEGO Pokémon sets are releasing on March 1, 2026.</p>



<p>Three sets have been outed: 72151, 72152, and 72153. The first one reportedly has 587 pieces and will cost $59.99. The second set contains 2050 pieces and costs $199.99. The third and final set (72153) apparently features a whopping 6838 pieces and will set you back $649.99.</p>



<p>Again, this is a rumored leak, so take this information at face value for what it is. The fun part is now speculating what the sets could be. LEGO tends to have different versions of the same theme. The Millennium Falcon, for example, has three variations, and the main difference between them is size and price.</p>



<p>The three models mentioned in the leak could be Pikachu, but getting progressively bigger and more expensive. Either way, I can’t wait to see what LEGO Pokémon sets are in development.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Which LEGO Pokémon sets are you keen to see? Who’s your favorite Pokémon? I am desperate for a Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar set, personally. Let me know what you hope to see through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Approximately 40 minutes of Star Wars Outlaws gameplay, running on the Nintendo Switch 2, has leaked online.</p>



<p>The gameplay was uploaded by the YouTuber mataleao, who has managed to get the game early on the Switch 2 ahead of its September 4, 2025, release date. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As pointed out by some users in the YouTube comments, the gameplay appears surprisingly good, with some users noting that it even looks and seems to run better than Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>“This runs amazing. It’s not 60fps and 1080p but it looks really smooth. The people complaining are just holding these ports to extremely high standards” says YouTube user Selfbaptized. “Looks way better than I anticipated,” says another user.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-star-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-run-poorly">Does Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 Run Poorly?</h2>



<p>According to some media outlets, though, who were given the opportunity to play the game on the Switch 2 at PAX West 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-reportedly-performed-poorly-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws didn’t have great performance</a>. According to those in attendance, the game’s framerate dropped below 30 FPS on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>Media outlets were apparently not allowed to record gameplay, with those getting hands-on saying that the game was “king of rough”. </p>



<p>Whether the game runs well or not remains to be seen, but the 40 minutes of Star Wars Outlaws gameplay uploaded to YouTube do look like it runs rather well.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cancelled-star-wars-outlaws-sequel-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws sequel</a>, which Insider Gaming understands was in the very early stages of development, was canceled due to the game not meeting internal expectations. </p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws is set to launch on the Nintendo Switch 2 on September 4, 2025. Will you be giving it a play? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws is scheduled to release for the Switch 2 on September 4, 2025, and just days ahead of launch, the game’s performance might not be up to standard. </p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws for the Nintendo Switch 2 was announced during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partner Showcase</a> on July 31. Outlaws will be the first Ubisoft game to arrive for the new console. However, a new report reveals that the game’s performance is not the best, even with the release less than a week away.</p>



<h2 id="h-star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-framerate-dropped-several-times-below-30fps">Star Wars Outlaws Switch 2 Framerate Dropped Several Times Below 30FPS</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-version-performance-issues-low-frame-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5JbnfU0SVs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GVG</a> was present at PAX West 2025, where they were able to try Star Wars Outlaws for the Switch 2. Their new YouTube video states that Nintendo had all the games from Gamescom 2025 on display at PAX West 2025, with the only exception being Star Wars Outlaws. They were able to test the Star Wars Outlaws at this event, but were not allowed to capture any gameplay footage of the demo version.</p>



<p>GVG was not allowed even to have over-the-shoulder cameras to record footage; the only option was to play it and discuss it. Once, they played Star Wars Outlaws on the Switch 2, and it was evident that the performance was “kind of rough.” The video adds that Star Wars Outlaws runs “pretty poorly on the Switch 2.” </p>



<p>The demo only featured close sequences that included a Star Destroyer and a space fight. No open-world sequences were available, and even in the closed sequences, the framerate dropped below 30fps several times. The video clarifies that there was no way to analyse the drops as no footage was recorded, but the drops felt significant. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-direct-will-take-place-in-september-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1285515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable source has claimed that a Nintendo Direct is scheduled for the second week of September 2025. </p>



<p>The last Nintendo Direct was hosted in July 2025, and it was a partner showcase that featured 25 minutes of announcements from Nintendo’s publishing partners. Since then, SwitchForce has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-of-the-next-nintendo-direct-pick-up-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that another Nintendo Direct showcase is planned for the second week of September, and another insider has just corroborated the information. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-next-nintendo-direct-should-arrive-in-the-second-week-of-september">The Next Nintendo Direct Should Arrive in the Second Week of September</h2>



<p>The corroboration about September’s Nintendo Direct comes from the reliable leaker, NateTheHate, through his latest post on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1962214416339833244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). Nate has stated, “Yes, there is a Nintendo Direct in September.” The insider added that it will be held in the “second week of the month”. And, it would be “in the latter half on or around Sept 11 or 12th.” </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Yes, there is a Nintendo Direct in September. </p><p>When: The second week of the month, in the latter half on or around Sept 11 or 12th.</p></div>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1962214416339833244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In the same thread, a user has also asked whether the Red Dead Redemption 2 Switch 2 port will be announced at this direct. To which Nate responded, stating, “Maybe? Depends if Nintendo was able to court Rockstar.” The insider added that RDR2’s Switch 2 port is “bound regardless of announcement/reveal venue.” </p>



<p>It is hard to tell which games will be at this event, but we have several Switch 2 titles releasing in the October/November period, including Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Kirby Air Riders, Borderlands 4, Little Nightmares III, and more. Regardless, players should take the information about the Switch 2 Direct with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source. </p>



<p>In other news, Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sold-more-physical-copies-on-nintendo-switch-2-than-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold more physical copies</a> on the Nintendo Switch 2 than digital. Also, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade will release for the Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-intergrade-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2025</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Does Borderlands 4 Have Early Access?]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>September is stacked full of huge releases, and Borderlands 4 is undoubtedly one of the biggest, so we’ve got the details on whether you can dive into the game ahead of others with early access.</p>



<p>Releasing September 12, Borderlands 4 caught our eye in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, and Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has high hopes for the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predicting over 100m sales</a>.</p>



<p>If you can’t contain your excitement for Borderlands 4 and want to know whether there is any way to jump the queue and play early, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-borderlands-4-with-early-access">Can You Play Borderlands 4 With Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Landing with a bang. Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there are not any early access options for Borderlands 4. As such, the release date and time are the same for everyone.</strong></p>



<p>While many other games adopt an early-access stance, often as a pre-order bonus for a higher-priced edition of the game, neither the Deluxe Edition nor the Super Deluxe Edition of <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Borderlands 4</a> provide this incentive.</p>



<p>However, store listings for Borderlands 4 indicate the game will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staggered global release at midnight local time</a>, excluding Steam, so the doors won’t open for everyone at the same time.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-borderlands-4-early">Is There Any Way to Play Borderlands 4 Early?</h2>



<p><strong>Although there are no early access options for Borderlands 4, you may be able to play early by adjusting your time zone on your console.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox players have the easiest approach for the New Zealand trick, requiring only a change in location settings and restarting the console. With this approach, players will be able to play Borderlands 4 when the game launches in New Zealand, hours before the release time in their time zone.</p>



<p>PlayStation players can also take advantage of this approach, though it’s harder to do and potentially more costly. In order to play early on New Zealand, you must have a New Zealand account and purchase the game from the store in that region. However, you might not be able to transfer your save date over to your main account, so be careful.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for PC players, there’s no New Zealand trick and the Steam release, unlike on console, is set to be global at a set time. On the bright side, this does mean everyone on PC will start playing at the same time.</p>
