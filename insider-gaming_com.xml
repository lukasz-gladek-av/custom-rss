<p>VALORANT Patch 10.04 is officially live, and since it goes hand-in-hand <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-ditches-episodes-for-yearly-season-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a new Act</a>, it means that it’s a big one. The latest patch adds a dynamic, potentially game-breaking new duelist agent, major balance changes to existing agents, and some key changes to map pool.</p>



<p>Let’s dive into the full list of updates now live as of VALORANT Patch 10.04.</p>



<h2 id="h-welcome-to-the-waylay-era">Welcome to the Waylay Era</h2>



<p>Waylay is the newest addition to the duelist class, and this new light-bending duelist from Thailand has “broken” written all over her. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-pros-say-the-next-duelist-will-be-an-even-more-annoying-jett/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The pros weren’t lying when they said she could replace Jett</a>, or be just as annoying. Her kit is designed to disrupt, hinder, and surprise enemy players.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Waylay Official Gameplay Reveal // VALORANT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/njK6KgRNr2k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Here are each of the abilities for Waylay, the newest VALORANT duelist:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Refract</strong>: Create a light beacon on the floor. Reactivate to return to the beacon, traveling as an invulnerable mote of pure light. This is like a stationary Yoru Gatecrash, but it affords the opportunity to gather info before returning to the starting point.</li>



<li><strong>Light Speed</strong>: It’s a Jett double dash. Waylay’s Light Speed can be used to jump over walls or push deep into a site during an execute. There are going to be so many highlight plays from this one.</li>



<li><strong>Saturate</strong>: Throw a cluster of light that explodes when it hits the ground, applying the Hinder effect to nearby players. Hinder slows enemy fire rate, recoil recovery, equip time, reload speed, movement speed, and jump speed.</li>



<li><strong>Convergent Paths</strong>: Waylay’s ultimate ability. Project a beam of light forward, which after a delay, applies Waylay with a speed boost and applies Hinder to enemies caught in the beam.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-valorant-10-04-balance-changes">VALORANT 10.04 Balance Changes</h2>



<p>Clove, Tejo, Iso, and Deadlock are the primary recipients of this patch’s balance changes. In this section, we dive into the major changes made to each of those four agents.</p>



<h3 id="h-clove">Clove</h3>



<p>Meddle, Clove’s Decay-applying throwable, now explodes 0.75 seconds after hitting the ground, instead of just a 1.3 second delay. The cooldown on their Ruse smokes has increased from 30 seconds to 40. Pick Me Up’s health buff duration has increased from eight seconds to 10, but the move speed durations drops from eight seconds to just three.</p>



<h3 id="h-deadlock">Deadlock</h3>



<p>GravNet is now Deadlock’s signature ability, costing no money at the start of the round and receiving a 40 second rechargeable cooldown. GravNet’s size has slightly decreased from 16m to 13m. Barrier Mesh now costs 400 credits.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-iso">Iso</h3>



<p>Iso now only gets one charge of his Undercut, but it now applies Suppression along with Vulnerability. The tagging on Double Tap has been changed, so he is now slowed more when his shield breaks. Iso will always have Double Tap applied now when he wins a duel in his Kill Contract ultimate.</p>



<h3 id="h-tejo">Tejo</h3>



<p>Tejo’s Guided Salvo missiles deal 65 points of damage and deal half damage to non-player objects. This changes has been made so that Tejo’s Guided Salvo does not successfully destroy Killjoy’s Lockdown.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-10-04-map-changes">VALORANT 10.04 Map Changes</h2>



<p>With the start of the new act, the VALORANT map pool is getting a change. <strong>Ascent and Icebox are back in</strong> the Competitive and Deathmatch queues, while <strong>Abyss and Bind are being taken out</strong>. Ascent is returning with a big change: the infamous B Main wall that players spam through with the Odin has been reinforced. Riot noted that all the spamming at this spot was “creating unhealthy gameplay and frustrating experiences.”</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds sold 8 million units in the first 3 days of release, becoming the fastest-selling game in Capcom’s history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was released on February 28, 2025, and the game has been breaking records since the first day. The game brought in over 1.3 million players on Steam alone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within the first 12 hours</a> and is still managing to bring in more than 1 million players within the past 24 hours (at the time of writing). Their latest record, with 8 million sales in 3 days, has made Monster Hunter Wilds the fastest-selling game in the series and Capcom’s history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the announcement <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a>, the developers discussed what it took to sell over 8 million copies in such a short span of time. With the new instalment in the series, the developers wanted to take Monster Hunter to a broader audience. So, they conducted several global initiatives, such as appearing at global game showcases, hosting online beta tests, and hosting individual showcases to spread the word.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from the initiatives, the developers have also worked on several core aspects of the game that have helped Monster Hunter Wilds reach this significant sales milestone. Through the Forbidden Lands, players experience a new, dynamically changing open world where they can be in the harshest environment at one moment and then suddenly find themselves in a “rich natural environment teeming with life”. The game is also the first in the series to feature cross-play co-op, which helps more players across platforms enjoy the game together.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/runescape-developer-new-ceo-jon-bellamy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/runescape%E2%80%99s-developer-has-a-new-ceo-in-jon-bellamy.1124637/</guid>

<p>Jagex has announced a change-up at the highest level, with CEO Phil Mansell stepping down and being replaced by Jon Bellamy. Phil has been in the role of Chief Executive Officer at Jagex since 2017 but has been with the company for more than a decade. Jon Bellamy noted that he is excited to communicate his ‘broader vision’ for RuneScape soon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-handing-over-the-baton">Handing Over The Baton</h2>



<p>In a press release, Phil Mansell expressed his sentiments at stepping back from the role of CEO at Jagex:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After an incredible 14 years leading RuneScape and 8 years as Jagex’s CEO, I’m stepping back and handing over the baton to Jon Bellamy. </p>



<p>Working alongside such a talented and passionate team, we’ve significantly grown the Company and player community, cementing Jagex as an innovator in community-driven games and genuine leader in this industry. </p>



<p>As the Company embarks on its next chapter, I am delighted to be handing over to a leader who I know cares about our games and business as much as I do – and I look forward to supporting him as he builds upon the strong foundations we’ve created.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bellamy echoed those sentiments:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a great honour to assume the leadership of Jagex and to help steward a game franchise that means so much to so many millions, myself included. I am also excited to get to work with the outstanding team, whom I know well from my time on the Board, to ensure our games continue to be the best in the world. </p>



<p>I plan to spend some time now with the team, reviewing our ambitions for Jagex, and plan to communicate my broader vision to the RuneScape community in the near-term.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mansell was most recently in the press following an awful proposal made by Jagex to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-ceo-addresses-recent-runescape-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overhaul the paid membership model</a>. It rankled with the community and was taken with an awful reception, and Mansell branded the proposal ‘clumsy and inconsiderate’.</p>



<p>He said that they had failed to think the proposal through from the perspective of a player, and the plans were ultimately scrapped.</p>



<p>Last year, Jagex was in talks regarding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-billion-dollar-buyout/">a potential billion dollar buyout</a>, but that conversation eventually faded out of the press.</p>

<p>New leaks for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 have revealed that the game will release on July 11, 2025.</p>
