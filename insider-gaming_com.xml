<p>In a post on social media, the teams at Deck Nine and Square Enix announced the impending reveal of the new Life is Strange game. Just days ago, it was discovered on a ratings site that this game will be titled ‘Life is Strange: Reunion’, but the post on socials contains a cryptic message that might <strong>debunk that</strong> in some way.</p>



<p>The team wrote, ‘Separate the real from the rumor,’ but it’s not clear if they’re talking about the content of the game or the suggestion that the plot for the game has already been uncovered.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-life-is-strange-reunion-the-next-game">Is Life is Strange: Reunion The Next Game?</h2>



<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure was the <strong>last </strong>game in the series, released in 2024 to a mixed reception. It told the extended story of Max Caulfield, returning to the fray and being voiced by the instantly recognizable Hannah Telle for the first time in almost a decade.</p>



<p>The short teaser released by Deck Nine in anticipation of the upcoming reveal of the next Life is Strange game didn’t give much away, but we at least know that Max Caulfield <strong>is returning</strong>. That was a point made at the <strong>end </strong>of Life is Strange: Double Exposure, so that’s hardly a surprise.</p>



<p>What <strong>was </strong>a surprise was when the world learned that Life is Strange: Reunion, the rumored next game, would see <strong>Chloe Price </strong>make a grand reappearance.</p>



<p>In the original Life is Strange game, released in 2015, players joined Max and Chloe as they explored a mystery taking over the small coastal town of Arcadia Bay. Over five episodes, Life is Strange unravelled, packed full of teenage angst, emotional sequences, and huge twists.</p>



<p>The game’s ending represented a fork, with players deciding to <strong>let Chloe die </strong>or to sacrifice the <strong>entire town </strong>and drive off into the sunrise. Years later, the canonical ending was made clear, as the story of Double Exposure confirmed that Chloe Price was alive.</p>



<p>We’ll know what the next Life is Strange game looks like in just a few days, when Deck Nine and Square Enix unveil it during a livestream on January 20th at 1 PM EST.</p>

<p>Playtika, the mobile developer behind games like Bingo Blitz and World Series of Poker, has announced plans for mass layoffs at the company.</p>



<p>In an SEC filing on Wednesday, the company revealed its plans to cut staff as part of company-wide restructuring.</p>







<p>Playtika says that the decision comes <strong>“as part of a larger adjustment to the company’s cost structure and reallocation of<br>resources within its portfolio of games.”</strong> Overall, the company is looking to let go around 15% of its staff during the first quarter of 2026.</p>



<p>That amounts to roughly 450-500 employees for a company with over 3,000 employees globally. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-playtika-told-employees-about-the-layoffs">What Playtika Told Employees About The Layoffs</h2>



<p>As part of the SEC filing, Playtika provided the email that CEO Robert Antokol sent to staff announcing the decision.</p>



<p>In his email, Antokol said that it<strong> “was not made lightly”</strong> and that it reflects a <strong>“fundamental shift in how we operate so we can invest in the future and remain a leader in a highly competitive mobile games market.”</strong></p>







<p><strong>“For years, we operated with a broad growth mindset, applying similar resourcing models across our portfolio of games,”</strong> Antokol said. <strong>“The economic reality of our industry has shifted.”</strong></p>



<p>He continued to say that if the company didn’t adjust their strategy, it would compromise its <strong>“ability to invest in tomorrow”. </strong></p>



<p>As far as what the future holds for Playtika, Antokol said that the company is <strong>“moving away from headcount-heavy operations to streamlined teams powered by AI and automation.”</strong></p>



<p>He said that with this move, it allows Playtika to offer clearer career paths and better compensation to the employees being kept. For those being let go, Antokol said that they are “committed to treating all impacted employees with respect and compassion.” All employees will be given severance packages and “support to help ease this transition”.</p>
