            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/why-the-order-1886-didnt-get-sequel/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Order: 1886 was a one-and-done game released on PlayStation 4 in 2015. It was a pretty good title, pieced together by Ready at Dawn and offering players an immersive, original single-player campaign. It plunged gamers into an alt-history version of London in, you guessed it, 1886, pitting them against werewolves and vampires, among other things.</p>



<p>The Order: 1886 was a deeply cinematic affair, and even the game’s aspect ratio promoted a sense of ‘playing a movie’, but it wasn’t enough to warrant a follow-up title, despite one being planned by Ready at Dawn. In a recent interview, the studio’s co-founder explained <strong>why </strong>a sequel never arrived.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-missed-it-by-that-much">Missed it by That Much</h2>



<p>In an interview with MinnMax uncovered by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ready-at-dawn-co-founder-discusses-failed-the-order-1886-sequel-pitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VGC</a>, it’s revealed why The Order: 1886 didn’t receive a sequel, despite many players asking for one over the years. As the discussion unfolded in the 24-minute sequence, Ready at Dawn’s Andrea Pessino explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it was the sales – I think it was the critical reception.</p>



<p>Sony is a very proud group and rightfully so, and the critical reception, if it had even been just in the 70s, we would have had the sequel, I’m convinced.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pessino was referring to The Order: 1886’s Metacritic score, which landed on a not-so-good 63 post-launch. That was despite the game testing well and generating solid responses from previews and mock interviews, Pessino reported.</p>



<p>The Order: 1886’s follow-up title should have arrived in 2018 if everything had gone as planned. Ultimately, the team at Ready at Dawn had to slice and dice the opening game to meet Sony’s deadlines, resulting in some of the game’s more innovative and engaging segments effectively becoming sheer cinematics:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the problems is that so much was cut.</p>



<p>A lot of the more subtle narrative parts were lost because so much was chopped away and things that were supposed to be interactive became a movie.</p>



<p>We needed another year, that’s the reality. We needed at least one more year, we didn’t get it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

<p><br>The Order: 1886 is one of those games that’ll go down in history as <strong>needing a sequel</strong>. It fits in nicely alongside the likes of Bloodborne, another PlayStation 4 game that, for many years, fans worldwide have cried out for a follow-up title to.</p>

<p>G2 Esports was the front-runner to win the Six Invitational 2025 in Boston, but then the team ran into the underdogs. That’s part and parcel of the esports industry, and from one day to the next, it remains dramatically unpredictable.</p>



<p>In the group stage, G2 put up one hell of a result, coasting through the opening portion of the Six Invitational 2025 without dropping a single map – a record that no other team could replicate. However, going into the playoffs, the team faltered, falling short in back-to-back fixtures and being eliminated from the running.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-g2-out">G2 Out</h2>



<p>In the playoffs of the Six Invitational 2025, G2 Esports met its match <strong>twice</strong>, losing first to Spacestation and then again to Oxygen Esports in the elimination bracket. The Spacestation loss was tough enough, but Oxygen was barely in the running during the group stage and only just managed to secure qualification for the playoffs.</p>



<p>This huge loss was dealt with a strong blow, too – G2 failed to secure a point against Oxygen before imploding and dropping out of the $3 million flagship tournament.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the likes of M80, Shopify Rebellion, Team Liquid, w7m Esports, DarkZero, Virtus, and CAG all departed the competition.</p>



<p>Recently, drama struck the Six Invitational as <a href="https://x.com/R6esports/status/1889027697776456021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">M80’s coach exploded</a> against DarkZero’s roster, going on a tirade and exhibiting extremely aggressive behaviour. The act earned him a two-year competitive suspension and landed M80 with a $10,000 fine. To put that into perspective, M80 walked away from the tournament with just $55,000 in earnings.</p>



<p>Only eight teams remain in the Six Invitational 2025 lineup going forward:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team BDS</li>



<li>Spacestation</li>



<li>Razah</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>Oxygen</li>



<li>Unwanted</li>
</ul>



<p>The predictions have shifted, and now Team BDS sits in the top spot and is the odds-on favourite to win the event and the $1 million grand prize.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-record-year/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-helped-push-shift-up-to-a-record-breaking-year-in-2024.1105569/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-record-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Stellar Blade was released in April 2024, emerging to a solid reception and strong sales on PlayStation 5. It has since remained in the minds of fans worldwide, with developer Shift Up plugging away to keep the content stream relatively well stoked. From a festive-themed update to a Nier crossover event, Stellar Blade hasn’t been forgotten just yet.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=225&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial update</a>, Shift Up revealed that Stellar Blade was a key component in the company securing record-high revenue streams in 2024. The post-apocalyptic action title generated $43.2 million in royalties, and per the financial update, it ‘continues to sell well’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-hopes">High Hopes</h2>



<p>Stellar Blade will be expanding from the confines of PlayStation this year, with a fresh version of the game landing on PC. Shift Up has already suggested that the game will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-is-releasing-for-pc-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell even better on PC</a>, giving the IP a new lease on life.</p>



<p>In the last year that the game has been on the market, it has generated more than $40 million in royalties for Shift Up. At the same time, the company’s mainstay title, Goddess of Victory: Nikke, generated around $105.4 million, making up around 70% of the studio’s income.</p>



<p>Before Stellar Blade hit the market, Shift Up started talking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-dev-already-teasing-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about its next project</a>, which was later revealed to be dubbed ‘Project Witches’. It’s set to emerge in (or after) 2027, but nothing else is known about the game.</p>



<p>In a world being driven down by layoffs and studio closures, Shift Up plans to expand, hiring around 100 people by the end of 2025. The future looks relatively bright for this South Korean studio, and I for one am excited to see what comes next from the team.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-esports-world-cup-riot-deal/</link>

<p>Riot Games has signed a three-year partnership with the Esports World Cup Foundation to bring a trio of titles to the hyper-valuable event. From this year, League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, and most importantly, <strong>VALORANT</strong> will appear at the Esports World Cup event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>This will mark the first time that VALORANT has appeared at the event, as last year during the inaugural showcase, the game failed to surface.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-cultural-impact-of-competitive-gaming">‘The Cultural Impact of Competitive Gaming’</h2>



<p>The Esports World Cup is the biggest modern event in competitive gaming. It boasts a collective prize pool worth tens of millions of dollars, and it plays host to the industry’s biggest games and most talented players. For many, it’s an immoral event seen as ‘esportswashing’ and nothing more, but for others, it’s a monumental thing that’s set to become a staple of the wider business.</p>



<p>In a recent release, it was revealed that VALORANT will appear alongside League and TFT at the Esports World Cup 2025. During 2024’s event, VALORANT didn’t appear, so this will be the first time that the game has a place at the EWC:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Riot Games has <strong>shaped the cultural impact of competitive gaming</strong>, transforming esports into a global entertainment force.&nbsp;With League of Legends’ iconic World Championship — which continues to set new standards for immersive experiences, Valorant’s cultural collaborations, and Teamfight Tactics’ community-driven events, Riot has pioneered an ecosystem far beyond the competition. </p>



<p>By bringing these titles to the Esports World Cup, we are not just celebrating elite gameplay — we are, together, expanding esports as a global entertainment movement, creating deeper connections with fans across gaming, music, and digital culture</p>



<p>– Fabian Scheuermann, Chief Games Officer at EWCF.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Riot Games representatives explained that last year was an evaluation of sorts, and that’s why VALORANT wasn’t one of the games to appear at the Esports World Cup in 2024. In a post, the team explained, <em>‘The feedback we got from players and teams who participated last year was positive. The event’s significant prize pool offered crucial financial support for them, providing stability at a time when many esports organizations were working toward a stronger future.’</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/iconic-mmo-new-class-1997-tibia-monk/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-iconic-mmo-is-getting-a-new-class-for-the-first-time-since-1997.1105560/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/iconic-mmo-new-class-1997-tibia-monk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’ve been playing Tibia since 2004 – but not <strong>consistently</strong>. I’ll dip in and out of the game around special events, but it remains my number one most-played game of all time simply because of how long I’ve been a user. Recently, Tibia’s developer, CipSoft, revealed that <span>the game is getting a ne</span>w character class –&nbsp;<strong>Monk </strong>– for the first time in almost thirty years.</p>



<p>Those familiar with Tibia’s four-class paradigm are about to have their worlds shattered.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-monk">Enter the Monk</h2>



<p>CipSoft has unveiled Monk, an all-new character class coming to Tibia later this year. This humble MMORPG was released in 1997 with four core character pillars: Knight, Sorcerer, Paladin, and Druid. That structure has remained fundamentally unchanged for almost thirty years – until now.</p>



<p>With a very short trailer posted online, the CipSoft team revealed the Monk character class:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tibia - Vocation Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMzXYOz6o7I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>This new Tibia vocation promises to be a capable hand-to-hand fighter that can use ‘mystical abilities’ to heal allies while pummeling enemies into dust. Here’s the full description of the new character type:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Monk</strong>&nbsp;will be a melee fighter capable of supporting and healing allies while using martial arts and mystical abilities to defeat enemies. The great truth seeker will have some very special features, such as&nbsp;<em>harmony</em>,<em>&nbsp;virtues</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>serene</em>.&nbsp;A&nbsp;<strong>Monk</strong>&nbsp;can be played in a very special way and, at the same time, is expected to integrate seamlessly into the Tibian world. In fact, one of our main goals was to ensure that the new vocation holds a unique position without undermining the value of others or rendering them obsolete.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From February 25, CipSoft will be holding player tests for the Monk class, and later this year, the vocation will be permanently added to Tibia, which is still going strong after 28 years on the market.</p>



<p>It’s incredible to see CipSoft pouring so much love into Tibia after all these years. It was only a couple of years ago that the developers decided to add sound to the game, implementing audio effects and a soundtrack alongside countless other updates. The core aesthetic of Tibia has remained unchanged since 1997, but the game is still evolving today.</p>



<p>To learn more about the new Monk class,  check out the full breakdown from CipSoft’s ‘Niadus’ <a href="https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=latestnews&amp;id=8215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the Tibia website</a>.</p>
