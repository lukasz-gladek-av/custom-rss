<p>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile’s minimum requirements will be increased to iOS 17/Android 13 or higher from November 14, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the latest <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1854249671994012087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a>, Warzone Mobile’s minimum specifications require devices with iOS 17/Android 13 or higher on a device with a GPU capable of bindless texturing. If players wish to receive updates and access to the latest game version for Season 1 and beyond, they must meet those requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All is not lost for Warzone Mobile players who don’t meet the minimum requirements. The developers have provided 6 months for players to transition to a new device. Players with older iOS and Android versions can play “version 3.10 for a limited time (approximately six months),” provided they were already on ver 3.10 before November 14.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warzone Mobile developers have stated that the minimum requirements had to be updated for future updates and integrations with the Call of Duty franchise. They are currently working to bring new shared features such as Omnimovement and connected content coming with BO6/WZ S1. </p>



<p>IPhone X and below do not support iOS 17; you will need an iPhone XS or higher to play the latest version of Warzone Mobile. For other queries, check out their <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-minimum-specifications-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ section</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Call of Duty Mobile has reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-mobile-one-billion-downloads-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one billion downloads worldwide</a>.

<p>Shift Up has just confirmed that Stellar Blade can take advantage of the PS5 Pro’s processing power. For those running the game on Sony’s latest iteration of the PlayStation 5, two new graphics presets can be found in the settings: Pro and Pro Max. Both of these prests introduce HFR, but Pro Max causes a noticeable frame rate drop.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-photo-mode-when">Photo Mode When?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1854524305813717406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media platforms</a>, Shift Up posted a comparison video showcasing the difference between PS5 and PS5 Pro Stellar Blade gameplay. It takes something of a trained eye to truly spot the difference, but it’s there – somewhere.</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/StellarBlade/status/1854524305813717406
</p></figure>







<p>Of course, in the comments under these posts, fans were quick to demand an ETA for photo mode, which was announced recently by Shift Up and is on the way. It doesn’t have a date for when it’s going to be added to the game, but it’s one of the most highly anticipated features that fans are holding out for.</p>



<p>It should have been present when the game was released, but who am I to judge?</p>



<p>The team also revealed recently that the game’s first major DLC is on the way. In September, the team at Shift Up announced a Stellar Blade x Nier Automata crossover that will ‘bring post-apocalyptic universes colliding together’. </p>



<p>In April, when Stellar Blade was released, it topped the charts and shifted a million copies in just a few weeks, which isn’t bad for a new IP. It’s encouraging to see that Shift Up has plans to deliver more content, and this PR5 Pro Max upgrade is only the beginning.</p>

<p>Take-Two has two big releases coming up next year, GTA 6 and Borderlands 4, and the CEO has just confirmed that both titles will not be released close to each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick stated that they would not release GTA 6 and Borderlands 4 in the same period, even though they have similar release windows. When asked about this, Zelnick stated, “I think it’s safe to say that we wouldn’t, and no one would, stack up huge releases unnecessarily.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that GTA 6 is scheduled to release in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall of 2025</a>, as confirmed during the latest earnings call, and Borderlands 4 has been announced for fiscal year 2026, which falls between April 1, 2025 and March 31, 2026. It is hard to figure out Take-Two’s release plans for both titles, but they could reserve 2025 for GTA 6 and let Borderlands 4 find its glory in 2026.&nbsp;We will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure. </p>



<p>In the same interview, Zelnick also acknowledged the Borderlands movie’s disappointing run; however, he added that<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-disappointing-but-helped-sell-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it helped sell more video games within the franchise</a>. Zelnick stated that they are still looking forward to more adaptations of their intellectual properties and have selectively licensed some of them. Currently, they have a deal pending on the ‘Bioshock’ adaptation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Red Dead Redemption series has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-series-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 92 million units</a>. Also, a new PGA Tour 2K title has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed for 2025</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-weapon-customization/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-weapon-customization-lets-you-add-a-shotgun-to-a-sniper-rifle.1029732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-weapon-customization/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Since the days of Army of Two, I’ve been a fan of weapon customization in video games. It’s satisfying to take a standard rifle or submachine gun, modify it to your liking, and make it a memorable weapon that remains with you throughout the story. In Stalker 2, weapon customization proves extensive, and you have many unique options—pistols, SMGs, sniper rifles, and even light machine guns.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-weapon-customization-like-in-stalker-2">What’s Weapon Customization Like in Stalker 2?</h2>



<p>Thanks to a recent gameplay trailer, ‘Smoking Barrels,’ we now better understand the weapon customization mechanics in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. It appears GSC Game World borrowed plenty from past titles, including the weapon upgrade menu and mechanic, which is genuinely nice to see return. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl - Exclusive Smoking Barrels Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NAz3_4uvG0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch above in its entirety, showcases several unique weapons found across the Zone, along with customization, upgrade mechanics, and even jam and maintenance gameplay. According to the studio, we must account for our weapon’s cleanliness, ballistics, physics, and even the ammunition type we bring to each encounter.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-stalker-2-weapons-that-we-know-so-far">All Stalker 2 Weapons That We Know So Far</h2>



<p>In all, there are 35 weapons in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, ranging from early-game handguns to late-game machine guns and launchers. You’ll likely wind up with a favorite. I have my eye on the OTs-02 Kiparis for close-range encounters and the AS VAL for everything else, but I know many will opt for the HK416 for its modularity and accuracy.</p>

<p>Life simulator inZOI is heading to Early Access. In a message on the game’s Discord server on Thursday, director and producer Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim announced that inZOI Early Access will launch on March 28, 2025.</p>



<p>The new date <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">moves the game</a> out of the original late-2024 Early Access timeline. </p>



<p>Kim started his message by thanking players for taking part in the Character Studio demo over the summer, and saying that the reception was more than he or the team could’ve expected. </p>



<p>“Seeing so much engagement brought us immense happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with inZOI,” he said. </p>



<p>When the Character Studio was available, over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-character-creator-shows-players-are-ready-for-sims-competitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19,000 concurrent players</a> created over 100,000 characters. With that response and feedback, it gave Kim and the studio the insight needed to provide players with “the most complete experience possible”.</p>



<p>“It’s said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings,” Kim said. “The extra love and care required to nurture a child to adulthood is how I see our journey with inZOI—a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. </p>



<p>“This change in our release date reflects our commitment to building a stronger foundation for inZOI, so we can embark on this journey in the best way possible.”</p>



<p>Kim closed by saying the team’s goal is to “deliver an experience fans can enjoy for a long time to come”.</p>



<p>Recently, Insider Gaming sat down with Kim&nbsp;to talk about inZOI about the game’s development, his goals, and more. Stay tuned for that in the near future.</p>

<p>You’ll play whatever is brand-new, launching alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 whenever the system finally releases, right? But what about past titles? I don’t know about you, but I have zero intention of tossing aside my old system or games, so I’d like to get additional playtime from them, even with a new console generation in hand. So, here are a few games you should play first on Nintendo Switch 2!</p>

<p>Following official confirmation that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-backwards-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 offers backward compatibility</a> for Nintendo Switch titles, I thought it would be fun to look at a few of the top games of the current generation. They’ll surely carry forward, with fun gameplay and adequate graphics, even though competition will be stiff with an entirely new series of launch games.</p>



<p>Here’s what Nintendo’s Furukawa said about the upcoming system:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is Furukawa. At today’s Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about the successor to Nintendo Switch, including its compatibility with Nintendo Switch, will be announced at a later date.</p>

<p>Since the idea here is to ensure all Nintendo Switch titles work on the Nintendo Switch 2, on day one, we’ll have a massive library of games to choose from, along with anything new coming out for the successor system. But instead of speculating about what’s to come, let’s look back toward the top games on the Nintendo Switch that you’ll want to play on Nintendo Switch 2:</p>

<li><strong>Stardew Valley</strong></li>



<li><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dragon Quest 11 S: Echoes of an Elusive Age</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hollow Knight</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong></li>

<p>Honestly? We could continue listing exceptional Nintendo Switch titles until the list hits the triple digits. But for now, these ten titles prove time-consuming and extraordinary in their own ways.</p>
