<p>Rockstar has yet to confirm a GTA 6 PC release date; however, Corsair’s CEO believes the game could arrive for the platform in early 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corsair’s CEO, Andy Paul, recently mentioned GTA 6’s PC release window during the company’s <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757670-corsair-gaming-inc-crsr-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2024 Q4 earnings call</a>. The developer first spoke about how enthusiasts are “lining up” to purchase components to support the newly released Blackwell 50 series GPUs. Their “gaming business has never looked so strong”, with GTA 6, “the most anticipated and hardware-demanding game”, on the horizon.</p>



<p>Paul then discussed GTA 6’s PC release window, stating that, according to his understanding, “it’s going to come out in the fall for console, and then early ’26 for PC.”&nbsp;The CEO mentioned this release window when asked if GTA 6 would be a game that could “spur purchases of either peripherals or components.”</p>



<p>Take-Two’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke about</a> GTA 6 not coming to PC, stating that it will first be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S and then branch out to other platforms. However, Zelnick added that he’s observed the PC platform become a “more and more important part of what used to be a console business.” He understands how big the market is, stating that PC versions of games can “result in up to 40% of a game’s total sales.”&nbsp;</p>
