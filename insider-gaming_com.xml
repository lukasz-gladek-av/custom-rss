<p>Our first look at Yoshi and Bowser Jr. from The Super Mario Galaxy Movie comes from, well, a grocery chain. The film, set to release April 3rd, 2026, has yet to get a full trailer, but the new listing may hint at it coming sooner than we thought.</p>



<p>Illumination and Universal Pictures went big with The Super Mario Bros. Movie back in 2022. The first film based on a Nintendo IP in decades, it became the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt6718170/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-grossing video game adaptation</a>&nbsp;of all time. A sequel was quickly greenlit and, earlier this year, was revealed to be called The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Story details were thin outside of using Super Mario Galaxy, but we now have some more content from an unlikely source: slice-and-bake cookies.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-look-at-yoshi-and-bowser-jr-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-leaked-online">First Look at Yoshi and Bowser Jr. from The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Leaked Online</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leak comes from an unlikely source: Tops Markets. The East Coast grocery chain put up a new listing for “Pillsbury The Super Mario Galaxy Shape Sugar Cookie Dough”. It’s still up, <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">linked here</a>, if you want to look at it, but it’s out of stock. On the box, we have the best look at Yoshi, who is at the end of The Super Mario Bros. Movie via a cracked sewer egg. His design differs a bit from his video-game counterpart with smoother texturing and flatter eyes. </p>



<p>On the back, there’s a fun little maze to fill out. We do get to see some of the worlds Mario and Yoshi will be traveling to, though it’s hard to tell if they come from Super Mario Galaxy or its sequel. However, one icon should be familiar to fans: Bowser Jr.’s graffiti tag. The character, the son of Bowser (played in-film by Jack Black), had yet to be revealed, so his inclusion here is all but confirming his appearance. </p>



<p>A trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to come out soon</a>, possibly with the upcoming Wicked: For Good film. With April 2026 almost here, marketing is set to start and, unfortunately for Nintendo, happened a bit too early. Regardless, we have yet to see Yoshi and Bowser Jr. in action, but it’s good to know some new faces are along for the intergalactic ride.</p>



<p>What do you think of Yoshi’s look in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie? Are you going to be picking up the Pillsbury cookies? When do you think the trailer will come out?

<p>Use these Roblox Get Stronger Every Second monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash, Strength, Multipliers and much more.</p>



<p>Get Stronger Every Second is a popular simulator game on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-blade-x-zombies-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> that requires players to get stronger and gain more health by managing their weight and defeating enemies. This, in turn, allows players to progress through the game by destroying the map, thereby enabling them to get ahead of the competition. Although there is more than one way to go about playing Get Stronger Every Second, one thing that all players must do in common is make use of codes to get their hands on free rewards. These rewards, which can be claimed through the ‘Shop’ tab within the game, could prove to be extremely beneficial, especially to newer players just starting their Roblox journey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a showdown that lived up to its billing as the ‘Telecom War,’ T1emerged victorious over KT Rolster in the 2025 League of Legends World Championship Grand Final, held in Chengdu, China. The best-of-five series went the distance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-prediction-grand-final-t1-vs-kt-rolster/">as I predicted</a>, with T1 edging out KT Rolster 3 – 2 in one of the most thrilling finals in recent memory.</p>



<p>This marks history for T1, securing the third consecutive League of Legends World Championship title, pushing Faker ever deeper into the annals of League esports.</p>



<h2 id="h-t1-and-kt-rolster-secure-record-breaking-viewership">T1 and KT Rolster Secure Record-Breaking Viewership</h2>



<p>The matchup between T1 and KT Rolster wasn’t just a battle for the Summoner’s Cup; it was a clash of legacy. It was T1 attempting to further cement its place as the most remarkable esports organization in the world, and KT Rolster’s desire to make a name for itself by winning its first LoL Worlds trophy.</p>



<p>While T1 entered the finals as the defending champion, aiming for a three-peat, KT Rolster had reached the GF of Worlds for the first time after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kt-rolster-shatter-worlds-2025-finals-first-time/">decimating Gen.G</a>.</p>



<p>The tournament shattered viewership records, with the final match drawing millions of fans worldwide. T1’s quarter-final against Anyone’s Legend peaked at a whopping 3.27 million viewers, which made up a massive chunk of the 90.3 million watch hours recorded across the entire event.</p>



<p>There’s a reason why League Worlds is considered the most valuable esports tournament in the world.</p>



<p>Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok has had a stellar year thus far, but this latest win propels him even further into the record books. Alongside his squad, he’s cemented himself as the undisputed GOAT of esports.</p>



<p>With this win, T1 not only secures their fourth overall Worlds title but also becomes the first team with three consecutive wins, a record that might <strong>never be beaten </strong>for as long as League of Legends exists.</p>
