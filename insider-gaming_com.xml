<p>2025 is already shaping up to be a massive year in video game releases, what with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Avowed, Civilization VII, and countless indie titles ranging from boomer shooters to real-time strategy hits. Despite the slew of new releases, many players continue returning to old favorites, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-beginners-guide-tips-and-tricks-for-new-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Counter-Strike 2</a>, which retains its massive population.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-games-everyone-plays">The Games Everyone Plays</h2>



<p>Sometimes, you don’t know what to play. It happens to all of us. Once we finally have some free time, we sit at our computers, staring at our Steam libraries, with no clue how to proceed. But if you want a multiplayer game with a massive community to immerse yourself in, these games continuously retain players monthly!</p>



<p>It’s important to note that these player numbers change frequently. You’ll find that looking at the charts one minute provides a very different result from within the next five minutes. That said, we can still focus on ballpark numbers to give us an idea of what everyone around the world is playing regularly, as the top most played games on Steam rarely change:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Counter-Strike 2</strong> – 1.4 Million</li>



<li><strong>PUBG: Battlegrounds</strong> – 707,500</li>



<li><strong>Dota 2</strong> – 702,000</li>



<li><strong>Marvel Rivals</strong> – 466,000</li>



<li><strong>Path of Exile 2</strong> – 290,000</li>



<li><strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong> – 194,000</li>



<li><strong>Naraka: Bladepoint</strong> – 178,000</li>



<li><strong>Rust </strong>– 179,000</li>



<li><strong>Wallpaper Engine</strong> – 134,000</li>



<li><strong>Palworld </strong>– 133,000</li>



<li><strong>Delta Force</strong> – 132,000</li>



<li><strong>Apex Legends</strong> – 125,000</li>



<li><strong>Stardew Valley</strong> 116,000</li>
</ul>

<p>A reliable leaker has claimed that Xbox is working on a Red Cipher Wireless Controller.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-nouvelle-manette-xbox-en-edition-speciale-bientot-disponible-59870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, Xbox’s next wireless controller is the Red Cipher, the latest instalment to the Cipher series. Previously, the manufacturers released the Sky Cipher and Ghost Cipher controllers. The Red Cipher announcement is expected to be announced in January 2025 and will be available only through the Microsoft store.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-red-cipher-controller-price-nbsp">Xbox Red Cipher Controller Price&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The exact release date for the Xbox Red Cipher controller is currently unknown. However, the pricing details have been revealed. The upcoming controller is expected to cost the same as the other controllers in the series, €69.99 / $69.99 / GBP 64.99.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from the pricing, we also know the colour palette for the Xbox Red Cipher Controller. The controller will feature a translucent design, similar to the Sky and Ghost instalments. The buttons will be bright red, and the back will be garnet red.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from the red controller, the report also mentioned the Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-be-bringing-haptic-motors-to-xbox-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sebile</a> controller, which was leaked through FTC documents some time ago. The controller is said to feature haptic feedback tech similar to Sony’s DualSense controllers, and <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/microsoft-patents-movable-haptic-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a> recently spotted a patent for it. However, no new information has been revealed about the Sebile controller.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-6-xbox-series-s-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB rating suggests</a> that Resident Evil 6 is coming to Xbox Series X/S. Also, a report claims that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-purchase-hasnt-helped-xbox-game-pass-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision’s purchase hasn’t helped</a> Xbox Game Pass.

<p>Marvel Snap developers are hard at work getting the game back online, and according to the latest developments, it may return within a day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Snap was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned</a> along with TikTok yesterday and is currently unavailable to play in the United States. The game was banned because the company that developed TikTok also owns Marvel Snap publisher Nuverse. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> spotted that the developers of Marvel Snap, Second Dinner recently took it to <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881154403333521795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> to reveal that they have been “working around the clock” to bring the game back and&nbsp;“hope to have it back online within 24 hours.”</p>



<p>Players who are missing out on content while waiting for Marvel Snap to return shouldn’t worry too much. The developers have <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881099521310269578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">assured</a> that they will compensate all players fairly for the lost time. They have also <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1881135534548107414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">advised</a> players unable to play Marvel Snap to check out content creators.</p>



<p>Currently, the game isn’t available on the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. If you try to log in to Marvel Rivals through any device in the United States, you are met with a message stating, “A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use Marvel Snap for now.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Avowed is a new IP from the big brains at Obsidian Entertainment. The ARPG is a diverse experience taking the best bits from action games and the depth of role-playing titles. It comes in a busy year for the company, so let’s check out Avowed’s release date, and where you can find the release.</p>



<p>Obsidian Entertainment is all hands on deck in 2025. The developer is preparing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2 sequel</a>—another ARPG—whereas Avowed takes on a more magical feel. It’s fresh, looks exciting, and it’s the sort of magical fun the world needs. Spells, weapons, swords, and axes are part and parcel of this jaw-dropping, semi-open-world release. </p>



<p>There are big expectations, and rightly so, and we’re here to see what Obsidian is cooking up for launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-avowed-s-release-date">When is Avowed’s Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The big, bad bear. Credit to Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Avowed launches on February 18, meaning the full release date is almost here.</strong></p>



<p>February and March are always a competitive period for gaming. Companies are keen to capitalize on the quieter January and post-Xmas lull. If you check your calendar, you’ll notice Avowed is only a few days after Valentine’s Day, making it a perfect late present. </p>



<p>Keep the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-confirmed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed release date</a> in mind if you need gift ideas!</p>



<h2 id="h-avowed-release-time">Avowed Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>Avowed doesn’t have a special launch time yet, meaning a midnight launch is likely.</strong></p>



<p>Very few games come with unique launch windows. Avowed also looks to be heading this way—unless Obsidian intervenes and ruins my theory—so you can ready yourself for midnight in your region. </p>



<p>New Zealand users get their usual benefit of first access due to the time difference. Make sure to keep off of social media until Avowed is installed and ready to go on your format.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-avowed-platforms">All Avowed Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox Series X|S and PC are the only platforms you can find Avowed for now.</strong></p>



<p>Avowed is published by Xbox Game Studios, meaning it’s a <strong>Microsoft-exclusive title</strong>. So bizarre is the gaming landscape in 2025 that I wouldn’t rule out Avowed coming to PS5. Exclusivity means a lot less than it used to—with Sony publishing exclusive games on PC too—and the PlayStation and Xbox crossover is only getting stronger.</p>



<p>Reports are abound that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellblade 2 and Gears of War are coming to PS5</a>. There are rumors about Halo dropping too. If this is all possible, an Avowed PlayStation port doesn’t seem beyond the realms of possibility.</p>



<hr>



<p>Does Avowed catch your eye in 2025? Or is it a standalone interest, is The Outer Worlds 2 also sending you to space? Let us know your thoughts on both games.</p>

<p>Netease’s latest hero-shooter, Marvel Rivals, has managed to wow fans worldwide in a very short time, so much so that it is receiving a comic book adaptation by Marvel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is an original story woven by the game’s developers to create this hero-shooter. After seeing the numbers it has pulled off, Marvel has decided to adopt the game’s narrative in a comic book. Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-infinity-comic-physical-print-release-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, a new <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/new-marvel-rivals-comic-book-spins-out-of-the-hit-video-game-sensation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on the Marvel website revealed that “MARVEL RIVALS #1, a special one-shot inspired by the game’s story,” is set to arrive in April 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Marvel Rivals comic book is written by Paul Allor and drawn by Luca Claretti. The comic will receive “all six issues of Marvel Unlimited’s Marvel Rivals Infinity Comic in print for the first time.” Players can grab a digital copy of the comic through the Marvel Unlimited App or purchase a physical copy from their local comic book store when it arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the story of Marvel Rivals #1 comic book, the events are set in Tokyo 2099, where a time rift has hampered the Web of Life and Destiny. Two groups have been formed with their own opinions on solving the problem. The first group is led by Peni Parker, who wishes to plug the Web into Cyberspace, and the second group is led by Spider-Man, who wants to use Chronovium to strengthen the Web so that it repairs itself.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals #1 comic book series will take us through “an epic battle between two squads” composed of characters from the game’s original roster. This means we will see heavy hitters like Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Jeff the Land Shark, Peni Parker, and more battle it out.&nbsp;Which group do you think will emerge victorious in this battle?</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals could receive a ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-red-hulk-mystery-skin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mystery skin</a>‘ to celebrate Captain America: Brave New World’s release. Also, the developers have issued a warning for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-issues-warning-for-keyboard-and-mouse-adapters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keyboard and mouse adapters</a>.
