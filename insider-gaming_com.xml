<p>Fortnite has a bunch of enjoyable modes and is regularly adding more, some of which prove to be extremely popular. Delulu certainly falls into that category, and we’ve got the full schedule of the mode.</p>



<p>Delulu mode in Fortnite introduced proximity chat to the game, leading to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-proximity-chat-led-to-thousands-banned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thousands being banned</a> over the first weekend of the mode, but those who have behaved have been able to enjoy a unique approach to Fortnite that allows for mid-game alliances and betrayals.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering when you can next dive into Delulu in Fortnite, take a peek at the full schedule. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-delulu-still-in-fortnite">Is Delulu Still in Fortnite?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes, the Delulu mode is still available in Fortnite for a limited time, though the doors are not open 24/7.</strong></p>



<p>The mode was initially planned to be a limited-time mode, but has proven to be extremely popular and has been extended significantly. In fact, we know that the Delulu mode will be available until the end of 2025.</p>



<p>That is significant as Chapter 7 in Fortnite is due to kick-off in early December, so confirmation that the mode will be available for at least the first month after that huge update suggests Delulu could be a long-term addition.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-delulu-fortnite-schedule">Full Delulu Fortnite Schedule</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite Delulu will be available every weekend until the end of 2025, starting at 6 AM PT on Friday and ending at 6 AM PT on Monday.</strong></p>



<p>Outside of these times, Delulu will not be available in Fortnite, so you’ll have to wait until the weekend calls to dive into the mode.</p>



<p>The table below shows the full Delulu schedule until the end of 2025.</p>

<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger has plenty to keep you occupied in the hunt to boast full completion, with an extensive trophy list and achievements to hunt down.</p>



<p>The Bandai Namco title arrived to mark the start of a huge period for fans of the creature-catching genre, landing ahead of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and there’s more than enough to digest—including mulling over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-personality-guide-all-personalities-stat-boosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which Personality is best for each Digimon</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re planning to tick off every task in the achievement and trophy list in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, we’ve got the full to-do list for you.</p>

<p><strong>The trophy and achievement list in Digimon Story: Time Stranger has plenty to keep you occupied, with rewards for story progression and completing specific tasks.</strong></p>



<p>Many of the achievements and trophies that are not hidden are unlocked through generic progression, which should be unlocked with ease by just playing through the game. However, there are tasks to train on the Digifarm a specific number of times and to spend YEN in shops.</p>



<p>A full list of the Digimon Story: Time Stranger trophies and achievements are below, with the hidden tasks separated later in this article.</p>

<p><strong>There are 46 achievements and trophies to unlock in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, including the illustrious Platinum trophy for obtaining all other trophies.</strong></p>



<p>That task is still present for those on Xbox, though it awards zero Gamerscore and is merely the mark of a completionist. As usual, Xbox players have 1,000 total Gamerscore to hunt down.</p>



<p>Additional trophies and achievements could arrive in post-launch content, with the Season Pass offering plenty of DLC in the first year of the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/baby-steps-secret-cutscene-game-of-thrones-naughty-dog/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps%E2%80%99-secret-28-minute-cutscene-bizarrely-mentions-game-of-thrones-naughty-dog-and-bagels.1318228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans of the recently released Baby Steps have been humoured by the surfacing of a nearly 30-minute cutscene in the game that’s only unlocked after ticking some major boxes. If you skip every cutscene in the game (which is no simple feat), you’ll unlock a secret cutscene that runs for a whopping 28 minutes, but it’s <strong>bizarre</strong>.</p>



<p>The secret Baby Steps cutscene is simply the game’s two lead actors (and developers), Gabe Cuzzillo and Bennett Foddy, sitting outside a log cabin and chatting about their real lives, including Game of Thrones rewatches, bagel fillings, and Naughty Dog’s games.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-miss-uncharted-i-wish-they-d-bring-it-back">‘I Miss Uncharted, I Wish They’d Bring it Back’</h2>



<p>In a video uploaded to YouTube, one creator uncovered the full, secret cutscene in Baby Steps, which comes in at a staggering 28 minutes and is seen by some as a ‘punishment’ for skipping every cutscene in the game.</p>



<p>That’s how you unlock the secret cutscene – you have to skip <strong>everything </strong>that comes before.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Baby steps - Secret cutscene found" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQahQACsvPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s a mildly motion-capped sequence that sees Nate (Gabe Cuzzillo) and Moose (Bennett Foddy) sitting outside a log cabin and chinwagging about life, pulling away from Baby Steps entirely, and gassing about all manner of things.</p>



<p>They test the limits of their motion capture equipment, rib the player for skipping cutscenes, and determine whether or not they should take a nap while being filmed.</p>



<p>At one point, they dive into the topic of Naughty Dog:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foddy: </strong>I miss Uncharted, I wish they’d bring it back.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>It has been a while.</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> I don’t think they’re going to do another new one.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>That new one looks alright.</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> Which one? The ‘space Uncharted’?</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>Yeah, that one looks good. I’m going to play that.</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> I’m not going to skip any of those cutscenes.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>You see how they put her jacket on, that’s insane!</p>



<p><strong>Foddy:</strong> People don’t know what’s involved in that.</p>



<p><strong>Cuzzillo: </strong>That’s the most impressive thing I’ve seen in my life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The pair go on to talk about putting broccoli in bagels, what else they had for lunch, and how Foddy’s Game of Thrones rewatch is going on, with Cuzzillo slipping in some casual spoilers for the viewers.</p>



<p>They even take a sidestep into talking about famous clowns, including Pennywise, The Joker, and Ronald McDonald.</p>



<p>As the segment unravels, the two actors discuss whether or not the player has skipped <strong>this </strong>cutscene before stressing that they need to use the bathroom and they can’t leave until things have played out to an undetermined end.</p>



<p>It ends with them ‘going to find the credits guy’ to get them rolling, suggesting that they’d ‘rough him up’ to bring in the end of the game. </p>



<p>This is probably one of the best secret cutscenes ever seen in a game, and it really humanized the actors quite nicely. Let me know if you already found this cutscene over on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision has unveiled a poster for this year’s iteration of The Haunting, the annual Halloween-themed event that hits the Call of Duty platform every October. This time around, players will come face-to-face with Predator.</p>



<p>The first news regarding this year’s The Haunting event was featured in a blog post published yesterday on the Call of Duty site. It was mentioned that The Haunting lands with the final season of Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone, and that <strong>all</strong> studio partners have weighed in on the event in some capacity.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-happening-with-the-haunting-this-year">What’s Happening with The Haunting This Year?</h2>



<p>The recent <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty blog post</a> didn’t do much to clear up what’s coming in The Haunting 2025:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Haunting will return with Season 06 of Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone, and we (including all our studio partners) have some Halloween fun just around the corner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>All we know is that The Haunting starts this week, on October 9th. It arrives as the Black Ops 7 beta comes to an end, marking the closure of a divisive, debate-laden trial period that has produced mixed feelings about this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>Here’s the post (and poster) that was uploaded to social media by Activision:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Shortly after announcing The Haunting 2025 with the poster, the Call of Duty team responded ‘ok’ <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1975327267858293053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a post</a> from September 2023 requesting that Activision add a Predator skin to the game. It was a strange throwback, but perhaps it reveals how long the team has been considering this idea.</p>



<p>Last year’s The Haunting event ran between September and October and introduced Mike Myers, a character tied to the Call of Duty series, in a rather nostalgic way (IYKYK). Activision’s studios prepared spooky map variants, new modes including Zombie Royale and Hordepoint, and a fresh reward path for those participating in the event.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that The Haunting 2025 will be a similar affair.</p>

<p>The announcement for PowerWash Simulator 2’s release date was slated to drop this week, but in an early trailer upload, the beans have been spilled. It has been three years since the first PowerWash Simulator game dropped, entertaining gamers everywhere and allowing them to clean everything from skateparks to carnival rides, and from trains to planes, with high-powered power washers.</p>



<p>The trailer has since been removed from YouTube, but not before eagle-eyed gamers were able to capture the release date for PowerWash Simulator 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-powerwash-simulator-2-coming-out">When is PowerWash Simulator 2 Coming Out?</h2>



<p>In the leaked trailer (which no longer exists), <strong>it was revealed that PowerWash Simulator 2 is coming out on October 26</strong>.</p>



<p>Early impressions of PowerWash Simulator 2 have been positive, even if it’s understandably tough to improve upon such a simple concept. In PowerWash Simulator 2, you’re still cleaning things with power washers and utilizing an array of attachments and cleaning liquids, but previews have remarked on how ‘different’ it manages to feel.</p>



<p>The news regarding the leaked trailer was published on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nzlvtg/powerwash_simulator_2_release_date_trailer_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, with one user sharing the link to the now removed release date trailer for PowerWash Simulator 2. Using an archive platform simply reveals that the video now sits in a private state, ready to go live soon.</p>



<p>In the comments under the original post on Reddit, fans of the original PowerWash Simulator game were raving about how good it was. There are recollections of users pouring over 100 hours into the game, spraying endlessly, and cleaning dirt from surfaces in a game that’s pure relaxation and satisfaction.</p>



<p>Many have dubbed it an incoming Game of the Year contender, but that’s tongue-in-cheek at best.</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is getting the cross-generational treatment, releasing on both the Nintendo Switch 1 and the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Sure, most people are going to focus on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-starters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s starters</a> or the new mega evolutions, but, as with many other Switch games, the performance is going to matter.</p>



<p>Here is a breakdown of the Switch 1 and Switch 2 performance differences in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and which version you should consider buying.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-different-in-pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-1-and-switch-2">What’s Different in Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Switch 2 gives a smoother experience. Image by Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The difference in the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions is purely based on performance. The Switch 2 version has a better framerate and resolution. Outside of that, both versions have the same content.</strong></p>



<p>On the original Switch, games like Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were criticized a lot for the performance issues both had. Luckily, the Switch 2 is more powerful, and that power allows Game Freak to get more out of their game with the new hardware.</p>







<p><strong>The version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A you should buy comes down to your situation</strong>.</p>



<p>Obviously, if you only own a Switch 1 and have not upgraded to a Switch 2, you should buy the Switch 1 version. However, it’s not a full guarantee that you should go with the upgraded version if you have the newer console.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is backwards compatible with many Switch 1 games, and this includes Pokémon Legends: Z-A. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-pokemon-legends-z-a-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The cost of the game</a> is $10 more expensive on the Switch 2 for that bump in performance. If you need to save money, you are fully capable of buying the Switch 1 version and then <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-upgrade-pack-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">upgrading later in the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>



<p>While the Switch 2 version does have the performance enhancements over the Switch 1, some people might not tell a drastic difference between the two. We are sure the difference is notable when shown side by side, but that isn’t as applicable when you only see one version.</p>



<p>To sum it up, if you are a Switch 2 owner, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-exclusive-platform-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 version</a> will give you the best performance. However, if you are in a spot where you need to save a little money, buying the Switch 1 version will still give you the full Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, with maybe a negligible performance difference when played on a Switch 2.</p>
