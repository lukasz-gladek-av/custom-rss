<p>Team Vitality are the champions of IEM Katowice 2025, after upsetting top-ranked Team Spirit in a surprising 3-0 fashion in the grand final. Vitality claims their first big trophy since IEM Cologne 2024, and their first since signing former FaZe star Robin “ropz” Kool.</p>

<p>Vitality came out firing, stealing away Spirit’s first map pick of Dust2. Robin “ropz” Kool had easily his best map since joining the team, notching 26 kills against only 9 deaths, and dominating on the T-side in the second half. On Nuke, it was the legend Mathieu “ZywOo” Herbaut who stepped up, delivering 26 kills against only 6 deaths, while rarely using the AWP he was once synonymous with.</p>



<p>On Mirage, Vitality went into half-time with the lead for a third straight map. Spirit lost their sixth pistol round to kick off the second half, having failed to win a single pistol round all series. Trailing 11-4 and with their backs against the wall, Spirit finally showed some life in the second half, stringing together 7 straight rounds to tie it. Vitality finally got to 12 thanks to Shahar “flameZ” Shushan, and he opened the kills again in the pivotal final round of regulation to secure the map, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/matches/2378917/vitality-vs-spirit-iem-katowice-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the series</a>, and the trophy.</p>



<p>For Vitality, this represents the first time that the organization has lifted the trophy in Katowice in more than half a dozen tries. The team’s leader Dan “apEX” Madesclaire had never won in Katowice in the tournament’s 11 year history until today. ZywOo also ties the legendary Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev for most tournament MVP awards with 21.</p>



<p>Is Vitality the new favorite to lift the trophy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the next Major</a>?
