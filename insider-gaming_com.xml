<p>Use these Roblox Get Stronger Every Second monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash, Strength, Multipliers and much more.</p>



<p>Get Stronger Every Second is a popular simulator game on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-blade-x-zombies-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> that requires players to get stronger and gain more health by managing their weight and defeating enemies. This, in turn, allows players to progress through the game by destroying the map, thereby enabling them to get ahead of the competition. Although there is more than one way to go about playing Get Stronger Every Second, one thing that all players must do in common is make use of codes to get their hands on free rewards. These rewards, which can be claimed through the ‘Shop’ tab within the game, could prove to be extremely beneficial, especially to newer players just starting their Roblox journey.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a showdown that lived up to its billing as the ‘Telecom War,’ T1emerged victorious over KT Rolster in the 2025 League of Legends World Championship Grand Final, held in Chengdu, China. The best-of-five series went the distance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-prediction-grand-final-t1-vs-kt-rolster/">as I predicted</a>, with T1 edging out KT Rolster 3 – 2 in one of the most thrilling finals in recent memory.</p>



<p>This marks history for T1, securing the third consecutive League of Legends World Championship title, pushing Faker ever deeper into the annals of League esports.</p>



<h2 id="h-t1-and-kt-rolster-secure-record-breaking-viewership">T1 and KT Rolster Secure Record-Breaking Viewership</h2>



<p>The matchup between T1 and KT Rolster wasn’t just a battle for the Summoner’s Cup; it was a clash of legacy. It was T1 attempting to further cement its place as the most remarkable esports organization in the world, and KT Rolster’s desire to make a name for itself by winning its first LoL Worlds trophy.</p>



<p>While T1 entered the finals as the defending champion, aiming for a three-peat, KT Rolster had reached the GF of Worlds for the first time after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kt-rolster-shatter-worlds-2025-finals-first-time/">decimating Gen.G</a>.</p>



<p>The tournament shattered viewership records, with the final match drawing millions of fans worldwide. T1’s quarter-final against Anyone’s Legend peaked at a whopping 3.27 million viewers, which made up a massive chunk of the 90.3 million watch hours recorded across the entire event.</p>



<p>There’s a reason why League Worlds is considered the most valuable esports tournament in the world.</p>



<p>Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok has had a stellar year thus far, but this latest win propels him even further into the record books. Alongside his squad, he’s cemented himself as the undisputed GOAT of esports.</p>



<p>With this win, T1 not only secures their fourth overall Worlds title but also becomes the first team with three consecutive wins, a record that might <strong>never be beaten </strong>for as long as League of Legends exists.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-return-dying-light-2-updates-community-what-next/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/techland-returns-to-dying-light-2-updates-and-asks-the-community-what%E2%80%99s-next.1348051/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Now that Dying Light: The Beast has been on the market for several weeks, Techland has reorganized its developers and intends to get back on the Dying Light 2: Stay Human train. In a post on social media, franchise director Tymon Smektala asked the community what it would like to see prioritized in the coming months, suggesting that at least half a year of content is planned.</p>



<p>This was always on the cards, as Techland stressed that Dying Light: The Beast represented an important stopgap in the ongoing support of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, the live-service title that debuted in 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-dying-light-2-stay-human">What’s Next for Dying Light 2: Stay Human?</h2>



<p>The post on social media published by Techland’s franchise director of Dying Light has exciting implications for Dying Light 2: Stay Human, the live-service, open-world zombie apocalypse title that dropped in 2022.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As The Beast was released we can now move more people to support DL2:SH as promised. What are the most important things we should handle? What kind of content/updates/fixes you’d expect right<br>now or in 3-6 months?</p>— Tymon Smektała (@smektalaTM) <a href="https://twitter.com/smektalaTM/status/1987249247402578122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In a community-led decision, Techland has opted to have fans decide what comes next, with Smektala reaching out to the players to see what they’d like prioritized. Techland has always been focused on the community with Dying Light, and hosts a submissions function on the game’s themed website that users can lean on to make their requests and wishes heard.</p>



<p>The Dying Light series has plenty left in the tank. Following the launch of Dying Light: The Beast, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-dying-light-3/">a new era of sorts was established</a>, and the game’s ending directly links to future projects that can easily be predicted. With a universe that still has plenty to give, there’s no telling where the road will eventually take Dying Light.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-9-882/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-882-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-sunday-november-9.1348039/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another week comes to a close, and I’m hopeful that your NYT Connections streak has kept up for the duration. I’m also optimistic that I’ve <strong>helped you </strong>maintain that streak by providing you with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions all week long. If you want more of that today, read on.</p>



<p>Today’s NYT Connections tips and solutions are waiting just below.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-9">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 9)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #882:</p>



<ul>
<li>NOODLE</li>



<li>BRUSH</li>



<li>CRANIUM</li>



<li>MIRROR</li>



<li>PUFNSTUF</li>



<li>REFLECT</li>



<li>TIGHT</li>



<li>MUSE</li>



<li>COMPACT</li>



<li>LUNAR</li>



<li>NAIL FILE</li>



<li>THICK</li>



<li>DENSE</li>



<li>DELIBERATE</li>



<li>CRONUT</li>



<li>TWEEZERS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think beauty tools or grooming essentials you might stash in a makeup bag or bathroom drawer.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These words all describe things that are tightly arranged, thickly clustered, or densely filled</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each of these verbs evokes contemplation, pondering, or mental wandering—perfect for a philosophical mood.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>This group blends real and invented terms that share a playful, oddball vibe—some are names, some are snacks, some are just fun to say.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 9.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-9-882">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 9 (#882)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BRUSH, MIRROR, NAIL FILE, TWEEZERS</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COMPACT, DENSE, THICK, TIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – DELIBERATE, MUSE, NOODLE, REFLECT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CRANIUM, CRONUT, LUNAR, PUFNSTUF</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to take the world by storm, this time generating a new all-time high peak player count record on Steam more than a week after release. It’s proving to be the most sensational title to hit the market in years, and everyone from casual gamers to hardcore extraction shooter fans is getting involved.</p>



<p>On Steam, ARC Raiders just hit 416,517 concurrent players, up from the recent high of 354,000. It’s indicative of something remarkable, as ten days into the game’s lifecycle, it’s bucking trends and continuing to soar.</p>







<p>In the numbers, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/">the reviews</a>, and the ratings, ARC Raiders is the most popular extraction shooter ever made. The sentiment surrounding this game is enough to throw the likes of Escape from Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown, Arena Breakout: Infinite, and Delta Force out the window entirely.</p>



<p>People are soaking up every element of ARC Raiders, from the aesthetic that’s dripping in retro-futurism to the social mechanics that are making ARC Raiders a joy to explore.</p>



<p>On Steam, ARC Raiders just hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-hit-new-peak-player-count-broke-servers/">another all-time high</a> peak concurrent user count, which is rare considering the game has been out for <strong>ten days</strong>. In most cases, games start to inevitably ebb in terms of player count at this point, but ARC Raiders is <strong>evolving</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>What’s more impressive is that it’s only getting better. Embark Studios has lined up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-2025-roadmap/">a roadmap of content</a> and upgrades that it’ll drip feed into ARC Raiders, and the team wants to support the ambitious extraction shooter for a whopping <strong>ten years</strong>.</p>



<p>Things could take a bit of a dip this coming week, as Escape from Tarkov, arguably the most prolific spearhead extraction shooter ever made, finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">hits a 1.0 release</a> and emerges on new platforms, namely Steam. If anything can poach players from ARC Raiders, it’ll be that, so it’ll be interesting to see what loyalty ARC players have stumped up in the short term.</p>
