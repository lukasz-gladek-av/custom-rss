            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A small content creator by the name of EvenBadWolves Gaming (real name Elizabeth McAulay) has decided that she will be suing a much larger content creator by the name of InkSlasher for allegedly stealing her content. </p>



<p>In her video, which she uploaded to her YouTube channel, EvenBadWolves Gaming, she releases a side-by-side comparison of both her video and InkSlasher’s, of which she claims over 30 minutes of InkSlasher’s 43-minute video is directly ripped from her video. The side-by-side comparisons show duplicate footage and the same editing style, and, in some cases, the same watermarks.</p>







<p>According to McAulay, her original video took 200 hours to create, so seeing the majority of her content stolen is understandably frustrating. As she explains, such issues are typically swept under the rug by YouTube because of its copyright policies, where counter-notifications make it nearly impossible for smaller creators to obtain justification for their content being stolen.</p>



<p>However, McAulay is a real lawyer, and as such, she has decided to sue InkFlasher for stealing her content. McAulay says she has submitted her case to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia over copyright infringement.</p>



<p>Of course, McAulay says that taking someone to court isn’t cheap, and she was quoted up to $135,000 Australian for the case. <span>McAulay currently has a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-big-youtuber-stole-my-video-im-fighting-back" target="_blank">GoFundMe setup</a>&nbsp;to try to</span> raise some of the funds for her case, for which she is seeking $50,000 AUD. Alternatively, you can watch EvenBadWolves Gaming’s video below to help support her.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Since the video was uploaded to YouTube, InkSlasher’s video has mysteriously disappeared from YouTube, and he’s seemingly avoiding discussing the allegations as anything said will likely be used against him in court.</p>







<p>What do you think of EvenBadWolves Gaming case? Do you think she will be successful in taking InkSlasher to court?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Leon Kennedy has overshadowed all of Resident Evil Requiem’s development so far, as fans are more fixated on the long-term hero either making an appearance or being a playable character. It’s no longer a vocal minority, and Resident Evil Requiem’s producer has commented on the rumors.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline game in the horror series. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-has-a-third-person-camera-because-resident-evil-7-was-too-scary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 7 Was “Scary,”</a> and Resident Evil 8 did a great job of making a quiet village terrifying. Resident Evil Requiem takes us back to Raccoon City, and everyone wants to know if Leon Kennedy will be there.</p>







<h2 id="h-could-leon-kennedy-be-in-resident-evil-requiem">Could Leon Kennedy Be In Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>He has to be, right? Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stevivor</a>, Resident Evil Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa opened up on the upcoming sequel. </p>



<p>It should be noted that Kumazawa’s responses were translated via an interpreter. While we don’t discredit the translator, there’s always the possibility that something was lost in translation. But when asked about the future of Leon Kennedy and the rumors that he might be in Resident Evil Requiem, Kumazawa had a simple response:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Apart from any official information that Capcom has released, the rest is more detective work [on the part of players]. So I would suggest to please not take everything at face value. Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don’t know what’s right or what’s wrong. It’s just that players are free to believe what they would like to believe; what I’d like to tell is that, please, unless it’s officially released from Capcom, we can’t give you any confirmation. There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eye patch, and just basically saying there’s a DLC or a new costume for Leon — but just to make sure, these are all fake news.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Firstly, at no point did Kumazawa outright say Leon isn’t in the game. He merely stated that speculation is speculation, and AI could be responsible for the leaks. On the other hand, this is the most PR-appropriate answer he could’ve given.</p>







<p>Of course, he’s not going to say if Leon is in RE9 and ruin the surprise. <strong>However, he could certainly shut down any suggestions, and he didn’t outright</strong>. Fake news doesn’t mean no, and how many times have we seen or heard a dev say something isn’t happening, knowing full well it is?</p>



<p>You only have to look at Summer Game Fest 2025, where Capcom fooled everyone by teasing us with future RE9 news, before unveiling the game at the end of the show to fake everyone out!</p>



<p>With news of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-skin-spotted-on-playstation-portugal-pre-order-page/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Leon Skin Being Spotted On The PlayStation Portugal Pre-Order Page</a>, all signs point toward the legendary character being involved one way or another.</p>



<p>We’ll keep monitoring the situation and checking the latest RE9 leaks. DO you think Leon will be in Resident Evil Requiem?

<p>Rockstar Games sent the world into overdrive two years ago with the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1. It has amassed countless views, and now it’s been claimed that it’s risen to the top as the number one YouTube trailer without ads.</p>



<p>One day, many from now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> will release. It will be a glorious day, everyone will rejoice in the game’s outrageous content and over-the-top violence, and appreciate that Rockstar Games spent a lot of time crafting a probable masterpiece. The most recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 delay</a> hurts, yes, but we’ll look back on the journey with newfound fondness—particularly Trailer 1.</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 set the wheels in motion, and it continues to be watched worldwide.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The day and nightlife. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Evidence shows that Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 has recently passed 269 million views (and counting) on YouTube, making it allegedly the number one YouTube trailer of all time <strong>without ads</strong>.</p>



<p>We have to emphasize this as there are a small handful of worldwide trailers that eclipse this, but do feature YouTube ads. It’s an incredible feat as Rockstar Games could quite easily have monetized this trailer, and still landed themselves a nice, hefty chunk of revenue.</p>



<p>The video also has over 1 million comments! Trailer 2 isn’t doing too badly either, sitting at just under 150 million views at the time of writing.</p>



<p>With another year to go until Grand Theft Auto 6, we’ll keep rewatching Trailer 1 (and Trailer 3), await Trailer 3, and hope for a full gameplay reveal or walkthrough sooner rather than later.</p>
