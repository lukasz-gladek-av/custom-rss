<p>ARC Raiders Update 1.11.0 patch notes reveal that Stella Montis is going to get even more intense as lighting has been lowered in several areas. </p>



<p>Embark Studios has several announcements for ARC Raiders players today. We were informed earlier that the game has surpassed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-is-offering-a-free-gift-for-crossing-12-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 million copies sold</a>, and they are providing the community with a free gift to celebrate. Now, new patch notes reveal nerfs to certain items as well as other changes to their PvP-heavy map. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-arc-raiders-update-1-11-0-stella-montis-lighting-change-kettle-and-trigger-nade-nerfs">What’s New in ARC Raiders Update 1.11.0? Stella Montis Lighting Change, Kettle and Trigger Nade Nerfs</h2>



<p>Starting with the biggest one, right at the very bottom of the ARC Raiders Update 1.11.0 patch notes, players will see that a new change will be taking place in Stella Montis Night Raid. Stella Montis was already a PvP-heavy map with low lighting and angry Raiders thirsty for blood. Now, the lighting has been reduced in some areas, making the use of flashlights and listening even more essential. The change could lead to more sneaky tactics, such as camping in the dark and ambushing opponents. </p>



<p>Moreover, the Kettle’s fire rate has been reduced from 600 to 450, as the previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using Macros. The Trigger ‘Nade has been nerfed as well, as it was dominating PvP encounters and players were preferring it over the other grenades. The nerf will reduce its use as a “trigger-in-air” grenade while retaining its use as a sticky bomb, with the delay being increased from 0.7 seconds to 1.5 seconds. Lastly, a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them has been fixed.  </p>



<h2 id="h-complete-arc-raiders-update-1-11-0-patch-notes">Complete ARC Raiders Update 1.11.0 Patch Notes </h2>



<ul>
<li>Kettle
<ul>
<li>Dev note: Reduced fire rate from 600 to 450. The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favours using 3rd party software.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Trigger ‘Nade
<ul>
<li>Dev note: Trigger ‘Nade currently dominates PVP encounters, and players favour picking it over all our other grenades. This nerf aims to make it less usable as a “trigger-in-air” grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb. Damage falloff has been rebalanced to concentrate the damage closer to the center of the explosion, and deal less damage further away. The delay between triggering the grenade and it detonating, has been increased from 0.7s to 1.5s, giving players more time to react, and making it harder to time the detonation in air.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them.</li>



<li>Lighting has been lowered in some areas on Stella Montis Night Raid making flashlights and listening more relevant.</li>
</ul>

<p>ARC Raiders just keeps on growing, hitting a new milestone in 2026 of over 12 million copies sold, and the devs are offering a free gift to players to celebrate the occasion. </p>



<p>Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders is definitely one of the most popular releases in 2025, and is still going strong into the new year. The player base also includes a dedicated bunch, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/one-million-arc-raiders-players-wiped-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 million completing their first Expedition Project</a>. Now, you can grab a free gift for helping the game reach this milestone. </p>











<p>As revealed through the official ARC Raiders <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2010985172632797620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the developers have confirmed that they have seen “over 12 million Raiders ascend from Speranza to raid the Rust Belt.” The dev team had crafted a special gift to celebrate hitting 10 million players, and this free thank-you gift is a Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool. Any player who has logged in since launch until January 13, 23:59 CET, will receive this gift once the latest update is released. </p>



<p>Since its release, ARC Raiders has slowly and steadily cemented its position as one of the best extraction shooters ever released. <span>Last week, a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank">sales estimate</a>&nbsp;for the</span> game was released, stating that the title had already surpassed 12 million units across Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox. This seemingly helped Embark Studios rake in a whopping $350 million and reach a daily active user count of 3.2 million. </p>







<p>In other news, ARC Raiders players are complaining about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bans-false-block-banned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">false account blocks and bans</a>. Additionally, we recently caught a glimpse of what ARC Raiders might have looked like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-first-person-works-well-new-clip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if it were a first-person shooter</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Fired Rockstar Devs Denied Pay While Legal Battle Goes On]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-devs-denied-pay-legal-battle/</link>
            <guid>1404184</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new report, it has been revealed that a UK judge has outright <strong>denied </strong>the 31 fired Rockstar employees interim pay while they tussle with the firm and Take-Two over what they claim was an unfair dismissal. Last year, 31 employees in the United Kingdom were fired from Rockstar Games in one sweep, with the gaming titan claiming that they were leaking confidential information.</p>



<p>Following the sweep, it emerged that Rockstar may have been fighting back against unionization, targeting employees who joined the IWGB union in the United Kingdom. Rockstar has categorically denied these claims.</p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-s-dismissed-devs-won-t-get-pay">Rockstar’s Dismissed Devs Won’t Get Pay</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/fired-rockstar-employees-denied-pay-by-uk-judge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a>, it was stated that the UK’s Judge Frances Eccles had <strong>denied </strong>a plea for interim pay for the 31 former Rockstar Games developers. This interim pay would have allowed these employees to jump back on the company’s payroll while the situation with the mass dismissal was being handled through legal channels.</p>



<p>It was stated by the judge that the fired employees could not demonstrate their case enough to have a ‘pretty good chance of success’ at proving they were dismissed in a union-busting effort.</p>



<p>The judge wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>In all the circumstances, the tribunal was unable to conclude that it appears likely that the tribunal will find that the principal reason for the claimants’ dismissal was their membership of the IWGB</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that it’s <strong>unlikely </strong>that the dismissed employees will have the court weigh in their favor over the union-busting allegations. It’s another angle of support for Rockstar’s suggestion that the employees were leaking confidential information.</p>



<p>Days ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-devs-fired-over-leaks-sent-to-influencers-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar claimed</a> that the employees were dismissed because they were leaking information about ‘upcoming and unannounced titles’ to influencers on social channels, including a Discord server.</p>



<p>That server has become the biggest point of contention. The company explained that <strong>25 non-Rockstar employees</strong>, including former workers, competing developers, and even <strong>a video game journalist, </strong>were in that server. This gave them unimpeded access to critical information about Grand Theft Auto 6 and other games.</p>



<p>The court’s ruling now locks these former employees out of any pay while they attempt to resolve the situation with Rockstar Games.</p>
