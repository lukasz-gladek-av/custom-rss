<p>Fortnite is stepping into the Forgotten Realms. Wizards of the Coast has announced a new collaboration with community creators Chartis and Teravision Games, bringing a series of Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired Fortnite islands to players worldwide.</p>







<p>The partnership introduces five fan-made islands designed to merge <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pimlico-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s creative sandbox</a> with the fantasy adventure and storytelling that D&amp;D is known for.</p>



<h2 id="h-five-dungeons-amp-dragons-islands-have-arrived-in-fortnite">Five Dungeons &amp; Dragons Islands Have Arrived In Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Good luck. Image by EPIC Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Built using Epic’s UEFN toolset, the islands were created by long-time D&amp;D fans as part of Wizards of the Coast’s “launch and learn” initiative—an experiment aimed at exploring new ways for D&amp;D to reach wider audiences. The line-up includes a PvP battle arena, a social hub, a platforming challenge, a co-op boss fight, and what’s being described as the largest co-op roguelike mode ever created in Fortnite.</p>



<p>Players can expect plenty of classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warlock-dungeons-and-dragons-coming-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> flavor throughout. The islands take place across iconic Forgotten Realms locations, including the Yawning Portal tavern, the Spine of the World mountains, and Mount Hotenow. Familiar threats also await, with players facing legendary foes such as Klauth, the ancient red dragon, and the necromancer Valindra Shadowmantle.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast says the project is inspired by the homebrew spirit at the heart of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dungeons-and-dragons-cancelled-by-payday-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tabletop D&amp;D</a>. “We’re bringing the spirit of D&amp;D homebrew to Fortnite—supporting creators, experimenting in new mediums, and learning how we can introduce D&amp;D to new players,” said Nick Strann, Franchise Strategy Director for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. “We hope we can make it just as meaningful for millions of Fortnite fans.”</p>







<p>All five D&amp;D Fortnite islands are available now via the following Island Codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>D&amp;D Boxfights – 1190-4691-0255</li>



<li>D&amp;D Treasure RNG – 4958-2624-5634</li>



<li>D&amp;D Dungeon Deathrun – 5806-6430-0158</li>



<li>D&amp;D Bossfight – 2218-1049-5866</li>



<li>D&amp;D Zombie Dragon Adventure (Early Access) – 2525-9596-3235</li>
</ul>

<p>Though it may seem like new games are the talk of the town in 2026, there’s plenty to come from titles you have already sunk hours into, including a huge drop with the Cult of the Lamb Woolhaven DLC.</p>



<p>Initially launched in 2022, Cult of the Lamb has received plenty of updates since, with cosmetic DLC and free in-game content, but the Woolhaven expansion will be bigger than ever.</p>



<p>For all the release date details and the exact time you can jump in to play, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-dlc-release">When Does Cult of The Lamb Woolhaven DLC Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New challenges await. Image via Massive Monster</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cult of the Lamb’s Woolhaven DLC will be released on Thursday, January 22, providing a major expansion to the game.</strong></p>



<p>While the game is turning six later this year, additional content has become a regular occurrence throughout Cult of the Lamb’s lifespan, and the Woolhaven DLC is the biggest update so far.</p>



<p>Previous DLC for Cult of the Lamb has featured mostly cosmetic additions, but Woolhaven will be different, adding new areas, dungeons, bosses, weapons, and new characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-dlc-release">What Time Does Cult of The Lamb Woolhaven DLC Release?</h2>



<p><strong>The Woolhaven DLC for Cult of the Lamb releases at 9 AM PT on January 22 across all platforms.</strong></p>



<p>Naturally, due to time zones, this means the release date for some players is actually in the early hours of the morning on January 23, but there won’t be any delays for players on a particular platform, as the release is simultaneous.</p>



<p>That means that whether you’re playing on PC, console, or on the go via Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, the Woolhaven DLC will be available at exactly the same time as other platforms, as long as you’re connected to the internet to initiate the download.</p>



<p>The table below shows the release time for the Woolhaven DLC for Cult of the Lamb in major time zones across the world.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Highguard on PlayStation 5 & Xbox Series X|S? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-platforms-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s/</link>
            <guid>1410976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The year ahead promises to be a big one for gaming, with 2026 stacked full of big releases, and Highguard is among the major names landing this year, though there has been some confusion about the platform availability.</p>



<p>Revealed at The Game Awards, Highguard is set to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on January 26</a>, though the build-up has gone under the radar for many players due to an eerie radio silence from the developer.</p>



<p>Expect that to change in the final days before release, however, and if you want to know which platforms Highguard is available on, Insider Gaming has the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-highguard-on-playstation-5">Is Highguard on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Combat ready. Image via Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Highguard is available on PlayStation 5, as the title from the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall is releasing the game across all major platforms.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation 5 is, naturally, among those platforms, and, similarly to other games in the genre, crossplay will allow you to play with friends and other players across various platforms.</p>



<p>Uncertainty over the title being available on PlayStation stems from a very quiet build-up to the game, with pre-ordering and wishlisting for the title not available, apart from the latter on Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-highguard-on-xbox-series-x-s">Is Highguard on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, just like PlayStation 5, Highguard will be available on Xbox Series X|S at launch, allowing players on the platform to join the new title at any point.</strong></p>



<p>Similar to the PlayStation confusion, the quiet approach to promotion on Highguard has led to some queries on what platforms exactly the game will be released on, with details scarce following the initial trailer.</p>



<p>However, that trailer, albeit briefly, confirmed Highguard will be available on Xbox Series X|S, so fear not if you’re active on either console, as the game will be available.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-highguard-on-pc">Is Highguard on PC?</h2>



<p><strong>Highguard will be playable on PC, and, in fact, Steam is the only place in the build-up to the launch where you can wishlist the title.</strong></p>



<p>While store listings have been absent on other platforms, the Steam listing for Highguard has been live since the unveil, and you can add the game to your wishlist so you don’t forget exactly when it drops.</p>



<p>If you play on PC, you won’t be locked out of playing with those on other platforms, as the game will feature full crossplay support.</p>

<p>Do you have high expectations for Highguard? Share your thoughts on the upcoming release in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>



<p>For more Highguard, read how the developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t pay for a spot in The Game Awards finale</a>, and find out why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-dead-on-arrival-gamers-fear-a-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some gamers fear the title could be dead on arrival.</a></p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>
