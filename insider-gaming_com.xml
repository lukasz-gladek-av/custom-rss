<p>It’s a new week, and it’s an important one! This is when you’ll see the 1000th NYT Connections puzzle land, so expect some interesting challenges to surface as the week goes on. Today, we’re one step closer to that milestone with #995, which is a neat one to start your week with.</p>



<p>If you’re coming out of a sweet weekend and preparing to start a busy work week, make sure you kick it off the right way with a spot of NYT Connections success. Below, you’ll find the hints and answers you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-march-2">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (March 2)</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Marathon’s Server Slam Didn’t Gain Traction This Weekend, But It Still Topped Some Titans]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-server-slam-traction-top-titans/</link>
            <guid>1450033</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon’s server slam started on Thursday, and within a couple of hours, hundreds of thousands of people had either downloaded it and started playing <strong>or </strong>started watching it on a streaming platform somewhere. It picked up pace, hit more than 143,000 concurrent players on Steam alone, and then promptly <strong><em>fizzled</em></strong><em>.</em></p>



<p>Within six hours, the peak dropped by 30,000 players, and by the following evening, it was peaking at <strong>half </strong>the original high. Many believed the weekend would yield some gains as players worldwide came off work and into Bungie’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98">Marathon</a>, but it wasn’t to be. That being said, the server slam still managed to top some titans on Steam.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-could-go-either-way">Marathon Could Go Either Way</h2>



<p>Marathon didn’t make immense waves in the gaming space this weekend, but it still beat the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty/" id="32">Call of Duty</a>.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that these two titanic franchises have had their fair share of issues in the last few months. Black Ops 7 launched to a woeful reception and is suffering immensely at the hands of a disinterested community. On the other hand, Battlefield 6 continues to flounder amidst poor updates and a slow change cadence.</p>



<p>Marathon will be the ‘new shiny thing’ this month when it launches on March 5, marking Bungie’s long-awaited entry into the extraction shooter space. It’s going up against some monumental competition, especially in the form of both ARC Raiders and Escape from Tarkov, but tens of thousands of people have already gotten a taste of Marathon and (likely) want more.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4254230/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon’s server slam</a> product had a 24-hour peak player count of 76,437 users <strong>on Steam</strong>. This is how that stacks up against other, similar games on the platform:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARC Raiders – 227,765</li>



<li>Apex Legends – 201,571</li>



<li><strong>Marathon – 76,437</strong></li>



<li>Battlefield 6 – 71,861</li>



<li>Call of Duty – 52,575</li>



<li>Escape from Tarkov – 19,220</li>



<li>Destiny 2 – 11,623</li>
</ul>



<p>The discourse around Marathon has been pretty mixed. There’s enough positivity there for the game to enjoy a semi-decent launch, but only if Bungie can deliver a strong roadmap and rapid enough updates. The team has already been addressing the game’s biggest gripes, including concerns around the complex UI, the lack of PvP, and optimization issues on PC platforms.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Marathon is <strong>also </strong>going to be a game that lives or dies by its viewership, such is the life of extraction games. If the creators can get hooked, they’ll retain an audience and keep feeding people into the game, but if that doesn’t happen, Marathon will surely plummet.</p>



<p>In the opening hours of the server slam, Marathon secured a peak of around 301,000 viewers <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/407314011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitch</a>, and then, thanks to a huge push from popular streamers, it edged past that to hit 350,000 on Sunday, March 1. That was short-lived, though. The peak came at around 7 PM GMT, and by 10 PM GMT, only 70,000 people were watching the game.</p>



<p>It should be stressed that this isn’t a <strong>negative </strong>take of Marathon’s performance, as such. This is a game that could offer a sorely needed shake-up to the extraction genre, in a way that ARC Raiders managed to do in October 2025. It’s unique enough to leave a mark on the space, but the longevity of the thing is yet to be witnessed.</p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>
