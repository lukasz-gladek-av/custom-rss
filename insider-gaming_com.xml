<p>An actor’s resume has revealed that Back 4 Blood 2 by Turtle Rock Studios could be in active development.</p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-back-4-blood-2-in-development-with-codename-gobi-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mp1st</a>, the information was spotted on the <a href="https://www.istunt.com/jesse-hutch-4776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">resume of actor Jesse Hutch</a>, who lists ‘Gobi 2’ as a part of his motion capture performances. Gobi was the codename for the original Back 4 Blood, so it doesn’t take a genius to assume that a sequel under the name ‘Gobi 2’ could also be in development.</p>



<p>As spotted by mp1st, back4blood2.com was also registered by the developers in May 2023, suggesting that the company could be lining up for an announcement at some point.</p>



<p>In February 2023, the developers announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/back-4-blood-shelved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Back 4 Blood would cease further development</a> and post-launch content.</p>



<p>In the statement that was&nbsp;<a href="https://turtlerockstudios.com/news/b4b-2223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on the studio’s website</a>, the future of the firm was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Turtle Rock Studios is actually pretty small for a studio making AAA games. We don’t have quite enough folks to continue working on Back 4 Blood content while we spin up another game – yes, another game! Given this, it’s time for us to put our heads down, get back in the lab, and get to work on the next big thing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Turtle Rock Studios is the developer behind the game. Seven developers worked on the demo that would become Left 4 Dead. Back 4 Blood was announced in March 2019 and later revealed during The Game Awards in 2020. </p>



<p><span>Back 4 Blood w</span>as first released in October 2021 for&nbsp;PlayStation 4,&nbsp;PlayStation 5,&nbsp;Windows,&nbsp;Xbox One, and&nbsp;Xbox Series X/S. The game received mixed reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic, but in February 2022, Warner Bros. announced that the game had over 10 million players and was one of the fastest-selling original IPs in 2021.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Starbreeze To Invest ‘Significantly Less’ in Payday 3’s Second Year of Content]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-less-investment/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-to-invest-%E2%80%98significantly-less%E2%80%99-in-payday-3%E2%80%99s-second-year-of-content.1038033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-less-investment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent financial update, Starbreeze’s leadership team revealed that it will shrink the team working on Payday 3 going into the game’s second year of content, and invest ‘significantly less’ overall. However, the company has assured players and shareholders that this won’t impact the value delivered to gamers worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-less-is-more">Less is More</h2>



<p>Starbreeze revealed in a recent financial report that Payday 2’s sales contributions were still a whopping 50% of the value of Payday 3’s contributions. That’s a representative example of the staying power of the second game, while the third game has long struggled with player retention.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a statement</a>, the interim CEO of Starbreeze, Mats Juhl, said that the company is ‘leveraging the strength of its franchises’ to continue succeeding going into 2025:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This time last year we had just launched PAYDAY 3 – a milestone for us as a studio, and a commercial success, but also a launch marred by a series of technical issues. Since then, we have worked tirelessly to improve the game and expand the amount of content and features. </p>



<p>By the end of the quarter, we had launched four major DLCs as well as a large amount of updates to both functionality and content for all of our players. At the end of October, one of our biggest updates since launch was launched, with a brand new user interface, server browser, VoIP and much more.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He mentioned midway through his statement that…</p>



<blockquote>
<p>… ahead of year two, we are confident in being able to continue delivering amounts of value to our players with a significantly lower level of investment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was highlighted that the sentiment around Payday 3 is improving across all channels, which is true. The game has recovered somewhat from the terrible launch it underwent, even if the player base has dwindled considerably since release.</p>



<p>Starbeeze will continue to deliver content for Payday 3 going into 2025, but perhaps at a slower cadence. The team is hard at work on Project Baxter, and Juhl revealed that the company is on an expansion initiative, fleshing out roles to support the development of the new game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot Games Suggests More League Shows Will Follow in Arcane’s Footsteps]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-arcane-more-league-shows/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-suggests-more-league-shows-will-follow-in-arcane%E2%80%99s-footsteps.1038015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-arcane-more-league-shows/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently revealed that Arcane set a record as the most expensive animated television series ever, coming in at a whopping $250 million for just two seasons. It has been a roaring success, though – and fans are lapping up the content, especially now that the League of Legends World Championship has wrapped up.</p>



<p>Admittedly, Arcane is a masterclass in animation, and it’s picking up some seriously high praise from fans worldwide. In a recent post on Twitter, one of Riot Games’ co-founders, Marc Merrill, revealed that Riot Games isn’t done with these animated shows, despite the third season of Arcane being cancelled.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-want-more">We Want More</h2>



<p>In a simple post on Twitter, Marc Merrill revealed that ‘there are lots of other stories to tell’. He was responding to a question asking why there won’t be more seasons of Arcane.</p>



<p>Mere weeks ago, Merrill was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arcane-most-expensive-animated-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defending the budget</a> that Riot Games blew through in the production of Arcane’s first and second seasons:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players’ time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>League of Legends has been running for more than a decade and remains one of the most storied and lore-heavy games in existence. It has a thriving community backing it up, and millions of people are more than willing to soak up whatever multimedia offerings Riot Games can produce.</p>



<p>Perhaps a budget adjustment will take place, though. With Riot Games spending $250 million to produce 18 episodes of a show, many have questioned the sustainability of the company’s coffers. If that’s trimmed up, maybe we’ll get something with more meat on the bones – who knows?</p>
