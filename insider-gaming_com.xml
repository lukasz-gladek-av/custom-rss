<p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware are teaming up at least one more time to deliver Elden Ring Nightreign’s anticipated The Forsaken Hollows DLC. If you thought you were done beating the night, you can think again.</p>



<p>The Nightreign updates and content haven’t stopped since launch. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-even-harder-in-new-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got even harder</a>—which was brutal—and then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-expansion-dlc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first expansion was revealed.</a> The developer has no intention for you to go outside and see the light anytime soon.</p>



<p>If you want Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows DLC release information, Insider Gaming has the dates and details you seek.</p>

<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign’s The Forspoken Hollows DLC is currently scheduled to release on December 4.</strong></p>



<p>This would be quite apt as it would be nearly one year on from Nightreign’s announcement at The Game Awards 2024. With no word on how much content Nightreign is expected to get—especially with FromSoftware resources being diverted to The Duskbloods—this could end up being the only major DLC expansion for Nightreign.</p>



<p>This guide will be updated if any late announcements indicate a delay to The Forspoken Hollows.</p>







<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc">Everything Included In Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows DLC</h2>



<p><strong>Nightreign’s The Forspoken Hollows DLC includes new playable characters, new bosses, a new Shifting Earth, and much more on top of this.</strong></p>



<p>FromSoftware is a master of its craft. It doesn’t short-change gamers and constantly provides value for money. These are the full details that have been provided for The Forspoken Hollows DLC so far:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This product is an additional&nbsp;DLC&nbsp;for&nbsp;ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN. It includes&nbsp;2 additional Nightfarers,&nbsp;2 new Bosses, and&nbsp;1 new Shifting Earth, and more.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The two new Nightfarers are <strong>Scholar </strong>and <strong>Undertaker</strong>. Here’s a brief explainer provided for each new character:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scholar:</strong> “An&nbsp;academic&nbsp;who walks the&nbsp;Lands Between.&nbsp;Boasting impressive arcane levels, he gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation.”</li>



<li><strong>Undertaker:</strong> “An&nbsp;abbess&nbsp;who was mandated to slay the&nbsp;Nightlord.&nbsp;Boasting impressive strength and faith, she sends enemies to the afterlife with ruthless efficiency.”</li>
</ul>



<p>Whereas the Shifting Earth brings about gorgeous crystals in an enchanting locale. The rest remains to be seen on December 4. As usual, the content is playable on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>You can see tidbits of new content and a snippet of what’s to come in the official gameplay reveal trailer for the DLC expansion.</p>
