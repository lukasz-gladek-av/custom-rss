            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new video has emerged showcasing a Rainbow Six Siege exploit that can take over your entire screen. </p>



<p>The developers of Rainbow Six Siege recently revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-year-11-roadmap-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 11 roadmap</a>, which features “more Siege, more often”. As we wait for the R6 Invitational to end, players have spotted a new exploit that can completely block the player’s field of view. Learn more about it below. </p>



<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-exploit-uses-charlie-kirk-image-for-screen-disruption">Rainbow Six Exploit Uses Charlie Kirk Image for Screen Disruption</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege player Bikini Bodhi has posted a new video on their official <a href="https://x.com/BikiniBodhi/status/2023840148581216684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), showcasing the image exploit. In the video, we see Bodhi running and talking to his team when he is suddenly flashed with an image of Charlie Kirk’s face swapped with IShowSpeed. The image takes over Bodhi’s entire screen, making it a massive disadvantage for the player. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the comments section, Bodi was asked whether this was a new cheat or a stream thing. He responded that this is not a cheat but an exploit, where the player can link their name to an image. This image can then pop up and cover the opponent’s entire screen, leaving them in the dark. </p>



<p>This is not the first time Rainbow Six Siege players have been experiencing full-screen disruptions caused by image pop-ups. Back in 2022, players were seeing lewd and gore-filled images popping up that were blocking almost the entire screen. </p>



<p>In other news, Solid Snake has been unveiled for Rainbow Six Siege’s ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solid-snake-rainbow-six-siege-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operation Silent Hunt</a>.’ Additionally, the game’s creative director has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-creative-director-stepping-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down from his role</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon fans have plenty to enjoy in 2026 with the franchise’s 30th anniversary, including the Pokémon Go Tour Kalos event that takes place right after Pokémon Day.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a>‘s annual tour event places focus on a specific region in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> history, and the Kalos tour follows on from a return to Lumiose City in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/" id="2273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. As always, the event features the debut of new Pokémon and Shiny forms, so there is plenty to enjoy.</p>



<p>For all the details on when the Pokémon Go Tour Kalos takes place, and the exact times you will be able to play, Insider Gaming has everything you need to know.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">When is The Pokémon Go Tour Kalos?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shiny addition. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour Kalos starts on February 28 and runs until March 1, with millions of players across the world uniting to participate.</strong></p>



<p>Following in-person events in Los Angeles and Tainan, Go Tour Kalos is available virtually for all players worldwide, with both free and premium offerings.</p>



<p>The event puts Pokémon X and Y, which introduced the Kalos region, in the limelight, but there are also debuts from other regions. Mega Victreebell and Mega Malamar, both of which made their debut in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, are both available for the first time during the event.</p>



<p>Additionally, Shiny Diancie makes its Pokémon Go debut, alongside two special Pikachu variants wearing Calem’s hat or Serena’s hat. Both Pikachu variants have an increased chance of appearing in their Shiny form, along with the Kalos starter trio: Froakie, Chespin, and Fennekin.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-start-time-for-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">What is the Start Time For Pokémon Go Tour Kalos?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour Kalos begins at 10 AM local time on Saturday, February 28. The staggered release means players in Australia and the Oceania region will be the first to enjoy the new content.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike other platforms and games, there’s no way to change your region in Pokémon Go to access the content earlier than your scheduled release time. While there are some spoofing options available, they are against the Pokémon Go terms of service and could result in your account being banned.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-end-time-for-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">What is The End Time For Pokémon Go Tour Kalos?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour Kalos ends at 6 PM local time on Sunday, March 1. Again, the staggered release means players in the Oceania region see the event conclude earliest, while those in the Pacific will finish later.</strong></p>



<p>As already mentioned, there’s no way to change your region in Pokémon Go to give yourself more time to enjoy Go Tour Kalos, and it’s highly recommended that you don’t try to find a workaround.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/</link>
            <guid>1439146</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embark Studios</a> revealed its future plans for ARC Raiders, with the first four months of 2026 all laid out nicely with a roadmap. So far, fans enjoyed the smaller Headwinds release back in January, but it’s finally time for a bigger update, with Shrouded Sky on the horizon. </p>







<p>It’s these substantial updates that keep live-service titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> alive and kicking, and although Bird City was a fun distraction, the Rust Belt could do with some big changes. Well, it looks like those updates are inching ever nearer, as Shrouded Sky is set to soar into the game pretty soon.</p>



<p>Here’s when you can expect Shrouded Sky to arrive in ARC Raiders, as well as what content has been confirmed for the update.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-shrouded-sky-release-in-arc-raiders">When Does Shrouded Sky Release In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Embark Studios has confirmed that the Shrouded Sky update will arrive in ARC Raiders on February 24, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Whilst it may have been surprising to see some content for January back when the roadmap was revealed, it was February that everyone was excited for. </p>



<ul>
<li>More Insider Gaming: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders Event Tracker—Every Map Condition Schedule</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Shrouded Sky is expected to launch at the usual update times for ARC Raiders, but in case you’re unfamiliar with those, Insider Gaming has them listed down below:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Headwinds Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">1:30 AM—February 24</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">3:30 AM—February 24</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (EST)</td><td data-align="center">4:30 AM—February 24</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">9:30 AM—February 24</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">8:30 PM—February 24</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-shrouded-sky-confirmed-content-for-arc-raiders">All Shrouded Sky Confirmed Content For ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Halfway through already. Image by Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As announced with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a>, six new pieces of content can be expected to drop with the Shrouded Sky update for ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>These are the following: </p>



<ul>
<li>New Map Condition</li>



<li>New ARC Threat</li>



<li>Player Project</li>



<li>Raider Deck</li>



<li>Map Update</li>



<li>Expedition Window</li>
</ul>



<p>As things stand, only a small teaser trailer has been revealed online, showcasing a weather vane picking up some high speeds in the wind. A wind-based Map Condition would align with the small gust teaser image seen on the roadmap, but specifics are still up in the air.</p>







<p>It’s caused fans to erupt with new theories as to what the new Map Condition or Updates could be, with some suggesting that Buried City’s sand dunes could see some shifts under strong winds, uncovering hidden buildings and loot for raiders to find. </p>



<p>Check it out for your yourself down below.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for the rest of the content, speculation is at an all-time high. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-expedition-2-release-date-requirements-rewards-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-expedition-2-release-date-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Expedition Window</a> was already widely known, and the new Raider Deck will be a welcome addition for the game’s progression, as will the new Project. However, what they’ll include is anybody’s guess.</p>



<ul>
<li>More Insider Gaming: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-secret-loot-spots-you-need-to-know-in-arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/7-secret-loot-spots-you-need-to-know-in-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Secret Loot Spots You Need To Know In ARC Raiders</a></li>
</ul>



<p>What fans are perhaps most excited for, though, is the New ARC Threat. Judging by the small teaser image, general suspicions are that a new airborne ARC will hit the game soon, with some suggesting it could even be a swarm-like enemy. </p>



<p>Once more updates are revealed for the Shrouded Sky update, Insider Gaming will refresh the article with the latest details. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Pokémon Pokopia Have Multiplayer? Co-Op & Split-Screen, Explained]]></title>

            <guid>1439086</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon fans are set to be treated well in 2026, the 30th anniversary of the franchise, and Pokopia will make waves when it arrives, with a variety of multiplayer offerings.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> is set for release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-countdown-exact-release-date-start-times/" id="177262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 5</a>, putting players in control of a humanoid Ditto in a relaxing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/life-simulation/" id="2994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-sim</a> game where humans have mysteriously disappeared, leaving a world of Pokémon behind.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering about the multiplayer options for Pokopia, including whether split-screen is supported, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-pokemon-pokopia-have-multiplayer">Does Pokémon Pokopia Have Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rebuild. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Pokopia supports co-op multiplayer in a variety of ways, including the ability to game share with players who don’t own the game themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia’s sharing feature, which also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-will-be-available-on-original-nintendo-switch-sort-of/" id="157583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enables those on the original Switch console to play</a>, brings players who don’t own the game themselves into the fold. However, the host must be online, and a fresh connection is required every time you want to play Pokopia in this way.</p>



<p>Multiplayer options also allow for up to four players to play simultaneously across a selected island, akin to Animal Crossing, which can be conducted via local wireless or online multiplayer. A Nintendo Switch Online membership is required for the latter.</p>



<p>Additionally, there is also a Cloud Island, a co-op mode where players create a blank town from scratch together, separate from the game’s main story. The main difference is that the host does not need to be online for the island to be accessible, and there’s no limit to the number of players who can join the island, although only four can be online at a time.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/6-things-i-learned-from-attending-pokemon-euic-2026/" id="177317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6 Things I Learned From Attending Pokémon EUIC 2026</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-does-pokemon-pokopia-have-split-screen-multiplayer">Does Pokémon Pokopia Have Split-Screen Multiplayer?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Pokopia does not support multiplayer across a single system, and additional Nintendo Switch consoles are required to play in the same household.</strong></p>



<p>All local co-op is network-based, requiring connection to the same wireless network, or held via online connection, which requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>



<p>While this may be frustrating, it shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise, as Pokémon Legends: Z-A and other Pokémon games largely don’t offer split-screen playing, with the exception being Pokémon Let’s Go Pikachu and Eevee.</p>
