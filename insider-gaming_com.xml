<p>Epic Games CEO recently commented on AI disclosure for game stores, stating it makes no sense as it will be involved in almost all future production. </p>



<p>The gaming industry has conflicting views about AI use in development at the moment. Some seem to be for it, with companies like Ubisoft pushing for full-scale AI-driven <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-ai-teammates-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research projects</a>. The Witcher 3 director also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke about</a> AI in development, stating he doesn’t feel “that games created with only AI will have soul.” Now Tim Sweeney has shared his two cents on AI in game development and store disclosure. </p>







<h2 id="h-epic-games-ceo-says-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production">Epic Games CEO Says AI Will Be Involved in Nearly All Future Production</h2>



<p>The CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney, recently responded to a comment on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that said Steam and other digital marketplaces “need to drop the ‘Made with AI’ label.” Sweeney said that he agrees with that comment, adding that the AI tag is “relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation.”</p>



<p>Sweeney added that AI disclosure “makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.” When another user spoke about customers deserving to know, Sweeney poked fun at those statements, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993890431462166818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stating</a>, “Why stop at AI use? We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses. Customers deserve to know lol.”</p>

<p>Talking about AI in game development, Activision was recently under fire by the community for using generative AI <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to create their calling cards</a> for Black Ops 7. The controversy received so much attention that it prompted a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-we-need-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response from US Congressman Ro Khanna</a>. He stated that “we need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits.”</p>

<p>The Pokémon TCG has seen a popularity boom once again in 2025, making products harder and harder to source, but there are some Black Friday deals to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Pokémon has moved the TCG into the Mega Evolution era, following the return of Mega Evolution Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which is expected to remain until the release of Gen 10, expected later next year. </p>



<p>Sets continue to come out thick and fast, but, with the first line of Ascended Heroes products not landing until the end of January, there’s a bit of breathing room to take a look at the best Black Friday deals available—and don’t forget to look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s other holiday guides</a>.</p>

<p>Finding Pokémon products in stock has been a struggle for collectors this year, and will likely remain the case over the Black Friday and holiday season. There are, however, some deals out there to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Admittedly, products don’t seem to be available at MSRP, even on places like Amazon, but there are some savings available. If you’re particularly after packs to rip, there are several options available, and, for the bigger collectors seeking a larger prize piece, the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection is worth pulling the trigger on.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has selected the very best Black Friday 2025 deals for the Pokémon TCG, showcasing the available price and the amount saved.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>CD Projekt Red has told fans not to expect any new showcases of The Witcher 4 during The Game Awards next month, despite being nominated for an award.</p>



<p>The Witcher 4 faces stiff competition with the likes of Marvel’s Wolverine and Grand Theft Auto 6 to be crowned the Most Anticipated Game at the 2025 awards show, but no matter the outcome, there won’t be any Witcher 4 reveals.</p>







<h2 id="h-witcher-4-skipping-the-game-awards">Witcher 4 Skipping The Game Awards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No show. Image via CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure>



<p>Joint-CEO of CD Projekt Red, Michal Norwakowski, <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Twitter</a> to thank fans who have voted for Witcher 4 in the running for the award, but stated the team won’t be bringing any new content this year.</p>



<p>The post read: “I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards. Thanks to everyone who has already voted – your support means a lot to us.</p>



<p>“We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.”</p>



<p>The first trailer for The Witcher 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-witcher-4-trailer-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted at The Game Awards last year</a>, while the latest sneak peek behind the scenes came in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-gameplay-revealed-at-state-of-unreal-tech-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Unreal showcase</a> this summer. </p>



<p>A significant amount of hires have been made by the studio, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/60-developers-join-cd-projekt-red-for-witcher-4-cyberpunk-2-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 60 joining back in August</a>, and the latest major acquisition came earlier this month with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-devs-acquire-kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-lead-gameplay-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hiring of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s lead gameplay designer</a>.</p>



<p>The title is the long-awaited sequel to the critically acclaimed The Witcher 3, which was initially released in 2015. However, no release window has been announced yet for the title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The holiday season is upon us, and sales are starting to hit the entire gaming hobby, including a huge price drop for Battlefield 6 just in time for Black Friday.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is one of the biggest titles to release this year, achieving critical acclaim, and even more content is on the horizon with seasonal content. If you’ve not yet jumped in and purchased the title, this is the best opportunity to do so.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-half-price-on-playstation-5">Battlefield 6 Half-Price on PlayStation 5</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cut price. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Amazon has slashed the price of <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-ps-5-amazon-us/">Battlefield 6</a></strong> on PlayStation 5 to just $35, half the price of the launch cost and a whopping drop on the previous low price found earlier in the week.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for players on Xbox Series X|S and PC, the cut-price sale of Battlefield 6 on Amazon only applies to the PS5 version, but it’s worth keeping your eyes peeled for similar price drops over the Black Friday weekend.</p>



<p>Stock is likely to be limited, however, so if you’re sat on the fence about picking up Battlefield 6, it’s best to act fast, otherwise, you’ll likely regret it.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has plenty to offer and, while the single-player campaign is fun at times, nothing beats multiplayer in the title, with combat on the ground and in the air. That’s not it, though, as datamines have previously revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-naval-combat-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naval warfare content is already in development</a>, having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-teases-naval-warfare-is-coming-to-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously been teased by EA</a>.</p>



<p>Season 1 in Battlefield 6 kicked off on October 28, launching the REDSEC Battle Royale mode, which is free to play, new maps, new game modes, and new weapons.</p>



<p>The season is expected to close towards the end of January, expected around the 20th, with more additional content then being brought to the game in Season 2 and beyond.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Creatures Of Sonaria monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash, new signature looks, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ever dreamt of soaring through the skies like one of the massive dragons from Game Of Thrones? If so, then Creatures Of Sonaria is a game that you need to check out immediately. Creatures Of Sonaria is a popular survival RPG experience on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-letter-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> where players take on the roles of various mythical beings. Although many Roblox games tend to be quite basic and generic in their gameplay, Creatures Of Sonaria is a welcome change to that frustrating trend. With a highly immersive world full of secrets to explore, this game has something for every kind of player.&nbsp;</p>







<p>To start, the Creatures Of Sonaria map is absolutely massive, featuring various terrains and atmospheres. Simply exploring every nook and cranny of the map will take players plenty of time. Another element of the game that makes it highly immersive is the fact that there are over 300 playable creatures. Not only that, but each of these beings also has its own individual abilities and unique traits, making the gameplay experience highly customizable. There’s also a solid Gacha system in the game, which players can use to get new and powerful beasts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The episode superhero adventure is arguably one of the best titles to release in a generation, putting you right in the mix of an Invincible-like story. Taking control of Robert Robertson, leading a pack of wannabe supervillain-turned-heroes seeking to be reformed, Dispatch’s eight-episode arc initially released weekly, but is perfect for playing in bulk, just like a binge watch of your favorite series.</p>

<h3 id="h-helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re yet to join the fight to defend democracy, where have you been? Helldivers 2 continues to shine as one of the best titles available on Steam, and the fact Xbox players joined the fight earlier this year means there’s even more crossplay fun to be had. While the game has regular updates like other live-service titles, the huge benefit is there’s no expiration to the Battle Passes, and plenty of ways to earn free credits.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The extraction shooter has made a quick impression since its release last month, standing as one of the best-reviewed games this week. Playable solo, or in teams up to three, one of ARC Raiders’ biggest strengths is the unpredictability every time you jump into the game, as you never know who you will come across. With ongoing support, ARC Raiders is here for the long haul.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>After the much-maligned Battlefield 2042, EA has come back swinging with Battlefield 6, arguably the most successful title to release this year. While the solo campaign is entertaining, nothing beats the huge multiplayer battles on the ground and in the air, with naval combat expected in the future. If there’s any year to skip Call of Duty for something else, it’s this one.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s been seven years since Red Dead Redemption 2 was released on consoles and while it took a while longer to get to Steam, it still stands as one of the best games money can buy, and the current price has been slashed. Winner of over 175 Game of the Year awards, Red Dead Redemption 2 is the perfect game to tide you over until the release of Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-baldur-s-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 set the gaming world alight when it initially launched in 2023, clinching a well-deserved Game of the Year award, and the Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure is rated five stars on Steam to this day. Your choices along the way shape your adventure, meaning you’ll have a different experience on every run.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-palworld">Palworld</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Initially released in January 2024, Palworld caught the eye. and the ire of Nintendo, with its release, and has received several updates since, including some big collabs. With an array of Pals to capture, expansive base-building mechanics, and the ability to permanently trap humans in a small sphere for eternity, what’s not to love?</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Despite turning four this year, Forza Horizon 5 still stands as the best racing game on the market, a title likely to be held onto until the release of Forza Horizon 6 next year. While racing is the name of the game, there’s plenty of other things to do, including exploration, stunt jumps, and listening to one of the best soundtracks available on any game on the market.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Black Ops 7 undoubtedly has its issues, but there are some major perks to the game. The biggest among them is Zombies, which is just as good, if not better, than Black Ops 6, with an expansive easter egg to complete on the initial map, along with more content on the way. There’s also intense multiplayer action and a frankly bizarre campaign to complete, which can be done solo with up to three other players.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Celebrating its tenth birthday next year, Stardew Valley continues to be one of the most-played titles on Steam and retains a five-star rating on the platform after a decade. Put in control of a run-down farm, players are tasked with bringing it back to life, growing crops and rearing animals. There’s also a mine to farm resources, a host of romance options, and plenty more secrets hidden away.</p>
