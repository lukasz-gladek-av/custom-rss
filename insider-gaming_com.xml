<p>Sony’s CFO, Hiroki Totoki, has gone on record suggesting that the PlayStation 5 Pro is selling just fine per the company’s expectations. In a recent statement, the CFO (also the firm’s COO) said that the PS5 Pro is ‘performing slightly stronger’ than the PS4 Pro did in the same period – in 2016.</p>



<p>He was frank in noting that Sony didn’t expect ‘large sales’ going into the manufacture of the console</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-under-the-impression">‘Under the Impression’</h2>



<p>In a recent statement grabbed <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Sony-raises-revenue-forecast-on-strong-game-and-music-results" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Nikkei Asia</a>, Hiroki Totoki explained how things were looking for the PS5 Pro, which was released on November 7:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is a high-end product targeted at core customers, so we haven’t been eyeing a large sales plan to begin with.</p>



<p>I’m under the impression that the product is performing slightly stronger than the pre-orders of the PS4 Pro during the same period, so I don’t think it is adversely affecting the product’s sales plan.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Critics were quick to point out how strange it sounds that the CFO is merely ‘under the impression’ that the console is selling well, but let’s ignore that for now.</p>



<p>Ahead of the release of the PS5 Pro, a few issues surfaced that many believed would hamper sales of the console. Firstly, the price point – at $699.99, the PS5 Pro is one of the most expensive consoles released in <strong>a very long time</strong>, but that doesn’t appear to have been a problem. </p>



<p>Also, users were concerned that the console wouldn’t make ‘enough of a difference’ to warrant the upgrade. It’s technically impressive, but many will be reluctant to purchase something new just to tease a few extra frames or a little more clarity out of their console. </p>



<p>Regardless, financial projections at Sony are on the up, and if Totoki’s statement is anything to go by, so are sales of the PS5 Pro. How many of those sales have been claimed by scalpers, though? At least there’s now so much stock available in some markets that they’re being forced to sell them at a loss…</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is an ambitious remake of the legendary stealth action title released on PlayStation 2 in 2004. It has been in development at Konami for some time, and amidst ongoing content drops including screenshots and teaser trailers, it was revealed that it’ll be released in full in 2025.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, MGS’ series producer, Noriaki Okamura, revealed one of the driving reasons why Konami resolved to remake one of the most iconic games in the series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-basically-our-duty">‘It Was Basically Our Duty’</h2>



<p>In the most recent iteration of Play magazine (and circulated <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-exists-because-konami-was-starting-to-get-worried-that-the-younger-generation-of-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-metal-gear-series-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by GamesRadar</a>), Noriaki Okamura sat down to talk about all things Metal Gear Solid. He revealed one of the core reasons why Konami decided to remake Metal Gear Solid 3 more than 20 years after it was first released:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the things that really sparked us to do the remake in general is because we realised that a lot of the newer, younger generation of gamers aren’t familiar with the Metal Gear series anymore.</p>



<p>It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations. After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say—but again, who is Solid Snake?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the 2000s, Metal Gear Solid 3 became one of my most beloved games, and I looped the story time and again. It felt so ahead of its time, boasting an immersive, lengthy story, an open-ended operating system, and unique camouflage, healing, and survival mechanics.</p>



<p>All that will be present in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but everything has been improved upon immensely for this ambitious remake.</p>



<p>Okamura raises a good point, though. The first Metal Gear game was in 1987, and the <strong>last </strong>major release in the series was in 2015 with Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. That’s about the time that Konami and Hideo Kojima, the creator of the series, fell out of one another’s good graces.</p>



<p>The team at Konami tried to release a survival horror MGS game called MG Survive in 2018, but it was am monumental flop.</p>



<p>It has been <strong>ten years </strong>since the last Metal Gear Solid game, and there being so much that came before means it’s daunting to a newcomer who just wants to get involved and see what the fuss is all about. Where do you even begin with a franchise this expansive? There are almost 40 years of history wrapped up in Metal Gear Solid.</p>



<p>Let’s hope that the Snake Eater remake isn’t the end of it.</p>

<p>More often than not, the management and simulation genre proves massive and complex. On PC, there are countless hotkeys to consider, and to the everyday player, it can feel overwhelming to remember every key combination necessary to quick-build or remove pathing sections. Hopefully, we can help. Here are a few of the most important hotkeys in Planet Coaster 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-important-planet-coaster-2-hotkeys-to-remember">Important Planet Coaster 2 Hotkeys To Remember</h2>



<p>I spent too long ignoring hotkeys and shortcuts in games in favor of simply clicking, and the day I started using hotkeys, I never returned. They make life easier. You can access nearly any menu or mechanic in the game without moving your hand from the keyboard. Of course, remembering every hotkey and shortcut command is initially challenging, but there’s no shame in keeping a guide like this one up on your phone or a second screen. </p>



<p>Here are a few Planet Coaster 2 hotkeys worth remembering:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>CTRL + Z</strong> — Undo</li>



<li><strong>CTRL + Y</strong> — Redo</li>



<li><strong>L</strong> — Light</li>



<li><strong>ALT</strong> — Radial Menu</li>



<li><strong>Right CTRL + Right SHIFT + G</strong> — Hide UI</li>



<li><strong>Z</strong> — Rotate 90 Degrees</li>



<li><strong>Hold Z</strong> — Rotate</li>



<li><strong>X</strong> — Advanced Move</li>



<li><strong>M</strong> — Move</li>



<li><strong>F</strong> — Snap Object to Wall Center</li>



<li><strong>P</strong> — Toggle Angle Snap</li>



<li><strong>CTRL + D</strong> — Duplicate Object</li>



<li><strong>R</strong> — Edit Building</li>



<li><strong>I</strong> — Multi Select</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there are many more hotkeys and shortcuts in Planet Coaster 2, and you can find all of them within the settings menu, but I find you’ll use these more frequently than any other. It’s worth keeping this guide open for quick reference.</p>
