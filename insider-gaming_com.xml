<p>A recent PlayStation Network (PSN) hacking incident involving a journalist has revealed a major security flaw that could put many users in trouble. </p>



<p>A lot of PlayStation users have been hacked at some point; some users manage to get their account back, whereas unfortunate others have to leave behind all of their years’ worth of progress for a new account. Interestingly, some users are hacked again when trying to recover their accounts, and someone has now discovered a flaw that could be the cause. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-network-accounts-can-be-hacked-with-just-an-invoice-number-and-your-username">PlayStation Network Accounts Can be Hacked With Just an Invoice Number and Your Username </h2>



<p>A journalist at the French publication <a href="https://www.numerama.com/cyberguerre/2147695-je-me-suis-fait-pirater-mon-compte-playstation-et-jai-decouvert-un-enorme-probleme-de-securite-chez-sony.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Numerama</a> (translated by Google) has discovered a major security flaw with PlayStation Network. The report dives into an incident in which the journalist’s account was hacked despite 2FA protection. The user’s account login ID (email address) was changed, and he was charged €9.99 as the hacker had changed the username. The journalist was able to recover their account by getting support over the phone, but what’s interesting is the information they needed to retrieve it. </p>



<p>The report reveals that after spending some time on the call, all the information they needed to share was their PSN username and a transaction number from an old invoice; the year didn’t matter. With that, the journalist recovered their account; however, it was hacked again within an hour. This time, the user was unable to reach PSN support on the phone and decided to contact the hacker themselves by messaging their old PSN account from a new one. </p>



<p>The hacker was strangely cooperative and revealed that they had hacked the journalist’s PSN account “using a transaction number you posted on a page.” Turns out he had posted one of his bills in an old article, which the hacker could use to get access to the PSN account. The hacker also claimed to have “coded an app” to access Sony’s servers; however, that claim hasn’t been verified, as the promised video hasn’t been shared yet. </p>



<p>The journalist got on another call with PlayStation Network support, expressed his concerns about his account being hacked, and was then asked questions such as his date of birth, original email address, and original username. At the moment, their request is on hold, with the account seemingly suspended and a 5-10 day waiting period for a response.</p>

<p>Three months before its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 27th, 2026</a> release, IO Interactive has delayed 007 First Light by two months. The James Bond game will now release on May 27th, 2026. </p>



<p>The upcoming action game from Hitman studio IO Interactive looks to be one of the biggest hits for next year. With an&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gemma-chan-announced-for-007-first-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-star cast</a>, including singer Lenny Kravitz, there’s a lot riding on the developer’s ambitious project. Set at the beginning of Bond’s career, fans will see the young agent earn the 007 moniker on a world-trekking adventure fit for the novels. Its upcoming March 27th, 2026 release made it a huge blockbuster for the Spring season. Now, it’s been moved to the summer for polishing.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In a statement on <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2003511022141817016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s official Twitter/X</a>, it was announced that 007 First Light would be delayed two months. Now, instead of coming out on March 27th, 2026, it will now launch on May 27th, 2026. As to why the decision was made, the team brings up the need for refinement and polishing the final build. However, IO Interactive did share that the game is fully playable from start to finish, so the two months will help make it that much better.</p>



<p>The initial reaction to 007 First Light’s gameplay from its State of Play was a bit lackluster. Constant frame rate issues and iffy textures did sour the game’s reputation a bit. However, it seems the version fans have been waiting for will come to light thanks to the new delay. While it won’t be meeting it’s March deadline, it does position the game to be a great start to the Summer season. </p>
