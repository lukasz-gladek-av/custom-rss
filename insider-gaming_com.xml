<p>It could be mere weeks until Activision opens up about the Call of Duty League 2025 roadmap. The long-awaited arrival of this season’s competitive ecosystem has been made even more exciting by the success of Black Ops 6, which is proving to be a winner for players both novice and pro.</p>



<p>Recent claims have outlined the season structure for the year ahead, with it being suggested that Activision is adding in ‘Minors’ alongside the existing ‘Major’ structure.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-to-europe">Going to Europe</h2>



<p>One of the most electrifying rumours, which is all but confirmed at this point, is that the 2025 COD League season is headed to Europe for the first time in several years. In the new year, Major I will take place in Barcelona, Spain, and it’ll be hosted by Toronto Ultra. Here’s the full (rumoured) schedule for the COD League 2025 season:</p>



<ul>
<li>Major I: Barcelona</li>



<li>Major II: Texas</li>



<li>Major III: Florida</li>



<li>Major IV: Chicago</li>



<li>Champs: Toronto</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.breakingpoint.gg/posts/the-2025-call-of-duty-league-season-structure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Breaking Point has claimed</a> that Activision will host a series of ‘Minors’ going into the 2025 season. These one-shot tournaments will offer a $20,000 prize for the winner, and they’ll be a neat opportunity for pro players to secure more CDL points.</p>



<p>Presently, the rumour is that the Minor events are only lined up alongside Major I and II as sort of a ‘testing phase’. Per the claims, a Minor will incorporate all twelve CDL teams playing online across a four-day weekend.</p>



<p>BP also suggested that this year’s season will feature a whopping 246 matches, one of the most we’ve seen in Call of Duty esports history. This will include 160 online fixtures, 72 Major matches, and 14 ‘post-season’ matches.</p>



<p>What do you think about the rumoured structure for the CDL 2025 season? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Metro Awakening is finally here and <strong>it is looking sharp</strong>. I played a trial of Awakening on PS VR2 at Gamescom, but it was a drop in the ocean in terms of experience compared to running through the entire game on Meta Quest 3. That’s what I’ve busied myself with of late, and I’m happy to say that this is <strong>still </strong>one VR shooter that you shouldn’t miss.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full Metro Awakening review, captured on Meta Quest 3.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-underground">Going Underground</h2>



<p>Metro Awakening is, for want of a better term, a <strong>real Metro game</strong>. It looks, feels, and sounds like a classic Metro title, plunging players into the dank depths of the Moscow metro system, forced to survive against mutants and human enemies out for blood. It’s an entirely new perspective on the franchise – literally – but it works so well once you give it a few minutes to get settled.</p>



<p>I’ll be honest, it took me a few attempts to gel with Metro Awakening, and those attempts included playing with the game’s settings, but once I’d hit the perfect setup, I was <strong>immersed and loving every inch </strong>of Vertigo Games’ stab at this legendary post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>Metro Awakening has an all-new, original story penned by Dmitry Glukhovsky, the franchise’s creator. That’s one of the most remarkable elements of this gritty VR shooter, and a few twists and turns along the way kept me thoroughly engaged, just as I would have been playing a premium, traditional release in the series, like Metro Exodus.</p>



<p>As you explore this story, you’re treated to an original soundtrack composed by Anne-Kathrin Dern. It’s unmistakably <strong>Metro</strong>, and on more occasions than I could count, the soundtrack, paired with the ambient audio, was enough to send a chill through me.</p>



<p><em>Seriously, if you’ve ever played a Metro game, you’ll know how terrifying they <strong>can </strong>be. As you’re crawling through a spider-infested vent with nothing but a lighter to guide you, a ‘Lurker’ will leap around a corner, diving and scratching at your face. Imagine how intense that is through a VR headset.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-excellent-expansion">Excellent Expansion</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Metro Awakening is a prequel, and it takes players along a path that sees the protagonist, an unassuming doctor named Serdar, become one of the most supernatural entities in the Metro series: Khan. It’s set in 2028, while the first Metro game walks players through events that happen in 2033.</p>



<p>That’s where the name ‘Awakening’ comes from, see?</p>



<p>It might be a prequel set years before the first game, but it’s brilliant how familiar Awakening feels compared to the follow-up, full-sized titles. From the voice acting to the weapons, and from the post-apocalyptic environment to the mutants that stalk the tunnels of Moscow, everything is instantly recognisable as being pulled from a Metro game.</p>



<p>And it’s in these elements – the weapons, equipment, set pieces, and so on – that players will come to appreciate the depth and detail of this game. I spent so long studying the rifles and handguns I could pick up, I probed every corner looking for collectables, and I found myself hitting ‘restart’ on checkpoints just so I could try a different approach through a scene.</p>



<p>This game is focused heavily on stealth, given that Serdar is not a grizzled combat veteran, but I found myself pushing into some hardcore fights. On the easiest difficulty, you’ll still get a tasty enough challenge, and going on the toughest difficulty setting is nothing short of masochistic.</p>



<p>Within a couple of hours, you’ll have an arsenal of weapons and a full array of tactics to deploy, but like other games in the series, Awakening is relatively open-ended. I found myself accidentally ‘getting ahead of the game’ just by wondering <strong>if </strong>I could do a certain thing and then <strong>trying </strong>to do it. It doesn’t hold your hand, thankfully.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<p>This game isn’t without faults. I’ll sum those up before I cap off my Metro Awakening review.</p>



<ul>
<li>I had to reload checkpoint a few times because of a bug where I was either too high off the ground or too close to the floor.</li>



<li>I also had to reload the game because on three or four occasions, I stepped outside my boundary and the game locked me out of the playable area.</li>



<li>I lost a fair bit of ammunition by taking a magazine out of my weapon and setting it down on a surface that promptly swallowed it.</li>
</ul>



<p>I also <strong>had </strong>to play the game using continuous movement as opposed to teleporting, simply because I kept teleporting into surfaces that would throw my headset into disarray. It worked out for the better, though – continuous movement is superior. </p>



<p>Ultimately, Metro Awakening is worth every penny. It’s the most immersive post-apocalyptic experience I’ve had the pleasure of playing, and every step I took through the tunnels beneath Moscow had me feeling on edge and wary of my next move. I lost myself in the heart-pounding pressure of gunfights, and stealth sequences made my mouth run dry.</p>



<p>This is as close to the end of the world as you’ll ever hope to be, and the 8 – 10 hours you play fully exploring this game will be very well spent. </p>



<p><em>Metro Awakening is available worldwide on November 7 on PS VR2, Steam, Meta Quest, and Viveport.</em></p>

<p>Call of Duty is not only one of the most popular casual shooter games, but it thrives in the world of competitive and ranked, too. With Black Ops 6 just released, many are waiting for the game’s ranked system to drop. However, all Call of Duty games over the last few years have kept the same ranked system. Here are all the Call of Duty ranks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-call-of-duty-rank">Every Call of Duty Rank</h2>



<p>Call of Duty still stands as one of the biggest games in the world of esports and gaming, with millions of players hopping on every day. However, just because the game is incredibly popular amongst casual gamers, there is a massive competitive scene too.</p>



<p>So, here is a list of every rank in Call of Duty (updated last in Modern Warfare 3):</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze (I – III):</strong> 0-899 SR</li>



<li><strong>Silver (I – III):</strong> 900-2,099 SR</li>



<li><strong>Gold (I – III):</strong> 2,100-3,599 SR</li>



<li><strong>Platinum (I – III):</strong> 3,600-5,399 SR</li>



<li><strong>Diamond (I – III):</strong> 5,400-7,499 SR</li>



<li><strong>Crimson (I – III):</strong> 7,500-9,999 SR</li>



<li><strong>Iridescent:</strong> 10,000 SR</li>



<li><strong>Top 250:</strong> 10,000+ SR</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s ranked system runs off of Skill Rating (SR), which is Call of Duty’s in-game points used to rank up. Players rank up by getting kills and wins when playing ranked. </p>



<p>If the ranked system changes for Black Ops 6, we will update you here at Insider Gaming.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-top-250-in-call-of-duty">How to get Top 250 in Call of Duty</h2>



<p>Call of Duty’s final rank, Top 250, is quite unique compared to other games. While every game has a final rank that players strive for, no other game has a rank that specifies you are in a certain top portion of players. </p>



<p>Being able to brag that you have made it into the Top 250 in Call of Duty is an incredibly impressive feat, as literally, <em>only </em>250 people will be able to make this claim. Still, unlike other final ranks in games, your spot in the Top 250 could be lost depending on how many others are working to get there. </p>



<p>To stay in the Top 250 you will have to consistently play ranked and work to not lose your spot. Those who make it into the Top 250 will be shown on a leaderboard for everyone to see, giving them the ultimate bragging rights.</p>



<p>Are you planning on trying to get into the Top 250 in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6?</p>

<p>Halloween is over, and Christmas is just around the corner. With Black Friday giving gamers quite a few options of titles to buy for the Holiday season, which games are the best to play for Christmas fans?</p>



<p>Here are the best Christmas video games to play.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-christmas-games-to-play">Best Christmas Games to Play</h2>



<p>Looking for the best Christmas games to play? Luckily, there are quite a few. However, many of these games are not necessarily Christmas-themed from the get-go. Many popular titles have Holiday updates during the season, giving gamers a break from the usual worlds they love to explore. </p>



<p>So, which video games are the best for players to jump into during Christmas?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been a leader in Christmas updates. The game adds quite a few new changes to its maps that go alongside the Holiday season. A personal favorite is the Christmas lights that can be seen hung up throughout different maps.</p>



<p>The game has many other additions, though, including new game modes and more. Last year during the Modern Warfare III Christmas update, we saw a mode called “Snowfight” introduced, which allowed players to kill each other using snowballs.</p>



<p>Sounds like a blast, right? With Christmas-themed rewards and more, the Call of Duty Christmas update is a must for gamers to play and will be introduced once again this December.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite">Fortnite</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fortnite is another game that always has an update to go along with whatever big Holiday is around the corner. With Fortnitemares, the game’s Halloween update, just ending, gamers are preparing for a unique Christmas update. </p>



<p>The game even has a “12-days-of-Christmas” event, where players can head to a log cabin where a plethora of presents will be sitting around an open fire. Every day you open up the game during the event, you will be able to open up one present. These gifts range from skins to gliders to weapon wraps and more. </p>



<p>The game usually adds quite a few Christmas-themed features onto the map, too. Snow will cover a large portion of the island, giving players the proper Christmas feel.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-go">Pokemon GO</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Expect to see Pokemon GO on this list? While many have thought to believe this game is dead, the popular mobile game by Niantic is still thriving and even has a Christmas update. </p>



<p>So, what’s all included in the Holiday update? Well, last year, during the Pokemon GO Christmas event, there plenty of players playing the video game were able to capture new Pokemon that had yet to be introduced to the game. There are still a few hundred names that have yet to join the game, so we could easily see more added during Christmas this year.</p>



<p>But new Pokemon is not the only feature that comes with the game’s Christmas update. Many new variations of Pokemon will begin to appear, all wearing Christmas or Holiday-themed clothing. For instance, in the past, Pikachu wearing a Santa hat could be seen and catchable throughout the streets.</p>



<p>The game also features special raids, rewards and more during the Christmas season, so get prepared.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Want a break from shooters or walking around your city in the cold trying to catch Pokemon? Well, the popular MMORPG, World of Warcraft, has a yearly Christmas event called “The Feast of Winter Veil.”</p>



<p>This event has been happening for years now and is a staple within the Warcraft community. It will even translate over to Hearthstone and other WoW-themed titles.</p>



<p>Players who jump in during the season will get various rewards from gifts under the tree. There will even be reindeer seen that players can attempt to free. </p>



<p>Not only that but there will be plenty of rewards and items to collect, including Christmas-themed cosmetics and more. And yes, you can even pick up snow and throw it as snowballs. </p>



<p>World of Warcraft is by far one of the best Christmas games to play, if you want to pay for the monthly subscription, that is.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-will-you-be-playing">What Will You Be Playing?</h2>



<p>With Christmas just around the corner, what game will you be playing? Will you hop in a shooter like Black Ops 6 or Fortnite? Or will you be looking to grab a bit of exercise, roaming the streets hunting for different Pokemon? </p>



<p>Or will you and some friends be jumping into World of Warcraft, completing raids and gaining as many Christmas-themed cosmetics as possible? The possibilities are endless this winter, so enjoy the Holiday season.</p>

<p>Nintendo modified its financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2025 after Switch hardware and software sales dropped significantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241105_5e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">financial report</a>, Nintendo’s net sales decreased by 34.3% for the first half of the fiscal year. Operating profit dropped by 56.6%, ordinary profit decreased by 61%, and profit attributable to parent company owners decreased by 59.9%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo’s dedicated video game platform sales dropped by 34.1 per cent year over year, and “a decline in unit sales for both Nintendo Switch hardware and software” was attributed as the cause for this fall. Mobile and IP-related businesses also saw sales decrease by 43% year over year, as income from visual content related to The Super Mario Bros. Movie decreased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo’s gross profit declined 32.6% year-on-year. However, the gross profit margin increased by “1.5 percentage points year-on-year to 60.8%.” Additionally, SG&amp;A expenses increased by 2.2% year-on-year, and the ratio of SG&amp;A expenses to sales increased by 13.4 percentage points to 37.5% year-on-year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to the fall, Nintendo has decided to revise its financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2025. The new estimates are 1,280.0 billion yen in net sales and 360.0 billion yen in operating profit. The ordinary and net profit forecast will not change, staying at 420.0 billion yen and 300.0 billion yen, respectively. Hence, the forecasted annual dividend will remain at 129 yen per share.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo has also modified the unit sales forecast for Nintendo Switch hardware and software. The forecasted unit sales for Switch hardware have been decreased by 1 million units and software by 5 million units, with the new numbers being 12.50 million and 160.00 million units, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 146 million units</a>. However, it suffered from a 31.0% drop year-on-year in hardware (4.72 million units) and a 27.6% drop year-on-year in software (70.28 million units). Also, Nintendo stated that the plan for Switch 2’s announcement before April 2025 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains unchanged</a>. What are your thoughts on Nintendo lowering its annual forecast?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has a ton of cards to collect from common collectibles to Ultra-Rare, Full art designs. Opening packs is one of the main ways to pull cards, and a long-standing rumor suggests certain boosters—”Bent Packs”—give you better luck.</p>



<p>It’s hard to quantify how much money I’ve spent on real-life Pokémon packs at this point. The buzz of opening a pack and not knowing what’s inside never gets old. Pokémon TCG Pocket digitizes the age-old hobby and converts the TCG into an easy-to-digest mobile phone format.</p>



<p>You still get to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open Pokémon packs</a> and experience the unbridled disappointment when you get a duplicate for the ninth time. A certain Bent Pack suggests you can boost your odds of getting super-rare cards from packs. Let’s see what all the fuss is about.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-do-the-corner-pack-trick-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How to do the Corner Pack Trick in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Every trick in the book. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Corner Pack Trick—otherwise known as the Bent Pack—in Pokémon TCG Pocket, is looking through the carousel of packs, and when you come to make your choice, <strong>you turn the pack to its side</strong> and identify a certain shape of pack <strong>noticeably bent in one (if not both) of the corners.</strong></p>



<p>To be honest, I don’t where this theory started, I don’t know who came up with it, but it’s pretty cool nonetheless. I use my own superstitions when opening packs from spinning the packs around in a full circle to opening the pack from the right-hand side instead of the left side.</p>



<p>But if you look closely at the carousel and thoroughly investigate each pack, I can confirm you can see one of these bent packs from time to time. But does it actually mean anything?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-corner-pack-trick-work-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Does the Corner Pack Trick work in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p><strong>No science or logic proves the bent pack works in Pokémon TCG Pocket</strong>, and after checking this out myself, I would conclusively say the <strong>corner pack is nothing but a myth</strong>—albeit a fun one to distract yourself!</p>



<p>Firstly, if you go onto the packs section of Pokémon TCG Pocket, the game has a button in the bottom-left corner saying “Offering Rates.” This is in line with <strong>regulations concerning loot boxes and gambling</strong> to protect you, and let you know the odds of getting each card, the rarity of a pack, and what you can pull—especially if you’re spending real money.</p>



<p>A bent pack might sound cool on paper, but it would be deceitful; players in the know would automatically gain an advantage over other players, and it would be a legal issue. Furthermore, I’ve tried these corner-trick packs, and there’s no obvious difference between them and opening a regular pack.</p>

<p>If you need a fresh way of opening packs, knock yourself out and hoard all the bent packs you can get your hands on.</p>
