<p>Recently, the solo developer behind Balatro, one of 2024’s most highly awarded games, opened up about his journey in a blog post. In an article dubbed ‘The Balatro Timeline’, LocalThunk took a deep dive into the end-to-end history of what it took to make Balatro, which was released in February 2024 to an overwhelmingly positive reception.</p>



<p>LocalThunk explained about the very origins of Balatro – which was first named ‘Joker Poker’ – in this timeline walkthrough. He also gives readers a transparent insight into the toll that creating the game had on his mental and physical health, which is something many gamers never realise.</p>

<h2 id="h-my-sleep-and-my-heart-are-getting-worse">‘My Sleep and my Heart are Getting Worse’</h2>



<p>In The Balatro Timeline, LocalThunk tracks back through three years of development history, going back to December 2021, when the first concept of what would become known as Balatro surfaced. It was being pieced together alongside a full-time IT job, and back then, LocalThunk couldn’t ever imagine it becoming as successful as it has.</p>



<p>The full account of this stunning development journey is a wonder to read, and it paints a clear picture of just how impactful these things can be on developers – especially solo developers.</p>



<p>LocalThunk explained that his mental and physical health were put to the test during the creation of Balatro, with the situation becoming much worse as the launch got closer and the attention around Balatro started ramping up <strong>fast</strong>.</p>



<p>For instance, it was noted that in August 2023, just six months before the launch of Balatro:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is when my sleep and heart started having issues. </p>



<p>I really struggled with my physical and mental health from this time onward all the way up to launch. This was entirely because of the stress around dealing with the public, players, and the pressure to get everything done before February 2024.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By October 2023, things were getting much worse for LocalThunk:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My sleep and my heart are getting worse. Every few nights I need to sleep sitting upright on the couch because sleeping while lying down kept getting interrupted by my heart. </p>



<p>I stupidly thought that I couldn’t handle going to the doctor while dealing with all the dev and business stuff swirling around at the time. I felt totally overwhelmed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Everything from signing with a publisher to hiring lawyers to hammer out contracts is detailed <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/balatro-timeline-3aarh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in The Balatro Timeline</a>. It’s an account of the highs and lows of solo development, but fortunately, it ends on a jubilant note.</p>



<p>LocalThunk revealed that he made $600,000 in just a couple of hours on Steam alone, and on launch day, he sat down to celebrate with a bottle of champagne and some burgers.</p>



<p>Nice.</p>

<p>Just as we all expected, the recent behind-closed-doors playtests for Battlefield 6 (not a confirmed title) have resulted in countless leaks hitting social and streaming platforms worldwide. The first tests took place this week, and participants were quick to screengrab as much as possible and leak it all over the internet.</p>



<p>What has emerged is something quite tantalising. It looks as though the Battlefield 6 leaks are uncovering a Battlefield 4 – or dare I say it, <strong>Battlefield 3</strong> – vibe, and I am truly here for every ounce of it. This could be the return of peak.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-back-again">Battlefield Back Again</h2>



<p>Battlefield has struggled in recent years; that much is obvious. The series has undergone a tumultuous time that began after Battlefield 1 hit the market and became one of the best-selling games in the franchise. It was all kind of downhill from there.</p>



<p>In 2021, Electronic Arts released Battlefield 2042, the worst game in the series by far, which flopped <strong>hard</strong> at launch.</p>



<p>Recently, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/">Battlefield Labs</a> playtest sessions have given way to stacks of leaks for Battlefield 6. That was fairly predictable, and some have theorised that it was engineered by Electronic Arts as a way to earn free publicity.</p>



<p>In the Battlefield 6 leaks, we’re seeing a present-day theatre of war populated by traditional soldiers, vehicles, and locales. It’s a back-to-basics shooter with recognisable weapons and a clean UI that’s entirely representative of the heyday of the Battlefield franchise. We can see classic destructive elements, snippets of the class system, and the no-holds-barred action sequences unfold. </p>



<p>In 2011, the team released Battlefield 3, and in 2013, Battlefield 4 came out. For many, those two titles represent the peak of the franchise – and I count myself among that crowd.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-is-streaming-battlefield-labs-for-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield leaks</a> we’re seeing are from a pre-alpha build of the game, and everything is subject to change. That’s why they’re testing things now and standing up a community-led feedback pipeline.</p>



<p>It has been far too long since a Battlefield game dominated the market, but Battlefield 6 could hit the spot for gamers eager for a broader, more ambitious first-person shooter title. If it’s anything like Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, including a campaign and a couple of side options and added modes, it could be a smash hit.</p>
