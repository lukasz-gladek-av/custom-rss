<p>Within the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-esports-organizations-are-flocking-towards-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fledgling pro Marvel Rivals scene</a>, almost all of the pro players play on mouse and keyboard, but one of the best Vanguard players is dominating with a controller in their hands. This rising superstar on the sticks is already playing, and winning matches for a massive esports organization, and showing all the controller players out there that a pro dream is possible for them.</p>



<h2 id="h-meet-ttk-the-marvel-rivals-vanguard-star-playing-on-controller">Meet TTK, the Marvel Rivals Vanguard Star Playing on Controller</h2>



<p>On March 13th, 2025, the 100 Thieves organization officially entered Marvel Rivals, signing a stack of insanely talented newcomers that had been playing under the name Mutants. At the Vanguard position, this 100T roster features Eric ‚ÄúTTK‚Äù Arraiga, and the ‚ÄúTopTierKid‚Äù is a menace on Magneto and Doctor Strange. And if it wasn‚Äôt obvious already, he‚Äôs dominating on controller.</p>



<p>In early February, prior to signing with 100T, TTK <a href="https://x.com/TTKIsAvailable/status/1887285537637101796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> to be the first player to reach the number one player rank on two platforms at the same time. He backed this claim up withs screenshots showing himself at the number on spot on both PC and Xbox, with 313 combined competitive wins between the two platforms. According to fellow 100T teammate Vincent ‚ÄúVinnie‚Äù Scarantine, it was one of the best controller-wielding pro players of all-time, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/formal-coming-back-to-cod-scump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpTic legend Matthew ‚ÄúFormaL‚Äù Piper</a>, that put in a good word at 100T about the roster. TTK‚Äôs play also drew attention from content creator star TimTheTatman, who spectated him on stream and covered him in a video that garnered more than 528K views.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Fast forward to the 100T roster‚Äôs first week of pro play, and the team is already making a case to be considered the best in North America. They are 5-0 and have only dropped two maps, and they‚Äôre the number one seed in the playoffs of the NA Marvel Rivals Invitational. During their wins against the likes of Sentinels and FlyQuest, TTK is out-damaging the opposing tanks, and even some of the Duelists on the scoreboard with Magneto and Doctor Strange.</p>



<p>As Marvel Rivals‚Äô pro scene continues to grow, could more controller players reach the upper echelon? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kenny-optic-texas-drop-cdl-major-ii-days/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a post on social media, OpTic expressed kind sentiments at everything Kenny has done for OpTic Texas since joining the starting roster, before parting ways with the veteran Call of Duty pro player. In recent weeks, OpTic Texas has struggled immeasurably, securing one of the worst records in COD esports history by hitting a 0-18 map streak before landing a win against LAG M8.</p>



<p>Amidst the losses, Kenny showed up as one of the worst players in the squad. He dropped a 0.3 KD series record against Toronto Ultra a few days back, prompting (more) fans to demand his cancellation from the roster.</p>



<p>It hasn‚Äôt been revealed who will be taking Kenny‚Äôs spot as Major II approaches.</p>

<h2 id="h-desperate-times">Desperate Times</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas went from a world championship win to the bottom of the table in the last few weeks. The team hit a cursed streak and failed to win a single map out of eighteen straight rounds, prompting major concerns from fans worldwide. Kenny was often found footing the blame, with many critical CDL viewers stressing that he was the catalyst for many of the team‚Äôs issues.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs the post from OpTic that surfaced on social media today:</p>



<div><article><p><span>A true World Champion, in and out of the game. We‚Äôre grateful for the leadership and legacy you‚Äôve built with OpTic

Thank you, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Kuavo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Kuavo</a><span> ü¶ñ </span></p></article></div>







<p>As for who <strong>could </strong>replace Kenny on OpTic Texas, one of the leading suggestions is Cesar ‚ÄòSkyz‚Äô Bueno, of LAG M8 fame. It was a few days back that Skyz was benched, being locked out of the starting roster on LAG M8 with an impending drop sitting on the horizon. In the most recent regular match the team played, Skyz was out of the picture, and Lunarz and Priestahhh stood up instead.</p>



<p>During the 2023 season, Skyz was part of the Subliners roster that tore up the CDL, landing Major chips and a world championship title. The grand final of COD Champs was a sweep by the Subliners, with the team securing a 5-0 win over Toronto Ultra in record time.</p>



<p>Who would you like to see replace Kenny on OpTic Texas? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation%E2%80%99s-new-first-party-studio-is-called-dark-outlaw-games.1136925/</guid>

<p>PlayStation has a new first-party studio under PlayStation Studios called Dark Outlaw Games. The studio is being led by former Call of Duty Zombies lead Jason Blundell.</p>



<p>The name of the studio was confirmed by Blundell in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY37_Cenui4&amp;t=4729s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Jeff Gerstmann</a> that was published on Monday.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThe studio is called Dark Outlaw,‚Äù Blundell said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working away in the shadows for a while, when we‚Äôve got something to talk about we‚Äôll step out into the light.‚Äù</p>



<p>As far as the secrecy behind the studio‚Äôs creation, Blundell says the story is about the game and not the studio. He added that doing it under the Sony umbrella is a ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-meet-the-creator-behind-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-creator-of-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meet The Creator Behind Call of Duty Skill-Based Matchmaking‚ÄîInsider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a privilege to be able to do it with Sony as a new first-party studio, Sony doesn‚Äôt start up first-party studios all the time, so to have that privilege is humbling,‚Äù Blundell said while adding that the studio is making new hirings for the development of its first game.</p>



<p>Those new hires could be for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-yet-to-announce-live-service-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unannounced live service multiplayer game</a> that began making the rounds. According to the recent job postings, this new game is still early in its development‚Äîthat‚Äôs even if it‚Äôs the same game at all.</p>



<p>Most details surrounding the studio, aside from its name and who‚Äôs leading it, remain‚Ä¶dark.</p>



<p>What do you think of Blundell leading a new first-party PlayStation studio, and what do you make of the name Dark Outlaw Games?
