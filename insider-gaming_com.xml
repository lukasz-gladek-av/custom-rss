<p>Rosanna Pansino’s crusade against Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ Donaldson and his team has reached a new level as she forwarded her recent allegations to the FBI for further investigation. It started with Pansino slamming MrBeast’s new ‘Lunchly’ line for containing mould, and now, she has obtained and shared details of a claimed ‘official MrBeast work chat’.</p>



<p>In this chat, thousands of messages are revealed, many of which are ‘inappropriate, especially for a company that targets children’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-one">Another One</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, MrBeast came under scrutiny when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ava-kris-tyson-predator-allegations/">‘Ava Kris Tyson’</a>, a close member of his team, was outed by allegations of ‘sexual messaging with a minor’, which the creator partially admitted to before leaving MrBeast’s production team.</p>



<p>One of the most damning claims from Pansino is that MrBeast <strong>must have </strong>known about Tyson’s behaviour given the nature of some of the messages and memes shared in the chat she obtained. Per her report in a recent video, she has ‘verified the legitimacy of these chats’, but some MrBeast fans have claimed it’s nothing more than a smear campaign.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have reported what I found and my concerns to the authorities <a href="https://twitter.com/FBI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FBI</a>.  Hopefully they will look into these  MrBeast Telegram Company Chats Logs and other concerns. <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Youtube</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TeamYouTube</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mrbeast?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mrbeast</a></p>— Rosanna Pansino (@RosannaPansino) <a href="https://twitter.com/RosannaPansino/status/1850650883027239117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In August, it was revealed that MrBeast’s channel suffered a monumental revenue and performance decrease as various controversies surfaced. After the news about Ava Kris Tyson, other participants in MrBeast’s videos came forward to make claims of human rights abuses and poor working conditions while working with the super-sized creator.</p>



<p>It was estimated that in August 2024, amid the scandals, his channel lost around $2.6 million in expected revenue, based on estimations and prior performance. </p>



<p>MrBeast’s team is yet to respond to Rosanna Pansino’s allegations.</p>

<p>Following an intense knockout stage that has unravelled over two weeks, the grand finalists have been revealed in the League of Legends World Championship 2024. For the trophy, and the $445,000 grand prize, <strong>Bilibili and T1</strong> will face off on November 2, live in London at the O2 Arena.</p>



<p>This could be the ultimate opportunity for Faker to secure his <strong>fifth </strong>world championship title, forever cementing him as one of the greatest esports competitors of all time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-heavy-is-the-crown">Heavy is the Crown</h2>



<p>It has been one hell of a journey to get this far. This year’s League of Legends World Championship event started on September 25, and there’s still just under a week until it’s all wrapped up. When that day comes, either Bilibili Gaming will have claimed its first LoL Worlds trophy, or T1 will have secured its <strong>fifth </strong>championship.</p>



<p>The last barrier for T1 to get this far was Gen.G, and social media managers were quick to promote the contest between T1’s Faker and Gen.G’s Chovy.</p>



<p>In the numbers, Faker and Chovy are putting out similar win-loss records, and their head-to-head figures over the years have ebbed and flowed dramatically. This year, Chovy was proving to be a thorn in Faker’s side, but when it counted most, Faker was able to gut up and push Chovy and his team out of League Worlds.</p>



<p>In 2022, the pair competed side-by-side during the Asian Games.</p>



<p>Now, all that stands between Faker, T1, and a fifth world championship trophy is Bilibili, an organisation that’s yet to secure a T2 finish at Worlds. Not one member of the all-Chinese team has claimed a League Worlds trophy yet, and despite a lacklustre Swiss Stage, Bilibili has recouped some momentum and stormed through the Knockout Stage.</p>



<p>One series is all it’ll take to decide this year’s champion.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-ksv-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-ksv-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment.1020615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-ksv-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The KSV is a meta SMG in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> and gives great results in close-range combat. The best thing about this gun is it’s available early in the game. You can get started with it and tweak the loadout from there on.</p>



<p>However, to get the most out of the weapon, here’s the best KSV loadout in BO6 with the right set of attachments, Perks, and Equipment.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-ksv-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-ksv">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-ksv">Best Secondary for KSV</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-ksv-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock KSV in Black Ops 6</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-ksv-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the KSV any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-ksv-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-ksv-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best KSV loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Infiltrator Stock</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Flip Mag</li>
</ul>



<p>Starting with the <strong>Suppressor</strong>, this attachment not only suppresses the firing sounds but also hides you from the mini-map. It unlocks at level 2 which is very easy to do.</p>



<p><strong>Long Barrel</strong> increases the firepower of the SMG by increasing the damage range. It unlocks when the KSV reaches level 3 and helps deal with more damage in medium-range combat. Right after this one, the <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> will unlock at level 6, attach it immediately. This attachment significantly increases the Aim Down Sight speed of the gun and helps you aim faster, enhancing its handling.</p>



<p>The <strong>Infiltrator Stock</strong> unlocks at level 8 and will improve your mobility by enhancing the Aim Walking Movement Speed. Lastly, get the <strong>Flip Mag</strong> after reaching weapon level 17 to improve the reload speed of the KSV.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-ksv">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for KSV</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Tracker</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Cold-Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Tactical Insertion</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Ghost</strong> leaves you undetected by Scout Pulse or UAV and <strong>Tracker</strong> allows you to see enemy footsteps. Use <strong>Cold-Blooded</strong> as the third Perk to remain undetected under thermal optics. These perks will activate Recon – the ability to see enemies through walls briefly.</p>



<p>Use the fourth Perk slot to equip <strong>Gung-Ho</strong>. This will increase Sprinting speeds while reloading or using Equipment. <strong>Semtex</strong> will add more firepower to the loadout while <strong>Stim Shot</strong> will help you heal up quickly. For the Field Upgrade, use the <strong>Tactical Insertion</strong> for custom spawn points in the map.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-ksv">Best Secondary for KSV</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon options for the KSV are Stryder .22 and GS45.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-ksv-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock KSV in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the KSV after reaching player level 7 in Black Ops 6. You don’t need to wait too long for this weapon as only a few multiplayer matches would unlock the weapon and you can start grinding from there on.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-ksv-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the KSV any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, at the time of writing, the KSV is one of the meta weapons in BO6. Although it comes with a high recoil, controlling it is easy and on the positive side, you get a fast TTK and high mobility with it – two crucial aspects for intense multiplayer lobbies.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-ksv-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the KSV in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-jackal-pdw-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackal PDW</a> is easily one of the best alternatives to the KSV. However, if you want to try something different, a weapon that’s slower but hits hard, give the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-tanto-22-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanto .22</a> a try.</p>

<p>Wonder Weapons are bonafide difference makers in Black Ops 6 Zombies—and most installments of game mode. Some classic Wonder Weapons return, but there is also some fresh blood added to the mix, making for both a familiar and refreshing Zombies experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has a fun and fresh Campaign, another exhilarating multiplayer marathon to embark on, and the return of Zombies. It’s proper Zombies though: Round-based, Easter Eggs, different maps, and Wonder Weapons.</p>



<p>As usual, Wonder Weapons are quite hard to get in Black Ops 6. But when you get one, the feeling is unmatched, and they’re well worth trying to track down.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-wonder-weapons-are-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How many Wonder Weapons are in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Zombies currently has <strong>four Wonder Weapons</strong>: The Ray Gun, Beamsmasher, Thrustodyne Model 23 AKA Jet Gun, and the Wunderwaffe DG-2.</p>



<p>You might recognize the Ray Gun, Thrustodyne Model 23, and Wunderwaffe, but give a warm, undead welcome to the <strong>Beamsmasher</strong>—a new, mega-powerful weapon of mass destruction.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-wonder-weapon-in-black-ops-6">Every Wonder Weapon in Black Ops 6</h2>



<h3 id="h-ray-gun">Ray Gun</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hello, old friend. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Ray Gun is surely bound for the gaming Hall of Fame as it’s one of the best weapons in history. Its design is iconic, and the engineering is likely complex, but the end result is a satisfying, striking, nuclear bolt of deadly energy. It’s akin to classic alien death rays from B-movies of a bygone era, but it still works in 2024—trying to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-ray-gun-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get a Ray Gun in Black Ops 6 Zombies</a> is as tough as ever though.</p>



<h3 id="h-beamsmasher">Beamsmasher</h3>



<figure><figcaption>No-nonsense death beam. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>As far as I’m aware, the Beamsmasher can only be obtained on the Terminus Zombies map—so bear this in mind when you’re trying to obtain one. Other than this, there’s not much else to say about the Beamsmasher that the above screenshot doesn’t already tell you about the new toy. It fires a single, devastating, zombie-eviscerating beam and is great for concentrating on bringing down Elite Zombies.</p>



<h3 id="h-thrustodyne-model-23-jet-gun">Thrustodyne Model 23 / Jet Gun</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It’s obnoxiously big, and I love it. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I would say “Thrustodyne Model 23” doesn’t quite roll off the tongue like “Jet Gun” does—so I’m going to refer to it as the latter. The Jet Gun gives off an evil cartoon vibe (you can’t tell me those dials aren’t deliberately evil-looking eyes) and it’s making its first appearance since its debut in Black Ops 2. It sucks up Zombies and recycles them into a fine paste—and I feel it delights in doing so. </p>



<h3 id="h-wunderwaffe-dg-2">Wunderwaffe DG-2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A classic returns. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Finally, another legendary Wonder Weapon comes back with a vengeance, and it’s none other than the Wunderwaffe DG-2. Apart from the Ray Gun, the Wunderwaffe DG-2 has featured about as much as any Wonder Weapon down the years, and Black Ops 6 is very accommodating.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-wonder-weapon-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to get Wonder Weapon in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>There are various ways to get Wonder Weapons in Black Ops 6 Zombies: Get lucky with the <strong>Mystery Box</strong>, get them as loot from <strong>Armory Lockers or Safety Deposit Boxes</strong>, use <strong>Legendary Gobblegums</strong> for lucrative rolls, and you can also <strong>craft the Beamsmasher</strong>.</p>



<p>Using 950 Points on the Mystery Box is the easiest way to get a Wonder Weapon—and the odds increase the higher the round count you reach—in Black Ops 6 Zombies. You can also secure Loot Keys from Elite Enemies and open Lockers and Safety Deposit Boxes to see if they contain a Wonder Weapon.</p>



<p>Furthermore, certain Gobblegums can reroll Mystery Box drops—the Wonderbar! Gobblegum guarantees a Wonder Weapon—and the Beamsmasher can be crafted.</p>
