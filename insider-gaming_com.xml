<p>Xbox Live is currently down for many Xbox users on all fronts, like Xbox Game Pass and <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">even the support page</a>. The outage comes at an inconvenient time, as Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds 2 is in the middle of its launch today. As for what the cause is, it looks to be an Azure service outage, as Obsidian Support has <a href="https://x.com/OESupport/status/1983586140478435817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mentioned in a tweet</a>.</p>



<p>Outages for Xbox Live are rare, but when they happen, it causes a lot of problems for many players. Without access to the internet, you can’t play multiplayer, purchase items, or download anything. So, when it goes down, it’s a big deal. Unfortunately, it just so happened to shut down today with The Outer Worlds 2 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield: REDSEC</a> starting up. </p>



<p><em>This story is currently developing and will be updated when more information is available.</em></p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Due to an ongoing Azure service outage, all titles may be temporarily unavailable to purchase or install on Xbox Series X|S, the Xbox app on PC, and with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. We're working with Microsoft to resolve the issue and will update players with info.</p>— Obsidian Support (@OESupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/OESupport/status/1983586140478435817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>As of now, the only statement Microsoft made about the Xbox Live outage was for <a href="https://x.com/AzureSupport/status/1983569891379835372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Azure Front Door services</a>. The <a href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">support site</a> shows that it is out worldwide and affects everything in the network. This includes Microsoft Office and, of course, Xbox Live. Furthermore, the outage has been addressed by Obsidian Support, who mention that all titles are unavailable to purchase and/or install on all platforms. This includes Xbox Series X|S, the Xbox app, and Xbox Game Pass. As mentioned before, it comes at a bad time for Obsidian, as they just released The Outer Worlds 2. While early access has been open since last week, the general public only got their hands on it today.</p>
