<p>Judge me all you want, but I’m having an absolute blast with Infinity Nikki. It’s an exceptional free-to-play dress-up game that allows you to sit back, relax, and unwind after a long day without worrying about grinding loot drops or dodge-rolling away from a boss’ attacks for the umpteenth time. It’s relaxing! But even more than that, it’s rewarding. To capitalize on rewards, you can input a few Infinity Nikki codes for January 2025 to help you score big!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-beginners-guide-tips-and-tricks-for-new-players/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cs2-beginner%E2%80%99s-guide-%E2%80%93-tips-and-tricks-for-new-players.1081320/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-beginners-guide-tips-and-tricks-for-new-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Counter-Strike 2 can seem awfully daunting towards beginners and new players, but the iconic tactical shooter from Valve is easy to learn. Unlike in other popular multiplayer titles where there is a constantly shifting meta, CS2 mostly stays the same, apart from the occasional map pool change, a new gun, or a small gameplay tweak.</p>



<p>If you’re a new player jumping into CS2 for the first time ever, here are some tips for beginners to use.<em> </em></p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-learn-the-maps-and-callouts">Learn the Maps and Callouts</h2>



<p>CS2’s primary competitive mode, Premier, uses an active duty map pool that consists of seven bomb defusal maps. Getting used to the map layouts is important to CS2 beginners, but so too is learning the callouts, i.e. the names of specific locations. Knowing the callouts is key to relaying information between teammates.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have a second monitor, display the map with callouts on your second screen. Over time, you’ll learn the callout locations and will be able to call them without needing the map. There are also community-made aim courses in the Steam Workshop that will help you learn common angles an hiding spots on each map. Speaking of aim courses…</p>



<h2 id="h-practice-makes-perfect">Practice Makes Perfect</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-practice-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Practicing is the only way to get better when you’re a new player to CS2</a>. Arms Race is a great mode for getting used to how all the weapons work and then you can use aim courses, warmup servers, and deathmatches to prioritize the crucial weapons. Once you feel capable with the main weapons, you can jump into Casual games first to get a better sense of the game.</p>



<p>Whether it’s weapon recoil or the round-to-round economy, the only way to get properly familiarized with all the systems in CS2 is to practice.</p>



<h2 id="h-communicate-clearly">Communicate Clearly</h2>



<p>Regardless if you’re a beginner or a veteran player with 1000+ hours, communication is key to winning in CS2. Communication in CS2 is crucial to coordinating everything: T-side rounds, retakes, buys, and crossfires. If you end up getting killed but you relay no information to your teammates, that round loss is on you.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re interested in playing competitive CS2, then it should be a requirement that you have a mic that you use. In a game like CS2, if you’re playing competitive, text chat and pings just are not good enough. And remember that a key part of communication is positivity. If you’re only using your mic to flame your teammates, you’re part of the problem.</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2’s lead developers have revealed that a hacker was able to compromise 66 player accounts recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.404media.co/hacker-broke-into-path-of-exile-2-admin-account-hijacked-wave-of-characters-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">404Media</a>, Path of Exile 2’s lead developers, Jonathan and Mark, recently appeared on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjxzTAcJqAM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">podcast</a> with Ghazzy TV and Darth Microtransaction. During this interview, the duo was asked whether there had been a data breach at the studio. Mark responded that there had been a situation where a Steam account got hacked, which gave the hacker access to an admin account on Path of Exile 2’s website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers revealed that they are now aware of how the hacker took over the admin account, but they do not understand the “full scope” of what occurred then. Mark explained that one of their admin accounts was linked to a Steam account, and the user of this account wasn’t aware of that. The Path of Exile 2 hacker compromised this account through Steam support, and as the user was not using the account, the malicious activity wasn’t noticed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another reason the Path of Exile 2 hacker went unnoticed was a bug in the system. Mark elaborated that whenever an admin account makes changes, the events are logged into an audit log, which can be checked later. However, due to a bug in the system, the password changes were not recorded as events but as notes instead. The hacker was able to delete these notes, which is why the team at GGG could not tell what was wrong when they looked through the accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark confirmed that 66 notes were deleted, which means that the Path of Exile 2 hacker was able to compromise 66 accounts. However, their log history only extends for 30 days, and the hack began 5 days before that, so the full extent is unknown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark stated they would release a report with all the information they could gather in a day or two. They feared GGG’s data would be breached, and the hacker might gain access to the servers, but that wasn’t the case. The development team also added a bunch of more “security stuff,” which Mark admits should have already been in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark also confirmed that the moment the team realised what was going on, they immediately reset the passwords for all admin accounts and deleted all sessions to ensure their safety. Since then, the Path of Exile 2 hacker has not compromised any other accounts.&nbsp;</p>
