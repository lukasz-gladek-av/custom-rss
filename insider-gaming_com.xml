<p>The developers recently revealed that they pulled up references to all Batman movies and TV shows, such as Batman: The Animated Series, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and more. They also read every comic they could get their hands on and had access to the DC Comics archive for this project. From there, they started writing down the key, essential, and iconic moments, which became the starting point for LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight.</p>



<p>The game features a young Bruce Wayne, playing around Wayne Manor, excited to go to the movies with his parents. We then see the character visit the League of Shadows to train and eventually return to Gotham City as the Caped Crusader. You end up making allies with Jim Gordon, Catwoman, Robin, Nightwing, and Batgirl, who are playable characters and come with their specific abilities.</p>



<p>The game will also have you face iconic villains like The Joker, The Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Bane, and more, as well as many other gangs of enemies. Players will have access to a new combat system to take these enemies down, which includes combining combos, stealth techniques, and detective skills. Gotham City is also more immersive than ever, featuring crimes, challenges, rewards, secrets, and iconic landmarks such as Arkham Asylum, Ace Chemicals, and Wayne Tower.</p>
