<p>Hundreds of thousands of players have populated ARC Raiders since day one, but many want to play solo. If you’re looking for a single-player experience, we’ve got everything you need to know, and if it’s possible.</p>



<p>Many of us grew up in a bygone era of single-player-only gaming. Multiplayer wasn’t a BIG thing until the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, and then it took off. Still, many prefer a solo experience, and in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, especially, you may want to explore the surface alone, inviting peril and possibilities.</p>



<p>Let’s check if ARC Raiders offers a solo queue option.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-solo-queue-in-arc-raiders">Can You Solo Queue In ARC Raiders?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes, you can play ARC Raiders solo, and it’s possible to set up matchmaking so you’re hopefully not forced to join up with any players.</strong></p>



<p>Companies in 2025 are still not giving players complete autonomy over their game when it would seem like a logical option. For example, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale-solo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s REDSEC battle royale launched with no solo</a> mode, only Duos and Quads. It left many solo-oriented players confused and frustrated, and understandably so.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Embark aptly doesn’t want you to embark into the world of ARC Raiders with other players if you don’t want to. Read on for instructions on how to ride solo quite easily.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-solo-in-arc-raiders-explained">How To Play Solo In ARC Raiders, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>You need to set the ARC Raiders “Fill Squad” option to “Off,” and doing so means your chances of a solo game are almost assured.</strong></p>



<p>It’s simple to do, but here are the quick steps to play solo:</p>



<ol>
<li>Load up ARC Raiders.</li>



<li>Go to the main <strong>Play </strong>menu screen.</li>



<li>Look in the bottom-right corner where it says <strong>Fill Squad</strong>.</li>



<li>Switch this to <strong>Off</strong>.</li>



<li>This massively increases your odds of getting a solo game—but it’s not guaranteed.</li>
</ol>



<p>The prospect of going into ARC Raiders solo is scary. You’re even easier prey for squads of merciless players, and it’s tougher to take down various types of ARCs on your own. We didn’t see that playing solo would be easy! Although we should mention the skilled individual who <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solo-queen-arc-raiders-someone-did-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo’d The Queen in ARC Raiders</a>.</p>



<p>But the choice is there, if you want it. You have free rein to complete the objectives you want to do, bring home a bigger haul of loot, and look out for numero uno—you.</p>



<p>Let us know if you think more games should prioritize solo queues and matchmaking. Yes, it’s the world of online multiplayer, but one you can still enjoy by yourself.

<p>News on the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC is right around the corner, with The Pokémon Company announcing updates will be shared very soon.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A released on October 16 for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, with major headlines being the return of Mega Pokémon to the franchise and major tweaks to the battle structure.</p>



<p>More content for Legends: Z-A is imminent with the previously announced Mega Dimension DLC on the horizon, and significant updates are coming sooner than we thought.</p>

<p>As shared by the ever-reliable <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1986071211579941235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Serebii</a>, The Pokémon Company has announced that an update for the Mega Dimension DLC will be shared on November 6 at 11 PM Japan time, which is 2 PM GMT and 6 AM PT.</p>



<p>No exact details have been shared on what the news will be, though it’s possible that a release date for the DLC will be announced, perhaps alongside a new trailer that outlines the additions to the game.</p>



<p>We already know that Mega Dimension will introduce two Mega Evolutions for Raichu, with Hoopa playing a central role, and further Mega Evolutions for other Pokémon could be revealed.</p>



<p>The Mega Dimension DLC will also bring more Pokémon to Legends: Z-A, expanding the Pokédex further, alongside new story content and side missions.</p>



<p>Full details are still to come, but excitement levels are certainly rising for more news to be shared, particularly as we edge closer to the 30th birthday of the Pokémon franchise next year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Where Winds Meet Have Early Access?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-where-winds-meet-have-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-where-winds-meet-have-early-access.1344364/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The year may be coming to a close sooner than we’d all like, but there’s still plenty of big releases on the horizon, including Where Winds Meet, and we’ve got all the details on early access availability.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 and PC</a>, with expectations for the title high as over seven million pre-registrations have been filed for the game.</p>



<p>With such a high amount of interest, it’s only natural to wonder if early access is available for Where Winds Meet, and we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-where-winds-meet-early-access">Can You Play Where Winds Meet Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Patience. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no early access to Where Winds Meet, meaning that, even if you do splash out on the pre-order edition, you won’t be able to jump into the game early.</strong></p>



<p>Where Winds Meet is not offering any early access incentives for players, and everyone will be able to jump in at exactly the same moment when the global servers are released. Naturally, given that there could be thousands of players looking to enter the game at the same time, you may encounter some server issues—but they should be resolved quickly.</p>



<p>The bonus is that nobody will receive a head start in the PvP elements of the game, with everyone starting on the same foot, but it also means patience is required.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-where-winds-meet-early">Is There Any Way To Play Where Winds Meet Early?</h2>



<p><strong>No, there is no way to play Where Winds Meet early, as the servers for the game will not be opened until the launch takes place.</strong></p>



<p>While there was a closed beta earlier this year, offering players the opportunity to try the game out early and provide crucial feedback, those doors have long closed. Additionally, any progress made in the beta will not transfer over to the full release, and players will have to start again from scratch.</p>



<p>On top of that, Where Winds Meet has a global launch, with doors opening to players around the world simultaneously. Therefore, there’s no way to jump the queue by adopting the popular New Zealand trick that is utilized by many players for other releases.</p>



<p>If you really were desperate to play Where Winds Meet early, you could head to China, where the game has been released since December 2024, but the easiest approach is just to wait it out.</p>
