<p>Since 2020, fans of the Call of Duty esports scene have questioned the downsizing of the top-most tier of the competitive ecosystem. When the Call of Duty League was created, it was cut to accommodate just twelve franchised teams, which has long been a sticking point with viewers and competitors alike.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, LA Thieves’ Dylan ‘Envoy’ Hannon spit some home truths about the state of play in response to his chat talking about ‘expanding’ the CDL. He’s of the mindset that an expansion would just yield more ‘dogsh**’ teams and that there isn’t enough talent to flesh out a broadened COD League.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-even-more-uncompetitive">‘Even More Uncompetitive’</h2>



<p>The Call of Duty League has long had a problem with competitive integrity or ‘balance’. The best example of this right now is the split between Atlanta FaZe and the Vegas Falcons. The former team has claimed two of two Major tournaments this year, while the latter org is yet to <strong>win a single series this season</strong>.</p>



<p>There are teams in the CDL that just cannot compete against the top-tier squads, and Envoy argues that adding more teams to match the days of the Call of Duty World League wouldn’t solve the problem. If anything, it’d make the situation worse.</p>



<p>That’s because there just aren’t enough good players coming up to fill rosters.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Expansion is not needed. That s*** is dead. You think some of the matches are boring to watch now?</p>



<p>The talent is just not good anymore, bro. It’s straight up. Like, some of the talent nowadays is better and the teams are structured better, but there is way less talent.</p>



<p>For CWL, last time there were sixteen teams, the bottom six teams were still dogsh**. These matches will be even more uncompetitive. It’s unfortunate for like, the Falcon boys and stuff. They’re obviously making switches after they tried out their roster, but like…</p>



<p>If you added four more teams, it would all be like that, unless you just added like — you made like a <strong>draft</strong>. It doesn’t change that all the top teams have the best budget, most resources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He argued that the lowest teams in the Call of Duty League are on par with Challengers teams, which is the circuit that operates <strong>beneath </strong>the CDL.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft’s VP of Esports went on record stating that, without <strong>new talent</strong>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-vp-of-esports-no-new-talent-games-die/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esports games <strong>will die</strong></a>. If there isn’t enough fresh talent passing through the rotation to keep rosters stacked and the scene competitive, titles will simply die.</p>



<p>Do you think the COD League has a balancing issue? Let me know your thoughts in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-back-on-twitch-unban-two-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Adin Ross, one of the most controversial streamers on the market, has been unbanned on Twitch after a historic two-year hiatus. He was suspended in 2023 for failing to control offensive content on his channel and in his chat, and he relocated to Kick.com to become one of the biggest faces of the platform.</p>



<p>In July 2024, I covered the topic of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-unbanned-on-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ross’s return to Twitch</a>, which surfaced when the company’s CEO, Dan Clancy, suggested he’d be open to ‘chatting with him’ to see if he’d truly changed. </p>



<p>I guess he has.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-took-you-long-enough">Took You Long Enough</h2>



<p>Adin Ross peaked at 7.2 million followers on Twitch before being banned in February 2023, racking up over 70,000 subscribers and some of the highest average viewer counts on the platform. His success carried over to Kick.com, but he never reached such lofty heights, despite putting out some insane content, like hosting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-donald-trump-stream-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with Donald Trump</a>.</p>



<p>Twitch zeroed <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/adinross" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Adin Ross’s account</a> on the platform after his ban, so he needs to rebuild from the ground up, but in the 12 hours since his return was discovered, he has landed 56,000 followers. It’ll take quite some time to get back to where he was, and with global viewership dropping, he might <strong>never </strong>get back there.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Adin Ross revealed his intention to partner with FaZe Clan to create <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-faze-gta-6-rp-crypto-server/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a crypto-backed RP server in GTA 6</a>, which set the gaming space ablaze. It’s almost certainly <strong>never </strong>going to happen because it conflicts in a major way with Take-Two and Rockstar Games’ terms of service, but you never know.</p>



<p>Ross is yet to stream on Twitch but his account is gathering steam, so it might only be a matter of days before he returns to the platform. Will you be turning in to see his grand resurfacing on Twitch? Let me know in the comments or over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of The Last of Us (2013), Joel performed an act that split the community. He dove into a hospital full of Fireflies and slaughtered them to rescue Ellie, his ward. For the last decade, it has been the topic of widespread debate, with fans on both sides of the fence arguing whether Joel was right to save Ellie.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the release of The Last of Us season two, showrunners and writers Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann sat down with IGN to discuss that very topic, and we secured a definitive answer from the highest authority in the debate.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-did-joel-do-the-right-thing">Did Joel Do The Right Thing?</h2>



<p>Love it or hate it, Joel’s decision kicked off a chain of events that led to The Last of Us Part II being born, and that was good enough for me to side with him. On a more real note, I fully appreciate where Joel was coming from – we do crazy things for family, even if that family is represented by a twisted, pseudo-adoptive daughter figure.</p>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-hbo-creators-answer-whether-or-not-joel-was-right-to-save-ellie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, Neil Druckmann, the creator of The Last of Us, offered his two cents:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I believe Joel was right.</p>



<p>If I were in Joel’s position, I hope I would be able to do what he did to save my daughter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Craig Mazin, who has been partnered with Druckmann for the last few years working on HBO’s The Last of Us, chimed in:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That’s so interesting, because I think that if I were in Joel’s position, I probably would have done what he did.</p>



<p>But I’d like to think that I wouldn’t. That’s the interesting push and pull of the morality of it. And that’s why the ending of the first game is so provocative and so wonderful. It just doesn’t let you off the hook as a player.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s mostly subjective, and it’s not a binary thing – there’s no black and white with what Joel did, and every person will end up giving a unique take on what they think about Joel’s actions.</p>



<p>Would you have saved Ellie if you were in Joel’s shoes? Let me know what you think in the comments, or hop over to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When is the Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-order Date?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-when/</link>

<p>Pre-orders for the highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 are set to go live soon, but when can I pre-order?</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order date is a little complicated as we currently only have leaked information to relay on. It’s expected that Nintendo will officially announce their pre-order information during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct on April 2nd, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-leaks-say-about-the-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">What The Leaks Say About The Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-Order Date</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Best Buy Canada accidently leaked that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-open-april-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 are set to go live on April 2, 2025</a>, after the Direct. However, shortly after the information went live on their website and the news started to circulate online, Best Buy Canada promptly removed the information.</p>



<p>According to Insider Gaming sources, who provided internal information and emails from Best Buy USA, they state that the pre-order date for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 will be on April 9, 2025</a>, one week after the Direct.</p>



<p>So, if the leaked documents are to be believed, Best Buy Canada made some kind of mistake and just assumed that pre-orders would go live on the same day as the Direct.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-included-in-the-pre-order">What’s Included in the Pre-Order?</h2>



<p>At the moment, no official details have been given on the Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders, but according to the same leaked documents, it will contain a Switch 2 collectable coin.</p>



<p>Other information such as what SKU’s, games, and colours will be available for the Nintendo Switch 2 on launch have yet to be announced or leaked.</p>



<p>Will you be buying the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-lack-of-gta-6-news-is-to-create-enormous-anticipation/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-lack-of-gta-6-news-is-to-create-enormous-anticipation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s been almost a year-and-a-half since the first Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 trailer was released, exciting fans of the franchise around the world. Since that moment when a 2025 release was confirmed, however, it’s been silent from both Take-Two Interactive and developer Rockstar Games when it comes to any GTA 6 news. </p>



<p>Fans have gone to theorizing every possible clue they could about when the next bit of information or trailer will be released, but nothing has come yet. And now, thanks to a new interview with Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick, the silence has been confirmed to be part of the plan.</p>



<p>Talking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M53-LKlECk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Zelnick said that a reason for the lack of news is to “create enormous anticipation” for the game.</p>



<p>“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property,” the Take-Two CEO said. “We want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.”</p>



<p>Zelnick said that there are competitors who reveal their release schedule “years in advance”. For Take-Two, Zelnick believes in doing heavier marketing as a release gets closer.</p>



<p>“We found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation,” Zelnick said. </p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Zelnick was asked about why wait so long—12+ years in the case of GTA 6—before releasing follow ups. He said that it’s intentional in order to “rest [their] intellectual property.”</p>



<p>“Some of our competitors come to market very regularly, maybe even annually with their titles,” he said. “We only annualize our sports entertainment titles.” </p>



<p>Regarding GTA 6, specifically, Zelnick added that Rockstar “seeks perfection in what they do and perfection is a pretty high bar.”</p>



<p>When do you think the next GTA 6 trailer or any news will be released? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1787/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
