            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield Studios has announced in its latest community update that it will fix the game’s weapon bloom in Battlefield 6 and REDSEC next week.</p>



<p>The exact date for the chnages will come on November 18th, which will also bring another multiplayer map, Eastwood, to Battlefield 6 multiplayer.</p>







<p>The full patch notes for the upcoming changes can be found below:</p>



<p><strong><em>Coming with California Resistance (November 18)</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Weapon Dispersion (Bloom) Fixes: </strong>We’ve made a small tuning pass that reduces how quickly dispersion and recoil build up during sustained fire. Dispersion adjustments apply to all weapons, while most also receive recoil tuning. These changes make weapons feel smoother and more consistent, especially at longer ranges where we’ve seen players engage more often. We’ll continue to monitor these updates and refine them based on gameplay data and community feedback.</li>



<li><strong>Lighting Adjustments Visibility Upgrades:</strong> We’ve made further improvements to soldier visibility, particularly when transitioning between interiors and exteriors. These updates enhance exposure balance to make enemies easier to see in varying lighting conditions. We’ll continue refining visibility and related visual effects based on player feedback.</li>



<li><strong>Challenge Clarity Updates:</strong> We’ve refined challenge descriptions and tracking to make your progress easier to understand and follow.</li>



<li><strong>Fort Lyndon in Portal:</strong> More segments of Fort Lyndon will be available in Portal for creating community experiences.</li>



<li><strong>Aim Assist Adjustments:</strong> We’ve adjusted Aim Assist to make aiming feel smoother and more predictable, helping players build stronger muscle memory. Tuning is now similar to the Open Beta experience. As a result, Infantry Aim Assist and Infantry Aim Assist Slowdown have been reset to match the new values, so try the update before making changes. Note: Infantry Aim Assist Zoom Snap settings are only active in Single Player and Portal experiences, and not in Multiplayer.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Targeting the Winter Offensive Update (December 9)</em></strong></p>



<p>In addition to the new limited-time event and new melee weapon, here’s a quick peak at a few of the other updates that are in progress for <em>Winter Offensive</em>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Vehicle Balance Pass:</strong> We’ve made an initial tuning pass to smooth out some of the biggest balance outliers between vehicles. Expect more consistent vehicle combat across the board.</li>



<li><strong>Breakthrough Mode Adjustments:</strong> Several maps in Breakthrough have been updated to improve balance and flow. For example, Sector 1 in Mirak Valley now has fewer available vehicles and adjusted capture zones to help attackers make better progress.</li>



<li><strong>Rush Mode Improvements</strong>: We’ve updated MCOM placements on Manhattan Bridge and Liberation Peak to create smoother attack routes and more engaging objectives.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Under Review</strong> We also wanted to highlight a few topics of conversation where we’re actively exploring and testing changes, but we don’t currently have confirmation on timeline for just yet.</p>







<ul>
<li><strong>Map Design and Size:</strong> We have seen your comments about map size and pacing. Battlefield is at its best when maps offer different ways to play and constant action around every corner. Striking that balance is always a priority, and we are committed to a variety of map types across future Seasons. With Eastwood arriving in the California Resistance Update, we will continue monitoring existing maps and modes for targeted adjustments (like what’s planned in <em>Winter Offensive</em>) while also learning from community creations in Portal.</li>



<li><strong>Review of Challenges:</strong> We are reviewing challenges to better support the sandbox gameplay that sits at the core of the Battlefield experience.</li>



<li><strong>UI and Menu Improvements:</strong> We are looking into adjustments that will roll out over time, with the goal of making navigation more intuitive, from settings menus to equipping earned skins to discovering Community Experiences more easily.</li>



<li><strong>Player Stats:</strong> We are exploring expanded player stat tracking, including per-season details and other improvements.</li>



<li><strong>Social Play Improvements:</strong> We are evaluating ways to make it easier to group up with friends and resolve issues that may prevent smooth session joining.</li>



<li><strong>Hit Registration (Netcode):</strong> We are investigating improvements to hit registration. This work is closely tied to potential updates around time-to-death (TTD) and time-to-kill (TTK) consistency, as well as bugs such as sometimes dying when behind cover.</li>



<li><strong>Vehicle Ecosystem</strong>: We are reviewing the overall vehicle experience to ensure balanced combat across all-out warfare modes and map types.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>REDSEC</em></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Audio Performance:</strong> We have identified performance and memory issues that can occasionally cause sounds, such as footsteps or vehicles, to not play consistently on larger Battle Royale maps. Optimization work is underway.</li>



<li><strong>Battle Royale Solo Mode:</strong> We are reviewing Solo mode pacing and difficulty. Playing without a squad can feel punishing, and we want Solo to remain a rewarding Battlefield experience.</li>



<li><strong>Casual Battle Royale Mode:</strong> We are investigating the potential for a more accessible Battle Royale mode that keeps the core intensity but allows for a relaxed playstyle.</li>



<li><strong>Armor Plating:</strong> We are reviewing the current action time and availability for armor plating. It provides meaningful tactical choices, and we want to approach any changes carefully to maintain that balance.</li>



<li><strong>Tank Availability:</strong> We are exploring possible adjustments to tank frequency and placement within Battle Royale matches.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Community Highlights</strong></p>



<p>Recently, we celebrated the spirit of connection in the</p>



<p><a href="https://discord.gg/battlefield" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Battlefield Discord</a></p>



<p>with a community giveaway, where hundreds of players shared their favorite memories from past titles and how they carry that passion into Battlefield 6.</p>



<p><em>“A Battlefield moment that will always stay with me. When I was younger, we just moved to a new state. My dad went out and bought Battlefield 1942 that September and surprised me with it to cheer me up. We took turns playing Battlefield 1942 all summer long. We eventually got Battlefield Vietnam, then Battlefield 2 and Battlefield 2: Special Forces, and the rest was history. It was so much fun teaching him how to fly helicopters and drive tanks in that game with our friends from our clan. RIP Pops, thank you for the memories!“ “A simple but fun memory for my entry, handing the controller to my grandfather, who has sadly been gone for over a decade, and having him fire the M1 on Battlefield 1943. He loved the controller vibration with each shot and, of course, the classic ping. He was a Korean War Navy man, so he didn’t serve in WW2, but said it was something he had always wished to fire in real life. He died about 4-5 months later. I think about this moment a lot and how much it meant to share a moment in my favorite franchise with my favorite person.”</em></p>



<p>The stories we received, from friends reconnecting to families playing together across generations, were a powerful reminder of what makes Battlefield special. Thank you for continuing to make it more than just a game.</p>



<p>And to all of you sharing your favorite in-game moments and Portal Experiences, we can assure you they are making rounds across the offices and are a nonstop highlight of our day.</p>

<p>We’ll see you on the Battlefield.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade developers have revealed that they are considering expanding to other platforms, which could mean that ports for Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox are on the cards. </p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-devs-are-considering-a-switch-2-port-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from earlier this year</a> claimed that Stellar Blade developers were already working on a Switch 2 port, with an official development kit already in their possession. Now, the devs have outright stated that additional platforms are being considered, which means there is a chance that Xbox and Switch 2 ports are indeed coming. </p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-devs-are-considering-additional-platform-expansions-to-enhance-brand-recognition-and-boost-sales">Stellar Blade Devs Are Considering Additional Platform Expansions to Enhance Brand Recognition and Boost Sales</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/this-big-ps5-exclusive-could-be-coming-to-xbox-soon-the-developer-is-considering-additional-platform-expansions-after-strong-steam-sales-on-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, the discussion about additional platform expansions for Stellar Blade arose during a Q&amp;A session in Shift Up’s latest <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings results</a>. The developers first revealed that the game was recognized “as one of the most successful platform expansions in global AAA IP history” and has had a “stable sales performance in Q3.” The PC version experienced strong sales momentum in the fourth month after its launch, and the PS5 version has also successfully attracted new players. The combined sales across both platforms have “met internal expectations”. </p>



<p>However, “to further enhance brand recognition and boost sales” for Stellar Blade, the developers will carry out various promotional activities and are “considering additional platform expansions” to help make the title more accessible to players. Moreover, they are looking forward to “engaging an even broader global audience” through upcoming seasonal and holiday promotions for both PC and PS5 versions. </p>



<p>Expanding to other platforms seems like a good choice for Stellar Blade, considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the boost Helldivers 2 was able to gain</a> with their Xbox port. However, the developers are yet to confirm outright that Xbox and Switch 2 ports for the title are on the way. </p>
