<p>Battlestate Games has skipped over the issues plaguing one of the rarest rewards in Escape from Tarkov and just issued a code that will give you <strong>Nikita’s voicelines </strong>instantly in the spearhead extraction shooter title. This is in response to waves of people complaining that Twitch drops, which are supposed to unlock the voice, simply aren’t working as intended.</p>



<p>If you want to unlock Nikita Buyanov’s voicelines in Escape from Tarkov, the code you need is right down below.</p>







<h2 id="h-nikita-voice-code-for-escape-from-tarkov">Nikita Voice Code for Escape from Tarkov</h2>



<p>If you want to unlock Nikita’s voicelines in Escape from Tarkov, you need to use the following code: <strong>WILWILBE</strong>.</p>



<p>Like any other code, this <span>can be redeemed via the escapefromtarkov.com site&nbsp;<strong>or&nbsp;</strong>through</span> the launcher. Once you’ve entered the code, you’ll be met with a <strong>green message </strong>if it worked, just like the one below:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>However, there’s a huge catch. You’ve only got <strong>three days </strong>until the code becomes invalid, so if you’re reading this guide after December 2nd or 3rd, you’re out of luck, and you might never get the voicelines.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov recently launched into a 1.0 state after more than a decade in development. It was the biggest milestone in the game’s history, but it was somewhat marred by network issues, server instability, and a hefty assortment of bugs, all of which led to Battlestate Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bsg-apologize-escape-from-tarkov-launch-problems/">issuing a public apology</a>.</p>



<p>That being said, the game has now become more accessible and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-getting-easier-first-time-decade/">easier for newcomers</a>, and in our recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-review-ultimate-extraction-shooter/">Escape from Tarkov review</a> (which scored maximum marks), we wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Through thick and thin, Escape from Tarkov has prevailed. It’s an enormous, deep, and rich game that’s still evolving, it offers unparalleled emotional experiences, and it looks, sounds, and feels great while doing all that. It’s the most punishing game you’ll ever play, but if you put enough hours into understanding this gem of a title, you’ll come to appreciate that it is a generational masterpiece of the extraction shooter market.</p>

<p>The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley posted some mysterious images this morning. However, it seems fans have already&nbsp;started to figure out what those teases could be.</p>



<p>On December 11th, The Game Awards are set to go live on social media. Hosted by Geoff Keighley, the event celebrates the best of the year’s games. This year is host to a plethora of amazing titles like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record-breaking Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. However, in recent shows, it’s also been home to huge reveals like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-wont-feature-at-the-game-awards-despite-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> and Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. This morning, Geoff Keighley and The Game Awards’ socials posted <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1994816833464217796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">weird photos of a mysterious statue</a> and location. Now, it seems the mystery is going a bit deeper thanks to one fan’s journey to said locale.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-game-awards-mysterious-statue-seen-in-real-life-hints-at-future-reveal">The Game Awards’ Mysterious Statue Seen in Real Life, Hints at Future Reveal</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned before, The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley released a picture of a statue and a desert location in New Mexico. Fans on Reddit speculated everything from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1p9uzuu/another_teaser_for_the_game_awards_do_you_think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tomb Raider</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1p9vgwx/dont_believe_his_lies_dont_believe_his_lies_dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Half-Life</a>. However, user <a href="https://x.com/TotallyNOTTrio/status/1994843343575224514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TotallyNOTTrio</a> noticed they lived not far from it and took a trip to the site. There, as pictured above, we get a closer look at the statue, which is adorned with demon-like creatures and a big yellow eye with tentacles. According to the user, the staff on location were quiet about what it could actually mean.</p>



<p>Luckily, it seems fans are already hard at work conjuring what it could be. The most likely consensus is that it’s for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation’s Saros</a>, as the visual design and architecture look similar to the upcoming Housemarque title. Perhaps a bit of a stretch, fans are hoping it’s referring to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/greek-god-of-war-game-pushed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/julian-lefay-father-elder-scrolls-passed-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls</a>, as both series have eldritch enemies and a similar visual style. Plus, the series are no strangers to The Game Awards, so the collaboration isn’t out of left field. Its fans are going crazy on Reddit, with some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/1p9vswt/this_geoff_post_on_twitter_what_you_guys_think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">referencing the armor as one of Kratos</a>‘ and others believing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TESVI/comments/1p9nef1/youre_thinking_about_the_teaser_wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it has a connection to Oblivion</a>.</p>



<p>Another one, Diablo 4, is another good choice, given it feels like it’s time for a new expansion, and the statue fits with something one could see in-game. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1p9mf6w/geoff_keighley_dropped_this_new_expansion_or_not/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fans on the subreddit</a> do think that, while it does go too far for an expansion, it could tease the Paladin class’s addition to the game. Additionally, it could very well be a new game from a big studio, given the marketing strategy. Unfortunately, it may be some time before it’s known what exactly it is, but it’s certainly one great way to market your game.</p>



<p>What do you think the statue is referring to? Saros? God of War? Elder Scrolls? Diablo? Another franchise? Leave a comment below or on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>
