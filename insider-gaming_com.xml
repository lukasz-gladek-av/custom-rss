<p>A new claim states that Halo Studios plans to remake the original trilogy. </p>



<p>A couple of months ago, there was a leak about Halo Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-2-and-3-campaign-remakes-development-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remaking the campaigns</a> for Halo 2 and Halo 3, with a mainline Halo 7 in development that will feature multiplayer. Now, another insider has reiterated these leaks, along with some additional details. </p>







<h2 id="h-halo-trilogy-remakes-reportedly-in-the-works-to-ensure-halo-s-new-era-doesn-t-fail">Halo Trilogy Remakes Reportedly in the Works to Ensure ‘Halo’s New Era Doesn’t Fail’</h2>



<p>The latest bit of information on the Halo Trilogy remakes comes through a new video by Rebs Gaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Klr-B5pd_pE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. He first talks about the post by Halo leaks, which had mentioned Halo 2 and Halo 3 getting full campaign remakes. Rebs then discusses Dan Gniady joining Halo Studios as a lead game designer on a new project, which turned out to be the Halo CE Remake. Dan has also seemingly teased that the trilogy is being remade in his LinkedIn post, which reads, “Doing a game direction on a Halo Experience, Giving the Covenant back their bomb.” However, this is just speculation.</p>



<p>Rebs then points at another source that has mentioned Halo Trilogy Remakes, which is TechnicalHalo on <a href="https://x.com/TechnicalHalo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. Rebs talks about their post from 2024, which states that Halo Studios decided to resell the entire series rather than porting the Master Chief Collection to PlayStation for “a higher potential revenue,” and the plan was to remake Halo CE to Halo 3. Additionally, the leaker also stated that Halo 2 and 3 remakes will launch from the same game. </p>



<p>Rebs also did some digging of his own on the Halo Trilogy remake. He first spoke to a former Halo Studios dev, who revealed that the studio is indeed remaking the original games, but didn’t share more details due to an NDA. Another source confirmed the remakes, along with the reason why Halo Studios is remaking games rather than creating new experiences. </p>



<p>The source stated that Microsoft and Halo Studios want to ensure ‘Halo’s new era doesn’t fail,’ so they are playing it safe and avoiding risks. The teams want to avoid making another Halo game, which would draw heavy criticism from OG fans. Hence, they are playing it safe by remaking the original games, as “they can’t afford to fail again,” and the original Halo games were so successful that many fans still play them. </p>



<p>Rebs added that this statement doesn’t mean developers aren’t working on a new Halo project; there are different teams in the studio, with some working only on campaign remakes and others on the multiplayer project.</p>



<p>Readers should note that this information doesn’t come from an official source, so treat it with caution. Official confirmation about a Halo Trilogy remake will only come through the devs. </p>

<p>A 2026 Roadmap for Battlefield 6 has already been laid out, and it includes news on a RedSec Battle Royale Solo mode, and other changes to the core multiplayer gameplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-is-uss-best-selling-game-of-2025-year-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> worked, and the series is back with all sorts of bangs. Call of Duty needed competition, and Battlefield 6 stepped up to the plate with a welcome return to full-scale military warfare. The game’s launch, the addition of RedSec, and Season 1 injected Battlefield goodness into everyone’s veins, but there’s plenty more scheduled for 2026.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Another great year beckons. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The ‘Battlefield 6 – Community Update – Holiday Wrap-Up’ spoke to the BF community going into Christmas. The player base is expected to grow due to the presence of ‘Xmas noobs,’ and the developer wanted to celebrate ‘an incredible year for the team.’</p>







<p>The blog runs through some obligatory thank you messages to all players—give yourselves a pat on the back—and shares some fascinating numbers. Check out some right here:</p>



<ul>
<li>Played over 1.7 billion matches and logged 383.5 million gameplay hours.</li>



<li>Delivered 12.4 billion kills and 871 million revives.</li>



<li>Destroyed 102 million helicopters and jets.</li>
</ul>



<p>After running through community highlights, it was time for the lowdown on what to expect from 2026.</p>



<p>The team will be “Refining core gameplay, balance, and quality-of-life improvements across Multiplayer, REDSEC, and Portal,” there will be new maps to “introduce fresh tactical opportunities and keep the experience evolving in meaningful ways,” and the developer wants to “Expand Battlefield Labs by bringing more of its experimentation into the live experience.”</p>



<p>Battle Royale players might be interested to hear that BR Solos is still in the pipeline: “We are working through the technical details to deliver it at a quality level that feels right for Battlefield. Once we are confident in the plan and timing, we will share more.”</p>



<p>It’s not a guarantee that it’s happening, but its arrival is likely happening.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Wrapped Isn’t Coming Because of Budget Constraints]]></title>

<p>This time of year is always an exciting time for those with oodles of subscriptions or memberships to various online platforms, because it’s when all the ‘wrapped’ presentations drop. From Spotify to PlayStation and from LinkedIn to YouTube, many platforms partake in the annual wrapped festival, offering key insights into your year as a subscriber or member.</p>



<p>That is, all except for Xbox. In a recent report, it was claimed that Xbox isn’t providing an ‘Xbox Wrapped’ presentation this year because the company has better things to spend its marketing budget on.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-xbox-wrapped-unfortunately">No Xbox Wrapped, Unfortunately</h2>



<p>There were <em>wrapped </em>presentations hailing from all corners of the gaming world this year. The likes of PlayStation, Steam, Discord, and even Nintendo have provided <strong>some kind </strong>of recap for 2025 in gaming. It was a veritable plethora of data for gamers to absorb, but it’s important to stress it’s all just a bit of fun, with some potential bragging rights tacked on.</p>



<p>In a recent report from Windows Central, it was claimed that Xbox isn’t doing a wrapped celebration this year because there’s far too much happening <strong>next year, </strong>and the marketing budget wouldn’t cover it.</p>



<p>Here’s the snippet <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Jez Corden</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My sources suggest that (as you might expect given that it’s now the 18th), that Xbox is not doing a “Wrapped” this year.</p>



<p>A lot of the “marketing budget” that would’ve typically been allocated to something like an “Xbox Wrapped” is being poured into efforts to celebrate these major milestones for Xbox, its brands, and some of its games.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As professed recently by Xbox ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-developer-direct-promises-huge/">upcoming Developer Direct</a>, there are stacks of milestones landing in 2026. For instance, Xbox is celebrating a quarter-century in the business, while Bethesda is ticking off its 40th birthday.</p>



<p>If you were holding out hope that Xbox was just waiting a bit longer than everyone else to release Xbox Wrapped this year, you’re out of luck.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> how <strong>you think </strong>you did this year within the Xbox ecosystem.</p>
