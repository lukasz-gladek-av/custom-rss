<p>Kratos Actor Christopher Judge has expressed his thoughts about going to Egypt for the next God of War game.</p>



<p>We keep hearing updates on spin-off and mainline God of War games, but we have yet to receive an official announcement. We recently saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshots</a> of the canceled multiplayer game emerge online, and now Kratos’ actor has expressed interest in traveling to Egypt for the next mainline release. </p>



<h2 id="h-going-to-egypt-for-the-next-god-of-war-would-be-a-completion-of-my-circle">Going to Egypt for the Next God of War “Would be a Completion of My Circle’ </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/god-of-war-actor-christopher-judge-says-he-hopes-a-potential-sequel-will-take-place-in-egypt-but-i-have-no-doubt-that-no-matter-what-pantheon-it-is-it-will-be-great/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Kratos actor Christopher Judge spoke about going to Egypt for the next God of War game at a panel at MCM London Comic Con. Judge stated that travelling to this location “would be a completion of my circle”, as he is highly popular for playing Teal’c from Stargate. Judge said “but whatever is decided”, before tracking back and stating “if there is another game”, he has “no doubt that no matter what pantheon it is, it will be great.”</p>



<p>Egypt, as the next location for a God of War game, has been a topic that has surfaced online many times in the past. And it makes sense to do so as well, as Kratos has already conquered Greek and Norse pantheons, it’s time for him to face off against a new set of gods. There was also a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> earlier this year that Sony was casting Middle Eastern actors for an unknown AAA game, which could be the next God of War title set in Egypt. </p>



<p>In other news, Amazon’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-casting-call-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casting call</a> for its God of War TV series has leaked. Additionally, the long-rumored Greek God of War game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/greek-god-of-war-game-pushed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly delayed to 2026</a>.
