<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s seasonal content moves on with Season 2. If you’re after the Black Ops 7 Season 2 start date and times, this hub has everything you need to know about the next season and new additions.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-reloaded-starts-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is one of the least commercially successful CoD titles in years; you’re all still playing it anyway. A steady player count means there’s an incentive for Treyarch to deliver the goods to retain the current community. What better way to do this than with a stacked second season?</p>



<p>Season 2 is looking to carry on the game’s early momentum.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-black-ops-7-season-2-coming-out">When Is Black Ops 7 Season 2 Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stick ’em up. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 7 Season 2’s expected release date is currently February 5.</strong></p>



<p>Seasonal live-service models have a certain level of consistency when it comes to start dates and times. As one season ends (usually signified by that season’s Battle Pass end date and time), the next begins. Using Season 1 Reloaded’s data, it’s a fairly logical assumption that Season 2 begins on February 5.</p>



<p>If this changes, IG will update you.</p>







<h2 id="h-expected-black-ops-7-season-2-start-times">Expected Black Ops 7 Season 2 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>As pretty much all Call of Duty seasons start at 9 AM PT, you can look forward to Black Ops 7 Season 2 starting at 9 AM PT first, with other regions facing a slightly different time relative to time zones.</strong></p>



<p>No extra words needed for this one, just check out the table below to see when Season 2 should get underway where you live.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Black Ops 7 Season 2 Start Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00 AM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12:00 PM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5:00 PM—January 8</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 AM—January 9</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-new-black-ops-7-season-2-content-ranked-amp-new-maps">All New Black Ops 7 Season 2 Content: Ranked &amp; New Maps</h2>



<p><strong>Early indications are that BLOPS 7 Season will add Ranked Play for the first time in this iteration, along with new and classic maps, and the usual slew of guns and game modes.</strong></p>



<p>At this early juncture, it’s safe to assume the usual carousel of seasonal content is coming. The armory needs restocking with new toys, game modes are needed to inject new life into the core gameplay, and it wouldn’t be a new season without the new Battle Pass and cosmetics, would it?</p>



<p>But two main additions will likely dominate the headlines: Ranked and Maps.</p>



<h3 id="h-maps">Maps</h3>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-black-ops-7-season-2-maps-have-already-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Black Ops 7 Season 2 Maps leaked</a> well ahead of time. They include <strong>Plaza</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Slums</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Yemen</strong>. There’s always going to be remasters, as it’s easy for the devs, and it helps boost the content count for a new season. On the other hand, no one’s going to reject the chance to play on different maps, especially classics.</p>



<p>There are likely going to be more announced.</p>



<h3 id="h-ranked-mode">Ranked Mode</h3>



<p>You’ve been asking for it, and Treyarch is finally delivering. Ranked Play is coming to BLOPS 7, and it starts with Season 2. Furthermore, it doesn’t appear to be a midseason drop either: Insider Gaming has more on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ranked-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Mode release date</a>.</p>



<p>This signals a new grind for the more experienced and hardcore users among you.</p>

<p>A new report about The Witcher 3’s upcoming rumoured DLC says it could take players to a brand-new region. </p>



<p>Talks about a new The Witcher 3 DLC have been circulating on the internet for quite some time now. Lastly, we learned that the rumoured expansion is scheduled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-will-receive-a-new-dlc-in-may-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in May 2026</a>. Now, it seems some additional details about this expansion have surfaced online, suggesting exploration of Zerrikania. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-3-s-rumoured-dlc-could-be-centered-around-the-zerrikania-region">The Witcher 3’s Rumoured DLC Could Be Centered Around the Zerrikania Region</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw?fbclid=IwY2xjawPKJn1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQBzcnR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN Poland</a> reveals that they have been aware of The Witcher 3’s rumoured DLC for some time; however, they decided not to disclose any information until now. According to what they had learned then, it seems that The Witcher 3’s DLC will take players to a brand-new desert region, where they will encounter exotic fauna and culture, a lot like “Dune-Style” Witcher. What’s more, there are a lot of hints in the games and the books about this region. </p>



<p>The Manticore School is situated in the Zerrikanian desert, which Geralt discovered in The Witcher 3’s Blood and Wine DLC. Additionally, many characters have referenced the school or the desert in the series. There’s also speculation that this is where Ciri could take her Trial of the Grasses and become a Witcher before the arrival of The Witcher 4. </p>



<p>However, information about this new region for The Witcher 3’s DLC surfaced years ago; players should definitely treat it with caution.</p>







<p>In other news, CD Projekt RED has confirmed that The Witcher 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not release in 2026 and the new trilogy will stick to the 6-year plan</a>. Additionally, check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-sword-replica/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-scale replica</a> of The Witcher’s Aerondight Silver Sword.

<p>StarRupture has plenty of secrets hidden away on the map, and finding the Stabilizer Blueprint is a key part of progression, though it’s hard to pinpoint the exact location if you don’t know where to look.</p>



<p>Creepy Jar has plenty planned during early access of StarRupture, as shown by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starrupture-early-access-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed roadmap</a>, and there’s lots to enjoy before the eventual 1.0 release further in the future.</p>



<p>If you’ve reached a sticking point in StarRupture and don’t know where to find the Stabilizer Blueprint, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-stabilizer-blueprint-in-starrupture">Where to Find The Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Here’s the spot. Image via Creepy Jar</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture is hidden away in a specific location a long way from the game’s starting point, so travelling to the location requires preparation.</strong></p>



<p>The exact spot, shown in the image above, is northeast of the starting point in the game. If you have a map and have already travelled near the location, it will be shown as a dark blue area on the map.</p>



<p>Before starting your travel, stock up on food, water, and weapons, as the trip can be perilous and weapons are required to defeat the arachnids that are waiting at the location.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-stabilizer-blueprint-in-starrupture">How to Get The Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture</h2>



<p><strong>Visiting the location where the Stabilizer Blueprint is found is merely the starting point to earn the reward, as there are a few steps to tick off before you can add it to your collection.</strong></p>



<p>The location is covered by a blue cloud, which needs to be cleared by destroying the blue spores scattered around the buildings, and you’ll also need to fend off the alien species that call the area home, which is why bringing a weapon was crucial.</p>



<p>Here’s a breakdown of the steps to take to claim the Stabilizer Blueprint in StarRupture.</p>



<ol>
<li>Destroy the blue spores around the location, found attached to buildings, and eliminate hostile aliens.</li>



<li>Loot all the buildings to collect valuable resources.</li>



<li>Head to the broken stairs and clear out more of the blue spores.</li>



<li>Follow the path of broken platforms and stairs around the tallest area in the location, clearing out the blue spores as you encounter them.</li>



<li>At the top, clear out the final blue spores and loot everything you can.</li>



<li>The Stabilizer Blueprint is waiting in a nearby Storage Box.</li>
</ol>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Ranked Release Date]]></title>

<p>Forget SBMM, the grittier competitors in the CoD community want Ranked and nothing but Ranked. The competitive mode is the usual hunting ground for more serious Call of Duty players, making a Black Ops 7 Ranked Play game mode a necessity—and release date info is known.</p>



<p>A casual game of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-discount-by-50-percent-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is great (with or without SBMM), but Ranked is where the strong and the weak are separated. Ranked Play is a whole different bullet-filled beast. You can literally taste the sweat of try-hards and the feeling of isolation as players lose access to the meta gear they’d normally dominate a non-Ranked game with.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve been looking forward to BLOPS 7 Ranked since day one or feel you’re ready to make the step up, this guide has everything you need to know about Ranked Play.</p>







<h2 id="h-ranked-play-release-date-for-black-ops-7-explained">Ranked Play Release Date For Black Ops 7, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s going to get sweaty. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ranked Play is dropping with Black Ops 7 Season 2’s start date, and this is expected to be February 5.</strong></p>



<p>Using <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-reloaded-starts-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded</a> and basic data from previous seasons (and the Battle Pass), it’s almost certain that Season 2 is kicking off on February 5. There are rumors that Season 2 could be just as big as Season 1 in terms of content, but it could even eclipse the game’s debut season!</p>



<p>Maps are great, new guns can change the meta, and you’ll never say no to a fresh game mode. However, the hardcore fanbase just wants Ranked Play, and Season 2 should be delivering it to your doorstep on launch day.</p>



<p>We’ll update you if there are any changes to this timeframe.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-ranked-mode-in-black-ops-7-from-launch">Why Isn’t Ranked Mode In Black Ops 7 From Launch?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The body and mind are ready. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 didn’t launch with Ranked as it’s presumably a bid from Treyarch to get players used to the game first before launching a fully fledged Ranked Mode.</strong></p>



<p>Pros and elite-level CoD players can jump into Ranked and not struggle, for the most part. But if you give casuals the chance to hop straight into Ranked, it could be a humbling and even sour experience for those wanting to enjoy Call of Duty. It could put people off altogether.</p>



<p>This is why every Call of Duty title doesn’t get Ranked until a few weeks into launch. It also allows the meta to settle—so people aren’t abusing broken guns in Ranked—and gives Treyarch time to adjust accordingly, instead of on the fly.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 Season 2 should finally bring Ranked Play. It’s time to find your ideal loadout, team up with trusted partners, and prepare for the joy and agony of promotion and relegation in Ranked leagues.</p>
