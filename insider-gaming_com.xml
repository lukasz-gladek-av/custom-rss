<p>REPO has exploded onto the scene with its combination of fear-inducing enemies and uncomfortable environments. Its synergy with slapstick comedy and multiplayer chaos is the tip of the iceberg. PC players are enjoying it, but PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch owners are wondering about extra REPO platforms and if it’s on consoles too.</p>



<p>Many breakout hits are traditionally indie titles on PC through Steam. I think of recent hits such as Lethal Company and Content Warning. REPO is following in their footsteps with its brand of valuable-collecting shenanigans. It doesn’t matter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-players-can-play-repo-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how many players you play with in REPO</a>, a good (but cursed) time is assured.</p>



<p>Its Steam player numbers have been extraordinary since launch, but can it also be enjoyed on consoles?</p>

<p><strong>REPO is not currently available on PlayStation 5 or even PlayStation 4.</strong></p>



<p>Developer semiwork’s only previous project was Voidigo—a colorful roguelite. As such, the company is still very much in the process of building its brand. A <a href="https://repogame.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> PS5 port is presumably dependent on the horror game’s long-term success. The more people buy it, the more people play it on Steam, the chances of a PlayStation port increase.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-repo-on-xbox">Is REPO on Xbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox also doesn’t have a REPO port lined up for the same reasons as other popular consoles.</strong></p>



<p>Yep, Microsoft owners face the same problem as PlayStation owners. REPO is very much an indie game, and Steam is a great proving ground for the title. Costs increase once you start factoring in more platforms and ports—let alone to mammoth brands such as PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-repo-on-nintendo-switch">Is REPO on Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch also misses out on a REPO console release.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve seen what I’ve had to say about REPO on PlayStation and Xbox already, the penny has dropped for Nintendo Switch owners too. The Switch is a very receptive platform for indie games, so a REPO release might not be unthinkable.</p>



<p>If the status of REPO’s platforms changes on PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch, we’ll update this guide and let you know.</p>

<p>REPO is the epitome of an overnight sensation that continues to grow. The sky is the limit as it stands, and people are loving REPO as it stands. let us know what you think, and share any funny stories you’ve had with it.</p>
