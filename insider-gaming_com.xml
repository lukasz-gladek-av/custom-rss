<p>Schedule 1 is one of the most impressive success stories of 2025. The indie drug-dealing game is a hit sensation on Steam, but a lawsuit controversy has jeopardized that feel-good story. </p>



<p>The concept of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> is simple. Players start as small-time drug dealers and work their way up, producing drugs and distributing them. However, It’s not always smooth sailing, as law enforcement and rival cartels will force you to defend your empire. </p>



<p>While relatively straightforward, the addicting gameplay loop is a massive draw. In only a few weeks after launching,  Schedule 1 reached nearly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/#:~:text=You're%20a%20small%2Dtime,coast%20city%20of%20Hyland%20Point." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half a million concurrent players</a> at its peak. The meteoric rise inspired <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console port imitations</a> as other developers tried to steal the magic formula. Yet, Schedule 1 also faces similar clone accusations. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-schedule-1-being-sued">Is Schedule 1 Being Sued?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Schedule 1 puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer. Image via TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Schedule 1 is not being sued</strong>, <strong>but the game is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/#:~:text=April%204%2C%202025-,Schedule%201%20Being%20Investigated%20For%20IP%20Copyright%20Infringement%20Claims,full%20investigation%20into%20the%20game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under investigation</a> for IP copyright infringement</strong>. </p>



<p><a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/movie-games-sa-172025-podjecie-decyzji-o-rozpoczeciu-dochodzenia-wzgledem-tworcow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">papbiznes</a> published a document titled “MOVIE GAMES SA (17/2025) Decision to commence investigation against the creators of the Schedule 1 production for claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and related to committing an act of unfair competition against it.”</p>



<p>Movie Games S.A. already had an established foothold in drug-dealing games with Drug Dealer Simulator 1 and Drug Dealer Simulator 2 before Schedule 1, raising questions about whether it is too similar. </p>



<p>The investigation is strongly looking into: “Elements of the game’s plot, mechanics, as well as UI – User Interface.” It finishes by saying: “The Issuer will immediately inform about further actions related to the pursuit of claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and the act of unfair competition in subsequent current reports.”</p>



<p>When news about the investigation surfaced, Schedule 1 fans lept into action and review-bombed the Drug Dealer Simulator games on Steam. The feud forced Movie Games to respond. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-schedule-1-be-sued">Will Schedule 1 be Sued?</h2>



<p><strong>If the investigation concludes that the similarities between Schedule 1 and Drug Dealer Simulator’s game plot, mechanics, UI, or anything else are too close, a lawsuit could be filed. </strong></p>



<p>After the incessant review bombing of Drug Dealer Simulator, Movie Games stepped forward and cleared up any confusion with a post on its <a href="https://x.com/MovieGamesSA/status/1909573722219888913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official X account</a>. </p>



<p>The company made it abundantly clear, “<strong>There is no lawsuit</strong>,” and it’s not the company’s intention to “<strong>Prevent TVGS from selling or developing their game</strong>&nbsp;[Schedule 1].” The statement goes on to say the investigation is being conducted because of the similarities, and “Movie Games, being a publicly traded company,&nbsp;<strong>could face severe litigation for negligence.</strong>“</p>



<p>Movie Games emphasized, “There is no ill will toward TVGS,” and they “<strong>Emailed them best wishes shortly before the release.</strong>“</p>



<p>Despite the reassuring statements, the investigation is ongoing, and we won’t know if there will be a lawsuit until it concludes. </p>



<hr>



<p>The investigation hasn’t slowed down the creation of new content for TVGS. Schedule 1 has an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensive roadmap</a>, including the addition of fishing, shooting, mini-games, and more. In addition, the game regularly receives <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new updates</a> to ensure an enjoyable experience. </p>

<p>On the way to Room 46, you’re likely to come across the Billiard Room. No, we’re not stopping for a quick game as we need to head into here so we can complete the ever-changing Darts puzzle, which offers free bonuses if you can complete it.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-creator-praises-blue-prince-as-one-of-the-best-games-hes-ever-played/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue Prince</a> is a game where I cherish the first few hours. Eventually, you come across the same rooms and items, and it becomes familiar. The initial wonderment comes from the beauty of exploration. You draft new rooms, see what they do and what they hold, and you find curiosities such as the Billiard Room.</p>



<p>Inside awaits a devious little puzzle. If you’re having trouble with it, don’t worry, I did at first. But once you understand its cunningness, it’s easily solvable.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-solve-the-billiard-room-dart-puzzle-in-blue-prince">How to Solve the Billiard Room Dart Puzzle in Blue Prince</h2>

<figure><figcaption>The maths don’t seem to add up. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p><strong>We need to use the mathematical properties of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division to select the correct numbers on the dart board and beat the puzzle.</strong></p>



<p>In theory, with enough time and patience, you can solve the puzzle with a process of elimination. But it’s more fun and satisfying to work everything out for ourselves—<strong>and it would take hours!</strong></p>



<p>You need to complete several stages of increasingly more difficult calculations and understand the colors to beat <a href="https://www.blueprincegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blue Prince</a>‘s Dartboard test in the Billiard Room.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-dartboard-colors-mean-in-blue-prince">What do Dartboard Colors Mean in Blue Prince?</h2>



<p>Below is a handy chart showing what each color means and how they influence the puzzle. You are likely to see one to complete the puzzle.</p>



<p>I haven’t seen any other colors during my playtime, but developer Dogubomb could always add more, or the late-game may feature further complications.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Segment Color</th><th data-align="center">What it Means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Light Blue</td><td data-align="center">Addition</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Yellow</td><td data-align="center">Subtraction</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pink</td><td data-align="center">Multiplication</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Purple</td><td data-align="center">Division</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-dartboard-puzzle-example-in-blue-prince">Dartboard Puzzle Example in Blue Prince</h2>



<p><strong>The puzzle, in my experience, has the same number of steps, and the equations become more difficult. Use the numbers on the inside of the board first and make your way to the outside of the board. Your answer should never be above 20.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s an example of how to complete the puzzle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Interact with the dartboard to start the puzzle.</li>



<li>The first step is likely to be a single blue number—<strong>the answer is the highlighted number</strong>.</li>



<li>So, if 14 is highlighted blue, the answer is <strong>14</strong> to start.</li>



<li>Next, 6 could be highlighted in yellow, with 14 still blue.</li>



<li>14 minus 6 equals <strong>8</strong>, so press this number.</li>



<li>8 could be in blue next, with the number 2 highlighted in pink.</li>



<li>If we take 8 and multiply it by 2, we get <strong>16</strong>.</li>



<li>Say the number 18 is in blue and 3 is purple now, we divide 18 by 3 to get <strong>6</strong>.</li>



<li>For the next step, 20 is blue, 10 is yellow, 2 is pink, and 4 is purple.</li>



<li>This means 20 minus 10 equals 10. Then 10 multiplied by 2 equals 20 again, and then 20 divided by 4 equals <strong>5</strong>!</li>
</ol>
