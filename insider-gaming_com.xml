            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-release-date-start-times/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nhl-26-release-date-explained%E2%80%94exact-start-times-release-date-confirmed.1286190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The annual home of hockey returns with NHL 26. One of EA’s many sports licenses is back for another outing on the rink, and if you want to know when NHL 26 releases, we have its launch date and start time details in one handy hub.</p>



<p>EA’s other sports titles are where the headlines usually go: EA FC, Madden, and College Football. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-release-date-platforms-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NHL 26</a> is evidence that the company also boasts the NHL license, and many people still loyally buy it each year. A reworked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-features-include-be-a-pro-and-gameplay-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Be A Pro</a> mode, a revamped ICE-Q 2.0 engine, and X-Factors are integral cogs in the new setup.</p>



<p>If you need a virtual ice hockey fix, then NHL 26 is the one. Let’s check out its release date and when you can start playing it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-nhl-26-coming-out">When is NHL 26 Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ready for a match. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NHL 26 hits the ice on September 12 across both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles.</strong></p>



<p>The game does have early access if you want to play earlier. If you’re waiting for launch, though, you’ve only got a few more days to wait. The NHL franchise is a lot more restrictive where platforms are concerned. Whereas EA FC 26, for example, will release on all PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC platforms, NHL 26 is only on current-gen PS and Xbox hardware.</p>



<p>It’s unclear if this is a cost-cutting measure. Regardless, September 12 is when NHL 26 hits digital and physical shelves, and its launch times vary depending on your region.</p>



<h2 id="h-nhl-26-start-times">NHL 26 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>According to the official PlayStation Store, NHL 26 will go live from 9 AM PDT on September 12—with other time zones to follow soon after.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-PPSA26785_00-NHL26STANDARD000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NHL 26’s PS Store</a> listing suggests a 9AM PDT start time. This could be subject to change, but if it’s not, you know when to prepare for the game’s arrival.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I’ve provided additional time zones below to cover America’s large reach, plus a couple of key zones for worldwide readers. Check out NHL 26’s release times here.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">NHL 26 Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Daylight Time (PDT)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Daylight Time (CDT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00 AM—September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)</td><td data-align="center">12:00 PM—September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">5:00 PM—September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT)</td><td data-align="center">2:00 AM—September 13</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Graham Greene lit up screens throughout a glittering 45-year career. The acclaimed actor did it all and has sadly passed away at the age of 73. Many gamers will fondly recognize and remember him for his incredible portrayal of Rains Fall in Rockstar Games’ Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>



<p>My first memory of Graham Greene was his role as Detective Joe Lambert in Die Hard with a Vengeance. He plays a valiant cop who ultimately tries his best to save kids he believes are in mortal danger. This is one of countless roles Graham accrued over his 40-plus-year career before his untimely passing on September 1.</p>



<p>Despite a resume anyone would snatch up in a heartbeat, Graham only had one video game role—Rains Fall in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-could-launch-on-switch-2-this-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2-voice-actor-graham-greene-passes-away-aged-73">Red Dead Redemption 2 Voice Actor Graham Greene Passes Away Aged 73</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It will make future RDR2 playthroughs harder. Credit to YouTube channel: <br>I’ll Give You Insight</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve played <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RDR2</a>, you know how important Rains Fall is to the story. He does his best to rein in his son—Eagle Flies—and advocates peace wherever possible.</p>



<p>Graham absolutely nails the role perfectly. It’s a wonder that this was his lone video game opportunity when you think about it. Technically, it wasn’t the only gaming project the actor was attached to.</p>



<p>In 2023, Graham played Marlon in HBO’s epic adaptation of Naughty Dog’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-receives-fewer-emmy-nominations-than-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> for one episode. He was also in 2008’s Turok: Son of Stone—but that reference is a bit more out there.</p>



<p>The actor graced TV shows, movies, and one of the greatest video games of all time, and it’s his role as Rains Fall that further cemented his legacy in the memories of millions of gamers.</p>



<p>Do you have a favorite Graham Greene role over the decades? Let me know, and also let us know if this is giving you the edge to go back and play Red Dead Redemption 2 for the tenth time.</p>

<p>The Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test was the game’s first proper hands-on opportunity. Don’t cry because it’s over, smile that it happened. Or if that doesn’t work, you can always enjoy the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds demo speeding your way.</p>



<p>This isn’t Sonic’s first foray into kart racers. Team Sonic Racing performed very well, and clearly well enough to warrant a full sequel. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworld-release-date-trailer-features-minecraft-persona-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> is that very sequel, and it’s just had its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Network Test</a>. These types of tests are common and an easy way to ascertain a multiplayer title’s online connectivity and stability.</p>



<p>The beta has finished, meaning if you didn’t get a chance to log in, you’ve missed this window. But as one door closes, another opens.</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-demo-launches-in-september">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Demo Launches In September</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You don’t need to hide in the shadows. Image via Sega</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve learned that Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is debuting a new single-player demo in “mid-September,” thanks to the Sonic The Hedgehog <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X page</a>.</p>



<p>“The Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test has officially ended! Thank you everyone for participating! And in case you missed it… A single-player demo will be released in mid-September! We hope you keep coming back for more races!” said the page in a September 2 message.</p>



<p>September is a busy month in the gaming calendar. The likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-26-announces-12-new-icons-including-francesco-totti-andres-iniesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC 26</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a> are some of the monstrous names propping up the month. If you can find time, a Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds demo will be wedged into the middle of this.</p>

<p>I didn’t get a chance to try the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test. It seemed to be fun, so let me know if you played it through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. Can it handle the gargantuan task of beating Mario Kart World?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>POE2 player numbers have been dwindling in recent weeks. This happens to many games after their initial launch and hype. But players have flooded back to Path of Exile 2 to make player count numbers blow up—thanks to the ‘Third Edict’ update and free weekend incentive.</p>



<p>Arguably, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-all-boss-powers-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4</a>‘s biggest competitor is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/path-of-exile-2-best-class-build-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>. The ARPG launched to great success in December 2024. Over half a million of you flooded the Path of Exile 2 servers to see what the fuss was all about. Peak numbers were still close to the 200K mark by January 2025, and things have tailed off a bit—save for the April 2025 update.</p>



<p> However, a free weekend opportunity combined with a huge new content update has revitalized the ARPG sequel once more.</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-third-edict-update-amp-free-weekend-boosts-numbers">Path of Exile 2 Third Edict Update &amp; Free Weekend Boosts Numbers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roaring back into life. Image credit: Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Path of Exile 2 was free-to-play for everyone from August 29 to September 1. Whether you own the game or don’t, everyone was entitled to download the game and try it out.</p>



<p>This was to get as many eyes and hours on the game’s Third Edict content update as possible.</p>



<p>According to the POE 2 <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3826469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>: “You will get access to all the content currently available in Path of Exile 2, including the newly released Third Edict Content Update. There are no limits to character leveling, and all progress made during this period will be saved to your account. When the Free Weekend ends, you can continue playing by purchasing an Early Access key or by waiting until Path of Exile 2 becomes free to play at full release.”</p>



<p>For reference, Steam Charts says Path of Exile 2 achieved around 8,000 players on average in July 2025, with a peak of around 14,000. Whereas August 2025 saw an average of about 25,000 users, but a peak of over 352,000! The average would’ve been low throughout the whole month, up until the free weekend right at the end of the month.</p>



<p>Did you get a chance to play Path of Exile 2 during the free weekend? Are you going to continue to play it? It seems to be a bold strategy that paid off for Grinding Gear Games.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-debut-could-finally-be-happening-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-ps4-debut-could-finally-be-happening-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1286103/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reputable social media has found traces of the first Marvel Rivals PS4 update. It’s long been suspected that a PS4 version of the superhero shooter would happen eventually, thank the Star Lord, it seems to be coming.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-c9-mean-in-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has been a huge hit for NetEase Games. It’s surprising, really, as Marvel fans are insatiable for the hero shooter and anything Marvel-related in general. It takes the best of Overwatch and sprinkles in its own flair and features to make an excellent free-to-play shooter.</p>



<p>Many people still haven’t made the step up to current-gen hardware, and if you’re a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-marvel-rivals-on-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS4</a> user, it might be good news for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-on-ps4-update-discovered">Marvel Rivals On PS4 Update Discovered</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A confusing message. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>, this has been uncovered: “Marvel Rivals Update 01.01 Released. (PS4 Version).”</p>



<p>This would suggest the first update and patch notes for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-version-might-become-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals’ debut on PS4</a>. This is the most recent update on the port, and the X page posted on August 13 with another message indicating the port was happening: “Marvel Rivals – PS4.”</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals on PlayStation 4 feels like reality more than a dream, and if you are a last-gen owner, you finally get to see what the fuss is all about. Also, I’d hazard a guess that if Marvel Rivals is coming to older PlayStation hardware, then Xbox One owners might also be in luck! I’m worried about the game’s performance, but let’s hope it holds up!</p>



<p>Stay tuned for updates and details.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Which Call of Duty is Free?—Play COD For Free, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/which-call-of-duty-is-free/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-call-of-duty-is-free-%E2%80%94play-cod-for-free-explained.1286088/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty has existed for more than two decades, and in that time, dozens of games have been released to flesh out the franchise. It’s arguably the most popular first-person shooter series of all time, and today, we’re helping people get a taste of it by answering an all-important question: ‘Which Call of Duty is free?’</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll outline which Call of Duty games are free and which ones you need to pay for.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-free-call-of-duty-games">Are There Free Call of Duty Games?</h2>



<p>Few franchises sell quite so many copies as Call of Duty does. It’s a titan of the gaming industry, and every year, even amidst bad press, the annual Call of Duty release tops the charts. In 2022, Modern Warfare II was released, and within ten days, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-2-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had topped $1 billion in sales</a>.</p>



<p>However, as it’s a premium franchise, Call of Duty can be expensive, and typically, every new title will boast a top-tier pricing point as well as a paid battle pass and other in-game bundles and items that also cost real money. It can get very pricey, very quickly, and for some players, the need to find a free Call of Duty game arises. </p>



<p>With that in mind, which Call of Duty is free?</p>



<h2 id="h-good-news-you-can-play-call-of-duty-for-free">Good News: You <em>Can </em>Play Call of Duty For Free</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: Activision</figcaption></figure>







<p>There are two ways that you can play Call of Duty for free, and they’re both dramatically popular. </p>



<p>Firstly, there’s the Warzone ecosystem. This battle-royale-backed platform features one of the most popular titles to ever emerge into the genre, boasting hundreds of millions of players and an ever-changing landscape. It debuted in 2020, and in the years that it has been active, it has seen all-new maps, modes, events, and the growth of a massive community.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Warzone (in every capacity) is free to play across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms – it’s also a crossplay title, which has served to unite cross-platform players. There’s a possibility that Warzone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-mwii-ported-to-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will also be available on Nintendo devices</a>.</p>



<p>If Warzone isn’t your kind of thing, then you can get started with the <em>other </em>free Call of Duty game – COD Mobile. This is a handheld-exclusive game that has existed since 2019, and it’s a monumental title that, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1112479/call-of-duty-mobile-downloads-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to Statista</a>, secures around four million new downloads every single month.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Mobile incorporates content from several successful COD games, featuring a wide range of game modes, a battle royale mode, and plenty of customisation options. It’s free-to-play, but there are many microtransactions under the surface that fuel the development of the game itself.</p>



<p>That answers the titular question, ‘which Call of Duty is free’. There’s a battle royale platform that also includes an extraction shooter sub-mode and a mobile platform that is ever-expanding. That’s not a bad selection, considering it’ll cost you absolutely nothing to get involved with either of them!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Map Leak Shows Large US Setting For ‘Season One’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-map-leak-large-us-setting/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-map-leak-shows-large-us-setting-for-%E2%80%98season-one%E2%80%99.1286064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another major Battlefield 6 leak is circulating on social media, with the culprit uploading ten minutes of gameplay from a previously unseen map, titled either Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm. The ten-minute video showcases a stunning, large map reportedly set in California, and it has been dubbed the first map to come to Season One of Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>It’s a positive look, regardless of how the content has surfaced. Fans were asking for larger maps following the end of the recent open beta, and that’s exactly what this leaked map represents.</p>



<h2 id="h-latest-battlefield-6-leak-reveals-larger-map">Latest Battlefield 6 Leak Reveals Larger Map</h2>



<p>In a ten-minute video leaked by the same source that uncovered the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 battle royale map</a>, we get a walkthrough of what is either named Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm. This naming convention comes from the original poster who first shared the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6ap3s/bf6s_season_1_map_badlands_video_leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video on Reddit</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the linked video uploaded on Streamable:</p>



<p><strong><em>Video removed by copyright request</em></strong></p>



<p>Bizarre perspective aside, the video offers a neat look at one of the larger maps coming to Battlefield 6, assumedly with the game’s first season. There are oil derricks spread across a vast, rocky area, pitted with long sight lines and many avenues that would make vehicular combat on this map a dream.</p>



<p>Another area on the map appears to house an airstrip with some hangars, and there are factory-style buildings, rolling hills, and even what looks like a small village. It’s a super diverse map with plenty to uncover. It’s the kind of thing that large-scale Conquest fans have been begging for, and I can certainly see it becoming a fan favorite at first blush.</p>
