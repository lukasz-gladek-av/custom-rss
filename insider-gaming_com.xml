<p>007: First Light’s gameplay director has revealed that the game’s combat will take references from the Batman Arkham and Uncharted series. </p>



<p>IO Interative’s upcoming James Bond-themed adventure is all set to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-delay-may-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on May 27, 2026</a>. Ahead of the launch, the developers are revealing small tidbits to build hype, and now we have been given more details about the game’s combat and other gameplay elements.</p>







<h2 id="h-007-first-light-takes-inspiration-from-arkham-games-for-combat">007: First Light Takes Inspiration from Arkham Games for Combat</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2MTwTrcGtA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-aims-to-channel-batman-arkham-freeflow-combat-with-uncharted-spectacle/1100-6538356/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamespot</a>), 007: First Light gameplay director Andreas Krogh spoke about drawing inspiration from Arkham Games for combat. Krogh stated that in the approach to close combat sequences, players will see references to Arkham games. But there are also “some modern takes on destructibility in the environment”, which players would not have seen in Arkham, but in games like Uncharted. </p>



<p>Krogh elaborated that IO Interactive has a deeper system as they want to do “more of it”. In terms of shooting, players will also see references from modern games; however, which games exactly were revealed. The developers had to explore this area, since Hitman used combat as a last resort, and the area wasn’t as deeply developed as the stealth experience, so they had to look outside to see how they could improve it. </p>
