            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I was ushered into a replication of Svartrau Cathedral at Gamescom and sat down before a screen to experience half an hour of live gameplay from The Blood of Dawnwalker. This vampiric debut title from Rebel Wolves has sat firmly on my radar since the studio was opened, and I was beyond excited to finally see it unfold before my eyes.</p>



<p>In a guided segment, I saw combat, exploration, puzzle-solving, and cinematic sequences unravel, with the Rebel Wolves team showcasing as much of The Blood of Dawnwalker as possible in a relatively short window.</p>



<p>Here’s my full preview based on that presentation.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-will-rival-the-witcher">The Blood of Dawnwalker Will Rival The Witcher</h2>



<p>Rebel Wolves took me deep into a reimagination of 14th-century Europe, complete with Gothic architecture aplenty, dark and foreboding streets, and mythical themes of monsters lurking in the shadows. I quickly learned that our hero, Coen, is one of those monsters, cursed with vampiric powers and a bloodthirsty mission to save his family before a ticking clock runs out.</p>



<p>The demo started some ways into the game, with Coen already boasting many upgrades and being around a third through his ‘time limit’ to rescue his family before the worst could happen.</p>



<p>Instantly, I could see how ‘Witcher-coded’ The Blood of Dawnwalker is. This game comes from Rebel Wolves, an all-new studio made up of a mix of talent, much of which has worked extensively on CDPR’s The Witcher franchise in recent years.</p>



<p>It was almost inevitable, but much of the UI, the combat mechanics, menus, and even music are deeply reminiscent of The Witcher. That’s not a bad thing, but it <strong>might </strong>harm Dawnwalker down the line when it’s trying to stand apart from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-witcher-4-trailer-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games like The Witcher 4</a>.</p>



<p>I can honestly say that, if nothing else, Dawnwalker will be <strong>a strong rival </strong>to The Witcher. The hybrid action-RPG flow of the game promotes skill paths and brutal combat sequences unfolding in real-time, and the addition of vampirism only makes the game more visceral and visually incredible.</p>



<p>As I watched the Blood of Dawnwalker preview, I saw Coen walk up walls as though they were floors, dart between rooftops as a cloud of smoke, and dispatch enemies with gnashing teeth and slashing claws. This is his <strong>night form</strong>, and it’s remarkable to behold.</p>



<p>In the daytime, Coen is much more human and relies more readily on swords, daggers, and traditional approaches to navigate the game’s open world environment.</p>



<p>I was pleased to note that very few bugs were present in the demo, despite Rebel Wolves offering a disclaimer warning us of the possibility. I noticed <strong>one </strong>issue, and that was when Coen chopped off an enemy’s head, and it proceeded to float away like a balloon.</p>



<h2 id="h-coen-is-already-memorable">Coen is Already Memorable</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>I found myself pulled in by Coen’s story, aided by the reiteration of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-first-trailer-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cinematic trailer</a> that was used to unveil Rebel Wolves’ The Blood of Dawnwalker in the first place. I’ve always been a fan of vampire-themed tales, and Blood of Dawnwalker hits the nail on the head in that respect.</p>



<p>As the minutes ticked by, I watched a Rebel Wolves representative explore Svartrau, hunting for a powerful sword that would be a key tool in the fight against the vampiric overlords who had claimed Coen’s family. The journey took me from a gorgeous and thriving cityscape to catacombs and tombs beneath the bustling streets.</p>



<p>I was informed that while players have a ‘time limit’, Rebel Wolves have cleverly employed control tactics to make sure users can still enjoy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-devs-quality-not-quantity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything on offer in Blood of Dawnwalker</a>. The clock will only tick down when certain tasks are completed, and you can see ahead of time how much a certain action will cost you. It’s a very transparent system, and I like it already.</p>



<p>As the Blood of Dawnwalker preview came to an end, I watched a tense boss fight unfold, with Coen battling Mihai, a long-forgotten soul trapped by betrayers hundreds of years before. He uses similar techniques to Coen, which makes the fight a relatively matched battle.</p>



<p>This is where we learn more about the Dawnwalker lore, understanding how important a character Coen is and how unique his condition is to the world around him.</p>



<p>I can already promise you that Blood of Dawnwalker is now one of my most highly anticipated titles. It might remind everyone who plays it of The Witcher, but in many ways, it’s doing certain things <strong>better </strong>than CDPR, and both Dawnwalker and The Witcher 4 can exist happily in the same space.</p>



<p>Blood of Dawnwalker is slated for release in 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-steal-a-brainrot-codes-and-rewards/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-roblox-steal-a-brainrot-codes-rewards%E2%80%94every-august-2025-active-code.1279341/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Are you hunting for Roblox Steal a Brainrot codes?</p>



<p>Steal a Brainrot is the most popular game on Roblox right now, tying in terms of player record with Grow a Garden. In Steal a Brainrot, players do exactly that – <strong>they steal Brainrots</strong>. If you’re enjoying this insanely popular game and are hunting for all Steal a Brainrot codes and rewards that are active <strong>now</strong>, look no further than this guide.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve captured every Steal a Brainrot code so you can unlock all the key benefits and rewards in a matter of seconds. If you’ve been trying to figure out how to use Steal a Brainrot codes, I’ve covered that too.</p>



<p>Read on to see all the latest Steal a Brainrot codes.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-steal-a-brainrot-code-in-roblox-august-2025">Every Steal a Brainrot Code in Roblox (August 2025)</h2>



<p><strong>It might sound bizarre, but there are no Steal a Brainrot codes in August 2025</strong>. Since the game was released, the developer ‘Brazilian Spyder’ has neglected to provide a function for redeeming any reward codes in Steal a Brainrot.</p>



<p>The only way you can unlock Brainrots in this game is to steal them from other players, which is the core gameplay loop of Steal a Brainrot.</p>



<h3 id="h-will-steal-a-brainrot-ever-have-rewards">Will Steal a Brainrot Ever Have Rewards?</h3>



<p>It’s a good question, and I’d like to say for sure one way or another, but it’s entirely up to the developer.</p>



<p>Grow a Garden, one of the most popular games ever introduced to the Roblox platform, has <strong>plenty of codes </strong>for players to activate and soak up, but Steal a Brainrot just doesn’t follow suit. There are no codes in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/109983668079237/Steal-a-Brainrot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steal a Brainrot</a>, nor is there any way to redeem them.</p>



<p><strong>Yet.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-secrets-in-steal-a-brainrot">How to Get Secrets in Steal a Brainrot</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As there are no Steal a Brainrot codes, you’re restricted to two methods when it comes to getting secret characters in Steal a Brainrot:</p>



<ul>
<li>Purchasing them using earned cash</li>



<li>Stealing them from other players</li>
</ul>



<p>Most players follow a ‘server jump’ tactic to enter a server, scan for valuable secrets, and then steal them when the owners aren’t looking. If there are no valuable secrets on a given server, players just complete a jump to another one.</p>



<p>If you’re going hard on stealing Brainrots from other players, you’ll need to buy gear to help you trap them.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you can try using a private server combined with a conveyor belt to hopefully roll a valuable secret character.</p>



<h3 id="h-most-valuable-secret-brainrots-in-steal-a-brainrot">Most Valuable Secret Brainrots in Steal a Brainrot</h3>



<p>Here are some of the most valuable secret characters in Steal a Brainrot. Be aware that the values might have changed since this guide was published:</p>



<ul>
<li>Garama and Madundung (10 Billion)</li>



<li>Nuclearo Dinossauro (2.5 Billion)</li>



<li>La Grande Combinasion (1 Billion)</li>



<li>Chicleteira Bicicleteira (750 Million)</li>
</ul>



<p>Let me know below or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what your most valuable Brainrot is.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-steal-a-brainrot-rewards">Where to Find Steal a Brainrot Rewards</h2>



<p>The best way to find Steal a Brainrot codes is to keep this page bookmarked and check back regularly. Failing that, you can join the Brazilian Spyder Discord server for the game and hope that the developers announce the addition of a Steal a Brainrot codes function in Roblox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tens of millions of players have flocked to Roblox this weekend to participate in a special, limited-time event backed by the two biggest games in the Roblox ecosystem. Grow a Garden, joined by the more recently successful Steal a Brainrot, have linked forces in an ‘Admin War’ event that pushed Roblox’s concurrent player count to <strong>47 MILLION+</strong>.</p>



<p>This shatters the previous record set in June, originally spearheaded by <strong>just </strong>Grow a Garden. Steal a Brainrot is the latest monumental success in the Roblox space, and it continues to soar.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-admin-war-in-roblox">What is the Admin War in Roblox?</h2>



<p>On social media, Jandel (<em>Grow a Garden</em>) and SpyderSammy (<em>Steal a Brainrot</em>) have been engaged in a digital beef to promote an Admin War event in Roblox. This event has propelled Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot to the top of the charts and the history books alike, with more than <strong>30 million concurrent players </strong>enjoying these two games alone.</p>



<p>This has now cemented Roblox as boasting the record for the highest CCU in gaming history.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365329529675882496/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on LinkedIn</a>, Roblox Strategist James Purell noted that the recent PR issues that have set Roblox alight are doing nothing to slow the platform’s growth:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>Now Roblox is officially the largest gaming platform by concurrent users and also holds the record for highest CCU game in the world.</p><p>While Roblox corporate deals with PR issues, developers like Jandel and Sammy are building experiences that millions of kids can’t stop playing. They’re the ones pushing the platform forward with innovation and community building.</p><p>Yes, Roblox 100% needs to do better on safety, but these developers are creating the content that keeps 47M people engaged. They’re the real engine behind the numbers – not Roblox corporate.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>In a similar sentiment, Atlas Creative’s CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaelherriger_roblox-hit-47-million-concurrent-users-this-activity-7365080265284567040-tD_J/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Michael Herriger</a>, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The future of gaming is happening right in front of us. Great job to all the devs and for Roblox for propping up great games.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>No game on the market can come close to Roblox right now, which is <strong>technically </strong>more of an ecosystem than a single title. It’s unfair to refer to Roblox as ‘a game’ when it’s the most diverse UGC-backed universe in the industry.</p>



<p>Those taking part in the Admin War between Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot are picking their side and soaking up the special event before the weekend is up and things return to normal.</p>



<p>Which side did you pick in the war between Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>COD NEXT, the monumental event that unravels the short-term future of the Call of Duty franchise, sits firmly on the horizon. It’s set to drop in a matter of weeks, unveiling everything coming in Black Ops 7 and beyond. This will follow the latest trailer and preview that was showcased during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering when COD NEXT 2025 will take place or how to watch COD NEXT when it surfaces, read on. I’ve got all the information you need, including predictions.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-cod-next-2025-being-streamed">When is COD NEXT 2025 Being Streamed?</h2>



<p><strong>COD NEXT will be streamed live on September 30, 2025. </strong>It’s set to feature several hours of Call of Duty content and will almost certainly boast the usual arrangement of COD creators and pro players streaming the game from a centralized location.</p>



<p>COD NEXT 2025 is set to take place in <strong>Las Vegas</strong>, and in typical COD NEXT fashion, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ll see trailers</a>, gameplay walkthroughs, and dev panels unfold during the event. The insights will be unparalleled, and we’ll come away from COD NEXT with all the knowledge we’ll need for Black Ops 7, which will be released worldwide on November 14.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-watch-cod-next-2025">Where to Watch COD NEXT 2025</h2>



<p>The best place to watch COD NEXT 2025 is, as always, via the official Call of Duty channels. Every year, Call of Duty NEXT rewards viewers with exclusive drops that they can redeem in-game, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Beta codes</li>



<li>Double XP tokens</li>



<li>Exclusive charms, skins, sprays, or emblems</li>
</ul>







<p>Here are the links you’ll need to watch COD NEXT:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/callofduty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty on YouTube</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/callofduty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty on Twitch</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Alternatively, you’ll be able to watch <strong>some </strong>of COD NEXT by tuning in to see if your favorite Call of Duty streamer is broadcasting live from the event in Las Vegas on September 30. This will afford you a first-person perspective of Black Ops 7, but you might miss things like the developer panels and trailers.</p>



<h2 id="h-cod-next-2025-predictions">COD NEXT 2025 Predictions</h2>



<p>It’s easy to predict that we’ll see stacks of Black Ops 7 multiplayer content at COD NEXT. We’ll likely explore the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-weapon-build-feature-makes-sharing-loadouts-easier/">create-a-class systems</a>, maps, modes (especially new ones like Skirmish), and potentially ‘extra’ deliverables like Ranked or the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7’s Zombies platform will be revealed in full, and like the multiplayer ecosystem, we could see some creator-driven activations that’ll allow Activision’s studios to dive deep into the fan-favorite mode.</p>
