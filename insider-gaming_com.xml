<p>Nintendo has denied claims that generative AI was used in promotional images for their new “My Mario” toy line.</p>



<p>Nintendo announced on Thursday, January 8, 2025, that its My Mario products would launch in the United States on February 19. On social media, they advertised the lineup with pictures of parents playing with their children and several products from the new line. Some who saw the images raised concerns that the company was using generative AI in its marketing, citing the way adults’ hands appear in some of the photos.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-and-campaign-actress-deny-gen-ai-usage">Nintendo And Campaign Actress Deny Gen AI Usage</h2>



<p>One of the models, Brittoni O’myah Sinclair, even commented on Nintendo’s Instagram post to deny using generative AI in the campaign. Now, Nintendo has commented on the matter, telling Insider Gaming that no generative AI was used in the campaign.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The topic of generative AI continues to become more prominent in gaming as Gen AI tools become more commonplace and accessible. Recently, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stripped of its wins </a>at The Indie Game Awards due to the use of generative AI. Also, Larian Studios, the developers of Divinity, recently said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-devs-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-for-concept-art/">they would not use Gen AI</a> tools for concept art or dialogue.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-1st-removed-from-player-accounts/</link>
            <guid>1402501</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve never played Fallout 76, Bethesda Game Studios’ post-apocalyptic MMORPG, you’d be excused for having no idea what ‘Fallout 1st’ is. It’s the game’s premium and entirely optional subscription service that unlocks a wealth of bonuses, boosts, and advantages for subscribers, and historically, some have dubbed it a ‘pay-to-win’ service.</p>



<p>In recent social circles, news surfaced regarding the Fallout 1st subscription service, and it wasn’t good. It was claimed by some Japanese users that Bethesda Game Studios suddenly stripped them of their paid subscriptions without warning because the service <strong>wasn’t supposed to be available to Xbox users in Japan in the first place</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-76-subscriptions-stripped-from-japanese-gamers">Fallout 76 Subscriptions Stripped from Japanese Gamers</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 is a premium service that the most dedicated users pay a monthly (or yearly) fee to uphold. It unlocks various benefits, such as free monthly ‘Atoms’, exclusive cosmetics, fancy base-building items, handy storage containers, and the ability to <strong>host private servers</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’re anyone who is sinking time into Fallout 76, you should at least <strong>consider </strong>Fallout 1st, as the quality-of-life improvements it offers for the nearly decade-old MMORPG are insane.</p>



<p>However, certain users <strong>can’t </strong>take advantage of those bonuses as of a few days ago.</p>



<p>On social media, Japanese users started complaining that Bethesda Game Studios had stripped them of their Fallout 1st subscriptions without so much as a warning. In one post on Medium, a user explained that contacting Bethesda or Xbox’s support channels resulted in a stock message being offered:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Fallout 1st is not officially offered for Xbox in Japan. There was a period when it was mistakenly available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the story goes, Fallout 1st <strong><span>rarely</span> worked properly </strong>in Japan, for whatever reason. Suddenly, in April 2024, it popped up on the Japanese Xbox Store and <strong>stayed</strong>. Users could run their subscriptions without any issues, and it was a bountiful time to be a Fallout 76 fan within the territory of Japan.</p>



<p>Then, ‘around New Year’s Eve’, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1q83g4h/japanese_xbox_user_fallout_1st_subscription_was/?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20260109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">players started explaining</a> that their subscriptions had been stripped from their accounts without any warning. If you <strong>have </strong>Fallout 1st, play for hundreds of hours, and then <strong>lose </strong>Fallout 1st, it can have a pretty dire knock on your experience, especially when it comes to storage of junk, ammunition, healing items, and so on.</p>



<p>On Reddit, one user explained the situation quite nicely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>playing this game without fallout 1st is such a nightmare, and japanese are one of the biggest population contributor in xbox oce/sea region server, if the region lose them it will be kinda dead</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was reported that PlayStation 5 and Steam-based users <strong>have no issue </strong>running their Fallout 1st subscriptions in Japan.</p>



<p>As detailed <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/fallout-76-20260106-399011/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Automaton</a>, a Japanese outlet, no official explanation has been offered by Bethesda Game Studios or Microsoft to explain why the service was a) suddenly made available, and b) removed from the grasp of Japanese users without warning.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Weird New ARC Raiders Exploit Has Players Building Mobile Barricades]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent hours, clips have started emerging on social media showcasing ARC Raiders players creating mobile barricade systems via a newly-discovered exploit. With the assistance of ziplines and deployable barricades, users are building semi-useless bulletproof shields that they can carry either in front of themselves or as a complete, 360-degree shield.</p>



<p>It sounds strange, and it’s hard to convey, so be sure to check out the clips below to understand what we’re talking about.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-barricade-exploit-is-pretty-hilarious">ARC Raiders Barricade Exploit is Pretty Hilarious</h2>



<p>The recent barricade exploit in ARC Raiders has been popularized by streamers like TheBurntPeanut. The award-winning streamer was captured experimenting with the exploit during a recent broadcast, when one of his teammates – Hutch – was seen enshrouded by a four-barricade shield.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a later clip, the creator was using a bizarre contraption made up of a barricade, zipline, and jolt mine to push along a corridor while trying to deflect damage with his mobile shield. It wasn’t a successful effort, which has prompted ARC Raiders players to ridicule the exploit, dubbing it completely pointless.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple to complete this exploit. For those wanting to build a large, mobile shield, you’ll need four ziplines, four deployable barricades, and a ‘depot battery’. You need to place ziplines onto the battery, and then once deployed, you can place a barricade <strong>on </strong>the zipline, with a little fiddling around.</p>



<p>Do that four times, and you have your shield.</p>



<p>In the second clip from TheBurntPeanut, you can see the zipline trick was only completed once, creating a ‘riot shield’ of sorts rather than an encircling barricade.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mpc-25-kicked-out-of-cdl-by-pro-players/</link>
            <guid>1402345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League has come under intense scrutiny once again from fans due to a questionable GA that has locked down anyone attempting to use the MPC-25 SMG. The weapon was used <strong>very briefly</strong> in recent days, most notably by Skyz, and all of a sudden, pro players have decided to nix the gun ahead of Major I.</p>



<p>This pushes the CDL back to a two-weapon meta, forcing players to use the Dravec and M15 once again, prompting an outcry from fans desperate for a little variety ahead of the season’s first Major tournament.</p>







<h2 id="h-mpc-25-is-gone-from-the-cdl">MPC-25 is Gone From the CDL</h2>



<p>The MPC-25 lasted no time at all in the Call of Duty League, the top flight of COD esports. It was used for a couple of hours and then pushed clean out of the rotation by a fresh GA (Gentleman’s Agreement).</p>



<p>This has prompted fans of the League to take to social media to rage against ‘soft’ pro players who will do anything to control every facet of the ecosystem.</p>



<p>ACHES, one of the most prolific former pro players in the space, said: <em>‘Slasher retired and the next day they GA’d the one gun used on 2 maps. The last of the old guard is gone.’</em></p>



<p>Sam ‘Octane’ Larew, one of the more recent retirees from the Call of Duty League, wrote:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The current set of pro players gotta be the most cry baby pussy set of players COD has ever had. They’d GA the M8 in BO3. <a href="https://t.co/esK6xiC1n8">https://t.co/esK6xiC1n8</a></p>— Sam “Octane” Larew (@OctaneSam) <a href="https://twitter.com/OctaneSam/status/2009833696279617691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Many pointed out how ‘busted’ the MPC-25 is under a 10-meter range, which is the leading reason behind the GA, but others have stressed that it simply doesn’t hold a candle to the existing meta and should have been left alone.</p>



<p>Another CDL fan wrote, <em>‘The MPC gets demolished outside of like 12 meters by the Dravec and M15, you’re taking a BIG risk pulling out an MPC, and you’re rewarded with a better TTK up close. That’s how it should be. Pros just HATE 3 gun metas, BO7’s our last good cod in a long time, we’re wasting it.’</em></p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>At the same minute as this article was posted, the Apex Legends team gave an update confirming the resolution of this issue: ‘This incident is now resolved with the help of our community. Anti-Cheat is a constant cat-and-mouse game and your reports are imperative to bringing information to our attention, including the one that helped us today. Thanks for your patience as our teams jumped to tackle and resolve this issue.’</p>



<p>Fans have taken to social media to cry out against the latest Apex Legends hack. The situation is dire, and ‘a bad actor’ is utilizing an unknown exploit to control other players’ characters in the popular battle royale game. This has led to Respawn making an official statement declaring an ‘active security incident’.</p>



<p>In a two-minute clip uploaded on social media, users get a first-hand look at the depth of this issue. In the video, a player is toyed with multiple times, with the hacker emptying their inventory and throwing them off the map.</p>











<p>In a post on social media, the team at Respawn Entertainment wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are aware of an active security incident where a bad actor is able to control the inputs of another player remotely in (Apex Legends).</p>



<p>Based on our initial investigation, we have not identified evidence that suggests the bad actors can install or execute code as in the case of an RCE or injection attack. </p>



<p>We are actively working on a solution and will update you when we have more information.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This message was posted a few hours after a clip surfaced showcasing the exploit in question:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is far from being the first major hacking incident to hit Apex Legends, one of the oldest and most popular battle royale games on the market. In January 2025, some of the most notable pro players had their accounts hijacked, and in March 2024, the Apex Legends Global Series was <strong>taken over </strong>by malicious operators during a live broadcast, and the hack was <strong>very similar </strong>to this one.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to criticize the situation in the comments under Respawn’s post. One user pointed out:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apex is a security risk to have installed at this point</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>lol maybe if they focused more on Anti-Cheats and better security they wouldn’t have these problems but instead they focus on buffing characters and more boring events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Death In The Box is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-volleyball-legends-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a high-stakes survival and strategy game. Players are required to compete against up to 15 other participants upon launch, and from there, navigate through a series of deadly challenges orchestrated by a menacing clown figure. With a unique blend of luck-based events and strategic card play, Death In The Box offers an intense competitive experience where players must outthink and outlast their opponents to be the last one standing.</p>







<p>Having been released in August 2023, Death In The Box has gradually gained traction and now boasts over 87 million visits with an active player base of more than 2,000 players. Although mastering the card system and understanding strategic voting mechanics is enough for players to improve their survival chances, using redeem codes to get extra Wheelspins is never a bad idea.</p>

<p>Death In The Box codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Death In The Box Discord server, which features a dedicated announcements channel where all new codes are posted first, and the ARK-ADE Roblox group, where updates and milestones are announced.</p>



<p>Codes often come out around special events, major updates, or game milestones, but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as new codes go live, and any expired codes are removed promptly, so you always see only the ones that are still active.</p>
