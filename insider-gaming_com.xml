<p>It’s a big week for Pokémon fans with the 30th anniversary celebrations taking place this week, and fresh rumors have emerged concerning a huge collab with Fortnite.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> is the undisputed behemoth in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battle-royale/" id="127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale</a> scene, while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> is the strongest franchise among the creature-collecting games. For many, that may seem like a natural fit for a collab.</p>



<p>If you want to know what the source of the Fortnite x Pokémon rumors is, and whether a crossover is on the cards, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-pokemon-coming-to-fortnite">Is Pokémon Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not likely. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no official news regarding a collab between Fortnite and Pokémon. While it’s not been ruled out either, it seems unlikely to occur.</strong></p>



<p>While Epic Games are the masters of collabs, bringing the likes of South Park, Star Wars, and major anime titles into the game, working with Nintendo provides different challenges. So far, Epic Games and Nintendo haven’t managed to come to an agreement.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-things-we-want-to-see-announced-on-pokemon-day-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Things We Want to See Announced on Pokémon Day</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Fortnite previously wanted to bring Samus from the Metroid franchise into the game, but Nintendo wanted significant restrictions. It’s been widely reported they only wanted Samus to be playable on Nintendo consoles, even if you already owned the skin.</p>



<p>Additionally, Pokémon is a family-friendly franchise, and while it’s no denying the likes of Pikachu and Eevee would make amazing Sidekicks, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are unlikely to want their valuable IP running around in a world filled with guns.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-did-the-fortnite-x-pokemon-rumours-start">Where Did The Fortnite x Pokémon Rumours Start?</h2>



<p><strong>The desire from fans to bring Pokémon</strong> <strong>into the world of football is not new, but the rumors have been ramped up following a recent viral social media post.</strong></p>



<p>On Instagram, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DVE04N_gT9X/?img_index=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forthnite</a>, a page with over 2.7m followers, shared a fan-made trailer made by feraalsy that showcased what a collab between the two major franchises could look like.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green Nintendo Switch Release Date</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The trailer was done expertly, showcasing the likes of Ash Ketchum, Pikachu, and Charizard in their full might, and went viral on social media. At the time of writing, the post has over 15.5k likes.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, as we’ve mentioned, the collab is likely to be a pipe dream, and if Nintendo were to partner with Fortnite, there are other franchises, including Zelda and Super Mario, more likely to feature first.</p>

<p>A major expansion is on the horizon for World of Warcraft players with the long-awaited release of Midnight, with the release date for WoW Midnight now right around the corner.</p>



<p>The release date for the expansion was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-release-date-announced/" id="160714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first revealed back in November</a>, meaning fans have been ticking down the hours waiting for the next big slew of content in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blizzard/" id="1092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a> masterpiece.</p>



<p>If you’re eagerly awaiting the WoW Midnight release date, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-wow-midnight-coming-out-release-date-explained">When is WoW Midnight Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New landscapes. Image via Blizzard</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>World of War Midnight is set for release on Monday, February 2, so the countdown to launch is well and truly on.</strong></p>



<p>Midnight brings the long-awaited arrival of housing to WoW, something players have been clamouring for, and it’s expected to be a busy release period. Naturally, that may come alongside server stress, so prepare yourself for potential problems.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-have-multiplayer-co-op-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Does Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Have Multiplayer?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>WoW has the capacity to deal with the majority of server stress issues, however, so there shouldn’t be too many major problems.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-wow-midnight-early-access">When is WoW Midnight Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>Early access for World of Warcraft Midnight is set for Thursday, February 26, giving players an extra weekend to dive into all the brand-new content.</strong></p>



<p>Like many other games, however, entry to early access comes at a cost, as it requires an additional purchase. Given the cost of maintaining WoW access, players may want to consider holding out for the full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-wow-midnight-start-times">What Are The WoW Midnight Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>WoW Midnight is set to be released at 3 PM on March 2, with the early access launch coming four days earlier at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>That means a late afternoon launch for those in the United States, while those in Europe face a late night. Meanwhile, those in Asia and Oceania have to wait until the next day.</p>



<p>The exact release times have been shared by Blizzard and are available in the table below. We’ve separated the main release time and early access into different columns.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">World of Warcraft Midnight Release Time</th><th data-align="center">WoW Midnight Early Access Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – March 2</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Feb. 26</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – March 2</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Feb. 26</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">6 PM – March 2</td><td data-align="center">6 PM – Feb. 26</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – March 2</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Feb. 26</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – March 3</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Feb. 27</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Slay The Spire 2 is ready to enter Early Access, just like its predecessor did all those years ago. It’s the perfect time to take on community feedback and balance the various cards and characters, but there’s one thing on everyone’s mind—will the sequel have multiplayer?</p>







<p>It was one of the most requested features for the original Slay The Spire, and for good reason; who wouldn’t want to ascend the Spire with their friends? Well, now’s the time to find out whether Mega Crit took on the fan feedback, and to see whether <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a> will have multiplayer during Early Access.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-have-multiplayer">Does Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Have Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stand together! Image by Mega Crit.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Slay The Spire 2 will have multiplayer during Early Access, as you and up to three friends can face the Spire together. </strong></p>



<p>This is thanks to the brand new online Co-Op mode, which brings a whole new level of complexity to the game. From multiplayer exclusive cards to powerful team synergies, you and your friends can work together to ascend the Spire and beat the game. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-indie-games-coming-in-2026/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-indie-games-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8 Biggest Indie Games Coming In 2026</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, this is brand new to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-exact-start-times/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-exact-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a>, with the original game not having any form of multiplayer or co-op available. Whilst you can still play the game solo, there’s no denying that strategizing with three friends will be a thrill like no other—but can you do it from the same device?</p>







<h2 id="h-does-slay-the-spire-2-early-access-have-split-screen-co-op">Does Slay The Spire 2 Early Access Have Split-Screen Co-Op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Helpful notes. Image by Mega Crit.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>At the moment, it doesn’t seem like Slay The Spire 2 will have split-screen co-op during Early Access. </strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mega-crit/" id="3619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Crit</a> have only mentioned that the game will have online co-op, and there remains no mention as to whether there will be anything to do with split-screen. However, the likelihood is that whilst it remains in Early Access, co-op features will remain exclusively online.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Is Pokémon Pokopia? </a></li>
</ul>



<p>That’s not to say that it won’t change in the future, though. As the game rolls out on different platforms once Early Access is complete, there’s a chance that local multiplayer features could be added. Until then, though, you’ll have to team up with your friends across different devices. </p>

<p>The sequel to the incredibly popular deck-building roguelike Slay The Spire was officially announced back in April, 2024, and now almost two years later, its release date has officially been announced. </p>







<p>However, that comes with a major caveat: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/slay-the-spire-2/" id="3528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slay The Spire 2</a> is first releasing in Early Access, with an official full release date still unconfirmed. But if you’re eager to tackle the mysteries of the Spire, then you won’t have to wait long, as Early Access is right around the corner.</p>

<p><strong>Mega Crit announced that Slay The Spire 2 will enter Early Access on March 5, 2026, though the full release date remains unknown. </strong></p>



<p>Whilst it might sound confusing to some, the original Slay The Spire was actually released in the same way. It arrived in Early Access, and after almost two years’ worth of community-led finetuning and balancing, the game was officially released as the complete package.</p>

</ul>



<p>Mega Crit mentioned on Slay The Spire 2’s Steam page that they expect to follow a similar schedule with the sequel. So, if all goes according to plan, Slay The Spire 2 should ideally officially launch as a complete package by late 2027 or early 2028. Of course, these dates are speculation, so don’t put too much trust in them, but fingers crossed that it arrives sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone diving into Slay The Spire 2’s Early Access will be native to the PT time zone, so for everybody else, Insider Gaming has adjusted the release time for your convenience. If you don’t see your time zone, let a staff member know, and it’ll be added! </p>
