<h2 id="h-undisputed-update-1-2-details">Undisputed Update 1.2 Details</h2>



<h3>New Venues</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added Cambrian Hall. Located in the heart of England’s Capital and draped in rich boxing history, fighting at this venue is every prospect’s dream.</li>



<li>Added Atlantis, an underwater aquarium-like venue, located on the ocean bed. Can you keep your composure in the ring when you’re deep under water?</li>
</ul>



<h3>New Cosmetics</h3>



<ul>
<li>All players will receive an additional free outfit for Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk – recreate their historic first fight in all its glory with their fight-accurate outfits.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Career Mode</h3>



<ul>
<li>Introduced the ability for players to move up and down a weight class from their starting weight class. We know this is one a lot of you have been asking for and we’re excited to see you step up to the challenge of becoming Undisputed in not one, not two, but three weight classes with the same fighter!</li>



<li>Introduced the esteemed boxing correspondent Gareth A Davies to the Career Mode media feed, the first in a series of real-life media figures and brands.</li>



<li>Made a range of quality-of-life improvements to the career mode’s UI.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3>General Changes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Introduced Cruiserweight, Bantamweight, and Light Heavyweight queues to online quick fight and online ranked.</li>



<li>Added new knockdown and knockout animations.</li>



<li>Added an animation that plays when a fighter’s block health has been depleted, giving players better visual feedback during gameplay.</li>



<li>Slightly reduced stamina cost on missed punches and power punches to make combination and pressure fighting a more viable option.</li>



<li>Made a range of quality-of-life improvements to game audio and commentary.</li>



<li>Made performance optimisations to custom characters.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that meant players that quit out of online games on PlayStation weren’t being punished, and the win was not being correctly awarded to the remaining player. This now works as expected.</li>



<li>Many other bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p>The former Marathon game director, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-director-fired-at-bungie-over-inappropriate-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who was fired from Bungie</a> early this year for alleged inappropriate contact, has spoken publicly about the allegations. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/oryxeleven/status/1867248221967560952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Christopher Barrett talked about how “difficult and painful” the last nine months have been since leaving Bungie while announcing that he has filed a lawsuit against both Sony and Bungie.</p>



<p>He claims that the claims and “attacks” are unfounded and damaging his reputation.</p>



<p>“The past nine months following my departure from Bungie have been very difficult and painful for me as I’ve had to endure rampant speculation, unfounded attacks on my reputation, and innuendo about what happened behind the scenes to cause me to be fired after 25 years of loyal service,” Barrett said. “I want to thank everyone who has been there for me.”</p>



<p>He continued: “I’ve eagerly awaited the opportunity to get the truth out there and tell my side of the story, and now is that time. Today, I filed a lawsuit against Sony and Bungie to hold them accountable for their conduct and the damage that has been done to my reputation and my career.”</p>



<p>For those unaware, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported that at least eight females came forward with allegations against Barrett. An internal investigation would discover that Barrett would call lower-level employees attractive while also asking them to play truth or dare. In addition, Barrett reported flaunted his “wealth and power” within the company while hinting that he could help people advance their careers.</p>



<p>For his side, Barrett says that his name will be cleared as the lawsuit plays out.</p>



<p>“I am confident that the facts are on my side and look forward to clearing my name through the legal process,” he said. “Because this is a pending legal matter, there is nothing else I can say about it at this time.”</p>

<p>It has been one hell of a year for Fallout.</p>



<p>From the next-gen update for Fallout 4 to the release of the critically acclaimed Fallout TV series on Amazon Prime, the post-apocalyptic series has gone from strength to strength in the last twelve months. Earlier this year, the launch of Fallout’s live-action adaptation caused player counts to skyrocket, and that fact has reflected quite nicely in one particular title.</p>



<p>Fallout 76, the series’ MMORPG entry, has hit 21 million players, according to Bethesda Game Studios. That’s up from the 17 million that was reported this time last year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-atomic-growth">Atomic Growth</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 had a hard time getting here, but it’s finally getting the praise and attention it deserves. It took an award-winning television series for many to see the value in Fallout 76, but that’s fine – it’s a live-service game and it’ll be around for quite some time.</p>



<p>Recently, Bethesda Game Studios has busied itself pouring content into Fallout 76’s ecosystem, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-map-expansion-coming-late-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening up new areas</a> and injecting fresh events and updates into the game for the 21 million wasteland wanderers to enjoy.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7xenCy1xRvZBNQE2tHSBSp/thank-you-vault-dwellers?linkId=100000318285297" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Bethesda site</a>, the team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While traipsing along them country roads, we’ve met over 21 million vault dwellers who bravely emerged from Vault 76.</p>



<p>That must be a huge vault!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When Fallout 76 was released in 2018, it was to widespread mockery and disappointment, and it took a long time for the game’s image to stabilise. Even today, many ignorant gamers still believe Fallout 76 is the shell of a title it once was.</p>



<p>Take it from me, a die-hard Fallout fan of 15 years – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fallout-76-good-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 76 is good</a>, at the very least.</p>



<p>Are you one of the four million new players who found their way into Fallout 76 this year? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The Game Awards 2024 is taking place in Los Angeles, and this year’s trophies are going to be handed out to some deserving games, creators, and industry personalities. It’s one of the most highly anticipated shows in years, given that it was the 10th anniversary of the event, and Geoff Keighley and team seem poised to deliver.</p>



<p>While Insider Gaming will have full coverage of everything announced at the show, awards will also be given away. Here’s the full list featuring every winner at The Game Awards 2024. </p>



<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This is a running article that will be updated as the awards are announced, so make sure you bookmark this page and refresh the page when winners come in. All of the nominees are listed below.</p>

<p>Leading the way in nominations are Astro Bot and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, each having <strong>seven </strong>nominations to their name, which was a fair spread for sure.</p>



<p>There was some controversy leading up to The Game Awards because of the Game of the Year category, though. Many had issues with Shadow of the Erdtree being put <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-all-nominees-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forward as ‘Game of the Year’ </a>because it’s a DLC and not a full, separate release.</p>
