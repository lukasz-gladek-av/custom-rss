<p>The release date for Marvel Cosmic Invasion draws ever closer, and Insider Gaming has all the details so you don’t miss a second in the push to force Annihilus back into the Negative Zone.</p>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion from Tribute Games and Dotemu pits players in control of famous Marvel characters against the horde of bug-like enemies from the Negative Zone, and it’s confirmed to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/9-new-games-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-next-wave/">available day one on Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>



<p>If your Spidey Sense is tingling and you can’t wait to jump into the new beat ’em up title with a classic look, this guide has all the details you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-marvel-cosmic-invasion-release-date">What is The Marvel Cosmic Invasion Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beat ’em up. Image via Dotemu</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is set for release on December 1 across pretty much every possible platform, including last-gen consoles and the original Nintendo Switch.</strong></p>



<p>The beat ’em up title featuring a host of Marvel characters, including Captain America, Nova, Venom, Spider-Man, and the Silver Surfer, battling against the threat of Annihilus.</p>



<p>15 playable heroes will be available, with the Cosmic Swap tag-team system allowing players to switch between two selected heroes quickly to combine for creative team-ups and devastating moves, all brought to life with retro, full-color pixel art designs.</p>







<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-marvel-cosmic-invasion-start-time">Do We Know The Marvel Cosmic Invasion Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is expected to release across all platforms simultaneously at 8 AM PT on December 1, with no opportunity for players elsewhere in the world to jump in early.</strong></p>

<p>Peak Evolution is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dueling-grounds-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> clicker action game with a medieval theme, where players have to defeat various enemies to purchase new characters and upgrade their weapons and abilities. Boasting enemy characters like Pirates and Knights, Peak Evolution is all about gaining coins and EXP points, which can then be used to get better gear, Pets, Evolutions and much more.&nbsp;</p>







<p>There are many worlds that players can explore using their character, and each of these worlds has hordes of enemies to defeat. The main objective of the game is to achieve the strongest warrior form, and this can be done by progressing through the game and by going through multiple rebirths. With daily objectives and seasonal events for players to complete, Peak Evolution can be a fun experience for enthusiasts of the action genre, and with the addition of some free rewards using redeem codes, it’s definitely worth checking out.&nbsp;</p>

Players can also train their characters to be more effective while mining, increasing the amount of any material that can be mined in a given time.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Another key element of Pickaxe Simulator is Pets. These Pets, once hatched, provide users with additional benefits while mining, making the players’ operations even more profitable.

That’s where the Pickaxe Simulator codes can be helpful to players.&nbsp;</p>
