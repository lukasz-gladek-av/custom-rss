<p>Skate’s controversial decision to have microtransactions in early access has been exacerbated by an extortionate and terrible-looking Isaac Clarke skin from EA’s Dead Space franchise.</p>



<p>EA’s newest Skate title arrived to much chagrin and dismay. The community feels the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skate-to-enter-early-access-on-september-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skate early access</a> launch is a soulless cash-grab, and the decision to include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-adds-microtransactions-to-skates-closed-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microtransactions</a> was never going to go down well. It’s hard to be objective as well when you see the state of the new Dead Space bundle in Skate that EA is charging you a <em>lot </em>of money for.</p>

<p>The new Isaac Clarke bundle in the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Skate</a> shop sure is something. To be fair, it does come with other accessories, including player profile cosmetics and flourishes for your board. But the main reason anyone wants this is for the Isaac Clarke skin.</p>



<p>Did you know Skate 3 had an Isaac Clarke skin that was completely free and simply required a code to unlock? Furthermore, it looked exactly like Isaac’s real suit in the game. In 2025, Skate’s early access offers a bundle that costs upwards of $40, and it looks like a last-second Halloween outfit made of painted cardboard.</p>



<p>We had to study this for ourselves. On the Skate store, you buy the San Van Bucks separately; the cheapest it costs is £30.97 (buying 2,800 SVB and two lots of 500 SVB), which equates to <strong>just over $40</strong>. </p>



<p>Or you can buy the Founder’s Deluxe Pack for $49.99, which has more than enough San Van Bucks and extra content.</p>







<p>What do you think? Is EA going too far with this? Or should it be expected? We’re very interested ot hear your thoughts in the comments below, and through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most satisfying games ever to release is receiving a sequel, with the release of Powerwash Simulator 2 rapidly approaching, and we’ve got all the details on its Game Pass inclusion status.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date-explained-exact-start-times-and-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 23</a>, Powerwash Simulator 2 will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released exclusively on current-gen consoles</a>, and is set to offer hours of calm cleaning as you tackle the toughest dirt there is around.</p>



<p>If you want to know whether you can save some money on the title with a Game Pass subscription, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-powerwash-simulator-2-free-on-game-pass">Is Powerwash Simulator 2 Free on Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Clean sweep. Image by Futurlab</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Powerwash Simulator 2 is available as a day-one launch on select Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.</strong></p>



<p>Powerwash Simulator 2 will be available to play as soon as it launches with the service, though different tiers of subscription provide different games. While it’s yet to be confirmed, we’re expecting it to only be available on day one with a Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>



<p>For those with a Premium membership, Powerwash Simulator 2 may be added to the service in future, but it’s not a first-party Xbox title, meaning it’s not guaranteed to come within the first year of launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-powerwash-simulator-2-on-game-pass">How to Play Powerwash Simulator 2 on Game Pass</h2>



<p><strong>A Game Pass membership is required to play Powerwash Simulator 2 on the service, while the game also needs to be downloaded onto your console and ready to go—though it may be available via the Play Anywhere feature.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not yet confirmed what tier of the service is required to be able to play Powerwash Simulator 2 with a subscription, though the recent changes to the service indicate that it will likely be an Ultimate membership that’s required, with the service recently receiving a price bump.</p>



<p>A step-by-step guide on how to play is below:</p>

<p>Life continues to find a way, with Jurassic World Evolution 3 marking the next stage in the franchise with some major changes, and we’ve got the exact release date and start times for the title.</p>



<p>The third iteration of the franchise, which began back in 2018, Jurassic World Evolution 3 takes a big step forward with the debut of baby dinosaurs and modular building, features that are crucial in sister titles Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster.</p>



<p>If you want to count down the hours until you can build the park of your dreams, or sacrifice guests to a T. Rex, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-jurassic-world-evolution-3-coming-out">When is Jurassic World Evolution 3 Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Baby dinos. Image via Frontier Developments</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3 will be released on October 21 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</strong></p>



<p>With no delays to the release date, the game is ready for launch to mark the next era of the franchise for Frontier Developments, following on from two previous iterations of the game.</p>



<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is Frontier’s big release of the year, following on from Planet Coaster 2 in 2024, but the exact time you can dive into the park management sim depends on where you are located in the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-jurassic-world-evolution-3-start-time">Do we Know The Jurassic World Evolution 3 Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Store listings confirm that Jurassic World Evolution 3 will be available to play from 7 AM PT on October 21, with players elsewhere in the world needing to wait until later in the day.</strong></p>



<p>Confirmed by the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP2377-PPSA25153_00-JWEVOLUTION30000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 has a global release and unlocks simultaneously for all players. This isn’t too surprising, as online features are minimal, so there’s no need for a staggered launch to ease stress on the servers.</p>



<p>You will be able to preload Jurassic World Evolution 3 onto your console or PC ahead of launch, reducing the wait time when the doors do finally open, but there’s no way to queue jump the title.</p>



<p>The table below shows the Jurassic World Evolution 3 start times in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Jurassic World Evolution 3 Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – Oct. 21</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Oct. 21</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Oct. 21</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Oct. 21</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – Oct. 22</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
