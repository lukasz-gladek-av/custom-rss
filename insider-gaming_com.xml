<p>The mystery surrounding Highguard stayed with the game until its inevitable launch. The FPS revealed next to nothing in the build-up to its launch, but Wildgate Entertainment was happy to address one major detail about Highguard: Its price and free-to-play status.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> aptly kept up a high guard following its shocking The Game Awards 2025 reveal, even as the days and weeks ticked by to its release date. This added only to Highguard’s aura, and while we all tried to work out what the game was and what it was about, the dev left no doubt about Highguard’s price tag.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It won’t blow a hole in your wallet. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard doesn’t cost anything, and it doesn’t have a price, because Highguard is a free-to-play shooter.</strong></p>



<p>That’s the first big stumbling block out of the way. Games like Concord have shown that charging a fee for this type of game can warrant a backlash, or worse (in the case of Concord), nothing at all from anyone.</p>



<p>The gaming world was left with its mouth ajar, watching Highguard be the final reveal of TGA 2025. By not showing anything since, this ironically increased the game’s appeal and hype. On the plus side, no matter how Highguard turns out, whether you love it or hate it, it won’t cost you a penny.</p>



<p>In fact, the game’s only real marketing at all, a few days from launch, was its initial reveal trailer. The impressive footage ended with a definitive message: “Play Free.”</p>

<h2 id="h-will-highguard-have-microtransactions-amp-battle-pass">Will Highguard Have Microtransactions &amp; Battle Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Many will. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Steam claims that Highguard will have ‘In-App Purchases,’ but this is the full extent known about Highguard’s extra paid purchases and potential live-service elements.</strong></p>



<p>All that is known about Highguard—other than the Steam notice about the purchases—is a brief description of the shooter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From the creators of&nbsp;Apex Legends&nbsp;and&nbsp;Titanfall, comes&nbsp;Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to battle for control of a mythical continent. There they’ll clash against rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>You’ll find out, like everyone else, what Highguard has in store (potentially literally) when it launches as a F2P game on January 26.</p>



<p>If Highguard wasn’t free-to-play, would it have put you off? Will you still be skipping Highyuard anyway? IG is very interested to hear your thoughts on the game, its lack of promotion, and more, which you can share via the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has announced the next Life Is Strange game, “Life is Strange: Reunion,” which will conclude the story of fan favorites Max and Chloe. Due out on March 26, the game is coming to current-generation consoles, and <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a> appears to have shared the news ahead of a dedicated stream officially announcing the next game in the series.</p>



<p>The title of the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unannounced-life-is-strange-reunion-rated-by-pegi-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed through a PEGI rating </a>early in January 2026, and now players know there’s just a little more than 2 months until they can begin the journey to end the story of Max and Chloe.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-fate-of-max-and-chloe-is-in-your-hands-in-life-is-strange-reunion">The Fate of Max and Chloe Is in Your Hands in Life Is Strange: Reunion</h2>



<p>Andrew James, the Senior Brand Manager of Life Is Strange, wrote the blog on Xbox Wire announcing the next game. In the piece, he spoke about his own emotional connection to the story and promised fans the opportunity to decide how to bring Max and Chloe’s story to a definitive conclusion.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Max and Chloe’s relationship is at the core of the story, a relationship that YOU will choose how to develop over the course of the game. Whether Chloe lived or died in Arcadia Bay, and whether she and Max were friends or lovers — these choices are key not just to the past you’ll confirm as you play, but to the future you’ll fight for the chance to build.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A live stream is scheduled to begin at 1:00 p.m. ET on January 20, with further details provided by the development team. Insider Gaming may update this story with new information following the stream.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade has been out for a few years, but you poor Xbox and Nintendo Switch players have had to wait your turn. Square Enix has heard the cries of the planet, and yours, and the FF7 Remake Intergrade release date beckons for the forgotten consoles.</p>



<p>It feels like a lifetime ago that the FF7 Remake debuted on the PS4! It arrived during a weird time for the real world, mirroring the thematic struggles of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remakes-buster-sword-almost-had-a-more-realistic-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>‘s planet. A lot of time has passed since then, so let’s check out the difference in platforms and new release dates.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-coming-out-on-xbox-series-x-s-amp-nintendo-switch-2">When Is Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade Coming Out On Xbox Series X|S &amp; Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cloud nine. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A January 22 release date is currently locked in for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch 2 owners.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation has gotten to enjoy Intergrade for years, and even a PC port has been commissioned in between. The final bridge that needed to be crossed was the one connecting to Xbox and Nintendo. There were doubts if it was ever going to happen.</p>



<p>The timeline on this has been fun, though: Firstly, we heard in June 2025 that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-releasing-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake was finally releasing on Xbox</a>. After a few months, FF fans learned that the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-officially-confirmed-for-xbox-and-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Trilogy was confirmed for Xbox and Switch 2</a>!</p>



<p>The experience should be amazing, but if you’re on Nintendo Switch 2, be warned that it will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-be-close-to-100gb-on-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">close to 100GB on Switch 2</a>!</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-on-ps5">Can You Buy Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade On PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, a PS5 version of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is real, and has been available since June 10, 2021.</strong></p>



<p>The PS4 was first associated with FF7 Remake and the Intergrade upgrade. However, it seemed sensible to clear up all platforms and reveal if Intergrade has made its Chocobo-w on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Come January 22, FF7 Remake Intergrade will be available on most main formats.</p>



<p>Let IG know if you’re planning on picking up the Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on either Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch 2. The place to do this is simple: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Insider Gaming Official Discord Server</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s time to look ahead to FF7’s future. Read about the report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3’s game experience is ‘More or Less Complete’</a>.</p>

<p>Fortnite is stepping into the Forgotten Realms. Wizards of the Coast has announced a new collaboration with community creators Chartis and Teravision Games, bringing a series of Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired Fortnite islands to players worldwide.</p>







<p>The partnership introduces five fan-made islands designed to merge <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pimlico-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s creative sandbox</a> with the fantasy adventure and storytelling that D&amp;D is known for.</p>



<h2 id="h-five-dungeons-amp-dragons-islands-have-arrived-in-fortnite">Five Dungeons &amp; Dragons Islands Have Arrived In Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Good luck. Image by EPIC Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Built using Epic’s UEFN toolset, the islands were created by long-time D&amp;D fans as part of Wizards of the Coast’s “launch and learn” initiative—an experiment aimed at exploring new ways for D&amp;D to reach wider audiences. The line-up includes a PvP battle arena, a social hub, a platforming challenge, a co-op boss fight, and what’s being described as the largest co-op roguelike mode ever created in Fortnite.</p>



<p>Players can expect plenty of classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warlock-dungeons-and-dragons-coming-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> flavor throughout. The islands take place across iconic Forgotten Realms locations, including the Yawning Portal tavern, the Spine of the World mountains, and Mount Hotenow. Familiar threats also await, with players facing legendary foes such as Klauth, the ancient red dragon, and the necromancer Valindra Shadowmantle.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast says the project is inspired by the homebrew spirit at the heart of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dungeons-and-dragons-cancelled-by-payday-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tabletop D&amp;D</a>. “We’re bringing the spirit of D&amp;D homebrew to Fortnite—supporting creators, experimenting in new mediums, and learning how we can introduce D&amp;D to new players,” said Nick Strann, Franchise Strategy Director for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. “We hope we can make it just as meaningful for millions of Fortnite fans.”</p>







<p>All five D&amp;D Fortnite islands are available now via the following Island Codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>D&amp;D Boxfights – 1190-4691-0255</li>



<li>D&amp;D Treasure RNG – 4958-2624-5634</li>



<li>D&amp;D Dungeon Deathrun – 5806-6430-0158</li>



<li>D&amp;D Bossfight – 2218-1049-5866</li>



<li>D&amp;D Zombie Dragon Adventure (Early Access) – 2525-9596-3235</li>
</ul>

<p>Though it may seem like new games are the talk of the town in 2026, there’s plenty to come from titles you have already sunk hours into, including a huge drop with the Cult of the Lamb Woolhaven DLC.</p>



<p>Initially launched in 2022, Cult of the Lamb has received plenty of updates since, with cosmetic DLC and free in-game content, but the Woolhaven expansion will be bigger than ever.</p>



<p>For all the release date details and the exact time you can jump in to play, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-dlc-release">When Does Cult of The Lamb Woolhaven DLC Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New challenges await. Image via Massive Monster</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cult of the Lamb’s Woolhaven DLC will be released on Thursday, January 22, providing a major expansion to the game.</strong></p>



<p>While the game is turning six later this year, additional content has become a regular occurrence throughout Cult of the Lamb’s lifespan, and the Woolhaven DLC is the biggest update so far.</p>



<p>Previous DLC for Cult of the Lamb has featured mostly cosmetic additions, but Woolhaven will be different, adding new areas, dungeons, bosses, weapons, and new characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-dlc-release">What Time Does Cult of The Lamb Woolhaven DLC Release?</h2>



<p><strong>The Woolhaven DLC for Cult of the Lamb releases at 9 AM PT on January 22 across all platforms.</strong></p>



<p>Naturally, due to time zones, this means the release date for some players is actually in the early hours of the morning on January 23, but there won’t be any delays for players on a particular platform, as the release is simultaneous.</p>



<p>That means that whether you’re playing on PC, console, or on the go via Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, the Woolhaven DLC will be available at exactly the same time as other platforms, as long as you’re connected to the internet to initiate the download.</p>



<p>The table below shows the release time for the Woolhaven DLC for Cult of the Lamb in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Cult of the Lamb Woolhaven Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Jan. 22</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">11 AM – Jan. 22</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM – Jan. 22</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Jan. 22</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 AM – Jan. 23</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
