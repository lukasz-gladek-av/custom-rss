<p>In the Call of Duty League, rostermania has been kicked into final gear in the <strong>day before </strong>the Major III qualifying stage. Moments ago, Vegas Falcons revealed that Arcitys and Priestahh will join Pred and Exnid to complete the four-man roster. </p>



<p>Weâ€™ll likely never know the size of the bag these players have been offered to represent the Vegas Falcons. Presently, the team has the worst record in COD esports history, having failed to win a single series since the season kicked off in December 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-it-enough">Is It Enough?</h2>



<p>The Vegas Falcons have had a woeful run, failing to win a single match since entering the Call of Duty League last year. Theyâ€™re flat bottom in the standings, and unless something remarkable happens, the team is already out of this yearâ€™s Call of Duty League Championship, which is taking place in Canada in June.</p>



<p>On social media, the Falcons team revealed the recent signing of Arcitys and Priestahh. The latter was recently dropped from LAG M8, which has also been on a monumentally miserable run of late, while the former comes up from a solid run in Challengers.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Two more World Champions have arrived to complete our roster. Weâ€™re ready to make some noise as we head into Major III Qualifiers.

Welcome, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Arcitys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Arcitys</a><span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Priestahh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Priestahh</a><span> ðŸ¦…ðŸ’š </span></p></article></div>







<p>Both of these players are former world champions, Priestahh much more recently than Arcitys. He was a part of the incredible New York Subliners roster that went on a dramatic run through the CDL 2023 season, winning Champs in record time with a 5-0 scoreline.</p>



<p>Arctiys has been out of the League since being dropped by Surge just over a year ago, but he has been in phenomenal shape in the Challengers circuit. Just days ago, he won the Dallas Open while flying the OMiT flag, and in July last year, he won the COD Challengers Final with Lore.</p>



<p>Do you think the Vegas Falcons can finally win a series? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.</p>
