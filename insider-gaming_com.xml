<p>It is no secret that CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) is one of the biggest esports out there. Even after its predecessor, CS:GO, handed the game the torch, Counter-Strike has continued to thrive. But do you know of all the ranks in CS2 competitive?</p>



<p>Here are all the CS2 ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-cs2-ranks">CS2 Ranks</h2>



<p>CS2 ranks fall under a much more complicated system than many other games. To heavily reward players, ranks are not thrown around lightly within the shooter. With 18 ranks as a whole, CS2 has one of the most immersive and impressive ranking systems.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-cs2-ranks">All CS2 Ranks:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Silver 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver Elite Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova 3</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold Nova Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian 1</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Guardian Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Distinguished Master Guardian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legendary Eagle</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legendary Eagle Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Supreme Master First Class</strong></li>



<li><strong>Global Elite</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While these are the traditional CS2 ranks, the game also has Premiere Mode, which is a more popular ranked system. </p>







<h2 id="h-all-counter-strike-2-premiere-mode-ranks">All Counter-Strike 2 Premiere Mode Ranks</h2>



<p>Premiere mode, unlike regular CS2 ranked, requires players to pick and vote on maps to ban before competing. After winning 10 placements in Premiere, you will be given a rating, which is a bit different from the system in the game’s traditional ranked mode.</p>



<p><strong>Here are all Premiere mode ranks in CS2 compared to the game’s traditional ranks:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>1,000 – 7,501 (Gray):</strong> Equivalent to Silver Elite Master</li>



<li><strong>7,502 – 11,831 (Light Blue):</strong> Equivalent to Gold Nova 1 to Gold Nova Master</li>



<li><strong>11,832 – 14,998 (Dark Blue):</strong> Equivalent to Master Guardian to Master Guardian Elite</li>



<li><strong>14,999 – 18,401 (Light Purple):</strong> Equivalent to Distinguished Master Guardian to Legendary Eagle Master</li>



<li><strong>18,402 – 19,999 (Purple):</strong> Equivalent to Supreme Master First Class</li>



<li><strong>20,000+ (Dark Purple):</strong> Equivalent to the Global Elite</li>
</ul>



<p>The Counter-Strike Premiere mode is much more focused on points than it is on actual ranks. Still, though, players should be striving to hit Dark Purple, which is the equivalent to Global Elite in the game’s regular ranking system.</p>



<p>To rank up, simply winning matches will skyrocket you through the ranked system, but beware, the competition will be extremely difficult later on, as CS2 has a much more precise competitive base than other games.</p>
