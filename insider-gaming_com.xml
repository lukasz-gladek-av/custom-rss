<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is continuing its run as the best-selling game in the United States (US), taking the top spot for January 2025. It’s the fourth month in a row it has been at number one.</p>



<p>In the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq6xkoc2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, three of the top five spots remained the same with Madden 25 coming in second and EA Sports FC 25 being the fourth-best-selling title. Throughout the rest of the list comes a plethora of changes, including games like Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth having a resurgence after its release on Steam. For comparison, the game was ranked 56th in December 2024.</p>



<p>Rounding out the top five was Minecraft, which jumped up from ninth. </p>



<p>For those looking for new games, only one made the list in January as Donkey Kong Country Returns debuted at number eight. However, in addition to Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, four games finished in the top 20 after being well outside in December</p>

<p>Total video games sales in the United States (US) for January 2025 have fallen 15% year-over-year with hardware taking the biggest nose dive. This comes from the latest information for Circana and continues a trend of declining sales across the board.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxqlzmm42w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the data company</a>, January 2025 saw hardware sales fall by a massive 45% to $205 million while accessories fell 28% to $194M compared to January 2024. The $205 million in hardware spending represents the lowest January total for hardware since January 2020 saw just $131 million.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that January 2025’s data accounts for four weeks while January 2024 was five weeks. However, with drops that substantial, one more week likely isn’t something that would’ve made much of a difference.</p>



<p>Circana’s Mat Piscatella says that double-digit percentage drops happened across all of the major consoles. Nintendo Switch, which has its successor launching this year, fell 53% year-over-year while Xbox fell 50%. PlayStation 5 came in third, but still dropped 38% in total.</p>



<p>Despite the drop, PlayStation 5 remained the top-selling console in terms of both units and dollars. Xbox Series was second in dollars while Switch was second in units sold.</p>



<p>Moving on to accessories, the PlayStation Portal remained the top-selling accessory in terms of dollars. For units sold, the DualSense Wireless Midnight Black controller led the way.</p>



<p>Lastly, regarding the sales of the PlayStation 5 Pro, Piscatella says that its sales pace has fallen behind that of the PlayStation 4 Pro after three months.</p>
