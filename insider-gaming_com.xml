<p>The new Fortnite Chapter 6 launch trailer has revealed that Godzilla and bosses will be making their way to the Battle Royale.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Fortnite has yet to officially upload the trailer; however, <a href="https://x.com/Guille_GAG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data miners</a> have been able to find it within the game files.</p>



<p>The new gameplay trailer for Chapter 6 reveals new skins, bosses, and Godzilla, who seemingly walks around the map. It’s currently unclear if Godzilla is a boss or not within Chapter 6.</p>



<p>You can watch the Chapter 6 trailer here:</p>

<p>Following a controversial reveal, Polaris Quest revealed 16 minutes of Light of Motiram gameplay.</p>



<p>Light of Motiram was heavily criticized yesterday following its reveal due to its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/">striking resemblanc</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/light-of-motriam/"> to the Horizon series</a>. Since the initial reveal though, 16 minutes of new gameplay of the game has been revealed, showing the game in somewhat of a different light.</p>



<p>You can watch the gameplay below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="騰訊曝光《荒野起源》15 分鐘實機展示 未來將與 PlayStation 有更多合作" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsq1xnd0CvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It’s fairly obvious that the developers have been heavily inspired (if not just blatantly ripped off) by the Horizon series, but after watching the gameplay, you also see some inspiration taken from other games like ARK and Souls.</p>



<p>The gameplay has left people conflicted. Some think the game looks impressive, whereas others think it’s just an unoriginal idea that borrows concepts and designs from other games.</p>



<p>“I think you can’t be more unoriginal than this,” said YouTube user Xezene on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqwoP_cTo4I&amp;t=502s&amp;ab_channel=Gematsu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reupload of the gameplay</a>. “This looks fantastic,” said YouTube user MrMultiPlatform.</p>



<p>Light of Motiram has been announced to be released sometime in 2025 on PC.</p>
