            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A is easily one of the most anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 games of this year, and being a die-hard fan of the franchise, I‚Äôve really been looking forward to this one. Insider Gaming was present at Gamescom 2025 this year, and we had the chance to test the preview build for Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A, and here are our impressions on it. </p>



<p>To set some context, Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A is the latest game in the series, where players get to return to Lumiose City from the X and Y games. The upcoming installment introduces a dynamic battle system that completely changes the way players approach battles in the series. Fortunately, we had the opportunity to preview the new Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A battle system during Gamescom 2025. </p>



<h2 id="h-dynamic-battles-keep-players-on-their-toes">Dynamic Battles Keep Players on Their Toes</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Gamescom preview build for Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A was only 10 minutes long, featured the Switch 2 version and was restricted to the German language. However, you were able to gauge the new battle system quite well, even with the language barrier. The demo had players walking through a Red Zone, where they would have to face three different trainers. It was a highly compact area, so there was no way to get a sense of the exploration; the only thing you could do was battle. </p>



<p>I had access to four Pok√©mon: Chikorita, Weedle, Mareep, and Fletchling. Each of these Pok√©mon came with its individual skill set, which could be activated with the press of a button. The PP system has been replaced with a cool-down system, where players must wait a short period before executing their next move. At the same time, players can swap Pok√©mon on the fly, and that‚Äôs a brilliant way to get away from some of the attacks. </p>



<p>The battle system also features a new ambush mechanic, where players can either ambush the other trainer‚Äôs Pok√©mon or be ambushed by them. A new stealth system has also been added, which allows players to sneak around a trainer if they do not wish to fight them at that moment. However, if you are caught off guard, the opponent trainer can dish out some hefty damage when ambushing you. </p>



<p>Every Pok√©mon has the ability to learn four moves that can be executed by aiming at the opponent with the ZL button and then pressing either X, Y, A, or B to pull off the move. The animations look really crisp, and the performance seems pretty solid too. Similar to previous games, the Pokemon learns new moves as they level up with battles. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The new battle system appears to be heading in the right direction, introducing a fresh layer of strategy and gameplay that will appeal to existing franchise players. As it is no longer a turn-based system, the player is no longer offered the luxury of time; you must be quick with your actions, as the opponents can be relentless. That was all we were able to explore during this demo; hopefully, we can see more of the redeveloped <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/story-world/lumiose-city" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lumiose City</a>, the mega evolutions, gym battles, and more soon. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-mirage-free-new-story-content/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-mirage-is-getting-free-new-story-content.1278966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Mirage is getting some surprise new content later this year, thanks to Ubisoft. The title, which was released in 2023, hit Xbox Game Pass a few weeks ago. With all the new players, it now seems that Basim‚Äôs origin story is not quite over yet. </p>



<p>Taking place in 9th-century Baghdad, you play as Basim Ibn Ishaq, whose older self appears in Assassin‚Äôs Creed Valhalla as Eivor‚Äôs mentor. It‚Äôs more classic Assassin‚Äôs Creed than Odyssey and Valhalla, so longtime fans were quick to praise the title, and for good reason. </p>



<p>While the recent Shadows has outplaced Mirage, a new update from Ubisoft confirms there‚Äôs more to come for the stealth-heavy entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-mirage-getting-additional-free-dlc-later-this-year">Assassin‚Äôs Creed Mirage Getting Additional Free DLC Later This Year</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Assassin's Creed Mirage players, we have a surprise coming your way later this year!</p><p> üìñ New story chapter &amp; missions set in 9th century AlUla<br>üéÆ Gameplay improvements for the base game and the new location<br>üéÅ All for free</p><p> Stay tuned! <a href="https://t.co/8CjB3MRvfR">pic.twitter.com/8CjB3MRvfR</a></p></div>‚Äî Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a tweet from the <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Assassin‚Äôs Creed account</a>, it states that, later this year, new content will be available for players to enjoy. Outside of new gameplay improvements, the game will get a brand new location and story content, all set in Al Ula. To top it all off, the DLC is free to all who own the game. Unfortunately, no set release date was given outside of releasing this year.</p>



<p>While it isn‚Äôt out of the ordinary for new content for years-old games to drop, Assassin‚Äôs Creed Mirage is an interesting one. As mentioned previously, it‚Äôs not the newest title anymore, as AC Shadows came out this February. Even more so, it‚Äôs also getting its own <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free DLC</a> in late September. </p>



<p>Having Mirage get new content, especially story content, may hint at possible ties to Shadows or future games like Hexe. Still, the game‚Äôs addition to Xbox Game Pass is now sure to get some traction, as now even more people can play the DLC whenever it comes out.</p>



<p>Are you excited to return to Assassin‚Äôs Creed Mirage? Have you played it before? How does it stack up against other AC titles? Let us know in the comments and on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forums</a>!</p>

<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight may have one up over Batman: Arkham Knight: its vast open world. According to a LEGO Games fan account, it seems that Gotham City in the new title, coming in 2026, will be a large one to explore.</p>



<p>Announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is the next big LEGO title from TT Games. The game brings together many of Batman‚Äôs iconic moments in entertainment, from The Dark Knight and The Batman, to tell the ultimate origin story. It‚Äôs every Batman fan‚Äôs dream, and if the news is true, it‚Äôs going to get even better.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-could-have-the-largest-batman-open-world-ever">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Could Have the Largest Batman Open World Ever</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Gotham City in LEGO Batman: Legacy of Dark Knight is bigger than Batman: Arkham Knight </p><p>The game consists of four islands, with South Island being the largest. <a href="https://t.co/JgRlfWxpJu">pic.twitter.com/JgRlfWxpJu</a></p></div>‚Äî LEGO Games News (@LEGOTtNewsI) <a href="https://twitter.com/LEGOTtNewsI/status/1959024577713230265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In a tweet by user <a href="https://x.com/LEGOTtNewsI/status/1959024577713230265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LEGO Games News</a>, they state that LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has four different islands. While only one gets a mention, the South Island (which will be the largest) is said to be bigger than Batman: Arkham Knight. If true, it does mean that the LEGO title will be the largest Batman open world in gaming.</p>



<p>Batman: Arkham Knight, created by Rocksteady Games, utilized a sprawling Gotham City, previously not as big as in Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, for players to explore. In fact, it was so big, they let players drive the Batmobile around to get to places quickly. Seeing that the game is surprisingly a decade old now, of course, advancements allow for more space to be done. </p>



<p>Still, despite LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only featuring seven characters</a>, there will be more than enough things to do in Gotham City than ever before.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-more-involvement-now-you-see-me-borderlands-movie/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-randy-pitchford-had-more-input-in-%E2%80%98now-you-see-me%E2%80%99-than-in-the-borderlands-movie.1278918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It might sound bizarre at first blush, but Randy Pitchford, CEO of Gearbox and creator of the Borderlands franchise, had <strong>less input </strong>in the recent Borderlands movie than he did in the upcoming release of Now You See Me: Now You Don‚Äôt. I sat down with Pitchford at Gamescom to talk all things Borderlands 4, and as you can imagine, that chat turned towards the Borderlands movie.</p>



<p>For many, it was a complete failure, even for the most die-hard fans. Randy admitted to me that ‚Äòhe liked it‚Äô but stressed that he ‚Äòcan‚Äôt look at it like anybody else could.‚Äô</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs the full video interview before you jump in:</p>

<h2 id="h-randy-pitchford-spearheads-the-magic-in-now-you-see-me-now-you-don-t">Randy Pitchford Spearheads the Magic in Now You See Me: Now You Don‚Äôt</h2>



<p>Now You See Me: Now You Don‚Äôt is the third movie in the series that debuted in 2013. It‚Äôs centered around a group of magicians who use their talents to perform heists and mind-blowing stunts, and I learned from Randy Pitchford at Gamescom that he had a massive input in the movie, <strong>more than he had in the Borderlands movie</strong>.</p>



<p>If we cast back to August 2024, we see the Borderlands movie release to a woeful reception. Today, it boasts a Rotten Tomatoes score of just 10% and a 4.7/10 rating on IMDb. I asked Randy what he‚Äôd do if he had full creative license over another attempt to produce a Borderlands movie, but he wasn‚Äôt willing to take that seat:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that would be a mistake because I‚Äôm not a filmmaker. I‚Äôve seen projects where people with IP get full creative and ‚Äî I‚Äôve been on the other side of it!</p>



<p>I did a James Bond game back in the day with Electronic Arts and we‚Äôre two weeks away from shopping, and the James Bond people said, you know, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt think James Bond should be so violent. How about we just take all the guns out of the game?‚Äô </p>



<p>I don‚Äôt want to be that guy. Whoever the experts are in the medium, do the best you can. You definitely know better than me. It‚Äôs hard enough as it is.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As I probed, I learned that Pitchford had much more of a hands-on involvement in Now You See Me: Now You Don‚Äôt than he did in Lionsgate‚Äôs Borderlands movie:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In another life, <strong>I‚Äôm a magician</strong>, and recently with The Magic Castle, which is a club for magicians that I own in Hollywood, the Magic Castle team did all of the magic and magic productions for the upcoming movie, Now You See Me: Now You Don‚Äôt.</p>



<p>My involvement in that movie was more profound and deeper and had more effect on both the storytelling and on the result than the effect that I had on Borderlands, which is crazy!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One day, we might get another pass at a Borderlands movie, but for now, fans will need to remain satisfied with the upcoming Borderlands 4, due to be released worldwide on September 12.</p>



<p>Let me know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you‚Äôre most excited for about Borderlands 4.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valor Mortis HANDS-ON PREVIEW: The Most Promising Soulslike in Years]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valor-mortis-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valor-mortis-hands-on-preview-the-most-promising-soulslike-in-years.1278831/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I‚Äôve been very vocal about the volume of Soulslikes releases. The market is saturated, and more Souls games are on the way. Valor Mortis is one of the latest to be announced, but this preview comes after playing it at Gamescom 2025. One More Level has an unbelievably exciting new project, as the studio has taken some of the best Ghostrunner qualities.</p>



<p>I knew I had an appointment to play One More Level‚Äôs (at the time) unannounced new IP at Gamescom 2025. We learned about Valor Mortis during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025‚Äôs Opening Night Live</a>. It became evident very quickly that this isn‚Äôt another Elden Ring, Lies of P, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valor-mortis-hands-on-preview/Fallen%20Feathers%20Review%E2%80%94Excellent%20Debut%20Earns%20a%20Feather%20in%20Its%20Cap%20-%20Insider%20Gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>. I can tell you first-hand, this is the most excited I‚Äôve been for a Soulslike in years.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-souls-than-your-usual-soulslike">More Souls Than Your Usual Soulslike</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let‚Äôs give him a big hand. Credit to One More Level</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://omlgames.com/en/game/valor-mortis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Valor Mortis</a> doesn‚Äôt hide its genre or obvious inspiration. There are Lanterns serving as the usual Souls checkpoints, enemies respawn, and you lose your resources if you die. It‚Äôs standard fare in that regard. However, I‚Äôve been wanting a polished and powerful first-person Soulslike for a while. Everyone goes for third-person, and no one seems to see the potential of a first-person perspective.</p>



<p>One More Level has taken the plunge. You‚Äôre a fallen Napoleon soldier in the 19th century, reanimated and revived. I jumped straight into the action with a sword in hand, a first-person camera angle in place, and the game teaching me the basics: How to attack, parry, and other common Souls techniques and movements.</p>



<p>I was elated to see that One More Level hadn‚Äôt forgotten its roots. Valor Mortis still lets you perform a sizable dash √† la Jack from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghostrunner-2-preload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghostrunner</a>, and there‚Äôs some fun parkour and traversal moments. But the core of the game‚Äôs structure revolves around combat. This is a Soulslike, and I can say it gets the blood pumping and makes my heart beat furiously.</p>



<h2 id="h-beauty-is-in-the-hand-of-the-beholder">Beauty is in The Hand of The Beholder</h2>



<p>My hour-long demo saw me finish with a sword in my right hand for light and strong strikes, and interchangeable gadgets for my left hand: A pistol or the ability to spew fire from my hand. If you‚Äôre familiar with Bioshock or the Dishonored franchise, you‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about.</p>



<p>The pistol is great for enemies with big weak points, whereas fire is perfect to coat enemies with a crispy blast of flames and can quickly build up huge damage. I found I needed all three weapons to overcome the boss at the end of the demo. I won‚Äôt spoil things, but the boss is big, nasty, malformed, and took some beating.</p>



<p>The fascinating part of the fight for me was that the boss had plenty of weak points to target. Other Souls games emphasize elemental damage and weaknesses, and resistances. The pistol was a necessity, and the weak points added dynamism to the fight. There‚Äôs a lot of diversity in Valor Mortis‚Äô gameplay, but you can still upgrade your main stats, like your health and parry capabilities. The unique environment is bolstered by visions of fallen soldiers, so you can learn more about the world‚Äîacting as a collectible in some ways.</p>



<p>One hour with Valor Mortis felt like seconds. As a huge Soulslike fan, this is the type of game I‚Äôve been craving. If the tight-knit world-building and slick gameplay of Ghostrunner transfer over to Valor Mortis, this might be a sleeper GOTY contender.</p>
