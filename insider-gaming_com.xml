<p>Following a successful early access launch on PC, inZoi’s unique brand of life-sim gameplay is set to arrive on PS5 in 2026. It looks to include upcoming DLC and should be fully optimized for the console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-inzoi-money-cheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inZoi</a> was heralded as a rival to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-reiterates-plans-for-the-sims-4-multiplayer-the-sims-5-not-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sims</a>—in case you’ve forgotten, it’s the game that initially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-lets-you-run-over-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let you run over children</a>. With EA’s series into the hundreds of millions in terms of copies sold, there’s a lot of catching up to do. inZoi achieved <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-1-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million copies sold</a> within its first week.</p>



<p>Numbers have dropped off since, but this is to be expected. A PS5 release could be what inZoi needs to get back into the picture.</p>

<p>In a press release, <a href="https://www.krafton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Krafton</a> declared: “inZOI, its immersive life simulation game, will launch on PlayStation 5 in the first half of 2026. The PS5 version will be fully optimized for console, bringing players the same robust gameplay experience featured on PC.”</p>



<p>The port features “All of the key systems and features that define the PC experience, reworked for console controls and performance to ensure a seamless and intuitive gameplay experience.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-developers-say-ability-to-run-over-children-was-a-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Running over children was eventually declared a bug</a>, so don’t expect to do that on PS5. However, the first major DLC expansion is on the way in 2025—Island Getaway. I’d expect this to come with the PS5 launch, but it remains to be seen if it’s free.</p>



<p>Have you played inZoi on PC? Is there any potential at all for it to challenge The Sims, or other life-sim legends like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-fortnite-shadow-briefings-locations-in-chapter-6-season-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-fortnite-shadow-briefings-locations-in-chapter-6-season-4.1268766/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Chapter 6 Season 4 is well underway in Fortnite, with a bunch of new Weekly Quests to complete, and locating Shadow Briefings is required if you want to net a handy boost for your Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Shadow Briefings are not new in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=Fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, instead being guaranteed in pretty much every chapter and season that features, but the spawn locations can vary. As such, it can be difficult to track them down in times of need.</p>



<p>We’re here to make things easier, however, by pointing you in the direction of all the Shadow Briefings locations in Chapter 6, Season 4. We’ve also included our tips on the best landing spots to help you complete the quest.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-shadow-briefings-locations-in-chapter-6-season-4">Fortnite Shadow Briefings Locations in Chapter 6 Season 4</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pick your spot. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Shadow Briefings spawn randomly at the start of each game, though they do have set spawns—which we’ve highlighted on the map above.</strong></p>



<p>Given the spawns are random, there are no guaranteed spots where you can secure Shadow Briefings. However, as the map shows, some areas are better than others, with a few potential spawns in close proximity. </p>



<p>The best spots I’ve found are:</p>



<ul>
<li>South of the Burd To Go in the northwest of the map.</li>



<li>The Resistance Base in the northeast of the map.</li>



<li>O.X.R HQ in the mid-west of the map.</li>
</ul>



<p>Heading to these locations is a great starting point in your hunt, given the potential spawns nearby. They also offer a decent haul of loot, so you will be well prepared if you encounter enemy players.</p>



<p>It may still take a few matches to tick off the quest entirely, however, but with these locations at your disposal, it won’t take too much time to knock out. You can also revisit the same spot if you enter a different match. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-amp-accept-shadow-briefings-in-fortnite">How to Find &amp; Accept Shadow Briefings in Fortnite</h2>



<p><strong>As you approach a Shadow Briefing spawn in Fortnite, a white laptop will appear on your map marking the location.</strong></p>



<p>To complete the weekly quest, follow these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Head to one of the locations on the map above to find a Shadow Briefing.</li>



<li>Approach the briefcase and interact with it to accept a mission.</li>



<li>Complete this step three times to tick off the Weekly Quest.</li>
</ol>



<p>As the Weekly Quest only tells you to find and accept Shadow Briefings, you don’t need to complete the missions they provide. However, if you do, you can net yourself some decent loot and some additional experience.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-already-has-over-600k-steam-sales-and-2-7m-wishlists.1268736/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 already boasts over 600,000 pre-order sales on Steam and has a whopping wishlist total of 2.7m, according to new data.</p>



<p>The EA title is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated games of the year, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over half a million players</a> jumping in during the first Open Beta weekend. The Battlefield 6 Open Beta <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/">return</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/"> this weekend</a> and could hit similar numbers, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new map and modes being added.</a></p>



<p>While Open Beta numbers don’t necessarily guarantee success, it appears the stars are aligning for EA with Battlefield 6 as the pre-order sales and wishlists on Steam suggest the community is ready to purchase.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-eye-watering-pre-order-data">Battlefield 6’s Eye-Watering Pre-Order Data</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Impressive. Image via Alinea Analytics</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to data from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a>, over 600,000 pre-orders have been placed for Battlefield 6 on Steam, while a whopping 2.7m players have added the title to their Steam wishlist.</p>



<p>The data adds that this translates to revenues of around $35m on Steam alone, with Battlefield 6 sitting at number two last week for revenues on Steam and number three for totalsales. Of course, this only equates to one platform, too.</p>



<p>Battlefield’s 6 impressive numbers have been rising for a while, however, taking just a few days to surge past the 500,000 wishlist mark when the game was added to Steam last month, including a staggering period from July 25 to 30 with between 95,000 and 150,000 players adding the game to their wishlists each day.</p>



<p>Those numbers put Battlefield 6 in sixth position in Steam’s top wishlisted games, behind only Hollow Knight: Silksong, Subnautica 2, Deadlock, Borderlands 4, Light No Fire, and ARC Raiders. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grounded 2 has surged past the three million player mark just a few weeks into its early access lifespan, it has been revealed.</p>



<p>The Obsidian Games title, a sequel to the initial game that was fully released in September 2022, has capitalized on the popularity of the franchise to set impressive numbers.</p>



<p>Most impressive, however, is that this is still extremely early on in Grounded 2’s lifespan, with a full release not officially set and plenty to come in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grounded-2-roadmap-2025-2026-content-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a>, so the signs are certainly promising.</p>



<h2 id="h-grounded-2-s-impressive-numbers">Grounded 2’s Impressive Numbers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Promising signs. Credit to Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/aarongreenberg/status/1955458077597348194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Microsoft’s vice president of games marketing, Aaron Greenberg, revealed the latest numbers from Grounded 2, with over three million jumping in.</p>



<p>These numbers cover only those on Xbox Series X|S and PC, via Steam or the Xbox App, with Grounded 2 yet to be released on any other platforms, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grounded-2-coming-to-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-grounded-2-on-playstation-xbox-or-switch-all-grounded-2-platforms-consoles-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>



<p>That means there is still ample opportunity for further boosts to the Grounded 2 player base, especially when you factor in updates including new tools, rideable bugs, and bosses.</p>



<p>Grounded 2 has already massively surpassed the original title on Steam, with a concurrent record of just shy of 50,000 set after launch, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2661300/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. In comparison, the highest concurrent player peak for the initial title is just over 32,000, set in 2021.</p>



<p>All in all, it’s very encouraging signs for the future of Grounded 2 and the franchise overall, with plenty more surges expected in the future.</p>



<p>Have you dived into Grounded 2 yet? What do you make of the game? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3288/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It was recently confirmed that we’ll be seeing Resident Evil: Requiem gameplay during the Opening Night Live ceremony at Gamescom, set to take place on August 19. Even more recently, notable Resident Evil leaker ‘Dusk Golem’ took to social media to uncover a series of tidbits regarding the next major release in the legendary franchise.</p>



<p>In a series of posts, Dusk Golem claimed that new lighting and shadow engines have been implemented, the AI system is unique and intelligent, and some open-level areas in Raccoon City <strong>will require a vehicle to traverse them</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-to-feature-last-of-us-part-2-combat">Resident Evil: Requiem to Feature ‘Last of Us Part 2’ Combat</h2>



<p>Dusk Golem has been a goldmine for Resident Evil leaks, but it’s always worth prefacing this with the ‘take it with a pinch of salt’ recommendation. Everything is always subject to change.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://xcancel.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955489759536771403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a series of posts</a> on social media, Dusk Golem revealed stacks about the upcoming Resident Evil: Requiem, all of which could be confirmed or refuted next week when gameplay is shown during Opening Night Live.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Right now officially they’ve talked about as you mentioned the ability to switch between first &amp; third person on the fly (&amp; basically designing two different games alongside each other to accomplish this as require big retooling to work with both), the new lighting/shadow engine, hair engine from Pragmata. </p>



<p>Additionally we know the stalker uses a new dynamic AI system they’ve done to behave uniquely &amp; intelligently on the fly. There’s few other innovations, some I know, but also sure I don’t know all of them. </p>



<p>A small handful I don’t mindsharing is they’ve been working hard to achieve having good performance <strong>on open-level designed areas like Raccoon City, along w/a vehicle to travel around it. The combat with Leon has seen huge innovations, honestly some Last of Us Part 2-isms</strong>, but also its own innovations.</p>



<p>There’s been effort to provide more environmental physic systems and interactivity for Grace’s segments where she has to work with the environment more, &amp; balance light &amp; darkness. And more I won’t say, &amp; sure more I don’t know. But they have a lot more to reveal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dusk Golem later shared an image of Alice from the Resident Evil movie series riding a motorcycle ‘without any context’, suggesting that we’ll be using a similar mode of transport in Resident Evil: Requiem.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crimson-desert-delayed-to-2026-due-to-%E2%80%98longer-than-expected-timelines%E2%80%99.1268691/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been announced that Crimson Desert, the upcoming open-world action title from Pearl Abyss, has been pushed back to Q1 2026. This news was announced during a recent earnings call and accompanied by a clear explanation.</p>



<p>The team at Pearl Abyss emphasized that the plans to showcase Crimson Desert at Gamescom will remain unchanged. Next week, the game’s open-world build will be rendered playable at Gamescom for the first time, and in September, the same demo will be available to explore at the Tokyo Game Show.</p>



<h2 id="h-unavoidably-delayed">‘Unavoidably Delayed’</h2>



<p>Talking on the delay of Crimson Desert during a recent earnings conference call, the Pearl Abyss team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Currently,&nbsp;<em>Crimson Desert</em>&nbsp;has been in the process of voice-overs, while also carrying out tasks such as console certification in preparation for its release. In the case of marketing, we plan to participate in Gamescom and PAX West this August to showcase our open-world build. And in September, we will join the Tokyo Game Show to strengthen our marketing efforts in the Japanese market.</p>



<p>The launch of&nbsp;<em>Crimson Desert</em>, our first large-scale AAA console game, has been unavoidably delayed by one quarter, from the previously announced schedule. This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations. </p>



<p>We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>It was then stated that Crimson Desert has been given an ‘internally confirmed’ release window of Q1 2026. There will be a follow-up announcement in due course, unveiling a firmer launch date. It was stressed that Crimson Desert’s release date <strong>will not </strong>be revealed at Gamescom.</p>
