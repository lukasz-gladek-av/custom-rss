<p>A new job listing shows that Electronic Arts is laying the foundation for the next game in the Mass Effect series.</p>



<p>It has been the better part of a decade since the last release in the Mass Effect series, 2017’s Mass Effect: Andromeda. Now, EA has made a public move to secure the franchise’s direction. A new <a href="https://jobs.ea.com/en_US/careers/JobDetail/Production-Director/212271" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job listing</a> from EA notes that the company is seeking a production director to serve as a leader on the next title in the game series.</p>



<p>EA is hoping the new Mass Effect Production Director has 10+ years of experience on AAA titles, deep ARPG and RPG knowledge, and proven team-building.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are looking for a Production Director with a passion for the Mass Effect universe to serve as a high-impact leader on our next Mass Effect title. You will partner closely with creative leadership, studio teams, and internal and external partners to champion the game’s vision and ensure its execution at the highest quality bar.</p>

<p>In November 2025, Mass Effect executive producer Mike Gamble proclaimed that EA and BioWare remain<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-confirms-next-mass-effect-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> committed exclusively to the series</a> and noted that there are more stories to tell in the universe. It has also been suggested that many believe the next title in the series will be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-moves-some-employees-to-other-ea-projects-while-developing-mass-effect-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make-or-break moment for BioWare</a> after the turbulent development of Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>







<p>There’s also a TV series in the works at Amazon. However, it has been confirmed that the series will not adapt the original game trilogy and will be an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-trilogy-original-story/">original story set after the events of the third game.</a></p>

<p>The next Resident Evil remake is coming within the next 18 months. </p>



<p>In a post on social media, NateTheHate reaffirmed that not only is Resident Evil Code: Veronica being remade, but that it’s “deep in development”. He then went on the mention when Capcom is targeting a release.</p>







<p>“Target of release is first half 2027,” <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2014767509803512263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. </p>



<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve heard claims of Code: Veronica being remade. In fact, rumblings about the game have been going on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since at least 2024</a>. Rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-remakes-scheduled-for-2027-2028-respectively-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest that the remake</a> of the 26-year-old game will be announced sometime this year ahead of the aforementioned 2027 launch.</p>







<p>Resident Evil Code: Veronica first launched in February 2000, exclusively for the Sega Dreamcast. After that console went under, the game was re-released as Resident Evil Code: Veronica X for the PlayStation 2 (2001) and Nintendo GameCube (2003). It even came to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. </p>
