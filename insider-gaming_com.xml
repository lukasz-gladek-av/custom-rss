<p>The first handful of games coming to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog in January 2026 have been leaked ahead of the official reveal.</p>



<p>Known leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-premium-on-connait-les-titres-majeurs-de-janvier-2026-60850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Billbil-kun</a> has revealed the first six games that will be announced. </p>







<p>For PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, five of the games being added this month are Resident Evil Village (PS5 | PS4), Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5 | PS4), Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (PS5 | PS4), A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead (PS5 | PS4), and art of rally (PS5 | PS4). </p>



<p>For Premium subscribers who enjoy classic games, the catalog will also see the PlayStation 1 classic Ridge Racer added. As mentioned in the report, both Ridge Racer 2 and Ridge Racer Type 4 are already available in the Classics catalog. </p>



<p>All of the games, per the report, will be available starting January 20. </p>







<p>While those six games are likely based on Billbil-kun’s track record, it should be taken with a grain of salt until the official announcement. It’s also unknown just how many games will be added to the library this month. The full reveal of the rest of the games is expected to happen on Wednesday, January 14. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two weeks into 2026, and Nintendo has finally released its Year In Review for Switch and Switch 2 players. </p>



<p>To access your Nintendo 2025 Year In Review, simply go to the <a href="https://year-in-review.nintendo.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recap’s landing page</a> and sign in with your Nintendo Account. From there, you’ll see stats such as the number of games you played, and the amount of time spent on the system.</p>







<p>In addition, you’ll find out the games you played the most, the types of games you favored, and a month-by-month breakdown of how much you played. </p>



<p><strong>“Your Nintendo Switch 2025 Year in Review has arrived,” </strong>Nintendo said on social media. <strong>“Check out not only your 2025 adventures, but memories from past years with your Nintendo Switch as well.”</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo joins other platforms like Steam and PlayStation with their “wrapped” or year in review features. The only one of the major platforms that didn’t release one for 2025 was Xbox. Microsoft skipped this year, reportedly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbbox-wrapped-not-coming-budget-constraints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to budget constraints</a>. </p>



<p>As far as why Nintendo waited so long to release this time around, that hasn’t been mentioned. Past versions came in the weeks leading up to Christmas, making 2025’s the latest one yet. </p>







<p>What did your Nintendo Year In Review reveal about your playtime on the Switch and/or Switch 2?

            <title><![CDATA[Why Isn’t Hytale Email Verification Working? Hytale Email Not Sending Issue, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-email-verification-issue-explained/</link>
            <guid>1405054</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re here because you haven’t gotten a verification email for Hytale, you’re not alone in this regard. This is a widespread problem preventing many users from buying the sandbox title.</p>



<p>It’s one problem after another, isn’t it? If it’s not servers, it’s something else. In this case, it’s a pesky verification email not sending as intended. Many aspiring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-controller-support-playstation-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytalers</a> have found themselves unable to even buy the game and start it up, so let’s go through what we know so far.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-am-i-not-getting-hytale-verification-email">Why Am I Not Getting Hytale Verification Email?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Could be a long wait. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The accepted reason for Hytale email verification not working as intended is due to the Hytale servers being overloaded, causing a huge backlog of emails and applications.</strong></p>



<p>If you check the official Hytale Discord Server, Reddit, or search for “Hytale email” on X, you will find you’re most definitely not the only one suffering from this issue.</p>



<p>Quite simply, Hytale is proving to be EXTREMELY popular. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-expects-one-million-players-at-early-access-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was expecting one million players for the early access launch</a>, and one would suspect that it’s comfortably surpassed this. A wall is being hit, though, as thousands of potential buyers aren’t getting the email verification notice.</p>



<p>It was recommended that all interested parties buy the game and install the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/download-hytale-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale Launcher</a> before the official early access release day on January 13. If you have left it until its debut, you are likely one of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of players, all trying to verify purchases and access the game simultaneously, which is presumably more than the current server capacity can handle.</p>



<p>To be clear, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-server-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale servers</a> are working on launch day, and the email verification is a separate issue.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-i-get-my-hytale-email-verification">When Will I Get My Hytale Email Verification?</h2>



<p><strong>The fact is, you will receive the email verification notice for Hytale, but it will take time to come through. If it does, and it’s past the time limit cutoff, try again.</strong></p>



<p>The system will catch up, and the developer is likely working on increasing capacity or manually addressing the problem. The team hasn’t officially acknowledged the issue (as of writing), but rest assured that the issue won’t fall on deaf ears. Keep checking for emails, request a new one if you have to, and be patient as it all works itself out.</p>



<p>Conversely, if you’ve found a workaround that guarantees you get the email verification and proceed, let other players and those in the community know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, so the message can be shared far and wide.</p>
