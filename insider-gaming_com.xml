<p>After the cancelation of Football Manager 25, developer Sports Interactive is back, teasing news for the upcoming Football Manager 26.</p>



<p>In a short video released on Wednesday, Sports Interactive gave players a glimpse at the “enhanced Match Day experience” from the game. They call it “just a taste of what you can expect” following the shift of the franchise to the Unity engine. At the end of the trailer, it says that a “Match Day First Look” is “coming soon”.</p>

<p><strong>“[Football Manager 26] promises to propel players on an adventure to shape their footballing destiny with our most immersive and visually rich Football Manager experience to date,”</strong> Sports Interactive said. <strong>“All the story-making potential is redefined as players get ever closer to the heart of the beautiful game.”</strong></p>



<p>Football Manager’s move to Unity has been a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-documented journey</a> that led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-to-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple delays</a> of Football Manager 25 only for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-cancelled-after-multiple-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game to be canceled</a> altogether.</p>

<p>Gamescom 2025 is right around the corner, so expect a huge surge of reveals and details on some of the biggest upcoming games. If you want to know exactly what to expect, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<p>With E3 dead and gone, Gamescom is the ultimate annual event for gaming fans to soak up the latest news and get their hands on huge titles ahead of launch, and 2025 is shaping up to be a huge year.</p>



<p>From the biggest AAA titles to indie games to keep an eye out for, we’ve highlighted everything announced for Gamescom 2025 in this guide.</p>

<p><strong>Games set to headline Gamescom 2025 include Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Hollow Knight: Silksong, EA FC 26, and lots more—with surprises also set to feature.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-start-date-times-how-to-watch-how-long-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live event</a> will be stacked full of trailers, first-look exclusives, gameplay showcases, and special guests. This includes the reveal for <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-happening-at-gamescom-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a></strong>, the opening cinematic from <strong><a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1954528805269221431" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>, </strong>and gameplay from <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Resident Evil: Requiem</a>.</strong></p>



<p>With over 1500 exhibitors at the event, there is no shortage of things to look out for, though perhaps the most in-demand will be the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable demo of <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Both Microsoft and Nintendo have announced playable demos on their hardware, the former including the new ROG Ally.</p>



<p>Konami announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">both <strong>Silent Hill F </strong>and <strong>Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater </strong>will be at Gamescom</a>, while other partners in attendance include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-first-wave-of-partners-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft and Capcom</a>. Nintendo also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-returns-to-gamescom-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced its attendance</a>, having skipped Gamescom in 2025, with the Switch 2 set to be a highlight.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <strong>EA FC 26 </strong>is among the titles that will be playable at Gamescom, with EA Sports ramping up marketing ahead of the worldwide release in September.</p>

<p>PUBG’s time on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will be coming to an end in November with a transition to current-generation consoles, it has been announced.</p>



<p>As previously announced in the 2025 roadmap, preparations have been made to move the console version of PUBG onto current-gen consoles. Unfortunately for those on last-gen devices, it means an end to official support.</p>



<p>Players on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 will benefit from improved visuals, more stable frame rates, and reduced crashes. However, the headline is undoubtedly the end of support for last-gen consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-pubg-moving-to-current-gen-in-november">PUBG Moving to Current-Gen in November</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced on the <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, PUBG will no longer be playable or available to download on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on <strong>November 13, 2025.</strong></p>



<p>The end for the platforms will come following live server maintenance on the above date, though the schedule is subject to change depending on the review process for each platform.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that existing account data and purchased items will be “securely preserved,” with players having the ability to log into the game on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S at any time after the change to continue playing on an existing account—with no separate transfer required.</p>



<p>While Xbox Series X|S players will have their version upgraded via the platform’s Smart Delivery process on November 13, PS5 players are required to download the new PS5 version of PUBG from the PlayStation Store when the update is live.</p>



<p>In the announcement, it was added that a goal of “fairness across all platforms” is a major priority, with the intention to provide a stable 60fps experience across all platforms. To enable this, the Xbox Series S will have selectable options of a Resolution Mode and a Performance Mode.</p>



<p>Is the move to current-gen consoles long overdue for PUBG? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3293/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Black Ops 7 news and leaks are starting to come thick and thin. A Tac-Sprint rumor suggests that the developer is toying with the idea of removing Tac-Sprint altogether from Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, it’s claimed.</p>



<p>Tac-Sprint is an auto-run mechanic allowing you to move faster in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD</a>. It comes with a strict penalty, though: A slightly slower time to aim. Many skilled players have been able to master the nuances of the movement. But there are also plenty of people who wish it weren’t in the game. If you’re one of those people, you might get your wish.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-reportedly-trying-out-no-tac-sprint">Black Ops 7 Reportedly Trying Out No Tac-Sprint</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could be very divisive. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The leak/report comes from one <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostofHope</a>—one of Call of Duty’s most renowned insiders—who claims to have new information on Tac-Sprint.</p>



<p>“There’s currently a build of Black Ops 7 being tested right now that has no tac sprint. This doesn’t mean the final game won’t have it but this is a very GOOD sign,” they said on X.</p>



<p>Now, they have previously reported that Tac-Sprint <em>is</em> in the game. This has probably been the case in the past, but new developments can always arise. It’s quite likely that a lack of Tac-Sprint in some capacity is being tested for Black Ops 7.</p>

<p>Whether the feature makes it into the full game remains to be seen. We’ll keep you updated on the latest rumors and leaks. Are you hoping Tac-Sprint sits BLOPS 7 out?
