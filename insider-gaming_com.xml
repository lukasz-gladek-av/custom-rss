<p>A new comic book one-shot inspired by the immensely popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=marvel+rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> game, titled Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1, is coming to comic book shops this summer. The series features stories from some incredible Japanese comic book artists, including some who’s character designs have already appeared in-game.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-ignite-first-of-likely-many-game-inspired-comics">Marvel Rivals: Ignite First of Likely Many Game-Inspired Comics</h2>



<p>Marvel <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/marvel-rivals-ignite-new-comic-book-series-variant-covers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today that Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1 will feature a trio of stories from comic book artists Peach Momoko, Yuji Kaku, Mitsuyasu Sakai and Ryusei Yamada. Each of the three stories will feature two playable characters doing head-to-head. Sai (Psylocke) will take on Venom, Luna Snow will travel to Asgard to face Hela, and Punisher goes “face-to-face” with Peni Parker.</p>



<p>Momoko, who is authoring and drawing the Venom vs. Sai story, became a popular face in the comic book world though her own “Momoko-verse,” where she reimagined various Marvel characters through the lens of Japanese folktales. She’s currently writing the Ultimate X-Men series, but she’s contributed designs for in-game Peni Parker and Spider-Man skins based on her own unique style. It’s possible these skin designs of hers eventually launch in-game around June 11th, when Marvel Rivals: Ignite hits stores. Today’s announcement says that “Momoko’s new wave of in-game costumes take center stage” in Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1.</p>







<p>Manga artist Yuji Kaku is writing and drawing the Punisher vs. Peni Parker story. Kaku has only contributed to a couple of Marvel projects recently, but is famous for penning the Hell’s Paradise: Jigokuraku manga, which was adapted into an anime in 2023. Finally, writer Mitsuyasu Sakai and artist Ryusei Yamada will take on the story featuring Luna Snow and Hela. Sakai has written scripts for Japanese animation for nearly 30 years, including the episode “The Duel” from the Star Wars: Visions series. Ryusei Yamada adapted the anime REVENGER into a manga series in 2023.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement from Marvel implies that more one-shots inspired by Marvel Rivals could hit comic book stores in the future. Will you be heading to the comic book shop to pick up Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1 on June 11th?

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is Ubisoft’s first Day One release on Steam it’s already climbed the platform’s all-time player peak charts to become third in series history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/not-even-1-day-after-release-assassins-creed-shadows-player-count-on-steam-already-has-valhalla-beat-and-now-its-coming-for-odyssey-and-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>), Assassin’s Creed Shadows is off to a great start on Steam, achieving an all-time player peak of 41,412 on the first day (at the time of writing). To compare, Shadows has more than doubled AC Valhalla’s numbers, which peaked at 15,679 2.3 years ago. It is less than 150 players away from beating AC Origins’ peak, 41,551, which arrived 7.4 years ago. AC Odyssey still stands strong at the moment, peaking at 62,069 6.4 years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding AC Shadows reviews on Steam, things seem to be going well for Ubisoft, with the platform categorising it as “Very Positive”.

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest instalment of Ubisoft’s popular series. For those unaware of the game, the new setting takes players to Feudal Japan, where they explore a fresh narrative set in a vast open world through the eyes of dual protagonists.</p>



<p>The new protagonists are Yasuke and Naoe, both featuring distinct playstyles. One is a stealthy Assassin, and the other is a legendary Samurai; players must master both characters to take down enemies with precision and power. The game also introduces a fully customisable hideout where you train your crew, craft/upgrade weapons, and interact with characters.&nbsp;</p>
