<p>Take-Two CEO has put fans’ minds at ease, revealing that they have “every reason to believe” GTA Online will continue after the GTA 6 launch. </p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6, the next mainline title for the wildly popular Rockstar Games series, is all set to release in November 2026, and the developers have recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-release-date-earnings-call/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaffirmed the date</a> as well. However, with the new instalment on the way, players have been wondering whether the online services of the previous title will sunset after GTA 6’s launch. </p>







<h2 id="h-take-two-has-every-reason-to-continue-gta-online-support-once-gta-6-arrives">Take Two Has ‘Every Reason’ to Continue GTA Online Support Once GTA 6 Arrives</h2>



<p>During the most recent <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/bb6700ad-114c-4457-b4da-379bbd89053b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings</a> call, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick responded to an investor’s question about the support for GTA Online. Zelnick expressed strong confidence in the service’s ongoing support, stating that they have “every reason to believe” it will continue. He emphasized that the game has a “great community” that remains engaged, and noted that Rockstar has demonstrated how the title can remain relevant for years after its release, thanks to the high-quality additional content.</p>



<p><strong>Interested readers can check out Strauss Zelnick’s complete statement below: </strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“At the same time, I have every reason to believe we’ll continue to support&nbsp;GTA Online.&nbsp;There’s a great community that loves it, that stays engaged. And again, in this quarter, Rockstar has shown that when you deliver great additional content, despite how long GTA Online has been in the market, people show up.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA Online has been around for more than a decade and is still a top contender in the games industry. On Steam alone, GTA 5 is able to bring in more than 100,000 players daily, and that’s almost all thanks to the Online service. What’s more, it was just announced that GTA 5 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-has-sold-225-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 225 million copies</a> worldwide, and GTA Online contributed significantly to that as well. </p>



<p>In discussing the title, Zelnick pointed out that the Grand Theft Auto series has “vastly outpaced” their forecasts. This impressive performance can be attributed to a “recurrent spending growth of 27%,” driven by the latest update for GTA Online, titled “A Safehouse in the Hills.” This update introduced new mansion properties and marked the return of the game’s protagonist, Michael DeSanta.</p>







<p>In other news, GTA 6 marketing will begin this summer and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-marketing-to-start-this-summer-will-have-physical-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will have a physical edition</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-genai-has-zero-part-in-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GenAI has zero part</a> in the upcoming title.

    <div>
        
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will be shown during Thursday’s Nintendo Direct event.</p>



<p>According to known leaker NateTheHate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix</a> is expected to show the game during the Partner Direct on February 5. He adds that it’s also possible that they’ll announce a release date for the game as well.</p>







<p><strong>“They will give it a release date and a brand-new trailer,”</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8B7axb3JMY&amp;t=3323s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. <strong>“Last week it was reported that Square Enix was targeting a summer release for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Switch 2 and Xbox. And to my understanding, that information is correct.”</strong></p>



<p>He then said that he thinks that the game will release sometime in June. </p>



<p>Of course, despite his track record with rumors and reports, it’s important to take the latest claims with a grain of salt.</p>







<p>The Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-partner-direct-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takes place at 9am ET/6am PT</a> on February 5. It will focus on games from external developers coming to both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>1425493</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a special day for this NYT Connections hints guide, because today is <strong>my birthday! </strong>It’s nice to celebrate in many ways, but today I’m welcoming my most recent trip around the sun by helping you solve today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Below, you’ll find the hints and solutions you need to get this puzzle completed as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Read on to learn what you need to know, and perhaps leave me a ‘Happy birthday!’ in the comments below!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #970:</p>



<ul>
<li>AMERICAN FLAG</li>



<li>BUMP</li>



<li>APPLE PIE</li>



<li>BUTT</li>



<li>BALD EAGLE</li>



<li>KNOCK</li>



<li>BASEBALL</li>



<li>RAM</li>



<li>JEANS</li>



<li>ANG</li>



<li>LAPIS LAZULI</li>



<li>BRUCE</li>



<li>OCEAN</li>



<li>CHRISTOPHER</li>



<li>SKY</li>



<li>SPIKE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Quintessentially American</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – When things are in your way</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Just like the group</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Lees of the film world</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 5:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-5-970">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 5 (#970)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– AMERICAN FLAG, APPLE PIE, BALD EAGLE, BASEBALL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BUMP, BUTT, KNOCK, RAM</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – JEANS, LAPIS LAZULI, OCEAN, SKY</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – ANG, BRUCE, CHRISTOPHER, SPIKE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[WD To Release A 100TB Hard Drive By 2029]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wd-100tb-hard-drive-2029/</link>
            <guid>1425487</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WD wants you to never have to by another storage device again. The digital storage company—also known as Western Digital—announced its new High Bandwidth Drive and Dual Pivot technology.</p>



<p>The Dual Pivot technology, <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/2026/2026-02-03-western-digital-accelerates-storage-innovation-for-ai-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WD says</a>, will add a second set of “independently operating actuators on a separate pivot and will deliver up to 2x sequential IO gain within a 3.5-inch drive.”</p>







<p><strong>“This differs from previous dual actuator designs that sacrificed capacity and required extensive customer software changes,”</strong> WD says. <strong>“Dual Pivot enables reduced spacing between disks, allowing for more platters per drive and higher overall capacity.”</strong></p>



<p>The High Bandwidth Drive will allow simultaneous writing and reading from multiple heads on multiple tracks. This technology, according to WD, will offer double the bandwidth of standard HDDs without any power setbacks. </p>



<p><strong>“The technology has a clear path to scale up to 8x bandwidth gains and is already in customer hands for validation,”</strong> they said.</p>







<p>With the new technologies, and others that continue to improve, WD has plans to scale its HDD offerings in a major way over the next few years. The company has already announced its 40TB UltraSMR ePMR HDD that will enter production in the second half of 2026. </p>



<p>After the 40TB drive comes a 60TB offering before moving to 100TB by 2029. </p>



<p><strong>“The result is unprecedented flexibility,”</strong> they say. <strong>“Hyperscalers and enterprises can adopt either technology on their own timelines with predictable capacity planning and seamless scaling – no forced technology transitions, no infrastructure disruptions, just continuous and accelerating capacity growth built on architecture they already trust.”</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I fell in love with PIONER when it was released in early access on December 16, exclusively on Steam. It’s a post-apocalyptic MMORPG with serious potential, which is what I alluded to in my full review of the game. It has an unmistakable charm, despite being rooted in an irradiated, glum, and perilous world, fraught with mutants, bandits, and lethal anomalies.</p>



<p>PIONER was pieced together by GFA Games, a small studio with roots in the likes of STALKER and Metro. Recently, I had the opportunity to interview the studio’s founder and CEO, Aleksandr Nikitin, about the future of his game and why PIONER simply <strong>had to be </strong>an MMORPG, despite a troubling climate for the genre.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-post-apocalyptic-pioner-had-to-be-an-mmo">Why Post-Apocalyptic PIONER Had To Be An MMO</h2>



<p>Talking to Aleksandr Nikitin, I was curious to learn why PIONER wasn’t a single-player game, given that it’s the studio’s debut title, and soaring out of the gate with a PvPvE MMORPG seemed like one hell of a bold ambition. According to Nikitin, opting for the MMO format was a strategic choice as much as a creative one.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Single-player games can certainly be self-contained as complete works or replayable like a movie you can rewatch multiple times.</p>



<p>However, much like the difference between a movie and a TV series, MMOs have clear advantages: beyond delivering new content and expanding the world, we can develop the story in front of players and allow them to become a part of it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nikitin suggested that the choice to develop an MMO was an intentional one from ‘the very beginning’ of the studio’s foundations. From a rocky origin that saw the studio traverse a financial downturn, the COVID-19 pandemic, and an outbreak of <strong>war</strong>, GFA Games stayed true to the notion of making a stellar MMORPG for an eager audience.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have both large-scale content already in progress, and active development of new content for future patches and expansions.</p>



<p>If players say they want more raids and we see that this mode is statistically more popular than expected, we need to be ready to postpone something else and increase the priority of what players want, because we are making this game for them.</p>



<p>It is important to preserve our vision that brought players to us in the first place, and finding this balance is truly critical for an MMO.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-review-early-access-mmo-ambition/">my PIONER review</a>, I revealed how well the game works as an MMORPG title, and how it can be compared to something like Fallout 76. It’s grittier and more serious in how it delivers content, but it’s just as entertaining and is loaded with enough original content to keep players <strong>engaged</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-gfa-is-aware-of-the-struggles">GFA is Aware of the Struggles</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PIONER looks fantastic on screen</figcaption></figure>







<p>The MMORPG space is a rocky, tumultuous one, and the sentiments of the genre ebb and flow. It was just a few days ago that we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ashes-of-creation-collapse-entire-intrepid-studios-laid-off/">Ashes of Creation</a>, an early access MMORPG that raised millions of dollars, implode as the entire studio was laid off.</p>



<p>Nikitin is wholeheartedly aware of that but is willing to compete with the downturn to create something special:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Even legendary giants like Lineage 2 and World of Warcraft are facing serious challenges right now. Next-generation giants like TESO, FF, and F76 are also going through a rough period, while AAA projects like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rust-director-offers-25-million-to-keep-new-world-alive/">New World</a> are simply shutting down.</p>



<p>The MMORPG genre truly struggles to survive and compete with session-based games.</p>



<p>In our view, the only viable path forward is to combine genres, taking their strongest elements and creating a mix.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s what GFA Games did with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-roadmap-revealed-ambitious-few-months/">PIONER</a>. It has arena-based elements like traditional multiplayer matches, some battle royale mechanics, the classic MMO vibe, and the post-apocalyptic action-RPG feel you get from games like Metro and Fallout. It’s an open-world construct with multiple maps, countless threats, and stacks of missions to solve, and progression is everywhere.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-pioner">What’s Next for PIONER</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a showcase of post-apocalyptic vibes</figcaption></figure>







<p>Nikitin was generous enough to give me a look behind the veil of what comes next for PIONER.</p>



<p>There are plenty of aspirations to go above and beyond at GFA Games, which is great news for anyone neck-deep in PIONER, but also for anyone curious about the game and wanting to experience it on other platforms.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have ambitious plans to lay the foundation for a console release, further develop the game’s story, and create new modules.</p>



<p>We plan to focus on developing and optimizing the in-game economy.</p>



<p>We also plan to delight players with new content that was not ready for inclusion in the intitial early access version but already has strong groundwork. This includes new locations such as Big Earth and Shadowlands, new world bosses, and a number of features that are only now beginning development based on player requests.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Throughout the interview, it’s clear how much Nikitin and his team value community feedback. That’s the gist that I got from the game when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-open-beta-launches-again-new-trailer/">I was testing it</a> ahead of the early access launch and experiencing it <strong>after </strong>it dropped. It’s the <strong>only way </strong>to develop a game that only survives if people are actively playing it.</p>



<p>In my opinion, PIONER is an underrated gem of the MMORPG space that deserves way more attention.</p>
