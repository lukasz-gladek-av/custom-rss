<p>For the third straight Major in a row, the most illustrious Counter-Strike 2 Major will feature a different active duty map pool. Valve announced today that the remade Train will replace Vertigo in time for the BLAST.tv Austin Major in April 2025.</p>



<p>With the next CS2 Major using this map pool, many are now expecting the in-game Premier pool and other official tournaments to swap in Train in place of Vertigo.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-line-for-vertigo">End of The Line for Vertigo</h2>



<p>Train officially returned to Counter-Strike, debuting for the first time in CS2, back in November 2024. The reworked map has been subjected to a complete visual overhaul (including a gorgeous rain effect when outdoors) and several major gameplay changes. Notably, both bombsites are now more open with less train car clutter, the Heaven area looking down on the A site is gone, and the “Popdog” ladder has been expanded to a long spiral staircase. The CS2 community as a whole has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/">eager</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">l</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/">y been waiting</a> for Train to come to CS2 for some time.</p>



<p>While Train’s arrival to the Active Duty map pool was inevitable, Valve has finally confirmed which map it will replace: Vertigo. At the professional level, outside of a couple of top North American teams, Vertigo has been one of the least played maps. According to statistics <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/maps?startDate=2024-01-01&amp;endDate=2024-12-31&amp;matchType=BigEvents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from HLTV</a>, it is the least played map at big events in 2024 other than Overpass, which was removed from the map pool during the year.</p>



<p>The only thing that remains unclear is when Train will officially be implemented in the in-game and other tournament map pools. The 2025 calendar for CS2 is set to officially begin just as week from now with BLAST Spring Bounty 2025. With the changes to the CS2 ecosystem, all big events will affect the global standings that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-confirms-cs2-major-expansion-and-rankings-based-invitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">determine who is invited to the Major or its closed qualifiers</a>.</p>



<p>Is replacing Vertigo with Train the right move? Join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>AMD’s next generation of graphics cards are here as the company has officially unveiled its first RDNA 4 graphics cards, the Radeon RX 9000 series. The announcement came during the company’s press event at CES 2025.</p>



<p>The two new cards announced on Monday were the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070. </p>



<p>While the cards have been unveiled along with various partners, not much in terms of specs, specific release date, or pricing were revealed. AMD said that more information on RDNA 4 and the new cards will be announced later this quarter. </p>



<p>What was mentioned was that they would be available at some point during Q1 and feature the next-gen FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4). AMD says that the the cards feature a 4nm process, 2nd generation AI accelerators, and 3rd generation ray tracing accelerators. FSR 4 was also developed specifically for RDNA 4 cards, suggesting that older cards won’t have access to the feature.  That wasn’t confirmed, however.</p>



<p>The new cards, when released, will be available from AMD along with a number of partners such as Asrock, Gigabyte, Sapphire, ASUS, and more. In addition to the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070, AMD will be releasing RX 9060 series graphics cards as well. Information on those cards will also be coming at a later date.</p>

<p>AMD has announced its new Ryzen 9000HX CPUs for laptops. Unveiled during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJoaV5NnPtw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s CES 2025 keynote</a>, the new “Fire Range” processors will launch with three CPUs at first and be available in the first half of 2025.</p>



<p>These new CPUs will be available in various high-end partner laptops, bringing faster gaming and content creation for consumers. They will act as the replacement for the Dragon Range Ryzen 7000HX CPUs.</p>



<p>In total, three processors were announced — the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D, Ryzen 9 9955HX, and Ryzen 9 9850HX. The two Ryzen 9 9955HX cards feature 16 cores and 32 threads along with a max boost clock of 5.4 GHz. The biggest announced difference between the base 9955HX and 9955HX3D is in the total cache where the 9955HX3D has a 144MB cache compared to 80MB for the 9955HX. The 9850HX features 12 cores and 24 threads along with a 5.2 GHz max clock and a 76MB cache.</p>



<p>One of the biggest changes overall comes in terms of TDP. All of the new CPUs announced have a TDP of just 54W, which is down considerable from the 75W of the last-gen chips.</p>
