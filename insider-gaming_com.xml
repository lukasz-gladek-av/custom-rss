<p>PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes reward you for playing the game. It’s a nice feeling, in all honesty, and to make sure you don’t miss out on new rewards such as clothes and consumables, we’ve got the latest PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes for February 2025.</p>



<p>2K has a habit of including Codes and Keys across its games. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands</a> is known for using Shift Keys to give players in-game bonuses. Whereas most of 2K’s sports games use the Locker Codes feature. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> is the latest example of incorporating Locker Codes into the gameplay.</p>



<p>Codes can be hidden in the game or on social media. But they’re not so hidden when we’re around.</p>

<p><strong>You need to go to the Settings menu, find the Locker Code Redemption, and input the code to secure your free goodies in PGA Tour 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is very straightforward, but here are the steps to follow:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to PGA Tour 2K25’s home menu screen.</li>



<li>Head to your <strong>Profile Menu</strong>.</li>



<li>Scroll across to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>

<li>Click on it.</li>

</ol>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-expired-locker-codes">PGA Tour 2K25 Expired Locker Codes</h2>



<p><strong>There are currently no expired Locker Codes in PGA Tour 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>As I write this, the game is still very new, so any active codes valid from its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a> launch are still going strong. You don’t have to miss out if you get on the codes above early enough. But don’t expect it to stay this way.</p>



<p>Make sure you keep checking back to see if any new codes are available. Plus, it’s always handy to know which no longer works.</p>



<hr>



<p>2K will likely add new PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes. The goodies likely vary from code to code, so ensure you’re not missing out on good stuff. Which rewards are you most desperate to be included as part of Locker Codes?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Twitch Thinks Cheating in Games is a ‘Low Severity Violation’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-thinks-cheating-in-games-is-a-%E2%80%98low-severity-violation%E2%80%99.1115289/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Twitch recently posted an update to its terms of service, outlining changes to the platform’s enforcement system. In this update, it was confirmed that violations will now ‘expire’, and the less severe the violation, the faster it’ll disappear from your account history. The most abhorrent violations will remain on your account for up to two years.</p>



<p>However, the policy update penned by Twitch Support also confirmed that the platform believes cheating in video games is an example of a ‘low severity violation’. As such, it will remove any trace of these incidents from your record, if you’ve faced punitive action, in as little as 90 days.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-getting-away-with-it">Getting Away With It</h2>



<p>Twitch’s <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/An-Update-to-our-Enforcement-System?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">enforcement update</a> came with a graphic that shows how things work on the platform.</p>



<p>Every account starts in ‘good standing’ with zero violations. If you’re caught cheating in a game, you’ll get a <strong>one-day </strong>suspension and the record will be marked against your account for 90 days. If you’re caught cheating <strong>again</strong>, you’ll get a <strong>three-day </strong>suspension and that 90-day threshold will reset and be pushed further out.</p>



<p>Following that 90-day window, you’ll be returned to ‘good standing’.</p>



<p>That means that you can be caught cheating multiple times, and as long as you serve your suspension, you’ll only have to wait three months before Twitch views you as a model citizen once again.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Is this justice?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Cheating is one of the most disruptive acts in modern gaming – and it has been a growing issue for years. Some games are borderline unplayable at times because of cheaters ruining everyone’s fun, and publishers and developers have taken ‘cheat makers’ to court and sought out damages in the tens of millions of dollars.</p>



<p>And many have been successful in their pursuits of justice.</p>



<p>In South Korea and China, you can face a fine or even jail time for manufacturing or using cheats in a game – but Twitch is banned in China and around a year ago, the company withdrew from South Korea.</p>



<p>As a lover of all things multiplayer, I find it bizarre that you can publicly cheat in a game on Twitch and a) face just a one-day suspension, and b) have your record scrubbed in 90 days.</p>



<p>What about those cheating in professional tournaments to win cash prizes? Should that just face a one-day suspension?</p>



<p>At the least, you’re standing firm as a testament to the slacking policies of the platform, but in the worst-case scenario, you’re letting others know where and how to cheat in popular multiplayer games. Many cheaters will use their streams to actively promote the sale of cheats, with some dastardly operators securing referral bonuses for pointing malicious gamers to cheating sites.</p>



<p>Do you think Twitch should come down harder on those caught cheating in games? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Neople’s The First Berserker Khazan has sleeper-hit potential, and its 2025 release isn’t one to miss. Whether you want to know which platforms it’s on, how much it costs, or how to play its exclusive demo, we have everything you need to know before you become a berserker yourself.</p>



<p>2024 smashed it in the Soulslike department. FromSoftware delivered its long-awaited Shadow of the Erdtree DLC—Radahn still gives me nightmares—and Stellar Blade was more than stellar. Now, it’s time to look ahead to 2025. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is the first hard-hitting heavyweight in the Soulslike division.</p>



<p>Khazan’s backstory is nearly as brutal and horrific as the punishing gameplay. But to see if this is the start of something special, I’m here to guide you through the title’s key tidbits before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-first-berserker-khazan-come-out">When Does The First Berserker Khazan Come Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re hyped. Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Prepare yourself for The First Berserker Khazan’s March 27 release date.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, the vengeance-hungry warrior graces screens in March. Not content with battling those who wronged him, <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The First Berserker Khazan</a> also has to stave off the presence of other March 2025 games including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-platforms">The First Berserker Khazan Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC users can prepare for The First Berserker Khazan launch.</strong></p>



<p>I’m afraid it’s bad news if I haven’t mentioned your platform. PS4 and Xbox One users have to miss out, as do Nintendo Switch owners. I keep questioning if any 2025 releases will get an eventual <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> port. The console is supposed to be a million times more powerful (might be an exaggeration) and a future Switch 2 launch might not be out of the question.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-the-first-berserker-khazan-demo">How to Play The First Berserker Khazan Demo</h2>



<p><strong>Search for The First Berserker Khazan demo on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC, download it, and get playing.</strong></p>



<p>It’s honestly this simple. But here are some handy instructions to follow precisely if you’re struggling:</p>



<ol>
<li>Choose which platform you want to play The First Berserker Khazan demo on.</li>



<li>Go to the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, or Steam.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>The First Berserker Khazan</strong>.</li>



<li>Select the free demo.</li>



<li>Click to download it.</li>



<li>Once it’s ready, you can jump straight into the The First Berserker Khazan demo.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-editions-amp-price">The First Berserker Khazan Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan has two editions: Standard Edition ($59.99/£49.99) and Deluxe Edition ($69.99/£54.99).</strong></p>



<p>Neople is dispensing with luxuriousness where The First Berserker Khazan is concerned. It’s just a Standard or Deluxe Edition to pick from. Most games release with several editions, so this is a more straightforward selection for once.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s not a full-price release, nor is it getting the hype of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> or even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, but don’t sleep on The First Berserker Khazan. It looks brutal and bold. Do you think it could be this year’s Shadow of the Erdtree? Or is it another Soulslike clone? Leave your thoughts in the comments.</p>
