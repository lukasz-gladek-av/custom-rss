<p>Escape from Tarkov is the most popular extraction shooter in the world, boasting hundreds of thousands of active players. It’s a game centered around <strong>loot</strong>, and sometimes, you might need help securing that loot. That’s where Battlestate Games comes in, regularly publishing Escape from Tarkov codes that you can use to get free items.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve collated all the active Escape from Tarkov codes that you can redeem right now, either in the launcher or via the website. Read on to pick up the free items in Tarkov that you know you want.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-active-escape-from-tarkov-codes">All Active Escape from Tarkov Codes</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games has a habit of publishing Escape from Tarkov codes that expire quite quickly, with some only being available for 24 hours. With that in mind, I’ve written the most recent Tarkov codes that are working, and the ones that <strong>might work</strong> and are still worth a try.</p>



<p><strong>Active Escape from Tarkov Codes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>SERVERMAN</strong></li>

<p>Use these Roblox Merge And Fight monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Seeds, Buckets, Potions and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Merge And Fight is a fusion of Plants Vs Brainrots and the iconic Plants vs. Zombies title. Players must increase their total output and total DPS to build the best garden filled with the finest plants. Furthermore, one must defeat the most profitable high-HP brainrots to increase their revenue contribution. This is when the active Merge And Fight codes come into play. Redeem these <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-survive-wave-z-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> codes to have your inventory overflowing with various Potions and Gears. New players using the codes will quickly secure the finest early-game brainrots and build the most damage-inflicting plants without grinding.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-active-merge-and-fight-codes">Active Merge And Fight Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>update1</strong>&nbsp; – x2 Jalapeno Seed, x3 Iron Bucket, and Damage Potion (New)</li>



<li><strong>cactus</strong> – x2 Cactus Seed, x3 Golden Bucket, x2 Plant Attack Potion, and x5 Freeze Grenade&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>pea</strong> – 2x Damage Potion, 2x Seed Potion, Speed Potion, and 3x Buckets of Water&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>plantsmerge</strong> – x1 Brainrot Potion, x1 Gloves, and x1 Cactus Seed</li>



<li><strong>welcome</strong> – Damage Potion, x2 Buckets of Water and x1 Shuriken&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-inactive-merge-and-fight-codes">Inactive Merge And Fight Codes</h2>



<p>There are no expired codes as of the writing of this article. You can expect new codes to be released during milestones and major in-game updates.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-merge-and-fight-codes">How To Redeem Merge And Fight Codes?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Merge And Fight Code Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Follow the steps below to redeem all the active codes:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Merge And Fight and spawn on the map.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Hit the “Store” button.</li>



<li>Scroll down to the last or press the “Redeem Code” key to see the code box.</li>



<li>Enter any code into the “Enter Code” text box.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Press the “Redeem” button to activate the code.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-more-about-merge-and-fight-codes">More About Merge And Fight Codes</h2>



<p>Gears claimed from the active codes have the following use:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Wooden Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 30 seconds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Freeze Grenade – Throws to freeze brainrots for a while.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Shuriken – Throw to deal 120 damage and bounce 2 additional times.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Gloves – Click to deal 600 damage to brainrots.</li>



<li>Iron Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 3 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Golden Bucket – Reduce plant growth time by 10 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Damage Potion – All plants ATK +50%, lasts 30 minutes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Brainrot Potion – Legendary+ brainrot spawn chance +100%, lasts 30 minutes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<p>Use the free Potions when you see boss brainrots walking down the Brainrot Portal. Freeze Grenades are useful because they can stun high HP brainrots and bring them down slowly. When you place rare plants, they’ll take quite some time to grow. This is when you must use the Bucket gears. They will help you ignore the annoying waiting time and quickly set up a sturdy defence in your garden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eidos-Montreal, the studio known for developing Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and supporting games like Tomb Raider and others, has had more layoffs.</p>



<p>Over the last week, a number of now former employees took to LinkedIn to announce that they were no longer with the company.</p>







<p><strong>“Hey there!”</strong> gameplay director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7398821593012989953/?originTrackingId=HOT3SE08iXRoDN1N9LEmuQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel Daher wrote</a>. <strong>“Was working at Eidos, loved it and would have stayed, but times are difficult.”</strong></p>



<p>In total, at least a dozen or more people are now looking for work. This is the second known wave of job cuts at the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after 75 people were let go</a> back in March. At the time, it was said that the layoffs were done due to “mandates coming to an end”.</p>



<p>And while one would hope that the latest layoffs are the end, that doesn’t appear to be the case. In recent days, multiple sources have explained to Insider Gaming most projects at the studio have been cancelled. The focus for Eidos-Montreal right now, they say, is on the work it’s doing with Microsoft and Xbox on games like Grounded 2 and Fable. There’s also another internal project that started development in 2019 which, sources say, has no way of recouping its current costs. </p>



<p>After those projects wrap, however, <strong>“additional staff reductions are already forecasted.”</strong></p>







<p>Insider Gaming has attempted to reach out to both Eidos-Montreal and its parent company Embracer for comment. As of writing, no responses have been received. In the past, Embracer has often declined to give an official comment on subjects such as layoffs and internal development projects. </p>
