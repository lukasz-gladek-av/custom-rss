<p>The first full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a> Direct of the year could be coming next week.</p>



<p>In his latest video on Monday, known insider NateTheHate spoke about when Nintendo fans should expect the first full Nintendo Direct showcase. </p>







<p><strong>“From what I have been told, the first Direct of 2026 will be held during the opening week of February,”</strong> he said. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMQiG9bc4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He then said</a> that the expectation is that the show will take place on Thursday, February 5.</p>



<p>While he mentions next week as being the time, NateTheHate did leave it a bit open. He said that that he had yet to confirm the information with his “best contacts just yet”. Should he have to give an update or amend anything, he says, he’ll do it on social media when he can. </p>







<p>He added that he didn’t know the type of Nintendo Direct it would be, nor did he mention any possible games. </p>



<p><strong>“While I hope it will be a general direct so Nintendo can really start the year with strong momentum—begin to detail some of those brand new first party games coming out in 2026, let us know what they have planned for The Legend of Zelda’s 40th anniversary—it could just as easily be a partner showcase,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>As with all rumors, please take this information on the Nintendo Direct with a grain of salt until it’s been independently verified by Insider Gaming or confirmed by Nintendo.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Nintendo isn’t leaving fans waiting too long for some news regarding its games. The company announced on Monday that it was holding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomodachi-life-nintendo-direct-arriving-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomodachi Life-specific Direct</a> on January 29.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is YAPYAP on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-playstation-xbox-nintendo-all-platforms/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re starting to get into the meat of 2026, and everyone is looking forward to seeing what games appear out of nowhere to suddenly steal hearts (and player counts from other games). YAPYAP could be that, and if you’re a console player desperate to play it, let’s check its PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo status for you.</p>



<p>Everything about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-official-release-date-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YAPYAP</a> screams success. One thing to shout home about is that it’s coming to Steam and PC, that’s almost a given. If you’re looking for clarification about its console platforms, then come quietly.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-yapyap-on-ps5-consoles">Can You Play YAPYAP On PS5 Consoles?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could appear, as if by magic. Credit to Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>YAPYAP is not on the agenda for PlayStation 5 owners, nor any PS4 players who haven’t upgraded yet.</strong></p>



<p>It appears as if YAPYAP is staying the course on PC for now. The game can be purchased through Steam—more details about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-cost-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YAPYAP’s price here</a>—and there will be no yelling down PS5 microphones for the time being.</p>



<p>As with all Steam games, if there’s a strong demand, it could come to PS5. It also depends on the developer and publisher, too. You only have to look at Content Warning as the perfect subject here.</p>



<p>Whereas games like Lethal Company and REPO—which are arguably more popular—have opted against a console release for the time being, Landfall is bringing Content Warning to console. It’s another of the recent ‘Friendslop’ trend, and should be a hit party game on console.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-yapyap-on-xbox-series-x-s-consoles">Can You Play YAPYAP On Xbox Series X|S Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>There will be no Xbox Series X|S console launch for YAPYAP either.</strong></p>



<p>The Xbox and PC link has been a popular one for many years. However, there’s still an element of separation where certain game releases are concerned, in this case, low-budget indie Steam titles.</p>



<p>YAPYAP has plenty of appeal and could be perfect for Xbox owners. If you want to play it with your friends and use knock-off Wingardium Leviosa spells to annoy them, you need a PC and Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-yapyap-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2-consoles">Can You Play YAPYAP On Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 Consoles?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All quiet on this front. Credit to Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nintendo consoles commonly get a lot of low-key indie titles and third-party releases, but you won’t find YAPYAP on either the Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 anytime soon.</strong></p>



<p>The Switch 2’s stunning 4K, HDR, 120 FPS screen and setup won’t have you flying around YAPYAP. It’s a full-scale Steam release for YAPYAP, and there have been no messages or signals of intent to bring it to consoles yet.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates, and keep checking back in case it does get a console port down the line.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem’s Leon is a Brutal Powerhouse To Offset Grace’s Weakness]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-brutal-grace-weak/</link>
            <guid>1416283</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released in one month, and fans are <strong>excited</strong>. It’s a solid return to Raccoon City as <strong>both </strong>Leon Kennedy and Grace Ashcroft, and it’s a diverse title shot from two perspectives – first- and third-person. It also features the kind of dual story that has been seen in the series before, with Leon and Grace exploring the same locations at different times.</p>



<p>In a recent walkthrough by Xbox Wire, the nature of this duality is perfectly portrayed. While Leon Kennedy is a combat master and a powerhouse of the apocalypse, Grace Ashcroft is, by all accounts, demure and frightened – but <strong>willing to survive</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-leon-cracks-skulls-grace-kind-of-avoids-them">Leon Cracks Skulls, Grace Kind of Avoids Them</h2>



<p>The mixed perspective available in Resident Evil Requiem effectively makes this ‘two games’, as recently explained <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/26/resident-evil-requiem-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Xbox Wire</a>. Grace’s journey puts players in control of a timid, terrified individual with a tighter inventory, a lack of combat experience, and the clear inability to take down the game’s heftier enemies.</p>



<p>Leon, on the other hand, is blasting the undead and tearing enemies to shreds (even ones Grace can’t touch) while offering quips and one-liners.</p>



<p>When you assume control of Grace, you’re taking a more investigative approach, and combat is more of a last resort than a first approach. Leon flips that script and weilds chainsaws, a hatchet, and hands and feet that must be registered as lethal weapons somewhere to dispatch all comers.</p>



<p>Xbox Wire referred to Leon’s sections of the game as ‘big, loud, and dumb, and a relieving change of pace’ compared to Grace’s slower, methodical approach that orders you to think twice about every door you open and every corner you turn.</p>







<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on February 27. Let us know which character you’re most excited to control on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How Much Does YAPYAP Cost? Price, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-cost-price/</link>
            <guid>1416280</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>YAPYAP is talking aloud, as it could be a huge indie hit, and wants everyone’s attention. Its yapping is literal, but one thing it’s remained silent on is the pricier tag.</p>



<p>The genre of games that includes hit titles such as Lethal Company, REPO, and PEAK has lovingly been titled ‘Friendslop.’ Seen as cheap and easy-to-make indie titles with a pure multiplayer appeal, centered around bedlam and busy work. It’s harsh, but it doesn’t matter when the games are so much fun. Besides, plenty of people seem to like them! <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-official-release-date-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YAPYAP</a> looks to be the first of many ‘Friendslop’ games in 2026, and its concept means it could be the best.</p>



<p>However, a quick dive into YAPYAP’s price first is on the cards.</p>







<h2 id="h-do-we-know-yapyap-s-price">Do We Know YAPYAP’s Price?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It shouldn’t be too spooky. Credit to Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>So far, Maison Bap has yet to reveal YAPYAP’s price across any of its social media, and Insider Gaming has also tried reaching out for an early sneak peek at the price, to no avail.</strong></p>



<p>Either Maison Bap is keeping its cards close to its chest until YAPYAP’s launch, or the developer simply sees no reason to let people know. There’s nothing wrong with this, and it’s something many indie games on Steam opt for.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will keep checking for price updates, so check back to this guide. If you hear or see nothing, it’s probably a case of waiting until release day to find out.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-yapyap-expected-to-cost">How Much Is YAPYAP Expected To Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A magical price tag surely awaits. Credit to Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A reasonable price tag of between $7.99 and $9.99 is expected for YAPYAP.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a similar trending price tag for these types of games, and based on YAPYAP’s first trailer and announcements, it’s safe to assume the game will go in a similar direction to those that have come before it.</p>



<p>For example, Lethal Company’s RRP on Steam is $9.99 or £8.50, PEAK is $7.99 or £6.39, and REPO has also opted for the $9.99 or £8.50 approach.</p>



<p>Unless there’s a staggering amount of work and production that has gone into YAPYAP, you should expect to pay no more than $9.99 for YAPYAP.</p>



<p>Never say never in this industry. How much do you think YAPYAP will end up costing? Drop your guesses via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
