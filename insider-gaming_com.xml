<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will be jumping into action during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>. The game is set to release sometime in 2026 and has been highly anticipated by fans.</p>



<p>Revealed at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025</a>, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is bringing back the Caped Crusader in all his blocky glory. Set to be an original story taking from the series’ most iconic moments, it looks like the perfect love letter to the DC franchise. While it won’t have many playable characters, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-open-world-arkham-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its open-world Gotham City</a> and Arkham-inspired combat will tide fans over. It’s been a bit quiet from TT Games about the title, especially with the 2026 release approaching. Now, it seems fans will get a new look at it on December 11th.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/LEGODCGame/status/1998211049951047851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet from the game’s official account</a>, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will appear at The Game Awards. The post, seen above, shows Lego Batman guarding a poster for the Geoff Keighley-hosted show, which’ll take place at Peacock Theater. It’s unclear what exactly will be shown at the event, scheduled for December 11th. However, it does seem likely fans will get a release window/date, given it’s due to come out in 2026. Even still, gameplay of the title is most certainly going to appear, so there’s that to look forward to. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got its hands</a> on LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight at Gamescom 2025 over the summer. The writer found the gameplay fun and engaging, calling the overall experience one with massive potential. Seeing as the LEGO games are a guilty pleasure for many, Legacy of the Dark Knight looks to be just what Gotham (and the world) needs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[2K Games is Launching a New Studio Headed by ex-The Initiative Leadership]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two former lead employees from The Initiative have launched a new studio for 2K Games. Previously, both members worked on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-and-xbox-no-longer-working-crystal-dynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cancelled Perfect Dark title</a> for Xbox.</p>



<p>The Initiative was an ambitious new first-party studio for Microsoft/Xbox and led by former Crystal Dynamics head, Darrell Gallagher. It brought in many notable figures from studios like Rockstar, Santa Monica Studios, and Naughty Dog. The studio’s first title was announced to be a remake/reboot of Perfect Dark. Unfortunately, earlier this year, the game was cancelled and The Initiative was shut down. Now, two former employees, including Darrell himself, are heading up a new studio for 2K Games.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403902973464014848/?originTrackingId=juNbzYzc45PM4zhZ2yaPjg%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a LinkedIn post</a>, former studio head of The Initiative, Darrell Gallagher, announced that he’ll be joining a new studio for 2K Games. He’ll join as SVP, Studio Head of the yet-to-be-named studio. His message can be found below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>I’m excited to share that I will be joining 2K as SVP, Studio Head, where I’ll be building a new studio and leading an ambitious opportunity unlike anything I’ve taken on before</strong>,” says Gallagher. “<strong>I’ve spent my career believing in what’s possible when great people come together with a bold vision. I can’t wait to get started with the exceptional team at 2K!</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Furthermore, Brian Horton, former Creative Director at The Initiative for Perfect Dark, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403908881246318592/?originTrackingId=CgNwdSlyrogNLDJN1Ms7OQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced on LinkedIn</a> that he will join Darrell as VP Head of Creative. Prior to The Initiative, Horton served as Creative Director for Marvel’s Spider-Man and the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>. No information was shared regarding any other talent joining or what the game may be. Either way, it is a pretty big snag and may give fans a peek as to what stories The Initiative would have told if not disbanded.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic 2 Remake Was In Development]]></title>

<p>It’s not just the original Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic that was getting the remake treatment. According to a new report, the game’s sequel, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords, also had a remake in development.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest edition of the GameFile newsletter</a>, Stephen Totillo dove into the game’s release on the Nintendo Switch. He writes about the fact that a planned console release for the Restored Content Mod was announced and planned, but never was released. That’s because, according to filings, Disney’s lawyers put a “blocker in place”.</p>







<p>That blocker was <strong>“a prohibition on releasing the Restored Content DLC for Switch without further clearances around who actually made the mod.”</strong> As Totillo wrote, it was an “insurmountable” roadblock that stopped it from ever coming with an official announcement on the matter happening in 2023. </p>



<p>As Totillo went further into what happened on the legal side that prevented it from releasing, he found that there was another project at developer Aspyr. Codenamed Juliet, it was a “full, modern remake” of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords. </p>



<p>This remake, it’s said, was in development as recently as March 2025. It was also set to have all of the cut content back in the game.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear if the game is still in development.</p>
