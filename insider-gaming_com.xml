<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is one of the most anticipated games of the year, and for all the completionists, there’s a host of achievements and trophies to grind for.</p>



<p>Having caught our eye in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, Silksong is a successor to the original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-hollow-knight-silksong-a-sequel-or-prequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight</a>, and fans have had to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wait patiently for nearly a decade</a> for its release.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for the full Gamerscore available in Hollow Knight: Silksong, or are chasing all the trophies to earn the coveted Platinum trophy on PlayStation, we’ve got the full list for you.</p>

<p><strong>The list of achievements and trophies in Hollow Knight: Silksong is sure to keep you occupied, with a load of bosses to defeat and items to collect.</strong></p>



<p>Progression is largely the name of the game, with achievements and trophies distributed for completing specific stages, but those wanting full completion will have to lock-in.</p>



<p>For anyone seeking maximum Gamerscore and the Platinum trophy, prepare to complete a speedrun as one achievement requires completing the game in under five hours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the minutes leading up to the global release of Hollow Knight: Silksong, more than 240,000 viewers were waiting in the chats of thousands of Twitch channels about to stream the game. Unfortunately, the sheer number of people hitting ‘download’ all at the same time took down Steam, leading many to wait and watch others start playing this highly anticipated game.</p>



<p>I scrolled through Twitch, clicking on various channels to see users disappointed at Steam’s implosion, brought on by their own doing.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-silksong-offline-for-everyone">Is Hollow Knight: Silksong Offline for Everyone?</h2>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong reached epic proportions on streaming platforms even before it had been released by Team Cherry. On Twitch, scores of viewers were sitting and eagerly awaiting the game’s launch, joining their favorite content creators in counting down to that inevitable moment when they could finally start downloading the game.</p>



<p>As I write this, more than 310,000 people are watching Hollow Knight: Silksong, and more than 47,000 people have managed to get into the game on Steam.</p>



<p>We’re also seeing reports that the Nintendo eShop and the Xbox Store are suffering, which we’re working to verify. Most recently, the store page for Hollow Knight: Silksong on Microsoft’s platforms disappeared, and we can’t fathom why.</p>



<p>Up until launch, Hollow Knight: Silksong remained the number one most-wanted game on Steam, acquiring a spot on millions of wishlists worldwide. During the Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom, a new trailer for the game was revealed, the the release date was dropped shortly after.</p>



<p>It was a monumental thing that had fans frothing at the mouth, simply because that release date was set to arrive <strong>today</strong>, mere weeks after the latest trailer dropped.</p>



<p>Earlier today, it was revealed by Team Cherry developers that the Silksong protagonist, Hornet, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-new-protagonist-completely-changed-dlc-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caused drastic design changes</a> based on her character model.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s DLC plans were tossed out thanks to the new protagonist, Hornet. </p>



<p>Team Cherry’s new game, which was finally released today, has been in development for 7 long years. The game started out as a DLC, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grew larger than planned</a>, with the devs adding multiple towns, a deep quest system, and a world much bigger than the original games. Now, the developers have revealed one of the major factors that contributed to the game’s lengthy development. </p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-s-hornet-changed-everything-for-the-developers">Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Hornet Changed Everything for the Developers</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/team-cherry-had-to-go-back-to-the-drawing-board-for-hollow-knight-silksong-for-one-simple-reason-hornet-being-taller-changes-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Team Cherry’s leads, Ari Gibson and William Pellen, explained how Hornet led to changes in Hollow Knight: Silksong’s DLC plans. Pellen explained that “Hornet being taller changes everything,” and the devs couldn’t do justice to the new playable character through just a DLC. </p>



<p>In Hollow Knight: Silksong, Hornet is able to travel much faster, jump higher, mantle or clamber onto ledges, and is generally more acrobatic than the previous protagonist. Hence, “the caves around her have to expand to accommodate her height.” Moreover, Hornet’s fighting is faster, and her competence led to a change in enemy design as well. “The core of the world is mainly a reflection” of this character and her nature “is echoed in the way the world is set up.”</p>



<p>If Hornet were straight placed in Hollow Knight’s world, she would be easily able to maneuver through the “would-be hazards,” and the extended attack range changes things as well. Silksong, on the other hand, brings “greater focus on aggression, decisive action, and proactive decision making.”</p>



<p>Gibson also elaborated that Hornet is half-bug, which not only makes the character more physical, but the world as well. Which means players will see “less glowy orb things, and magic bursts of light, and many more blades and traps.”</p>



<p>In other news, Hollow Knight: Silksong developers are offering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-offer-free-switch-2-upgrades-for-switch-1-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Switch 2 upgrades</a> to Switch 1 players. Also, the game releases today. Here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-cherry-confirms-hollow-knight-silksong-price-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price details and release times</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Is Dying Light: The Beast Coming to Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-dying-light-the-beast-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1288665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox Game Pass is one of the pillars of subscription-based gaming services. With Dying Light: The Beast looking to cause an explosive ruckus, it would be apocalyptic if The Beast jumped over the odd rooftop to get onto Game Pass.</p>



<p>Dying Light is looking to unleash the animal in all of us with The Beast. The game is a sequel to Dying Light 2, and brings back long-time hero <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-explains-kyle-crane-thirst-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyle Crane</a>. Techland has worked on the third full game, to the extent of delaying the horror title. The Beast resumes the series’ on-brand cocktail of parkour and dishing out pain.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> arrives during a busy September 2025. But if you’ve only got eyes for The Beast, you should know its Xbox Game Pass status in case you can save a penny or two.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dying-light-the-beast-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Dying Light: The Beast On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’ll be hell to pay for this. Credit to Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Neither Techland nor Microsoft has said Dying Light: The Beast is coming to Xbox Game Pass as either a day-one launch or as a freebie at some point in the future.</strong></p>



<p>It’s very telling if you approach a game’s release date and there’s nothing about <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a>. In 99% of cases, this means the game won’t be a day-one launch title. Xbox has had some third-party winners in 2025, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and even the Soulslike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>.</p>



<p>However, unless you’re an Xbox Game Studios title, there’s a good chance you’re paying full whack for the game—as is the case with Dying Light: The Beast. It’s not had a Game Pass logo slapped onto any of its trailers, and the Xbox store listing doesn’t bat even the slightest eyelid at the prospect.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-dying-light-the-beast-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Dying Light: The Beast Come To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>I’d say the chances of Dying Light: The Beast coming to Xbox Game Pass are pretty slim right now, given the franchise’s lack of history with the service.</strong></p>



<p>When you’ve enquired about enough games and their Xbox Game Pass chances, you learn a thing or two. I don’t think a Dying Light game has ever been on Xbox Game Pass. I can’t find the history of this, but Microsoft does have a habit of removing games after a while.</p>



<p>As of writing, you can’t find Dying Light or Dying Light 2 on Xbox Game Pass. That could be a big indicator of the game’s future on Game Pass. It’s not like these are niche indie titles after all. There have been rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-pass-killed-by-first-party-development-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass being unsustainable due to first-party development costs</a>.</p>



<p>It’s one of those: If The Beast is announced for Game Pass, you’ll hear it from us first. On the other hand, I suggest keeping your expectations in check on this one.</p>
