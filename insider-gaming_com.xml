<p>If you’ve just finished season two of the Fallout television show, you might have a few questions spinning around your head. Most critically, you might be wondering what Liberty Prime Alpha is and why it’s so important to those in the Fallout universe. This behemoth character was ‘introduced’ in the mid-credits sequence of the Fallout TV show’s second season finale, and it has some fans confused.</p>



<p>In case you’re unaware, Liberty Prime is the name of an enormous robot character in the Fallout universe, made most iconic in 2008’s Fallout 3 when it stormed into battle against the Enclave. It was seen again in 2015’s Fallout 4, but has lived in the shadows ever since.</p>



<p>But what’s <strong>Liberty Prime Alpha?</strong></p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-s-liberty-prime-alpha-is-coming">Fallout’s Liberty Prime Alpha is Coming</h2>



<p>In the closing seconds of the season two finale of Fallout, we saw blueprints for Liberty Prime Alpha, a towering robot that the Brotherhood of Steel, now led by ‘Quintus the Destroyer’, intends to build.</p>



<p>Those familiar with Fallout will instantly recognize Liberty Prime, but Liberty Prime <strong>Alpha </strong>is an entirely new construct, seen for the first time as the second season wrapped.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Liberty Prime Alpha could be the bgiger brother of this</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s assumed that Quintus, who was betrayed by Knight Maximus in the second season of the show, will attempt to build Liberty Prime Alpha, but his intended target is unclear. Liberty Prime is an utter wrecking machine, so Liberty Prime Alpha should be borderline apocalyptic, no pun intended.</p>



<p>It’s unclear where the blueprints for Liberty Prime Alpha came from, as Maximus’ friend Dane approached Quintus with them as the mid-credits sequence played out. At that point, Area 51, the home of the Knights of San Fernando, was the site of an exploding civil war between various chapters of the Brotherhood of Steel, one of Fallout’s oldest and most recognizable factions.</p>



<p>The most likely explanation is that the blueprints were somewhere <strong>in </strong>Area 51, and that was one of the driving reasons for Quintus to relocate his chapter there and try to align with the other faction bodies.</p>







<p>Whatever happens in season three of Fallout, we might see the creation of one of the biggest robots the franchise has ever seen. Are you excited? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/blizzard-entertainment/" id="87642">Blizzard </a>confirms <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch </a>will drop the “2,” launching a year-long Reign of Talon story arc with new heroes and seasons through 2026.</p>



<p>During the Overwatch Spotlight on February 4, Blizzard announced that not only are they launching the first year-long story for Overwatch with the “Reign of Talon” plot, but moving forward, the game would simply be known as Overwatch again. Season one of the new format begins on February 10. This arc will run through 2026, with five additional seasons, after which a new story arc will begin with season 1 in 2027.</p>



<p>Along with the new season will come the launch of five new heroes. Three of the heroes will be Talon-aligned: Domina, a tank hero; Emre, a damage hero; and Mizuki, a support hero. There will also be two Overwatch-aligned heroes: Anran (damage) and Jetpack Cat (support).</p>

<h2 id="h-the-reason-for-the-shift-away-from-overwatch-2-explained">The Reason for the Shift Away From Overwatch 2 Explained</h2>



<p>In a press release, the Overwatch team explained that they’re dropping the “2” from the game title because they believe the game is more than a number or an expansion; it’s a living universe, and this year marks a turning point in development.</p>



<p>“This year marks a huge turning point in how the development team envisions the future of Overwatch, so we are officially dropping the ‘2’ and moving forward as Overwatch,” they said.</p>



<p>Overwatch officially became Overwatch 2 in 2022, shifting to a 5v5 PVP-style game. In May 2023, Blizzard canceled planned hero missions for the game, which were to have RPG-style skill trees. The cancellation was due to the risk of diverting too many development resources from the live service game. </p>







<p>Now, the game again shifts focus and makes a new attempt to reach more players while still giving current players something to look forward to.</p>
