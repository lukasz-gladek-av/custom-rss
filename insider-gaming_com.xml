<p>During a new interview, a US patent expert stated that Nintendo is incorrect in its assertion that mods do not count as prior art. </p>



<p>For those unfamiliar, Nintendo and Pocketpair have been engaged in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-has-acquired-2-more-anti-palworld-patents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patent infringement lawsuit</a> for some time now, with the former claiming that the latter has infringed multiple patents with Palworld. Now, a US Patent expert has provided their opinion on the ongoing lawsuit and also on mods not being considered as prior art. </p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-saying-mods-not-counting-is-prior-art-is-the-most-asinine-thing-i-have-seen">Nintendo Saying Mods Not Counting is Prior Art “Is the Most Asinine Thing I Have Seen” </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/nintendo-is-so-wrong-it-hurts-us-ip-expert-says-nintendo-claiming-mods-dont-invalidate-its-pokemon-patents-is-just-a-loser-argument-and-a-hail-mary-in-its-ongoing-legal-fight-with-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+,</a> during a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Nusug2SfA&amp;t=211s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Junglist</a>, Kirk Sigmon, an attorney from Banner Witcoff, and an expert in patent law, spoke about Nintendo’s defense on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-argues-invalidity-and-non-infringement-against-nintendos-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mods not counting as prior art</a>. Sigmon started off by stating that “Nintendo is so wrong it hurts”. Sigmon added that there might be some nuance in Japanese law that could dictate where Nintendo is coming from; however, for the world of prior art, it doesn’t have to be perfect, nor does it have to be functional either. </p>



<p>Sigmon then went on to explain instances where prior art has been used that isn’t a computer program in the first place. He also provided an example of an IPR case from 5-7 years ago, where a Dungeons and Dragons manual was used as prior art, as it included character sheets and other details. He adds that “you don’t have to find prior art that’s of a specific nature”, it doesn’t have to be marketed either. Most of the time, the only requirement is that “it was written down somewhere” to prove that it existed. </p>



<p>The patent expert goes on to say, “Nintendo’s argument that mods are somehow different, to me is the most asinine thing i have seen”. For it seems like it’s coming from someone “who doesn’t understand computers at all”. According to Sigmon’s POV, mods are essential, but they are a very dangerous space at the same time. However, “if you are creating a mod for a game that has certain functionality, that’s all that matters.” </p>



<p>Sigmon goes on to conclude that there have been several references used in patent offices as well as litigation that were never actually made and had numerous flaws, but that doesn’t prevent them from being prior art in the United States. There might be a nuance in Japanese law that he may not be aware of. In general, Sigmon thinks Nintendo’s argument about mods not being prior art “is a loser”. It is “fixated too highly on form over function” because where to we “end that dispute, as there are multiple Unreal Engine 5, are those mods too just cause they are running on a singular engine? </p>

<p>New information on pricing and launch weapons for Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter Marathon has been leaked online. These details from a known Destiny 2 and Marathon data miner include details on the game’s pricing, season pass, and even launch weapons.</p>



<p>In a series of posts on social media, Colony Deaks says that the game will launch with two editions and remain a premium-priced title. </p>



<p>According to their posts, Marathon’s <strong>base price will be $40</strong>—which has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-marathon-price-report-double-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long been rumored</a>–while the Deluxe Edition of the game will be <strong>“around $60”</strong>. The Deluxe Edition, they say, will include more skins for players and possibly more. There’s also a pre-order bonus that includes a Destiny ship, ghost, and sparrow, along with a weapon skin. Lastly, the Deluxe Edition will give players “around $30-ish worth of season pass tokens,” though they are unclear what the tokens will be for. </p>



<p>In addition to the game itself, Bungie is planning a season pass for the game that will be cosmetic only and cost “around $10”.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On October 1, Microsoft announced that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/">rais</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">i</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/">ng the price</a> of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate by 50%. Now, less than a week later, news is coming out that not all subscribers will be subject to the price increase. </p>



<p>According to emails being sent out to Xbox Game Pass members within the European Union (EU) and other countries, the price increase from €18 to €27 will only be for new members and those who don’t have auto-renewal enabled.</p>



<p><span><strong>“Recently, you may have heard about changes to Xbox Game Pass subscription prices,”</strong> the <a href="https://x.com/Colteastwood/status/1975585850751844383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">email reads</a>.<strong> “At this time, these increases will only apply to new purchases and will not affect your current subscription in your region, as long as you are on an auto- recurring plan. </strong></span></p>



<p><strong>“Should you choose to cancel <span>your plan and repurchase, you will be charged the new current rate. If for any reason there may be changes to your existing account, we will notify you at least 60 days in advance and you will have the option to cancel or change your subscription plan at any time.”</span></strong></p>



<p>After the emails went out, you’ve had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/gp_price_hike_doesnt_seem_to_affect_people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many take to Reddit</a> to confirm that they received the same message.</p>



<p>“Same with PC Gamepass in Germany, signed up for it when it was 9,99€, still paying 9,99€ after the increase to 11,99€ and got an email that the price will remain at 9,99€ instead of the new 14,99€ for me,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/gp_price_hike_doesnt_seem_to_affect_people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said one user</a>.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni8rd8z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">others are getting emails</a> confirming a price increase, even if they have auto payments active.</p>



<p>As of publishing, Microsoft hasn’t made any sort of wide-ranging public comment on the matter. Insider Gaming has reached out to the company for clarification on prices for auto-renewal members and what regions are impacted. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>
