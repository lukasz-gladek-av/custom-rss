<p>Bloodborne is still the name on everyone’s lips years later. Its impact has been profound, and bridged a gap between casual gamers and the Soulslike genre. It’s considered one of FromSoftware’s finest pieces of work, and a Bloodborne 2 sequel is being discussed because of a certain The Duskbloods.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> unveiled a ton of exciting details about the new console. But one of the most shocking reveals was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-lands-fromsoftware-exclusive-the-duskbloods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a>—a new FromSoftware Switch 2 exclusive. In an age where exclusivity is dying and multi-platform releases are common, this feels like a huge win for Nintendo.</p>



<p>One thing you can’t help but feel watching The Duskbloods is that it’s a Bloodborne 2 sequel.</p>

<p><strong>The Duskbloods is not a direct sequel to Bloodborne, and is considered more a spiritual successor to FromSoftware’s 2015 hit.</strong></p>



<p>I watched the Switch 2 Direct live and saw <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Duskbloods</a> reveal trailer. Hand on heart, I was waiting for a “Bloodborne 2” graphic to pop up at the end. The aesthetic, the vibe, and the enemies exude a distinct Bloodborne feel.</p>



<p>But I think it’s pretty clear this is a standalone title—perhaps borrowing from the Bloodborne library. It’s due in <em>2026</em>, so there’s plenty of time to see what other influences FromSoftware has taken from its own IP—although it’s doing new things courtesy of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-will-feature-8-player-pvpve-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8-player PvPvE multiplayer</a>.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if we ever get official new Bloodborne media (a remake or a remaster), but this will do in the meantime.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-bloodborne-getting-a-remake">Is Bloodborne Getting a remake?</h2>



<p><strong>FromSoftware has not indicated they are developing a Bloodborne Remake, nor does it look like we’re getting a remaster or even a basic PC port for extra platforms.</strong></p>



<p>I’d argue Bloodborne is the most influential and most-loved title FromSoft has created outside of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a>. It’s resonated with fans for years, making its continued absence puzzling. Players have begged for a remake for years, or a 60 FPS remaster at the very least.</p>



<p>Worst still, while Sony continues to release its exclusives on PC, Bloodborne still hasn’t received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-boss-does-not-mind-a-bloodborne-pc-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC port</a>. FromSoftware’s president has even brought up the notion of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-bloodborne-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloodborne remake</a>, too. It probably should’ve happened by now, leading us to wonder if it ever will.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you happy to see FromSoftware making a game that looks to be in a similar vein to Bloodborne? Or are you still desperately hoping for a remake or remaster?</p>
