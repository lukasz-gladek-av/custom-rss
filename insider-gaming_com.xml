<p>Marathon developers have confirmed that players will not need a PSN account to play the game on PC and Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-doesn-t-require-psn-on-xbox-and-pc">Marathon Doesn’t Require PSN on Xbox and PC</h2>



<p>With Marathon being a Sony-backed project, many players worried they might need a PSN account to play the game on other platforms. However, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-wont-require-a-playstation-network-account-on-pc-and-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> spotted, Bungie has removed these worries through a message on the game’s official Discord channel. The developers have explicitly stated, “Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox.”</p>



<p>Several of PlayStation’s initial releases on PC came with a PSN account requirement. Many might remember the whole <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/negative-helldivers-2-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review-bombing fiasco with Helldivers 2</a> when it was released on Steam in early 2024. Since then, PlayStation has learned that players on other platforms do not wish to use a PSN account and have made the sign-up optional and also tried to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-will-incentive-users-with-psn-accounts-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incentivise </a>it for their recent releases like The Last of Us 2 Remastered, God of War Ragnarök and more. And now, with the latest confirmation, Marathon can be added to the list of games that don’t require a PSN account.</p>



<p>Marathon has been under wraps since its initial reveal, but players will finally learn more about the game on April 12. Bungie has announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-gameplay-reveal-showcase-announced-for-april-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay reveal showcase</a> for their upcoming PvP extraction shooter. In 2023, Insider Gaming exclusively revealed how <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the loot system</a> works in the game.</p>
