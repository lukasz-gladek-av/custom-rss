<p>Electronic Arts (EA) is trying to ease concerns for employees about what could happen to their games if the planned sale to a group that includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) is finalized. </p>



<p>In a new SEC filing, first spotted by Stephen Totilo of <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, EA has updated its employee FAQ to answer numerous questions surrounding the proposed sale. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">specific section</a> regarding the culture at the company, EA says that its mission and values will <strong>“remain unchanged.”</strong> It adds that the company will <strong>“maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact.”</strong></p>



<p>The section continues, <strong>“We will continue to be guided by our cultural values of creativity, pioneering, passion, determination, learning, and teamwork,”</strong> and that “<strong>The Consortium is supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and our strong culture.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-other-changes-at-ea">What About Other Changes At EA?</h2>



<p>It’s not just control over projects and games that employees have had questions about. With the group that includes the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners taking on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-bioware-producer-suggests-ea-sell-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$20 billion in debt</a> for this deal, some were concerned about future growth and even layoffs.</p>



<p>To both points, EA, as of now, says there shouldn’t be any worry.</p>



<p><strong>“There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction,”</strong> EA says. </p>



<p>Regarding growth, the company says that they will continue to pursue “<strong>organic and inorganic growth opportunities as a private company, even with new debt”</strong> and that there is an expectation to invest in the business in order to <strong>“accelerate innovation.”</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$55 billion deal to sell</a> EA and take it private is expected to close sometime after the start of Q1 fiscal year 2027 (after March 31, 2026).</p>



<p>What do you think will happen when the sale of EA to the group led by the Saudi Arabia PIF is finalized next year?
