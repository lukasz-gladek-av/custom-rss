<p>Path of Exile 2 is backed up by a silly amount of content to explore. It would make sense that PoE 2 can be played across different platforms and give you the option to transfer your progress from platform to platform. It’s never this easy though, so let’s dissect Path of Exile 2’s cross-platform features from possible crossplay to cross-progression.</p>



<p>People assume Path of Exile 2’s similarities to Diablo 4 means it surely has to share the same network features. But life is never that simple, and just because Diablo 4 has crossplay and cross-progression, doesn’t mean Grinding Gear Games’ long-awaited sequel does. It makes me wonder why these functionalities aren’t uniform, but I digress.</p>



<p>Path of Exile has the potential to wow gamers as 2024 draws to a close, and prioritizing cross-platform connectivity would be beneficial.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-path-of-exile-2-crossplay">Is Path of Exile 2 Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tag team turmoil. Credit to Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Path of Exile 2 most definitely has crossplay across all release platforms.</strong></p>



<p>If you have any doubts, let me shut them down by telling you it’s developer Grinding Gear Games who confirmed the wonderful news. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUUXKN7Kh9Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Path of Exile 2 Console Announcement Trailer</a>, appearing in large letters halfway through the trailer, it simply says, “<strong>Cross-play.</strong>” </p>



<p>A one-word answer tells us everything we need to know.</p>



<p>In short, if you’re on PlayStation, you can head into battle with Xbox and PC players, and vice versa. This is possible too as Path of Exile 2 has already assured the community of full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-path-of-exile-2-have-co-op-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer and co-op</a> integration during Early Access—and likely beyond.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-path-of-exile-2-have-cross-progression">Does Path of Exile 2 have cross-progression?</h2>



<p>We’re two for two as <strong>Path of Exile has also cross-progression</strong>—a detail once again confirmed by the game’s creator.</p>



<p>Tick all the boxes, give us your best grin, and choose your favorite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-classes-are-available-in-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2 class</a> with the knowledge your saved data is transferable between platforms. The console trailer also flashes up “Cross-progression” a few seconds after the crossplay confirmation, ensuring flexibility for all. </p>



<p>So, if you’re enjoying the free-to-play adventure game on PS5, and want to continue your adventure on PC, cross-platform cross-progression allows this seamlessly. You save your data on one format, turn it off, load up PoE 2 on another piece of hardware, and you pick up where you left off.</p>



<hr>



<p>Let us know if you intend to take full advantage of these handy qualities. Also, boost your PoE 2 knowledge by knowing the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-path-of-exile-2-pc-system-requirements-minimum-recommended-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC requirements</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to play Early Access</a>.</p>

<p>The year isn’t over yet and there are plenty of great games still set to be released before it ends. In this article, we’re bringing you the 10 most promising games of December 2024. The last month of the year can hold some good surprises and, so you don’t have to pick through them one by one, I’ve put them all in this list.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-most-promising-games-of-december-2024">10 Most Promising Games Of December 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-infinity-nikki-december-5">Infinity Nikki – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PS5, PC, Android, iOS</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Infinity Nikki - Gameplay Overview Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zP7dLsL1b6M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Developed by Infold Games, Infinity Nikki is an open-world game that follows a gacha structure similar to Genshin Impact.</p>



<p>One of the game’s main differentiators is its dress mechanic, which profoundly alters the gameplay. Some dresses allow Nikki to float, others reduce her size, others allow her to slide and so on.</p>



<p>Unlike games such as Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves, Infinity Nikki focuses on platforming and relaxing activities such as fishing, looking after animals and collecting insects.</p>



<h3 id="h-ufl-december-5">UFL – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PS5, Xbox Series</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="UFL™ Insider #7" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4YFxD21q2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Popularly referred to as the “Fifa Killer”, UFL is a free soccer game that was conceived with a difficult mission: to stand up to EA Sports FC and eFootball.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s not easy being the “new kid on the block” in a genre dominated by two forces. Despite the obstacles, the team is motivated to make the game succeed, attracting the attention and investment of personalities such as CR7.</p>



<h3 id="h-fantasian-neo-dimension-december-5">Fantasian Neo Dimension – December 5</h3>



<p><em>PC, PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension is a JRPG led by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu, two names that practically solidified the genre around the world.</p>



<p>For those who don’t know, Hironobu Sakaguchi is considered the father of the Final Fantasy franchise. In the story, we follow the protagonist Leo on an inter-dimensional adventure to save the Earth from Mechteria, a mechanical infection that steals the emotions and lives of humans.</p>



<h3 id="h-delta-force-december-5">Delta Force – December 5</h3>

</p></figure>



<p>On December 5, Delta Force will receive what the studio considers to be a global open beta for everyone. However, as progress will be maintained, we can consider this to be a PC release.</p>

</ul>



<p>The console versions will arrive in early 2025. The game is being very well received by the community, featuring both PvE modes, such as the campaign that reimagines the same Black Hawk Down campaign from 2003, and PvP modes such as Havoc Warfare, where 32-player matches take place.</p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-rivals-december-6">Marvel Rivals – December 6</h3>



<p><em>PC, PS5, Xbox Series</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Developed by Digital Mind Games, The Spirit of the Samurai is a 2D action game made in stop motion. Yes, you didn’t get it wrong.</p>



<p>The artistic style chosen by the studio gives the game a great air of originality. The story follows Takeshi, a samurai who must stop an Oni who commands an army of the undead.</p>



<p>The game is heavily inspired by Japanese folklore, featuring a rich lore of the country’s mythology. In addition to Takeshi, at certain points you control Kodama, a brave spirit and Chisai, a warrior cat.</p>
