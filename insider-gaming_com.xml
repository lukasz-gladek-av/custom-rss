<p>The League of Legends 2025 World Championship is upon us, with the Swiss Stage having kicked off on October 15. This stellar tournament will take players from Chengdu to Shanghai to Beijing, representing the most powerful, popular, and valuable esports event in the business.</p>



<p>This guide breaks down everything you need to know about LoL Worlds 2025, whether you’re a casual viewer or a diehard League of Legends enthusiast. It’s a $5 million tournament that features the talents of the most prolific esports pro players in the world, so you <strong>won’t want to miss a second.</strong></p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-lol-worlds-2025-schedule">LoL Worlds 2025 Schedule</h2>



<p>This year’s League of Legends World Championship tournament is broken down across four stages:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Play-In Stage: </strong>October 14</li>



<li><strong>Swiss Stage</strong>: October 15–25</li>



<li><strong>Knockout Stage</strong>: October 28–November 2</li>



<li><strong>Grand Final</strong>: November 9</li>
</ul>



<p>The tournament’s Grand Final will take place in the Dong’an Lake Sports Park Multifunctional Gymnasium (that’s one heck of a name) in Chengdu, China. It’s one of the biggest venues for an esports tournament to occupy, featuring a whopping 18,000-seat capacity.</p>



<h2 id="h-teams-playing-at-lol-worlds-2025">Teams Playing at LoL Worlds 2025</h2>



<p>There are 17 teams competing at the League of Legends World Championship in 2025. The first team to be eliminated on October 14 was Invictus Gaming, whittling the teams in the Swiss Stage down to 16.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of teams competing at the League of Legends World Championship in 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gen.G</li>



<li>Hanwha Life</li>



<li>KT Rolster</li>



<li>Bilibili Gaming</li>



<li>Anyone’s Legend</li>



<li>Top Esports</li>



<li>FlyQuest</li>



<li>Keyd Stars</li>



<li>100 Thieves</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>KOI</li>



<li>Fnatic</li>



<li>CTBC Flying Oyster</li>



<li>Secret Whales</li>



<li>PSG Talon</li>



<li>T1</li>



<li>Invictus Gaming (<strong>eliminated</strong>)</li>
</ul>







<p>Everyone comes into the League of Legends World Championship with keen eyes on T1 Gaming, the defending champions and the home of Faker, arguably the GOAT of the esports world. Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-2024-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Faker made history</a> while flying his traditional T1 banner, and the team has every opportunity to win <strong>yet another </strong>LoL Worlds this time around.</p>



<p>Behind T1 sits Gen.G, the top seed coming out of Korea and heading into LoL Worlds after a <strong>dominant </strong>run through the summer and regional qualifiers. Faker’s nemesis in Chovy is ready to bring it all to the table in China.</p>



<p>For the European League of Legends fans, the pick remains G2 Esports, Europe’s best hope for a League of Legends World Championship trophy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Some Pokémon fans have been hit with disappointment ahead of the long-awaited launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, after their Pokémon Center pre-orders were cancelled.</p>



<p>The title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launching October 16</a> on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles, features the return to Kalos’ Lumiose City and makes a big change to battle mechanics with a move to real-time combat.</p>



<p>Two days before the big release, however, some fans who pre-ordered through the Pokémon Center have seen their pre-orders cancelled, with the majority reporting that they have received no reason.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Bad news. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>An initial post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendsZA/comments/1o6icr4/pokemon_center_preorder_was_just_canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> stated two pre-orders from the Pokémon Center were cancelled without reasoning, even showing the plushie they had been granted as a pre-order bonus.</p>



<p>Many more users then commented that they had seen their pre-orders cancelled, with some reportedly being told the site was unable to reauthorize a payment method, despite a charge having been taken, and others stating they had been informed the product had been oversold.</p>



<p>Adding to the confusion, some of the tracking for the cancelled Pokémon Legends: Z-A pre-orders is said to be showing a status of received, which indicates the pre-order is still in the system.</p>



<p>At this stage, it appears the issues are only with Pokémon Center pre-orders for the game, and the specific reason for the cancellations is unknown. However, with the game due to launch in just a matter of hours, it serves as a major disappointment for those who were hoping to jump in immediately.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Pokémon for comment and we will update this article accordingly if we receive a response.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Glitches Have Players Flying Around The Map]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-glitches-exploits-ea-working-overtime/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-glitches-have-players-flying-around-the-map.1325020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has been in the open for almost a week, and it has been met with a solid response from players worldwide, except for the lacklustre campaign offering. The multiplayer platform is enjoyable, stable, and receiving constant tweaks by the Electronic Arts studios that fed energy into the creation of the first-person shooter.</p>



<p>In recent days, it has seemed as though the studios under the EA banner are working overtime to keep up with the number of movement exploits and glitches that are being uncovered by players, promising to patch them out as they crop up.</p>



<h2 id="h-hammers-ladders-and-drones">Hammers, Ladders, and Drones</h2>



<p>In the last few days, various clips have surfaced on social media of Battlefield 6 glitches that are being manipulated to give players an edge in-game.</p>



<p>One of the easiest to replicate is the ‘ladder glitch’ that allows players to launch themselves off ladders if they’re positioned and approached <strong>in a certain way</strong>. The resulting glitch catapults players at high speeds far across the map, which means users can gain access to an objective behind enemy lines in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>This is actively being addressed by DICE, but as far as we know, a patch hasn’t been released to address the glitch:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another entertaining bug that’s giving players a serious advantage is the ‘hammer and drone’ glitch. In clips on social media, we’ve seen players stand on their teammate’s drone and repeatedly slam it with a sledgehammer melee weapon. Each hit propels the drone higher and higher, pushing towards the skybox ad infinitum.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hammer + Drone = INSANE SNIPES 🤣 #battlefield6" width="422" height="750" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NuFEl31l8Yw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Once at the highest point, players can simply whip out their weapons and start firing shots across the map, confusing everyone trying to spot where the incoming fire is originating from.</p>



<p>Again, this is being addressed by Electronic Arts’ association of studios.</p>



<p>Have you noticed any hilarious glitches in Battlefield 6 that are giving you an advantage? Let me know about them on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
