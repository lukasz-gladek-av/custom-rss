            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-1-ante-1-hand-each-round-mean-in-balatro-hieroglyph-voucher-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’ve come across the Hieroglyph Voucher in Balatro and are unsure what it does, you’re in the right place. It stumped me, and my heart sank when I realized the full extent of what it did. Let’s avoid the same mistake happening to you.</p>



<p>Early games of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-has-announced-its-sold-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro</a> are understandably a lot to take in. Jokers, Card Enhancements, Planets, Spectral modifiers, etc. But Balatro’s Hieroglyph Shop Voucher is a perfect example of how a simple misunderstanding can bring a run crumbling down. I took this the first time it appeared, having a vague idea of what it would do, and it didn’t help.</p>



<p>With greater understanding, I now know Hieroglyph’s full value and worth. Let me pass this knowledge on.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-hieroglyph-voucher-do-in-balatro">What Does Hieroglyph Voucher Do In Balatro?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>For those daring enough. Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Buying the Hieroglyph Voucher reduces your Ante by one, but you have one fewer Hand for every subsequent Blind you come up against from this point on.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-1-ante-explained">-1 Ante Explained</h3>



<p>When you start a game of <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Balatro</a>, you are immediately on <strong>Ante One of eight</strong>. If you beat the Boss Blind—after the Small and Big Blind—you progress to <strong>Ante Two</strong>, and so on.</p>



<p>Let’s say you’ve beaten the Small Blind on <strong>Ante Four</strong>. You go to the Shop and purchase Hieroglyph, and your Ante counter now changes to <strong>Ante Three.</strong> You have gone back a whole Ante!</p>



<h3 id="h-1-hand-explained">-1 Hand Explained</h3>



<p><strong>The default Hands you start with is usually four</strong>. Different Decks can change this, but by and large, you’re going to start with four. A Hand is the <strong>amount of times you’re allowed to submit cards in exchange for a score</strong>.</p>



<p>So, if you buy Hieroglyph and have four Hands available, <strong>this tally goes down to three</strong>. You now only have three chances to score points for any Blind you come up against.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-use-1-ante-1-hand-hieroglyph-voucher-in-balatro">Should You Use -1 Ante -1 Hand Hieroglyph Voucher in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>Hieroglyph should only be procured if you have an extremely effective strategy and you’re obliterating every Blind with a single hand.</strong></p>



<p>The Voucher is designed so that if your setup is OP, <strong>you get another Ante to make it even stronger</strong>. If you’re already destroying Blinds in one or two goes, losing a Hand won’t affect you. </p>



<p>You can also try Hieroglpyh if you’re<strong> struggling and desperately need something to turn your run around</strong>. This is very risky, and losing a Hand could sign your death sentence. The <strong>Paint Brush</strong> (+1&nbsp;Hand Size) and <strong>Palette </strong>(+1&nbsp;Hand Size again) Shop Vouchers are incredible additions to your arsenal if you can get them.</p>



<p>They negate the consequence of losing a Hand and can give you a clean reset. I pick and choose my Hieroglyph usage—mainly for those OP runs—but it’s a great tool to be more powerful and <strong>take your run into Endless Mode</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<p>How often do you take Hieroglyph in Balatro? Are there any other scenarios you’d suggest buying the Voucher I haven’t already outlined?</p>

<p>The Supermaster V ranked bug is a literal marvel in Marvel Rivals. You’d think it has positive connotations and signifies progress in Rivals, but it’s a strange occurrence with drastic outcomes for ranked matches. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals ranked mode is where the elite go to fight. It’s where the dedicated want to prove themselves and ascend to higher levels of greatness, before eventually applying to join the Avengers. With Shroud looking at starting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-marvel-rivals-esports-organisation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivals Esports organization</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s director already discussing Esports plans</a>, ranked is the first step on the road to major competitive play. </p>



<p>However, Marvel Rivals ranked play is being impacted by a Supermaster V bug. Let’s take a look at everything we know about it and what it does.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-causes-supermaster-v-bug-in-marvel-rivals">What Causes Supermaster V Bug in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Has this happened to you? Credit to X user and streamer @whyAndr3w</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Supermaster V is a post-game bug happening <strong>when a ranked match is considered invalid—due to insufficient players, AFK action, or forfeiting.</strong></strong></p>



<p>These issues can be attributed to connection issues, users being idle, or rage-quitting. In short, if your ranked match goes off without a hitch, it’s sure to be a valid encounter where everything is presented and shown as normal. If any of the above happens, Supermaster V may land to spoil your day.</p>



<p>It only appears at the end of a Marvel Rivals ranked match, and I can confirm it’s not one of the official tiers in the Rivals ranked system.</p>



<p>NetEase has yet to formally address the Supermaster V error. We’re trying to piece together what we can from various players’ experiences. You can see X user <a href="https://x.com/whyAndr3w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@whyAndr3w</a>‘s game above where they encountered the bug and <a href="https://x.com/whyAndr3w/status/1878800368580391230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted about it</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-supermaster-v-bug-change-your-online-rank-in-marvel-rivals">Does Supermaster V Bug Change Your Online Rank in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p><strong>Your online rank being affected by Supermaster V is inconclusive, but based on what we’ve seen, it doesn’t appear you are penalized too heavily if it happens.</strong></p>



<p>Anyone in an invalid lobby who is hit by the Supermaster V bug is susceptible to an <strong>AFK ban</strong>. It’s not confirmed to be a guarantee, but I’ve seen several examples of players complaining about this.</p>



<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2767030/discussions/0/578249962076305125/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam user EXtremist said</a>, “The game shows me a Supermaster [V] message, after winning, and then I get a <strong>15-minute penalty for being disconnected</strong>, which never happened. This is [the] 3rd time.” Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2767030/discussions/0/591758265559292113/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam player shared their story</a>, “I was in a ranked game and everyone had poor connection midway through. I hit 1000 ping at one point, [and] at the end I got the ranked progress, it says 20/30, and the rank was Supermaster V.”</p>



<p>Not every case seems to be the same though. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hnqkmi/saying_my_rank_is_supermaster_v_after_competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JDlyndon on the Marvel Rivals subreddit</a> shared a picture of the Supermaster V screen. They said they “Played and won a game of competitive and instead of getting a normal ranked points gain screen I got this.” They add “<strong>There was no AFK in the match” and it went down like a normal ranked match</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, the findings aren’t absolute right now. Keep checking back as we find out the latest on Supermaster V, and if NetEase comments.</p>



<hr>



<p>Have you had Supermaster V happen to you after playing a Marvel Rivals ranked match? Did you get an AFK ban? Have you lost any ranking points as a result?</p>
