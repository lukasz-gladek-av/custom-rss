<p>Apex Legends is still rolling out new Seasonal content, with Season 28 celebrating the game’s seventh anniversary. It’s launching on February 10, 2026, and it marks a serious shift in the game’s meta.</p>



<p>Major Legend updates, new destructible environments, and huge changes to Ranked are just the tip of the iceberg for the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-ending-support-for-nintendo-switch-1-in-august/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-ending-support-for-nintendo-switch-1-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a> Season. It’s building up to be a game-changing update for the battle royale, and the Early Patch Notes have all the details.</p>

<p><strong>Plenty of changes are coming to Apex Legends in Season 28, but the headlines are bound to follow the new Hardlight Mesh, as well as Fuze’s reworks.</strong></p>



<p>Hardlight Mesh is a new, destructible window that will be present across existing structures. It provides renewed cover, but it can be destroyed, taking increased damage from certain weapon classes and weapon abilities. Controller class Legends can even rebuild them, adding another tactical layer to navigating the shrinking zone.</p>



<p>Fuze is the legend that takes center stage in Breach, as he’s seen a complete rework to his kit. However, Bloodhound and Catalyst have also seen some buffs, with further details coming on February 6. </p>



<p>For Ranked players out there, you’ll be glad to hear that the Dropship is returning. Respawn wanted to bring the mode into closer parity with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/algs-year-6-roadmap-revealed-by-electronic-arts/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/algs-year-6-roadmap-revealed-by-electronic-arts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ALGS</a>, but after some experimentation in prior Seasons, felt it was best to bring it back. </p>



<p>Additionally, Bot Royale lobbies are being reworked, some new advanced audio options are becoming available, and Apex will celebrate its seven-year anniversary with a free anniversary rewards track. </p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Cyberpunk 2’s creative director has revealed why he feels the first-person perspective works well with 2077’s story, genre, and world. </p>



<p>The sequel to Cyberpunk 2077 is going to take a long time to release, considering the studio’s next mainline title, The Witcher 4, is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not going to release in 2026</a>. What we do know is that the game is in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-has-entered-pre-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">production</a>, but the release is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequels-release-is-at-least-four-to-five-years-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least four to five</a>” years away. As we wait for the next game, check out why the dev didn’t include third-person in the original game.</p>







<h2 id="h-third-person-is-better-for-games-like-god-of-war-the-witcher-and-more-first-person-is-better-suited-to-cyberpunk-2077">Third Person is Better for Games Like God of War, The Witcher, and More; First Person is Better Suited to Cyberpunk 2077</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/cyberpunk/cyberpunk-2-lead-says-first-person-pov-was-better-for-cyberpunk-2077-as-third-person-is-for-more-defined-characters-like-the-witcher-3s-geralt-and-god-of-wars-kratos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, through a recent thread on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mdsstho36c22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, Igor Sarzynski, the creative director of Cyberpunk 2077, explains why the first-person perspective was the right choice for the game. He highlights that the first-person view “works well” for the story, genre, and world from a narrative design standpoint. In this perspective, the player embodies a character who is trapped in a deteriorating body, with the only way to escape being through “technological consciousness processing.”</p>



<p>On top of that, the player has to interact with a digital ghost in their head, which only they can see and exists only in their subjective perception. Sarzynski adds that he feels the third-person perspective is better for games with more defined characters like Geralt, Kratos, Ellie, and more, where players are playing and replaying someone else’s story.  </p>



<p>Sarzynski also confirms that this conversation is not indicative of anything in Cyberpunk 2, and only about the specific narrative setup in 2077. He also poked fun at the community, stating, the Cyberpunk sequel “might be a Play-Doh stop-motion RTS for all we know.”</p>







<p>In other news, the original creator of the Cyberpunk universe has stated that the sequel will feature another city that feels like ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-city-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Gone Wrong</a>’. Additionally, the original game’s writer has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-writer-confirms-long-held-fan-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed a long-held fan theory</a>.
