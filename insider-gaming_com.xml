<p>Grinding Gear Games pulled back the curtain on what’s coming next for Path of Exile 2 in update 0.4.0, and it’s one of the game’s largest updates yet. Also known as Last of the Druids, update 0.4.0 releases on December 12 and introduces the long-awaited Druid class, complete with three shapeshift forms, alongside an entirely new league, major crafting systems, performance upgrades, and sweeping balance changes across the board.</p>



<p>The reveal opened with Game Director Jonathan Rogers introducing The Druid, a hybrid Strength/Intelligence class the team says has been “one of the hardest classes for us to design.” The class blends traditional spellcasting with fluid shapeshifting between Bear, Wolf, and Wyvern forms, each built around completely different playstyles. Rogers emphasized that form-swapping is designed to be “seamless and immediate,” letting players weave in and out of forms mid-combat without friction.</p>







<p>Each form offers its own mechanics: Bear specializes in heavy, rage-powered melee; Wolf leans on mobility and cold damage to build a pack of summoned companions; and Wyvern unleashes long-range elemental breath attacks while consuming corpses to gain power charges. Human-form spells like Volcano, Entangling Vines, and Thunderstorm stack on top of that, creating setups that fuel form-based combos. The class also introduces a new weapon type—Animal Talismans—which determine which form is active and provide the form’s basic attack.</p>



<p>The Druid is also launching with two ascendancy classes: the Shaman, which channels rage into spell damage and enhances elemental chaos around the player, and the Oracle, which uses Foresight to predict incoming skill opportunities and unlocks more than 130 additional passives through alternate-timeline “future selves.”</p>



<p>A third Druid ascendancy will come later, but for now, players can look forward to several new support gems, over 20 Druid skills, and a standout unique item called Fury of the King, which transforms Bear form into a fire demon using the Molten Crash slam.</p>

<h2 id="h-introducing-the-fate-of-the-vaal-league"><strong>Introducing the Fate of the Vaal League</strong></h2>



<p>Alongside the Druid comes Path of Exile 2’s newest league, Fate of the Vaal, which dives deep into the lore surrounding Atziri and the ancient Vaal civilization. Game Director Mark Roberts walked through the new league structure, which revolves around uncovering arcane Vaal remnants across Wraeclast. Fully activating them opens a portal into a lost underground temple once belonging to Atziri herself.</p>



<p>The twist is that players essentially build the dungeon themselves. Every run offers six rooms that can be placed to shape the temple layout, link pathways, and position reward rooms. Room interactions matter as much as placement—Garrisons strengthen next to a Commander, Golemworks can power a Smithy, and generators can energize the entire system. Once a layout is set, players enter the temple, clear each room, and begin preparing for the next rebuild.</p>

<p>Things escalate when the player gains access to a prototype time-portal device. Roberts explains that it takes players back to “right before Atziri triggered the cataclysm,” unlocking an entire suite of past-only rooms with some of the update’s most powerful crafting opportunities. These include multi-stage corruption chambers, new Soul Cores, and the league’s wildest mechanic: limb replacement at the hands of a Vaal Flesh Surgeon, complete with random upgrades that disappear when the player dies.</p>



<p>Defeating the league’s Architect boss unlocks special reward rooms and a path to finally confront the Queen of the Vaal in a reimagined boss fight during her moment of transformation. One of the highlight drops is <strong>Atziri’s Rule</strong>, a staff that increases levels of all corrupted gems and causes projectiles to split into novas when fired at spawning mirrors around the arena.</p>







<h2 id="h-rise-of-the-abyssal-becomes-core-in-path-of-exile-2"><strong>Rise of the Abyssal Becomes Core In Path of Exile 2</strong></h2>



<p>Rise of the Abyssal is officially moving into the core endgame, though players won’t see Abysses in every area. Instead, a new Abyss Tablet allows players to force Abysses into maps and craft Abyss-specific modifiers. Grinding Gear has also built a full Atlas tree around the mechanic, letting players specialize in bosses, factions, or internal league interactions.</p>



<p>At the same time, GGG is addressing one of the biggest complaints about the endgame: monster density. Instead of scaling monster counts up by Tier 15, the team is now keeping density consistent and scaling rewards instead. According to the reveal, monsters will “drop 40% more items, grant 40% more experience, and have 40% more life” as tiers rise—without ballooning horde sizes.</p>



<p>The team is also toning down delirium fog visuals, removing Instilling from waystones, and shifting similar power to Tablets, which last ten maps and reduce micromanagement.</p>

<h2 id="h-performance-upgrades-and-huge-balance-pass"><strong>Performance Upgrades and Huge Balance Pass</strong></h2>



<p>Performance is another focus in Path of Exile 2’s update 0.4.0, with Rogers noting players “should see frame rates at least 25% higher” thanks to significant CPU-side optimizations. This includes better multithreading and fewer frame spikes, particularly on consoles.</p>



<p>The update also includes broad balance adjustments:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>11 new Unique items</strong></li>



<li><strong>21 rebalanced Lineage Supports + 9 new ones</strong></li>



<li><strong>Major ascendancy updates across nearly all classes</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rebalancing of 90 active skills</strong></li>



<li><strong>Over 250 new passive skills added</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Roberts confirmed that additional endgame content originally planned for 0.4.0 has been pushed to 0.5.0, but emphasized that a “significant overhaul to the atlas passive tree” and new pinnacle bosses are already in development.</p>
