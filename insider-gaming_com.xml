<p>Marvel Rivals Season 6 is here, and based on the Roadmap released by NetEase, it’s going to be a content-heavy season.</p>



<p>Of course, nobody needs a roadmap to know that the Merc with a Mouth is the latest hero to join the ever-growing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-cosmic-invasion-characters-how-to-unlock-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel</a> Rivals roster. Deadpool will arrive with the launch of Season 6, but there’s much more to come than just a new character.</p>







<p>Check out the Marvel Rivals Season 6 Roadmap below, which details all of the upcoming content and when you can expect it to release. </p>

<p><strong>NetEase has revealed the Season 6 Roadmap for Marvel Rivals, which features a myriad of content, from new maps and heroes to skins and events.</strong> </p>



<p>Here’s the complete roadmap for Season 6:</p>



<h3 id="h-january-16-season-6-release">January 16—Season 6 Release </h3>

<p><strong>Not too much is known about what you can expect from Marvel Rivals Season 6.5, but one thing is clear: Elsa Bloodstone is on the way. </strong></p>



<p>NetEase has confirmed that Elsa Bloodstone will be the next playable hero in Marvel Rivals. She’ll be joining the roster on February 13, when Season 6.5 kicks into gear.</p>







<p>If you’re not familiar with who Else Bloodstone is, then don’t worry. She’s a relatively new figure in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-blade-dev-is-super-proud-of-special-game-its-creating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel universe</a>, as she first appeared in Bloodstone #1 in 2001. Elsa is a British monster hunter who gains her powers from her father’s magical bloodstone choker. </p>



<p>As things stand, it’s unknown what her role will be in Marvel Rivals, but judging by her gun and sword combo, the odds are she will most likely arrive as a Duelist. Considering she hunts monsters for a living, she should have no trouble going toe-to-toe against the rest of the heroes.</p>

<p>007 First Light devs have now released an updated set of PC System requirements after the community pointed out several errors. </p>



<p>IO Interactive’s next big title, 007 First Light, is all set to release on May 27, 2026, across all major platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC. The title was initially set to release in March, but it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-delay-may-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed late last year</a>, providing the devs enough time to refine and polish the build. Check out the PC System requirements for 007 First Light below to see if your PC is capable of running the title. </p>







<h2 id="h-updated-007-first-light-pc-system-requirements">Updated 007 First Light PC System Requirements </h2>



<p>In a new post on <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2011735420631982151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the developers of 007 First Light have admitted there were a few “inconsistencies” in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously released</a> PC system requirements. The recommended RAM has been reduced to 16GB from 32GB, and the error in the minimum CPU line, which previously stated “Intel Core i5 9500K” (K being the issue), has been updated as well. The VRAM has also been reduced for both sets of requirements. Additional performance targets for the title will be shared closer to launch. Check out the updated set of PC system requirements for 007 First Light below: </p>



<h3 id="h-minimum">Minimum: </h3>



<ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new rumor has emerged online suggesting that Fortnite may be collaborating with Minecraft.</p>



<p>Fortnite is a major player in the realm of collaborations within the gaming industry, partnering not only with various media franchises but also with different games. In the past, we have seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-rare-fortnite-skins-that-need-to-return-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters from iconic games</a> such as God of War, Halo, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and more appear in Fortnite. Now, it appears the devs may be collaborating with one of the largest games of all time, Minecraft.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-minecraft-seemingly-in-early-development">Fortnite x Minecraft Seemingly in Early Development </h2>



<p>The information about Fortnite’s Minecraft being in early development comes from <a href="https://x.com/AdiraFNInfo/status/2011541834959671372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> user (formerly Twitter) AdiraFNInfo, which was reposted by reliable Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/2011542845010952494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>. However, HYPEX’s post has the word ‘rumored’ in it, which means that they haven’t been able to confirm whether this is indeed true. At the same time, if this is true, it could go down in the books as one of the biggest Fortnite collaborations of all time. </p>



<p>Fortnite has definitely levelled up their collaborations game over time, from just introducing skins, to introducing mythics and special abilities, and now designing their Island inspired by the collab. If Minecraft gets a similar treatment, we might see the Island adopt Minecraft’s unique art style. We could also see skins like Steve and other items make it into the game. However, this is just speculation, and readers should take this information with a massive grain of salt. </p>







<p>In other news, another claim states that Fortnite could be collaborating with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-office-x-fortnite-collaboration-could-be-coming-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a>. Additionally, here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch notes</a> for the January 9 39.20 update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re in the mood for some ’80s and ’90s nostalgia, grab some Dunkaroos and get ready to be transported back to the world of Disney Afternoon cartoons on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>



<p>Back in 2017, Capcom released the Disney Afternoon Collection. Originally developed by Digital Eclipse, the game featured six classic NES games based on Disney cartoons from the 1980s and 1990s. The six included games were: Darkwing Duck, TaleSpin, two Chip’n Dale Rescue Rangers games, and two DuckTales games. Now, nine years after its original release, the game could finally come to the Nintendo Switch</p>







<h2 id="h-a-new-esrb-rating-has-surfaced">A New ESRB Rating Has Surfaced</h2>



<p>Atari, which now owns Digital Eclipse, has an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41099/the-disney-afternoon-collection/">ESRB rating</a> for the collection of games specifically on the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2. It’s not shocking that any Disney game would receive an E for Everyone rating, but fans can read the full rating description below:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Disney Afternoon Collection is rated E for Everyone by the ESRB with Mild Fantasy Violence and Use of Tobacco. This is a collection of action platformer games from classic Disney franchises. Several games depict instances of mild, fantastical violence: players stunning enemies; characters shooting enemies; players throwing objects (e.g., boxes, rocks) at enemies; a plane shooting down enemy planes. Some games contain larger bosses and boss rush modes. One boss is depicted holding a cigar.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>There is no proposed Switch release date for the NES game collection at this time. However, it is available on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as PC, for anyone looking to scratch that nostalgic itch right now.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to follow the story and report any updates.</p>
