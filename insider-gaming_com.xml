<p>The esports industry continues to expand at an alarming pace, getting bigger each year with more games being added to the competitive collection. For a game to be considered ‘an esports game’, it simply needs to foster a competitive multiplayer environment – which means <strong>many </strong>games fit the bill.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’re looking at every esports game coming out in 2025. Which are you most excited about?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-esports-games-coming-out-in-2025">All Esports Games Coming Out in 2025</h2>



<p>This list represents every esports game either confirmed to be or <strong>expected </strong>to be launching in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-deadlock">Deadlock</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Valve’s Deadlock is one of the most anticipated esports games out there. It was kept on the DL by Valve for the longest time until it could be contained no more. In 2024, it stormed the charts on Steam, presenting users with a fresh and exciting hero shooter environment that’ll be set to rival Overwatch and Marvel Rivals if it’s one of the esports games coming out in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Gears of War once fostered a solid esports ecosystem, but times changed. There are high expectations that E-Day, an all-new adventure set in the Gears of War universe and a prequel of sorts, will bring back Gears esports once and for all. We don’t know what that’ll look like, but it’ll be good to see if it has a competitive environment if it’s released in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fortnite-ballistic">Fortnite: Ballistic</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fortnite Ballistic is a first-person competitive shooter built in the heart of the Fortnite platform. It’s everything you know and love from Fortnite intertwined with traditional multiplayer elements from the likes of Counter-Strike and VALORANT. It’s everything you’d expect from an esports game, and it’s expected to release in full, graduating from early access, later in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fragpunk">FragPunk</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>FragPunk is a brand-new IP from Bad Guitar Studio. It’s a gaudy, colourful five-vs-five hero-based FPS with plenty to offer, and it has impressed users in beta testing. It’s set to be released on March 6, 2025, making it one of the first new esport games releasing in 2025. It has a unique ‘powerup card’ mechanic that keeps gameplay as fresh as possible, which is well-needed in today’s world.</p>



<h3 id="h-virtua-fighter-6">Virtua Fighter 6</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>At The Game Awards 2024, Sega unveiled ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’, which many have dubbed Virtua Fighter 6. It’s the first new game in the series in almost twenty years, and it’ll be a nice addition to the stacked FGC roster. It <strong>could </strong>launch in 2025, but it’s not at all guaranteed. Instead, keep an eye open for Virtua Fighter 5 REVO, a remaster of sorts of the last game, released in 2006.</p>



<h3 id="h-splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Splitgate 2 is expected to be one of the fastest-paced shooters on the market when it drops in 2025. It’s a high-octane, energetic shooter that uses portals to empower players to traverse the map in genius ways, but under the hood, it’s a typical multiplayer title with oodles of esports potential. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/will-there-be-fallout-season-2-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fallout’s first season was released on Prime Video in April 2024 to an overwhelmingly positive reception. It single-handedly brought about a resurgence of the post-apocalyptic franchise, bringing millions of players into the series and flying high on the charts for weeks. It went on to win a slew of awards, but just as soon as it arrived, fans were hungry for a second season.</p>



<p>Will there be a season 2 of Fallout, and when will it be released? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fallout-season-two-release-date">Fallout Season Two Release Date</h2>



<p>Shortly after the first season’s debut, it was announced that Fallout season two was greenlit. That means that it’s almost guaranteed to arrive, and not long after that announcement, the cast and crew started teasing that the second season was in production.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to today, and Fallout season two is well and truly being pieced together. The most recent leaks have revealed some set pieces being stood up to reflect locations in Fallout: New Vegas, a setting teased at the end of the first season.</p>



<p>There isn’t an official release date for Fallout season two yet, but we know it’s ahead of schedule. Fans are expecting it to return in October 2025 – or October 2026 if things are substantially delayed for some reason. This is because October is an important month in the Fallout universe and it makes sense that Bethesda and Amazon would pay tribute and show some fan service.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-will-fallout-season-two-be-about">What Will Fallout Season Two Be About?</h2>



<p>Warning – spoilers ahead.</p>



<p>At the end of the first season of Fallout, our trio of hero characters were all alive and well, with their paths into the second season of the show being mapped out ahead of them.</p>



<p>Lucy (Ella Purnell) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) are sticking together going into the second season, but Maximus (Aaron Moten) has returned to the Brotherhood of Steel after being crowned a victor. It’s believed by the Brotherhood that he killed Lee Moldaver, one of the show’s antagonists. That’s not true, but the belief will work wonders for Maximus.</p>



<p>We also saw Lucy’s father, Hank MacLean (Kyle MacLachlan), jet off in a suit of power armour to New Vegas after being revealed as the ‘big baddie’ of the Fallout TV universe.</p>



<p>There are several smaller storylines yet to be wrapped up or explored, such as the goings-on inside Vault 31, 32, and 33, and the activities of some of the more well-known factions across the Fallout world. We may also have look-back episodes that offer more insights into the early lore of the games, much like we had in the first season.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Escape from Tarkov Down? | Tarkov Server Status Guide]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-tarkov-down-tarkov-server-status/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-escape-from-tarkov-down-tarkov-server-status-guide.1074222/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-tarkov-down-tarkov-server-status/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Escape from Tarkov is the most popular extraction shooter in the world, pitting players against each other and a slew of AI-based enemies across a series of maps under gruelling conditions. It has been on the market for almost a decade, but that doesn’t mean it’s not susceptible to a few glitches here and there – including network stability issues.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’re answering one key question: ‘Is Escape from Tarkov down?’ Use this guide to find out about the Tarkov server status and whether Tarkov is offline right now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-tarkov-down-answered">Is Tarkov Down? Answered</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is almost always online only, which means if the Tarkov servers are down, you’ll be presented with error messages and the inability to load into a game. It can be pretty irritating, as Escape from Tarkov is a game that requires time, effort, and dedication – none of which can be applied if the Tarkov server status is in the red.</p>



<p>That said, this guide will help you figure out the answer to your question: ‘Are Tarkov servers down?’</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-check-tarkov-servers-status">How to Check Tarkov Servers Status</h3>



<p>The best way to find out about the state of Tarkov’s server status is to use the official status page, <a href="https://status.escapefromtarkov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">which can be found here</a>.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can follow Battlestate Games on Twitter (X) using one of the following profiles for all the latest updates:</p>



<ul>

<li><a href="https://x.com/bstategames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlestate Games</a></li>
</ul>



<p>There are also third-party tools that you can use to check on Tarkov’s servers:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://tarkovserverstatus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tarkov Server Status</a></li>



<li><a href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/escape-from-tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Down Detector</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re stuck with Tarkov matching forever, don’t fret – just use one of these resources to see what’s up with the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-tarkov-servers-offline-now">Are Tarkov Servers Offline Now?</h2>



<p>I’ll keep this article updated as much as possible to help you out – I’m also a keen Escape from Tarkov player, so I’ll be tuned in to the latest disruptions as much as you will.</p>



<p><strong>From January 4 to January 5, Escape from Tarkov experienced server issues that took the game offline for players worldwide. The issue prevented players from loading into raids either as a PMC or a Scav, but Escape from Tarkov Arena remained unimpacted.</strong></p>



<p>That’s the latest – be sure to bookmark this page to check back when you need it, and stay in touch on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> for more coverage.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[6 Fun Remakes We’d Love to See in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fun-remakes-wed-love-to-see/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/6-fun-remakes-we%E2%80%99d-love-to-see-in-2025.1073976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fun-remakes-wed-love-to-see/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Remake and remaster culture continue to thrive. Countless other retro relics desperately need to be dug up and restored for a new generation, but our handpicked 2025 remakes are extra special, and would cause a big stir if announced—we can dream!</p>



<p>We’re in an era where wishes and dreams are closer to reality than ever. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/square-enix-wants-last-final-fantasy-7-remake-to-be-out-within-3-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7</a> was a remake people clamored after for years, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/glen-schofield-dead-space-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Space</a> is the horror title of our generation, making its remake more special, and Link’s Awakening brought an age-old <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zelda</a> classic into the limelight. Each year we’re seeing a plethora of remakes and remasters, and more continue to be revealed.</p>



<p>Our fondest and deepest desires are happening. Games we used to love are becoming titles to love all over again. 2025 is shaping up to be another huge year in the annals of gaming, and certain remakes could etch it in history.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-remakes-we-want-to-see-in-2025">Best Remakes we Want to See in 2025</h2>



<p>These remakes can either be a sudden shadow drop, an announcement, or an end-of-year launch. As long as we get something relating to a release or announcement, this is a big W in our books. Please devs, make our dreams come true.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-simpsons-hit-amp-run">The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The one we all want. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Simpsons had every other type of game by 2003, so why not a GTA clone? Unlike the majority of Simpsons games, Hit &amp; Run was really good, dare I say exceptional. It did what few (if any) predecessors did and gave us a chance to explore Springfield in detail. Trademarks, catchphrases, collectibles, spying bee cameras, and pure comic violence synergized to create the perfect, coherent open-world Simpsons game. The world is crying out for a remake, so for crying out loud, if we can’t have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-didnt-we-get-the-simpsons-hit-run-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hit &amp; Run 2</a>, someone put down their Duff and do it!</p>



<h3 id="h-burnout-revenge">Burnout Revenge</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Nasty. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Criterion Games was scorching hot in the mid-2000s with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/burnout-revival-possibly-coming-from-stellar-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burnout</a> franchise. This is peak arcade racing—more so than NFS: Underground 2—and we didn’t know what we had until it was gone. Burnout 3: Takedown was the turning point for the series, but after finding its niche, Burnout Revenge injected the franchise with a more potent, high-octane dose of super speedy, car-crunching action. Revenge’s introduction of Traffic Checking was revolutionary, and everything is better here.</p>



<h3 id="h-resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Chris never stops. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Resident Evil 5 feels like the awkward middle child between the genre-defining excellence of Resident Evil 4, and the ambitious and awkward nature of Resident Evil 6. It’s lost in the shuffle, and it’s a shame because Resi 5 is low-key excellent. The African setting did well and truly mark the full-blown departure from the series’ roots, and this rubbed some fans the wrong way. But the overt killing of infected enemies, spectacular action, and evolved Resi gameplay carry on Resi 4’s good work. The best detail is, you can play the campaign in co-op with Chris and Sheva. The earlier games have gotten a new gloss of bloody paint, so it’s only right a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-resident-evil-5-getting-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 5 remake</a> is next.</p>



<h3 id="h-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-amp-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 &amp; 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I feel like a teenager all over again. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>2020’s Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 was a nostalgia ride as emotional as any. Kickflipping gaps, finding secret tapes, and seeing if it’s possible to break bones with the hardest bailouts imaginable—just me? Goldfinger’s Superman alone is enough to bring a tear to your eye, and I want this feeling again with a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake. I spent hours trying to beat my high score in Pro Skater’s 3 Airport level, and don’t get me started on Zoo. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk is teasing future Pro Skater games</a>, but it remains to be seen if they’re remakes for 2025, even later, or not at all.</p>



<h3 id="h-god-of-war">God of War</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What an intro. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Before Kratos calmed down (ish), grew a beard, and refused to give his son a name for a while, he was a vengeful, powerful Spartan with his own army. A last-second plea to Ares changes Kratos’ life forever, and 2005’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-tv-series-redone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> explores the Ghost of Sparta’s haunting past. There are no third-person cameras or jumping bans here, this is the pinnacle of fully-fledged hack ‘n’ slash gameplay. After playing it recently, I can assure you it holds up; the use of puzzles and special abilities makes the OG GOW a well-rounded, must-play title—and it would look stunning if remade.</p>



<h3 id="h-bioshock">Bioshock</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Creepy. Credit to IGDB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Over 15 years on, and I still have nightmares of being served up as a Splicer’s side platter. Bioshock was a groundbreaking exercise in storytelling, horror, FPS innovation, and world-building. It ignores the conventions of generic, linear-pathed shooters and creates a whole universe to become immersed in—Rapture. Big Daddys, Little Sisters, an underwater city, shocking plot twists: It’s the brainchild of someone thinking seriously outside the box. That someone is Ken Levine, and his upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/judas-gameplay-trailer-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Judas</a> is a spiritual successor to Bioshock. Maybe it’s time to infuse ourselves with one final Plasmid.</p>
