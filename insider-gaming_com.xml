<p>Rainbow Six Siege’s Y9S4 update drops <strong>today</strong>, with Ubisoft taking the game offline for up to 60 minutes to apply the super-sized patch. It ushers in Operation Collision Point, which brings a new Operator to the game, as well as a slew of new features, tweaks, and balances.</p>



<p>It’s the last major update of the year for Rainbow Six Siege – check out the Y9S4 patch notes below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-does-operation-collision-point-release">When Does Operation Collision Point Release?</h2>



<p>Operation Collision Point is released today, December 3 on all platforms. It’s a free-to-consume update that brings countless new features and changes to the game, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Blackbeard, a new Attacker</li>



<li>Player Protection updates</li>



<li>Ballistic Shield balances</li>



<li>Console to PC crossplay 1.0</li>



<li>Matchmaking improvements</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a serious update that has players excited. This is typical of Ubisoft, though. Every so often, the team releases a major update into the Rainbow Six Siege ecosystem that alters the playing field – it’s why Siege has stayed on top for almost a decade.</p>



<h3 id="h-y9s4-patch-size">Y9S4 Patch Size</h3>



<p>Here are the download sizes for the Operation Collision Point update:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ubisoft Connect: 73.99 GB</li>



<li>Steam: 14.8 GB</li>



<li>Xbox One: 34.4 GB</li>



<li>Xbox Series X: 40.7 GB</li>



<li>PlayStation 4: 39.90 GB</li>



<li>PlayStation 5: 36.74 GB</li>
</ul>



<p>It was noted that the download sizes are larger than usual because the team has completed a texture reforge.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/6MQfBtcDbLYv6CbQxZg3pF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Y9S4 patch</a> is huge both in size and in what it offers. From an Operator price decrease to new seasonal skins, and hundreds of bug fixes to the introduction of the Siege Cup ecosystem, players are being spoilt rotten by Ubisoft this month.</p>

<p>Spotify Wrapped is one of the most exciting times of the year for the 250 million subscribers to the music streaming service. It doesn’t matter if you use it to play background noises while gaming or if you rely on it solely on your commute, <strong>everyone </strong>waits all year round for Spotify Wrapped to drop.</p>



<p>With that being said, Spotify has kept a tight wrapper around this year’s release, refusing to give anything away on social media. When is Spotify Wrapped 2024 coming out, and where can you find it when it does?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-is-spotify-wrapped-2024">Where is Spotify Wrapped 2024?</h2>



<p>Spotify Wrapped first surfaced in 2016 as the platform’s attempt to sum up everyone’s listening habits for the past 12 months. It has evolved with time and has become much more granular, and it’s now a staple in the calendar of every subscriber worldwide.</p>



<p>With Spotify Wrapped, you’re given unique insights into the music that defined your year. You’ll be offered an audio-visual trip down memory lane <strong>and </strong>a playlist tailored exclusively to you.</p>



<p>That’s all well and good, but when is Spotify Wrapped 2024 coming out?</p>



<p>Spotify Wrapped has always dropped around the first week of December, so we can expect it to arrive in the coming days (at the time of publishing). Here’s a brief history:</p>



<ul>
<li>2023: November 29</li>



<li>2022: November 30</li>



<li>2021: December 1</li>



<li>2020: December 2</li>



<li>2019: December 5</li>



<li>2018: December 6</li>



<li>2017: December 6</li>
</ul>



<p>Potentially, we’re looking at a release date of December 4 for Spotify Wrapped 2024.</p>



<p>To find it, you’ll just need to log into the Spotify app on a mobile or desktop device and you’ll be presented with a pop-up alerting you that your Spotify Wrapped 2024 breakdown is ready. Then, you’ll have a 2024 lookback playlist contained in your ‘Made For You’ section on the app.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to unlocking your end-of-year report from Spotify? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re expecting in your Spotify Wrapped.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-a-life-2-0-in-stalker-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-happened-to-a-life-2-0-in-stalker-2-gsc-explains-everything.1050564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-a-life-2-0-in-stalker-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When STALKER 2 was released on November 20, one thing that was missing was the ‘A-Life 2.0’ that was promised to make The Zone a living, breathing world. It was said that A-Life 2.0 would serve as a solid evolution of the A-Life mechanics featured in the earlier STALKER games, giving players a sense of being present in a world populated by intelligent AI characters.</p>



<p>That’s not there in STALKER 2, and recently, GSC removed a reference to A-Life 2.0 from the game’s listing on Steam. However, GSC’s CEO has sat down with IGN to explain what happened to A-Life 2.0 and why it’s not in STALKER 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-did-a-life-2-0-go">Where Did A-Life 2.0 Go?</h2>



<p>In an interview with IGN, Ievgen Grygorovych, the CEO of GSC Game World, explained what happened to A-Life 2.0. It was penned as being one of the most advanced features in STALKER 2, allowing players to witness events unfolding independently of their input, with NPCs almost living their own lives irrespective of what the player was doing.</p>



<p>Grygorovych said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This system to work properly requires a much larger area for spawn NPCs, and it requires much more memory resources. We were fighting with optimization. To optimize, you have a lot of things that need your resources, and you try to cut things from different directions to properly optimize the game well.</p>



<p>But to make it work we had to optimize some things, and they make A-Life work in many situations not as it should. Also, we created some bugs not long ago before release with NPCs spawning in the air and dropping back to the bottom. They should actually spawn in the terrain. Why it happened, I don’t know! And also we had some bugs with AI behavior.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He explained that the team is working very hard to stabilise A-Life 2.0 and deliver what was promised, but it’s ‘very broken and not working’. In another statement, GSC’s creative director, Maria Grygorovych, threw the blame at the company’s marketing team, stressing it was <strong>them </strong>who removed the reference to A-Life 2.0 on Steam without permission.</p>



<p>She brought receipts, though. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the interview with IGN</a>, she showed screenshots of a conversation between her and the ‘marketing person’ who removed the details on Steam. However, the team <strong>won’t </strong>put the reference back until they’ve fixed A-Life 2.0.</p>



<p>That’s what happened – but it’s now up to GSC to patch up A-Life 2.0 and turn it into something that resembles what was promised.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has reignited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-zombies-split-screen-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a> as the mode returned back to its round-based roots. The undead mode has been all about giving the community what they want, a classic Zombies experience, with all the Perks and features fans know and love.</p>



<p>Speaking of Perks, you’ll find a familiar bunch in both Terminus and Liberty Falls, from Juggernog, Speedcola and Quick Revive to Deadshot Daiquiri, Stamina-Up and PHD Flopper.  With the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle des Morts map</a>, the devs have decided to reintroduce a Perk from Black Ops 2 called Vulture Aid.</p>



<p>For those who aren’t familiar with the Perk, here’s what Vulturue Aid is in Black Ops 6 Zombies and how it works.</p>

<p>Vulture Aid is a <strong>Zombies Perk that players can purchase in the Black Ops 6 Citadelle des Morts map</strong>, which arrives December 5, 2024, as part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1-reloaded-release-date-new-guns-codmas-event-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 Reloaded update</a>. </p>



<p>The Vulture Aid Perk was first introduced in Black Ops 2’s Buried map and hasn’t been seen since. It returns in Black Ops 6, and it will likely feature the same coffin-style red and white Perk machine design.</p>

<h2 id="h-vulture-aid-perk-effects">Vulture Aid Perk effects</h2>



<ul>
<li>See Perks, wall weapons, the Pack-a-Punch machine, and the Mystery Box through walls when close-by (they will also have a brighter glow for better visability).</li>



<li>Zombies also occasionally drop ammo or points on death</li>



<li>Some Zombies will release a green cloud upon death that players can walk into to mask themselves from Zombies and be ignored.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are the effects of Vulture Aid in Black Ops 2. There’s no telling whether the Perk will have the same effects in Black Ops 6 until mwe get hands on, but it will likely be very similar.</p>

<p>Venture Aid is on the Citadelle des Morts map in Black Ops 6 Zombies. We don’t yet know exactly where the Perk Machine will be, but it has been confirmed for the new map.</p>
