<p>The next Assassin’s Creed game has secured its Lead Scriptwriter, and it’s someone with a history of working on the franchise.</p>



<p>Christopher Grilli, someone with a history as the Scriptwriter for Assassin’s Creed Origins and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, and the lead writer for Assassin’s Creed Mirage, recently revealed on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christophergrilli_im-thrilled-to-share-that-im-starting-a-activity-7417934734485413889-FrRL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAGBVXOMBvz_qCqVv-uRJAvpCCT5UFNbGSog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> profile that he has signed on to be the Scriptwriter for the next game in the long-running franchise, code-named Hexe.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m thrilled to share that I’m starting a new position at Ubisoft Montreal as a Lead Scriptwriter on Assassin’s Creed: Codename Hexe. Incredibly grateful to be a part of this team and project,” he shared on January 16.</p>

<p>In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming reported</a> that the game was in a relatively early stage of development and was expected to be released this year. It’s also believed this will be a more linear experience than other games in the franchise, and that the series will feature a female protagonist named Elsa with supernatural abilities.</p>



<p>The game takes place in 16th-century Central Europe during the Holy Roman Empire, and reports indicate developers plan to implement a fear system inspired by the Jack the Ripper DLC from Assassin’s Creed Syndicate.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>With the Lead Scriptwriter only now coming on board, it’s fair to suggest that the game is still a ways from release, but with someone with such experience on the team, it appears to be heading in the right direction.

<p>According to a new report, the God of War live-action series has secured its Sif, and it’s none other than Teresa Palmer. </p>



<p>Things have been shaping quite well for Amazon’s God of War live-action series, with new castings being announced over the past day. Yesterday, we were informed that the man taking on the iconic role of the God of War will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sons-of-anarchy-star-cast-kratos-god-of-war-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sons of Anarchy’s Ryan Hurst</a>, who will pick up the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos as Kratos. </p>







<h2 id="h-teresa-palmer-to-play-sif-in-god-of-war-s-live-action-series">Teresa Palmer to Play Sif in God of War’s Live-Action Series</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/teresa-palmer-cast-prime-video-god-of-war-1236684477/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> reveals that Teresa Palmer will play Sif/Phoebe, Thor’s wife. Amazon has declined to comment on whether this news is true. Fans will remember Palmer from movies like Sorcerer’s Apprentice, Lights Out, The Fall Guy, and more. </p>



<p>The report on this casting has also made fans wonder about the series’ timeline. Players who have played both games will remember that Sif and Thor do not make an appearance until God of War: Ragnarok. So, will the live-action series follow the game’s events or set its own flow? </p>



<p>Additionally, a report from last month discusses who will play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-series-thor-baldur-cast-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur and Thor</a> in the upcoming series. It seems Max Parker from Boots will be taking on the role of Baldur. At the same time, Olafur Darri Olafsson from Severance will be playing the God of Thunder, Thor. </p>



<p>There are still many essential characters left to cast, including Atreus, Odin, Freya, Mimir, Sindri, Brok, and more. Which characters do you think will best fit these roles? </p>



<p>In other news, the voice actor of God of War’s Kratos has expressed his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-wars-kratos-actor-wants-to-go-to-egypt-for-the-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desire to go to Egypt</a> for the next game. Additionally, check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshots</a> from a cancelled God of War multiplayer title. </p>
