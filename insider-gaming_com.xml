<p>It seems that the worlds of Fortnite and Fall Guys are going to collide again as a new collaboration has been teased. </p>



<p>A lot of rumours around Fortnite collaborations have been surfacing lately, with names like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-office-x-fortnite-collaboration-could-be-coming-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-chainsaw-man-could-be-the-next-anime-collaboration-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainsaw Man</a>, and more popping up. However, these were just rumours; now we have a confirmed collaboration on the way, and it’s with a game that Fortnite has already collaborated with in the past. </p>







<h2 id="h-fall-guys-mention-a-ball-in-fortnite-collaboration-tease">Fall Guys Mention ‘A Ball’ in Fortnite Collaboration Tease</h2>



<p>The confirmation of the 2026 collaboration between Fortnite and Fall Guys comes via an <a href="https://x.com/FallGuysGame/status/2012164984047120647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) from the latter. The post states, “Beans caught practicing… something involving a ball. Might want to keep an eye on this, Fortnite.” Players have already started speculating what the “ball” could mean, with some guessing it’s basketball-related, while others think it could be related to other sports that involve a ball. </p>

<p>Fortnite and Fall Guys collaborated back in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-fall-guys-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024</a>, through the ‘Where We Fallin’ event. In this special event, players had to find a Golden Bean Idol, which would then transform them into a Fall Guys bean and let them compete in an obstacle course in the sky. Players would earn Gold, Silver, or Bronze tier loot based on how quickly they complete the course.</p>



<p>The Fall Guys collaboration also made it to Creative, where players could not only create their own obstacle-course-filled islands but also explore 6 Islands published by Mediatonic. </p>







<p>In other news, check out the Fortnite update 39.20 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch notes</a>, which introduced the South Park collab to the game.
