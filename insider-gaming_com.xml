<p>The state of video game hardware continues to be somewhat bleak across the board. After falling 45% year-over-year in January, video game hardware sales fell 25% year-over-year for February 2025.</p>



<p>The drop from $341 million to $256 million is the “lowest February total for video game hardware sales spending since the $184 million reached in February 2020”. That, according to Circana and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqaie744m2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">analyst Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>



<p>When looking into specifics, the PlayStation 5 (PS5) was the best-selling console in terms of both units sold and dollar amount. The Xbox Series systems came in second in both metrics.</p>



<p>Moving on to accessories, that also saw a fall of 8% from $248M to $228M year-over-year. After two months of sales data, accessory spending is 18% behind 2024’s pace. A big reason for that, according to Circana’s data, is that controller spending has fallen 17% and headset spending has dropped off 25%.</p>



<p>As far as what remains a top seller, the PlayStation Portal’s base model was February’s best-selling accessory in terms of dollars spent.</p>



<p>Seeing the continued trend of falling hardware sales shouldn’t be surprising to many in, and around, the industry. It seems pretty clear that players either already have the system they want or there’s simply a desire to spend their money elsewhere as a result of increased cost of living. </p>



<p>It should be expected that hardware sales will get an uptick during the year when Nintendo releases its highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 system in the coming months.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of February 2025 in the United States (US), knocking Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 from the top spot after four months.</p>



<p>In the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqahyb5hk2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, four of the top five games from February were brand new releases. Coming in second was Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 while Civilization 7 and PGA Tour 2K25 were third and fourth, respectively. Rounding out the top five was NBA 2K25, which fell from second.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 finished sixth.</p>



<p>Regarding new game releases, six releases found their way into the top 10 for February after just one <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-was-january-2025s-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the top 20</a> in January. Aside from what was mentioned above, the other new games that made February’s list of best sellers were Avowed at seven and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii at eight.</p>



<p>Lastly, a number of games that found themselves near the top of the sales charts for months have continued to fall. In addition to the aforementioned Call of Duty and NBA 2K25, EA Sports College Football 25 has fallen out of the top 10 for the first time, coming in at 16th compared to seventh. The only game to stay in its same spot from month to month is Elden Ring at 18.</p>

<p>A game called Plants vs Zombies Reloaded has been rated by the Brazil rating board, sparking discussion that a remaster of the original could be in development.</p>



<p>The rating, which simply says “Plants vs Zombies Reloaded” was rated for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X, PC, Nintendo Switch, and mobile with an ‘L’ rating.</p>



<p>Plants vs Zombies was first developed and published by PopCap Games in May 2009 and later was acquired by EA in July 2011. Despite the initial game being a success and multiple spin-offs and a few sequels, the Plants vs Zombies community has criticized the developers for not replicating the success of the original game.</p>



<p>“I hope it means ea (or popcap idk if they can make decisions by themselves) will get his shit together to deliver a proper sequel in the future but at this point the mere thought of it falls into hopium territory, they fumbled the franchise so hard that it hurts,” said Reddit user kdk_2002.</p>



<p>“Thankfully you don’t have to even look to EA, I sure as hell don’t, since the fans have taken it upon themselves to continue PvZ and have made a plethora of great mods expanding upon PvZ1 and PvZ2. We’re eating good and not giving EA a dime, as it should be until they deliver something actually worth paying for,” said another user.</p>

<p>United Videogame Workers (UVW), in conjunction with the Communication Works of America (CWA) and the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) have announced the first ever industry-wide, direct-join union in North America. The UVW-CWA Local 9433 was revealed during Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2025 in San Francisco, California.</p>



<p>As a direct-join union, anyone working in the video game industry in both the United States and Canada can join. That includes artists, developers, QA tester, and more whether they are freelance or full time. It also doesn’t matter how many people from their specific company have joined.  </p>



<p>“The creation of this union was not done in isolation; it’s a cumulative effort by the thousands of video game workers who have been fighting for years to redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power in one of the largest and highest-grossing industries on the globe,”&nbsp;said CWA’s Senior Director of Organizing Tom Smith <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-launch-industry-wide-union-communications-workers-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via press release</a>. “These workers are taking a bold stand, joining together to build power for the workers behind the games we all know and love.”</p>



<p>CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. added: “As video game studios have consolidated, the workers whose creativity, dedication, and skill bring the games to life have become more an afterthought. They are subject to endless cycles of layoffs and rehiring as corporate executives pursue short-term profits at the expense of a sustainable future.”</p>



<p>The press release adds that as part of the union’s launch, its members will be running a petition “demanding dignity and job security for all video game workers, particularly those facing layoffs.” They will also have a large presence around GDC 2025, including panels and other events.</p>



<p>The unions mission statement reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Our mission is to take back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs; to empower our fellow workers; to link up arms with the laid off, with the freelancer, with the disillusioned contractor, with the disenfranchised and the marginalized, with the workers laboring invisibly to keep this industry afloat</em>. <em>We are going to create a game industry that works for us, one that nourishes its talent and invests in its future, rather than constantly seeking short-term profits. We are the ones that make the games, so we must be the ones that set the terms of how we work.</em></p>




</blockquote>



<p>As of publishing, there have been a <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">known 1,493 jobs lost</a> due to layoffs in 2025 across 47 companies. This comes after an estimated 16,000 people lost their jobs in 2024.</p>
