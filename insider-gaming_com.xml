<p>Fresh challenges await with the launch of Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, which includes several new bosses to defeat, and this guide has all the location details for Hush.</p>



<p>Hush is one of three bosses waiting to be encountered in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, alongside <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-human-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Bill</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-beach-brutus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beach Brutus</a>, with unique weapons and abilities available as rewards once defeated.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has all the boss location details for Hush in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 below, along with all the loot earned for defeating them.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-hush-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">Where to Find Hush in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>

<p><strong>Like the other bosses in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, Hush doesn’t have a single guaranteed spawn location, with several potential spawn points across the map instead.</strong></p>



<p>Though this can be frustrating if you’re on the hunt for a specific boss, like Hush, and the available loot, it keeps things fresh in every Fortnite match and prevents a flood of players dropping on the same guaranteed spawn location for an all-out brawl to defeat the boss and claim the loot.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of potential Hush boss locations in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ripped Tides</li>



<li>Classified Canyon</li>



<li>Painted Palms</li>



<li>South of Paws Inn</li>



<li>Sunset Falls</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for Hush, the best landing spot is Painted Palms, as this is a potential spawn location for all three bosses. Additionally, it’s near two other spawn points, so there’s quick rotation if your first point of call doesn’t yield the results you’re looking for.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-hush-loot-drops-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Hush Loot Drops in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>Hush has a decent crop of valuable loot when defeated in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, including the ability to transform into the boss and benefit from increased Health and Shields.</strong></p>



<p>Alongside those boosts, transforming into Hush unlocks the Kit In ability, which is used to Zero Point Dash. With this ability, traversal in combat, or for general movement across the map, becomes much faster.</p>



<p>In terms of weapon, defeating Hish drops Hush’s Deadeye Assault Rifle, a Mythic version of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapon available elsewhere in the map</a> with increased headshot damage, and low recoil. This makes picking enemies off at mid-to-long range much easier and can be a turning point in the battle.</p>



<p>Like the other bosses, defeating Hush also drops a Chug Jug, which can be used to restore Health and Shields. With a boost to both when you turn into the boss, it’s another invaluable piece of kit.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 Beach Brutus Boss Location—Where to Find & All Loot]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-beach-brutus/</link>
            <guid>1369051</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A fresh beginning has occurred in Fortnite with the launch of Chapter 7 Season 1, which brings with it a new map and new bosses to defeat, and this guide has all the location details on where to find Beach Brutus.</p>



<p>Beach Brutus is one of three bosses waiting to be encountered on the Fortnite map, alongside the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-human-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Bill</a>, and offers unique rewards that can turn the tide in any match, so he’s well worth hunting down.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming is here to help you track down the boss location, along with details on the loot dropped once Beach Brutus has been defeated.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-beach-brutus-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">Where to Find Beach Brutus in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s go to the beach. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Like the other bosses in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, there isn’t a single location guaranteed to have Beach Brutus waiting. Instead, there are several spawn points across the map.</strong></p>



<p>While it can be frustrating to have rotating bosses with a list of several spawn locations, it adds additional variety to each Fortnite map. Additionally, Beach Brutus is possibly the easiest to find, as the majority of the spawn points are located near each other.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of where Beach Brutus can be encountered in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ripped Tides</li>



<li>Classified Canyon</li>



<li>Painted Palms</li>



<li>Paws Inn (East of Wonkeeland)</li>



<li>Sunset Falls (Southeast of Wonkeeland)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for Beach Brutus, Painted Palms is a good place to start as he is often found here, and other spawn locations near Paws Inn and Sunset Falls are not too far away. However, he’s often found in Ripped Tides and Classified Canyon, both of which are popular initial landing locations, so competition to defeat him can be fierce.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-beach-brutus-loot-drops-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Beach Brutus Loot Drops in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>Beach Brutus drops a host of valuable loot when defeated in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, including the ability to transform into the boss.</strong></p>



<p>Transforming into Beach Brutus provides a boost to maximum Health and Shields, along with a special ability in the Beach Brutus Kit that allows you to regenerate shields without needing to consume Shield Potions, which provides a huge boost in any combat situation, and you can also spawn Henchmen to assist in battle.</p>



<p>The downside, however, is that transforming into a boss like Beach Brutus will permanently mark your location to nearby players in a more precise manner than Medallions have done in previous Chapters and Seasons.</p>



<p>In terms of weapons, Beach Brutus drops The Brutus’ Twin Hammer Shotguns, a Mythic weapon that has a much faster reload speed than the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-Mythic variant</a>. While they have a limited range, they are extremely lethal and can either be fired at the same time, or individually.</p>



<p>Finally, defeating Beach Brutus will also drop a Chug Jug, a valuable item that restores both Health and Shields—and it’s even more useful with the boosted amounts you’ll receive of both when transformed into the boss.</p>

<p>A new Chapter in Fortnite means new bosses to track down and defeat, but finding the specific boss locations is tricky if you don’t know where to look. Fortunately, this guide can direct you straight to Human Bill.</p>



<p>Human Bill is one of three bosses in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, offering powerful items when defeated that can change the course of a match and put you on course to secure victory, but the blue alien can be tough to track down.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has detailed where to find Human Bill in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, along with the loot offered once defeated.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-human-bill-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">Where to Find Human Bill in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The hunt is on. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Human Bill does not have a single set spawn in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, and can instead appear in several locations across the map.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite has adopted travelling bosses with varying spawns in the past, including in The Simpsons mini-season, and it seems this mechanic will remain. Although it can be frustrating if you want to farm the boss, it does make every match more interesting with no single set spawn that all players can flock to.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of where Human Bill can be encountered in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ripped Tides</li>



<li>Classified Canyon</li>



<li>Painted Palms</li>



<li>South/East of Wonkeeland</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for Human Bill, the areas around Wonkeeland are a good place to start, particularly Sunset Falls. The benefit of starting your search here is that Painted Palms, another potential spawn location for Human Bill, is a short distance away if you’re unsuccessful in your initial search.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-human-bill-loot-drops-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Human Bill Loot Drops in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>The most important loot dropped by Human Bill in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is the boss transform item, transforming you into Human Bill and providing a special ability.</strong></p>



<p>Human Bill’s Kit can be activated for Low Gravity for a short period, making traversal to hard-to-reach places much easier and providing a quick escape. Transforming into Human Bill also provides an increased bar for Health and Shields, making you tough to beat.</p>



<p>Beware, though, as transforming into a boss will permanently mark your exact location to nearby players, in a more precise manner than Medallions have done in previous Chapters and Seasons.</p>



<p>Weapon-wise, defeating Human Bill drops Human Bill’s Arc-Lightning Gun, a Mythic version of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapon introduced this season</a>. It takes significantly longer to overheat, making it easier to defeat enemies without needing to switch weapons or wait for the Arc-Lightning Gun to cool down.</p>



<p>Finally, Human Bill also drops a Chug Jug when defeated, which is always a useful item but is even more so when transformed into a boss, as it restores the higher amount of Health and Shield you have earned.</p>

<p>A new chapter has kicked off with Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, which brings a new map into the fray with a variety of NPC characters to find, and this guide has details on them all.</p>



<p>Chapter 7 kicked off after a dramatic end to Chapter 6 with the Zero Point live event, which led to significant changes in gameplay, including the removal of several modes. However, the dates for their return have been revealed by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-roadmap-blitz-reload-og-delulu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 7 Season 1 Roadmap</a>.</p>



<p>NPCs can be of real assistance in every season in Fortnite, and it’s worth knowing their locations and what they offer, so Insider Gaming has all the details of where they are found in Chapter 7 Season 1.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-npc-characters-amp-services">All Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 NPC Characters &amp; Services</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty to find. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 10 NPC Characters scattered across the map in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, with additions and removals likely as the season progresses.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike previous chapters and seasons, not all of the NPC characters have defined services and, instead, their offerings will vary each match. There are four potential options for each of the non-specialist characters to offer in a match, which are as follows.</p>



<ul>
<li>Gain Gold based on your match performance (Free)</li>



<li>Spawn a Rift (500 Gold)</li>



<li>Restock Ammo (500 Gold)</li>



<li>Health &amp; Shields (500 Gold)</li>
</ul>



<p>Specialists, meanwhile, are NPCs available to hire that will follow you for the remainder of the match, providing support based on their class, like ammo and health items, and will attack enemy players. Hiring a specialist costs 600 Gold.</p>



<p>A full list of all NPC characters in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is shown below. This article will be updated with any additions and removals as the season progresses.</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong>Kingston does not show as discovered on the Fortnite map this season after interacting with him, but this should be fixed soon. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Gulag became a popular meme when Warzone first released, and Fortnite could be set to bring its own version of the infamous battle arena to the colorful world.</p>



<p>‘1v1 me in the Gulag’ is a line (and meme) associated with the Covid era. Many took shelter from the pandemic in their homes and sank hundreds and thousands of hours into CoD Warzone as a means of escape. Warzone’s Gulag became the new Rust, and whenever you died in Warzone, the Gulag was your main entry point back into the game.</p>



<p>Now, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-bus-wheels-pump-n-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> Gulag could finally be following suit.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-gulag-takes-inspiration-from-call-of-duty-warzone">Fortnite Gulag Takes Inspiration From Call of Duty: Warzone</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fight me. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s fair to say that Fortnite doesn’t need to copy anyone’s homework. Epic’s shooter is still ridiculously popular nearly 10 years later, and keeps finding ways to freshen up the gameplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 7 Season 1</a> brought <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-leaks-reveal-driveable-reboot-vans-bots-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">driveable reboot vans, a Bots Mode</a>, along with a wingsuit, and many other ideas. According to renowned leakers Shiina and <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX"></a>HYPEX (through <a href="https://x.com/l3stei" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@l3stei</a>), a Fortnite Gulag is on the way.</p>







<p>It will reportedly be called ‘Restarter Island’ and will have players compete in a series of mini-games to determine the winner. The traditional Gulag is basically a quick 1v1 gunfight where it’s the first player to eliminate the other.</p>



<p>In Fortnite, you will allegedly battle in Rock, Paper, Scissors, some kind of Shockwave Grenades mini-game, and more.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>FORTNITE GULAG SYSTEM COMING SOON</p><p>– Called "Restarter Island"<br>– Includes Rock, Paper, Scissors<br>– Classic rules, best of 3<br>– Shockwave Grenades granted over time, used to knock opponents off their platforms</p><p>(via <a href="https://twitter.com/l3stei?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@l3stei</a>) <a href="https://t.co/1oEgYmWwVp">pic.twitter.com/1oEgYmWwVp</a></p></div>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1994896784154661265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Better yet—thanks to <a href="https://x.com/Egyptian_Leaker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@Egyptian_Leaker</a> &amp; <a href="https://x.com/KPMisParrot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@KPMisParrot</a>—you can see what it looks like.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Fortnite does feel like an amalgamation of every top battle royale idea at this point, and why not? Millions of players still hop in every day. As long as it’s implemented right and in a fun way that doesn’t detract from Fortnite, is a new Gulag a good idea?

<p>The Q3 earnings call for CD Projekt Red revealed a ton of fun details. One of the most eye-catching statements mentioned The Witcher 4, letting us know it’s not releasing in 2026, but giving us a full launch window for the three new The Witcher games.</p>



<p>It feels like a millennium has passed since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 3</a> launched. The RPG of a lifetime will go down as an all-time great, and after the development of Cyberpunk 2077, its release, and the vast clean-up operation following its debut, we’re all ready for The Witcher 4 and beyond.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-hits-new-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077 has hit a new sales milestone</a>, showing the incredible turnaround of the game’s fortunes following its horrific 2020 release. Phantom Liberty was another hit, but it’s high time CD Projekt Red turns its full focus back ot The Witcher franchise.</p>







<p>During the company’s <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q3 earnings call</a>, speaker Michał Nowakowski (Joint CEO at CDPR) was asked: “Can you share more detail about where you are in The Witcher 4 development process? What are the key technical/design risks that could shift the release window?”</p>



<p>Nowakowski respodned:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re not disclosing any details regarding the target release date, so there’s not a point in time I could refer to when answering such a question. The only think we’re commenting is that we’re not launching in 2026, and we’re also not typically getting into any specifics regarding technical or design matters. There’s nothing out of the ordinary, I’d say, in that area happening with TW4 – it’s just full scale production proceeding at its pace, as per our internal plans. I think that’s as much as we can say.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was probably to be expected, as you’d imagine CDPR doesn’t want to repeat the mistakes of Cyberpunk 2077. On the other hand, it was quite surprising to learn that CDPR intends to stick with its trilogy release plans:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time – as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between TW4 and TW5, between TW5 and TW6 and so on.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Again, The Witcher 4 in 2026 would be great, but the year is going to be stacked enough with games. As for the remaining games in the trilogy, as long as they’re well-made and exude that typical CDPR premium quality, three full-scale The Witcher games in six years would be special. Let us know if you think this is unrealistic, and you can do so through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
