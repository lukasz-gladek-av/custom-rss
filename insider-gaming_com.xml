<p>Sony has announced that PlayStation has sold 65 Million Units of the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>The news came via the company’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q2_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q2 earnings results</a>, which revealed&nbsp;that the company had sold 3.8 million units in its last quarter, bringing the total number of PlayStation 5s sold to 65.5 million. The company reported that the last quarter saw a 29% reduction in PlayStation 5 sales compared to the same quarter the previous year.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the PlayStation 5 total sales are just behind that of the PlayStation 4, which sold around 67.5 million units, a 2 million unit difference. Earlier this year, PlayStation announced that it expects a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-sales-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continued decline in its PlayStation 5 sales</a> as the console enters its latter half in the market.</p>



<p>It’s not all doom and gloom, though (if you could argue that anyway), as the company saw its biggest amount of Monthly Active Users for Q2 in its history at 116 million. The company saw 107 million Monthly Active Users during the same period last year.</p>

<p>During the same earnings call, Sony also announced that PlayStation 5 exclusive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot sold 1.5 million units in its first 2 months</a>.</p>

<p>Following the immense success of the live-action Fallout television series, thanks to Amazon Prime, it was only a matter of time before the series’ second season started attracting more high-profile names. Of course, season one ended on a cliffhanger, so we’re all beyond excited to dive in for more, and now we have a tidbit of information to run with. According to a recent report, Macaulay Culkin joins the cast of Fallout season two, apparently playing a ‘crazy genius-type’ character. I’m a little curious about the role, and something in me thinks his part involves the Enclave.</p>



<p>In the original report published by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/macaulay-culkin-cast-fallout-season-2-1236170530/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Macaulay Culkin’s role in the television series based on the long-popular role-playing game franchise remains relatively new. The only information we have about his performance is that he’s a crazy genius of some sort.</p>



<p>That said, Culkin joins a large and growing roster of exceptional stars, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ella Purnell</li>



<li>Walton Goggins</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-plays-knight-titus-in-the-fallout-tv-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Moten</a></li>



<li>Kyle MacLachlan</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-xelia-mendes-jones-in-fallout-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xelia Mendes-Jones</a></li>
</ul>







<p>Following the overwhelming reception to the first season, which debuted as one of Prime Video’s Top 3 most-watched series and received 16 Emmy nominations, a second season was almost immediately greenlit for production. While it’s still a ways off, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallouts-second-season-starts-filming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filming begins shortly</a>.</p>
