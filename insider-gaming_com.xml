<p>Tides of Tomorrow has been delayed to April 2026, just over a month before its previous release date. </p>



<p>Digixart and THQ Nordic’s next title was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-tomorrow-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> back in June 2025 during a PlayStation State of Play event, where the developers spoke a bit about the game’s unique multiplayer system. The title received a release date for February 2026, but that has been delayed to April due to feedback from the demo; more details below. </p>







<h2 id="h-tides-of-tomorrow-gets-a-new-release-date">Tides of Tomorrow Gets a New Release Date</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2678080/announcements/detail/493840283288472149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from the developers of Tides of Tomorrow reveals that the game is now set to release on April 22, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The developers considered renaming the title to Tides of the Day After Tomorrow, but decided against it. Instead, they are now delaying the release to work on the feedback they received from the demo. </p>



<p>Tides of Tomorrow’s demo and ongoing beta received extensive feedback, prompting the devs to delay the game. The additional time will be used to “respond to player input and implement improvements.” The extra time will allow the developers to “ensure the best possible experience for the upcoming narrative-driven adventure.” </p>



<p>While players wait for the upcoming title, they can check out the 40-minute <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3951580/Tides_of_Tomorrow_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">demo</a> on Steam, which lets them explore a location from the game’s opening act. As this is a narrative-driven adventure, the demo can be replayed to uncover new gameplay, storylines, and consequences. The game also features a unique multiplayer experience where players can follow a friend or a favourite streamer, and the system will generate a tailored experience by combining your choices with theirs.</p>

<p>Palworld devs have teased upcoming Pals through new concept art revealed from their 2nd Anniversary video. </p>



<p>Pocketpair has been hard at work growing the Palworld game and the franchise. In terms of content, we saw the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-ultrakill-collab-arrives-in-december-2025-with-home-sweet-home-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultrakill Collab and the ‘Home Sweet Home’ update</a> arrive last month. Additionally, we also saw a new Palword <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-facing-more-pokemon-rip-off-allegations-with-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TCG announced last week</a>, extending the franchise’s reach in the card game genre. Now, we have got a small tease for what’s in store for their 1.0 update, which will finally get the game out of early access. </p>







<h2 id="h-palworld-reveals-concept-art-for-upcoming-pal">Palworld Reveals Concept Art for Upcoming Pal </h2>



<p>Palworld’s 2nd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0M82qgvIxE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Anniversary video</a> starts with Bucky, Head of Publishing &amp; Communications at Pocketpair, addressing the community. Bucky reveals that developers are working hard on the Palworld <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-1-0-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.0 update</a>, which seems to be the game’s “biggest update ever”. However, they can’t show a sneak peek of this update at the moment, as it is still in development. They did have some concept art to showcase for upcoming Pals in Palworld. </p>



<p>The first concept art depicts a dragon-like creature with elements of a Lotus flower around it. The next one had a fluffy but angry-looking creature that seemed to have electric abilities. The third Pal concept art in Palworld featured a blue-and-white-coloured bird with a cloud around its face. The fourth concept art featured an eel-like Pal that could seemingly detach its lower half to turn into a blade. The last art showcased twin creatures in blue and red accents. </p>



<p>Apart from the Pal concept art, towards the end of the video, Bucky also teases another creature, asking, “That sounds like…a whale???” The statement was followed by an in-game cinematic that showed the player atop a mythical, whale-like creature, en route to a mysterious tree. Interested readers can check out the 2nd Anniversary teaser below: </p>
