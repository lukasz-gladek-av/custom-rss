<p>007 First Light’s developers have said that the game’s combat and physicality are inspired by Daniel Craig’s era of Bond movies. </p>



<p>It seems that Daniel Craig and his Bond movies have been a major inspiration for IO Interative’s upcoming origin story, 007 First Light. The developers had previously stated that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-used-daniel-craigs-likeness-for-first-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actor’s head was placed on Agent 47’s body</a> for the first demo. Now, the developers have revealed that the game’s other aspects are inspired by the movies this actor appeared in. </p>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-draws-inspiration-from-casino-royale-s-style-of-movement">007 First Light Draws Inspiration from Casino Royale’s Style of Movement</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.edge-magazine-subscription.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Edge Magazine</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/007-first-light-studio-didnt-want-to-create-this-superman-from-day-one-with-its-fresh-faced-james-bond-its-not-very-relatable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Creative Director Hakan Abrak spoke about drawing inspiration from Daniel Craig’s era for 007 First Light. Abrak first stated that it isn’t “one-to-one exactly,” as the dev team is trying to make the game “feel original.” However, the team found it essential that the character is constantly “moving, dynamic and acrobatic, almost like the parkour at the start of Casino Royale.”</p>



<p>While talking about drawing inspiration from these movies, Abrak also spoke about not creating “this superman from day one” where the character is already “on top of the world, and he’s hardened and seasoned, and he’s had his heartbreaks and now he’s hidden behind this iron armor.” The developers feel it won’t be “interesting” to players and provided an example of 1962’s Dr. No, which features Bond already as this super agent, which is “not very relatable”. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gemma-chan-announced-for-007-first-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemma Chan has been confirmed</a> among the cast for 007 First Light. Additionally, the developers have insisted that the upcoming title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-insist-it-isnt-a-hitman-reskin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t a Hitman “reskin</a>“. What are your thoughts on 007 First Light’s combat and physicality drawing inspiration from Daniel Craig’s era of movies?

<p>It’s deja vu for all the geneticists in the world, as Jurassic World Evolution 3 shows we still haven’t learnt the lesson not to reintroduce dinosaurs to the world, and there are a heap of achievements and trophies to earn as you defy Mother Nature.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Releasing October 21</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 comes four years after its predecessor and leans heavily on sister titles Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster 2, introducing mechanics that have become famed in those games—including the debut of baby dinosaurs.</p>



<p>If you’re a completionist and are seeking to complete the full Jurassic World Evolution 3 trophy list, we’ve got your to-do list.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-jurassic-world-evolution-3-achievements-amp-trophies">All Jurassic World Evolution 3 Achievements &amp; Trophies</h2>

<p><strong>Achievements and trophies to earn in Jurassic World Evolution 3 come from varying approaches, like reaching specific milestones and witnessing certain events.</strong></p>



<p>For example, releasing a Tyrannosaurus Rex is worth one award, while taking a photograph worth $200,000 is another. Long-term goals include completing the Genome Library, achieving the maximum rating in each campaign stage, and unlocking the full Tech Tree.</p>



<p>A full list of the known achievements and trophies are found in the table below.</p>

<p>Life continues to find a way with a new entry in the fan-favorite saga with Jurassic World Evolution 3, and we’ve got all the platform details for the title.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Releasing October 21</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 makes big additions to the franchise in the form of baby dinosaurs and piece-by-piece construction, with mechanics that were initially seen in the Planet Coaster series and Planet Zoo.</p>



<p>With Jurassic World Evolution 3 roaring onto the scene, we’ve got everything you need to know about the title, including it’s availability on various platforms. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-jurassic-world-evolution-3-on-ps4-or-xbox-one">Can You Play Jurassic World Evolution 3 on PS4 or Xbox One?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Blossoming. Image via Frontier Developments</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Jurassic World Evolution 3 is not available on Xbox One or PlayStation 4, and is solely a current-gen exclusive title.</strong></p>



<p>This marks the first time in the franchise that the title has not been available on PS4 or Xbox One, though it is in line with other <a href="https://www.jurassicworldevolution.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frontier Developments</a> releases. Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster 2, for example, were not released on either platform.</p>



<p>Significant enhancements have been made since Jurassic World Evolution 2, with Planet Zoo’s console version and Planet Coaster 2 both releasing after the previous entry in the series.</p>



<p>Moving forward, it’s further evidence that Frontier Development games are unlikely to be available on last-gen consoles, with any new releases likely to be only PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S moving forward.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-jurassic-world-evolution-3-platforms-explained">All Jurassic World Evolution 3 Platforms, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is only available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned above, there are no last-gen releases for Jurassic World Evolution 3, nor is there any news on a launch on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles. While the Switch 2 may have the capacity for the title on the console, there’s no indication that Evolution 3 will make the jump to Nintendo platforms.</p>



<p>There could be future platform releases later on, however. Planet Zoo was initially released as a PC exclusive in 2019, before being ported to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later. However, this seems unlikely this time around, unless a Switch 2 launch is on the cards.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6’s Campaign offers players an ‘Uninstall’ button once they have finished it. </p>



<p>EA’s highly sought-after FPS title, Battlefield 6, has finally been released, and it is already dominating the Steam charts, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beats-call-of-dutys-all-time-concurrent-player-count-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing</a> Call of Duty’s all-time concurrent player count within a day of launch. Now, new details about the BF6’s campaign have been revealed, and it seems that this game mode provides players with an option to ‘uninstall’. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-campaign-can-be-easily-uninstalled-once-completed">Battlefield 6 Campaign Can be Easily Uninstalled Once Completed</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/battlefield-bf-battlefield-6-bf6-ea-electronic-arts-campaign-hdd-space-uninstall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gamer</a>, a post by BobNetworkUK on <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1977095756193710437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) reveals that the Battlefield 6 Campaign screen will replace the usual button with an uninstall button once the player has completed the game mode. The original poster stated that players can continue playing and completing challenges if they don’t want to uninstall the mode, as it still features mission select. Still, many players might be happy to be offered that option once this game mode has been completed. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Regarding Battlefield 6’s campaign, we know it features nine missions spanning three continents: Africa, North America, and Europe. The game mode also lets players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-campaign-lets-players-command-a-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">command a full squad</a> at almost all times, with each member belonging to a different class. Moreover, the revive system works similarly to multiplayer: if a player has been downed, a squad member can revive them, and vice versa.</p>



<p>In other news, the developers have confirmed that Battlefield 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-use-anything-made-by-generative-ai-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not feature generative AI</a>. Additionally, the open beta <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-betas-smaller-maps-were-intentional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intentionally had smaller maps</a>.
