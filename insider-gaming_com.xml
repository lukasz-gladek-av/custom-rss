<p>Todd Howard, one of the head honchos at Bethesda Game Studios, has given up the first solid details we’ve ever gotten for Fallout 5. In a recent interview, the visionary developer confirmed that Fallout 5 <strong>will be impacted </strong>by the ongoing television series, which shares the same universe as the games.</p>



<p>It started with a Fallout 76 crossover, and it will eventually evolve into Fallout 5’s setting or story bleeding into what has happened, or is yet to happen, in the Prime-backed television show.</p>



<h2 id="h-huge-news-for-fallout-fans">Huge News for Fallout Fans</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Todd Howard sat down on his marketing spree to talk about the second season of Fallout, which debuted today. The second season is already proving to be a hit with fans and critics alike, scoring extremely well in early reviews.</p>



<p>The interview <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with the BBC</a> unveiled a juicy titbit that Fallout fans will go giddy over.</p>



<p>When asked if Fallout 5 will be impacted by the developing television series, Todd Howard simply said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In short, yes.</p>



<p>Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening.</p>



<p>We are taking that into account.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That means you’ll need to watch the television show unravel with a keener eye, as what happens in the series might serve as a nod to what’s <strong>going to happen </strong>in Fallout 5.</p>



<p>It stands to reason that Fallout 5 will be set further in the future than any other game to date. That’s currently an accolade bestowed upon Fallout 4, which is set in 2287, while the television series starts in 2296.</p>



<p>Fans have theorized that Fallout 5 could very well be set around 2300, following the events that are set to unravel in the next few episodes of the Fallout television show, <strong>and beyond</strong>.</p>



<p>This would push Fallout into uncharted territory. History is already written, and in some ways, Bethesda Game Studios going back to the origin of it all with Fallout 76, which is set in 2102, was an error, as it meant some elements of the series’ lore had to be retconned.</p>



<p>With Fallout 5 being (potentially) set after the television series, or even in a parallel timeline, Bethesda has the opportunity to unleash some creative freedom and really push the boat out.</p>



<p>But if we’re being honest, it will most likely be another five years <strong>at least </strong>before we get our hands on anything serviceable in the Fallout 5 stakes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Game Awards 2025 was a resounding success. In a post on social media, show organizer and host Geoff Keighly revealed that the 12th annual show was the most-watched The Game Awards in history.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2001381987278581942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Keighly revealed</a> that there were more than 171 million global livestreams of the full show. That’s an 11% year-over-year increase from the 151 million <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-most-watched-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">livestreams in 2024</a>.</p>







<p>The total count only includes those who watched the full broadcast on the available platforms. It doesn’t include any shorts or clips on the various channels for The Game Awards, nor does it include any data from Prime Video.</p>



<p>Aside from Prime Video—which aired the show for the first time this year—The Game Awards 2025 was available on YouTube, Twitch, Steam, TikTok, Twitter, Kick, Facebook, and Instagram. As far as concurrent viewership goes, Streamcharts, per <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/game-awards-2025-viewing-record-livestreams-worldwide-1236611146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, have the pek number at 4.4 million, which is also higher than 2024’s 4 million total.</p>



<p>There were even 23,000 co-streams of the show on YouTube and Twitch. That’s up 50% compared to last year’s event.</p>







<p>Whether you enjoyed the reveals and the overall awards presentation or not, there’s no denying just how well the show performed and a viewership level. The show was carried by a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number of major reveals</a>, including Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic. As far as the Awards themselves, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-2025-awards-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won in nearly every category</a> it was nominated for. The game even broke the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/">record for the most wins</a> in The Game Awards history with nine awards.</p>
