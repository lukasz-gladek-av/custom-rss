<p>Hell is Us is a brand-new action game headed up by Rogue Factor and supported by Nacon. It’s launching in a busy 2025 period and competing against some real AAA brutes. Nevertheless, if you’re hyped for it, let’s check out the Hell is Us release date and announced start times.</p>



<p>You take the reins of Rémi in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-is-us-release-date-confirmed-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hell is Us</a>. You fight Hollow Walkers, and the supernatural gameplay and storytelling are a major part of the game’s fabric. It leans into the ‘punishing’ aspect of combat, but from what I’ve seen so far, it looks to be infinitely rewarding. With 2025 building up to a stacked climax, Hell is Us has got its work cut out.</p>



<p>I’ve got everything you need to know about Hell is Us’ release date, and start times for major time zones. </p>

<p><strong>Rogue Factor’s Hell is Us is scheduled to release on September 4 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>As I’ve said, September 2025 is a crazy one for gaming releases. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> are just some of the blockbuster launches on the way.</p>



<p>A new IP like Hell is Us is going to have a tough time competing. But if you’re into your action games, chances are this supersedes other releases anyway!</p>



<h2 id="h-hell-is-us-start-times-amp-early-access-launch-information">Hell is Us Start Times &amp; Early Access Launch Information</h2>



<p><strong>We believe Hell is Us Standard Edition goes live at 1 AM PDT on September 4, and early access starts 72 hours ahead of time on September 1.</strong></p>



<p>There’s an early access incentive for Hell is Us. If you choose to do this, you essentially jump the queue by three days. This does require you to shell out even more cash for the Deluxe Edition, though. It all depends on how keen you are for Hell is Us and its release date.</p>



<p>While you contemplate this, here are the release date and start time details across key US time zones, the United Kingdom, and Australia—thanks to the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP6665-PPSA09259_00-HIU0000000000000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/imagine-dragons-interview-last-flag/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/interview-imagine-dragons%E2%80%99-dan-mac-reynolds-talk-%E2%80%98last-flag%E2%80%99-their-upcoming-video-game.1281564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At one point or another, you’ve probably heard an Imagine Dragons song. From “Believer” to “Thunder” to “Radioactive,” the American pop-rock band’s music has dominated the world since 2008 thanks to its catchy beats and powerful lyrics. Their songs have been featured in movies, TV shows, adverts, and even video games. But now, Imagine Dragons brothers, Mac Reynolds, the band’s manager, and Dan Reynolds, lead singer, are taking their creative minds to create their own video game dubbed “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-flag-limited-time-steam-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last Flag</a>“.</p>



<p>Development of Last Flag started sometime in 2020 under the brothers’ newly founded development studio Night Street Games.</p>



<p>Speaking with both Dan and Mac Reynolds, I wanted to know more about this newfound venture, what inspired Last Flag, and where they’d like to take Night Street Games in the future. But first, I was curious about why the brothers wanted to develop a game based on the Capture the Flag game mode and the inspiration behind it. </p>



<p>Mac Reynolds tells me, “The game is actually inspired by real-life capture the&nbsp;flag, which we played a lot as kids. Although we loved the CTF game modes in Unreal Tournament, Quake, and a ton of other games – none of them had that core element of “hide your&nbsp;flag&nbsp;anywhere you want.” There’s something freeing about that component that makes every game different and brings in a little more psychology when you’re sneaking around the map trying to put yourself in the enemy team’s shoes. As soon as we started down that path in development, we knew there was something special and different about it. Since then, it’s been all about how we capture that in a game loop that feels super replayable and fun as a team.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>One of the characters is a Boy Scout, which makes sense because of the game’s inspiration. But what’s the story behind the other characters we see?</strong></p>



<p>Dan Reynolds says, “Each of the contestants has their own reason for auditioning for the show. Some of them are more obvious, but others you really have to dig around as a player to discover. Julius, for example, is a bounty hunter turned author who is looking to promote his new book. Alejandro, our soldier, is trying to draw attention to his sister, who went missing when they were younger. He wears her guitar on his back in hopes she’ll see him on TV and keep her hopes alive. Some people may have more nefarious reasons for being there…”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>I believe the game started development around 2020? How did you go from an idea to actually making the game, and have there been any unforeseen challenges during development?</strong></p>



<p>Mac says, “Making your first game is a little like making your first album – you spend a lot of time in blue sky territory just thinking and planning and tinkering before things start taking shape.&nbsp; You never get that luxury for your second game or album, so we tried to stay unboxed in our ideas for as long as we could.&nbsp; It started with conversations Dan and I had, and then sketches, and even songs and animations Dan made that started to flesh things out.&nbsp; We tried everything from isometric views to fog of war before we found what felt like the right embodiment of all these ideas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There have been plenty of challenges in the dev process.&nbsp; One of these was figuring out how to take something a little chaotic, though lots of fun (hiding the flag anywhere), and give it enough of an objective framework that it doesn’t just feel like luck if you happen on the other flag.&nbsp; A lot of brainstorms with the team and particularly Matthew Berger (our incredible Game Director) led us to the idea of radar towers and other elements which tamed that chaos JUST enough.”</p>



<p><strong>[For Dan] What’s this entire process for you been like compared to writing music? I’ve heard you’re something of a programmer yourself – have you implemented any of those skills into the game?</strong></p>



<p>“I usually write from a pretty vulnerable and autobiographical place, so it was a nice change to just focus on the world of Last Flag and this whole 70s universe when working on the music. It was a pretty collaborative process with myself, Dave Lowmiller (our audio lead who also is in a metal band and did sound for Battlefield), and Grammy-nominated producer JT Daly. A ton of real instruments and time-period-appropriate recording techniques were used. We’re having a lot of fun.</p>



<p>I started taking programming classes online years ago, and it’s really become my outlet when I’m not on stage. I’ve gotten pretty decent at prototyping ideas in Unity, and when we first started Last Flag, that was really our jumping off point until we were able to grow the incredible team of devs we have today.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Now that Last Flag is getting nearer to completion, are the creative juices flowing for some other ideas and the next venture for Night Street Games?</strong></p>



<div><p>Mac says, “Our team has already been pitching ideas for game two to each other, as well as exciting places to take Last Flag in the future. But for now, we’re really trying to focus our creative energy on listening to feedback from our players and never allowing ourselves to feel too comfortable in thinking we know exactly what the perfect version of this game will be. We learn something every day from them, and have plenty of ideas to cultivate and incorporate into the game before we can let our foot off the gas.”</p><p>Dan tells me, “We definitely want to be a multi-game studio, but we know that means doing this first one right. This isn’t a side project for us, so we try to keep a long-term perspective on how we make this first game. We want to be doing this for a very long time.”</p></div>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721340/Last_Flag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last Flag is currently available in a&nbsp;free, limited-time demo on Steam</a> from August 25–September 1&nbsp;as part of Steam’s Third-Person Shooter Fest.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-chrono-storm-event-release-date%E2%80%94exact-start-end-times.1281552/</guid>

<p>Marvel Rivals’ next big event is on the horizon, providing a huge boost to Chrono Tokens earned to help you surge through any owned Battle Passes, and we’ve got all the details.</p>



<p>In the Marvel Rivals Chrono-Storm event, weekly missions, challenges, and season missions provide 2x Chrono Tokens when completed, providing up to 2000 extra, a perfect boost to complete the current Battle Pass ahead of the start of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a>.</p>



<p>As any owned Battle Passes are permanent though, it’s the perfect opportunity to catch up on previous seasons you might not have finished, but be prepared, as the event is only for a limited time.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-marvel-rivals-chrono-storm-event-start">When Does The Marvel Rivals Chrono-Storm Event Start?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Marvel Rivals Chrono-Storm Event kicks off at 2am PT on August 28, landing just in time for the weekend.</strong></p>



<p>With the start of the event right around the corner, I highly recommend pausing any grinds you have going to complete challenges and saving them for the event start. This way, you can benefit from the bonus Chrono Tokens that will be distributed.</p>



<p>Of course, if you have a long list of challenges to complete, you may as well crack on, as the amount of bonus tokens you can earn is capped at 2000.</p>



<p>Here’s when the Chrono-Storm event begins in time zones across the world.</p>

<h2 id="h-when-does-the-marvel-rivals-chrono-storm-event-end">When Does The Marvel Rivals Chrono-Storm Event End?</h2>



<p><strong>The Chrono-Storm Event in Marvel Rivals is confirmed to end at 1:59am PT on September 12, ahead of the launch of the newest season.</strong></p>



<p>Though details for Season 4 are not confirmed, a <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1960364095133061345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on social media</a> announcing the end date for the event drops a huge hint that this is when downtime ahead of the launch will commence.</p>

<p>Despite comments suggesting that Battlefield 6 will ‘boot stomp’ Call of Duty this year, many believe the impending conflict between Black Ops 7 and EA’s new Battlefield title has already been decided. In a recent report published as part of the Alinea Analytics newsletter, it was suggested that Black Ops 7 will outsell Battlefield because of consumer habits and nothing more.</p>



<p>The report spoke of ‘autopilot purchasing’, with Call of Duty fans buying the new release year in, year out, even if they’re displeased with the offering. That’s why Battlefield 6 won’t ‘win’ this year.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-battlefield-6-beat-call-of-duty">Can Battlefield 6 Beat Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>The recent <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Insight newsletter</a> discussed whether Battlefield 6 could stand firm as a ‘COD killer’, a term that has been lobbied a lot in recent years. Once upon a time, XDefiant was poised as a COD killer, and we all know how that went…</p>



<p>Alinea’s expert analysts pulled a number out of the hat, revealing that 60% of beta-based wishlisters of Battlefield 6 have played a Call of Duty game on Steam, which is a damning enough number right out the gate. The team admitted that Battlefield 6 could do better than any other game in franchise history, but it still won’t be enough to topple Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Rhys Elliott of Alinea put it perfectly in the report:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>COD<strong>&nbsp;is still dominant despite all this</strong>. Its core audience still loves the game and buys it every damn year. And that isn’t going to change just because&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;is rad and tracking incredibly well.</p>



<p>For many gamers,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;is an annual ritual. Tens of millions of players, many of them casual gamers, buy the newest&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>&nbsp;every year without hesitation. This “autopilot purchasing” habit is decades deep, and breaking it requires more than one awesome&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>&nbsp;release.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elliott went on to explain ‘that&nbsp;<strong>players will buy it even if they complain about it</strong>.’ It also doesn’t help Battlefield’s situation that Black Ops 7 is guaranteed to be a day-one title on the Xbox Game Pass subscription service. When Black Ops 6 was released on Game Pass last year, it was the single biggest day for new subscriptions on the platform.</p>



<p>I’m of the standpoint that Battlefield 6 <strong>doesn’t need to beat Black Ops 7. </strong>I’m more than comfortable with both games existing alongside each other, and even Battlefield’s developers stressed the same thing. They serve unique demographics in a few ways, and I’ll play both and make my mind up later as to which I prefer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently announced that Atari has formed a strategic IP agreement with Ubisoft to revitalize <strong>five forgotten games</strong>. The deal was inked recently, and it was confirmed that Atari will re-release these games under the new publishing arm that the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atari-revive-infogrames/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought back to life</a> in April 2024.</p>



<p>The five games now owned by Atari will likely provide a nostalgia hit for Ubisoft fans.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-ubisoft-games-does-atari-own">What Ubisoft Games Does Atari Own?</h2>



<p>Atari has secured the IP rights for five <strong>Ubisoft </strong>games:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cold Fear (2005)</li>



<li>I Am Alive (2012)</li>



<li>Child of Eden (2011)</li>



<li>Grow Home (2015)</li>



<li>Grow Up (2016)</li>
</ul>



<p>I’m particularly excited about I Am Alive, a 2012 blink-and-you’ll-miss-it post-apocalyptic survival game pieced together primarily by Ubisoft Shanghai and Darkworks, a studio that also worked on Cold Fear, which sadly closed its doors in 2011.</p>



<p>I Am Alive wasn’t an award-winning game by any means, but it offered players a perspective of a shattered world with a moral lens overlay. It took a whopping seven years to develop the game, and when it was done, it offered just a few hours of gameplay on a digital-only release.</p>



<p>I’ve always been eager for a follow-up to I Am Alive, which I feel is a criminally underrated game. Here’s a trailer for the title:</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250826081788/en/Atari-Announces-Strategic-IP-Agreement-With-Ubisoft-To-Revive-Five-Acclaimed-Titles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a> on the new IP deal, Ubisoft’s Deborah Papiernik, VP of New Business, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Millions of players have experienced these worlds over the years, and this will open the door for long time players to revisit those memories while inviting new audiences to discover them for the first time.</p>



<p>Atari has a rich gaming legacy and deep appreciation for these classic titles, we’re excited to see how they’ll evolve and connect with players in fresh, meaningful ways.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the sentiment was Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft and Atari both have a legacy of crafting worlds that players can fall in love with — games that resonate with generations of players not just for how they played, but for how they made us feel.</p>



<p>We’re excited to reintroduce these titles while also exploring ways to expand and evolve these franchises.</p>

<p>EA Sports is back with NHL 26, the latest installment of the long-running hockey franchise. As with any new release, NHL 26 features a number of trophies and achievements to unlock for all of the completionist who’ll boot up the game. </p>



<p>When it comes to sports games, earning achievements is a bit different than story-focused titles. These games reward you for winning games and championships, completing tasks in various game modes, scoring certain types of goals, and more.  </p>



<p>So, without any more delay, let’s get into everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-nhl-26-trophy-and-achievement">How To Get Every NHL 26 Trophy And Achievement</h2>

The challenges range from winning a Champions Hockey League trophy in Be A Pro to simply assigning a scout to the CHL in Franchise mode. If you want to 100% the game, you’ll have to play every mode in the game, including online modes like World of Chel and Hockey Ultimate Team.</p>



<p>You can check out all of the trophies and how to earn them below courtesy of <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/36114-nhl-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSN Profiles</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-nhl-26-secret-trophies">NHL 26 Secret Trophies</h2>



<p>Unlike fellow EA Sports title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-madden-26-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>, NHL 26 has no secret trophies to unlock this year. All 49 of the achievements can be seen when you load up the game on Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 5.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-and-trophies-are-in-nhl-26">How Many Achievements And Trophies Are In NHL 26?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 49 trophies and achievements to unlock in NHL 26.</strong></p>



<p>Looking further shows that there are 34 bronze trophies, 12 silver, two gold, and one platinum trophy to unlock. Compared to NHL 25, there are two less total trophies and achievements this time around. There are four less bronze trophies, but two more silver.</p>



<p>As far as unlocking them is concerned, they are all pretty straight forward. Most can be done in various single-player modes. Others, however, require you to play online against other players such as winning a Ones Eliminator Tournament in the World of Chel.</p>
