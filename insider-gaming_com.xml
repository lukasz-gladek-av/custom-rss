<p>Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov has posted a series of images on social media showcasing Terminal, the potential final map in Escape from Tarkov. For months, talk about the spearhead extraction shooter has been centred around the last step that players are waiting for – the ability to <strong>escape </strong>from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Alongside the images, which showcase a dark and brooding map, Buyanov wrote: ‘The place where it all ends?’</p>

<h2 id="h-the-end-of-all-things">The End of All Things</h2>



<p>When Escape from Tarkov finally hits a 1.0 release, it’ll be delivered with the ability to finally escape from Tarkov. That has been the goal for the last decade or so, and it’ll be a way to finally ‘complete’ the game.</p>



<p>The ultimate endgame objective was teased today on social media by Nikita Buyanov, the head honcho at Battlestate Games:</p>

<p>Escaping from Tarkov is something that has only ever been possible by powering down and stepping away from the desk – but soon, players will be able to do that after firmly completing the game. The only issue is that we have no idea what that’ll look like. Could it be some kind of ‘prestige’ system, allowing players to complete the game over and over again to earn new rewards?</p>



<p>Nobody knows.</p>



<p>The images showcased by Buyanov don’t reveal too much. It’s an industrial area, which we knew already based on the ‘port’ setting on the map, but something that’s never been seen before is a <strong>submarine </strong>docked in the port. Players have already theorised that’s how we’ll finally escape from Tarkov. </p>
