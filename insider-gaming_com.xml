<p>Hideo Kojima has revealed that if it weren’t for Super Mario Bros, he might not be in the gaming industry. </p>



<p>Hideo Kojima is one of the most prolific game directors in the industry, with popular game series like Metal Gear, Death Stranding, and more under his belt. But even he has gone through numerous traditional job interviews before reaching his current position. <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-revealed-who-inspired-him-to-start-making-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An HR director</a> sparked his entry into the games industry</span>, and now, Kojima has revealed the game that inspired him to pursue a career in game development and delve deeper into this medium.</p>







<h2 id="h-super-mario-bros-is-the-game-hideo-kojima-has-played-the-most">Super Mario Bros is the Game Hideo Kojima has Played the Most</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Ah5VQrzvA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WIRED</a> on YouTube (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/without-super-mario-bros-hideo-kojima-probably-wouldnt-have-become-a-game-dev-when-i-saw-that-i-felt-this-medium-would-one-day-surpass-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Hideo Kojima discussed his relationship with Super Mario Bros. and how it was instrumental in getting him interested in gaming. Kojima revealed that Super Mario Bros. is ‘definitely’ the game he has played the most. He played the game for a year while in college, and he skipped school to stay home and play it. </p>



<p>Kojima added that ‘without Super Mario,’ he probably wouldn’t be part of the gaming industry. The game director added that he wouldn’t really play the game today, noting that it is a side-scrolling action game that basically just involves jumping. But when you add the dash button, it brings subtle changes to jumping, changing its trajectory while attacking or dodging. </p>



<p>He spoke about how Super Mario Bros. has almost no story, yet it still feels like the player is on an adventure. After seeing that the game was “pixel art with no story,” Kojima felt that the gaming medium “would one day surpass movies,” and this conviction brought him to the gaming industry. </p>

<p>Helldivers 2 recently discussed their ‘plans’ to extend vehicle gameplay and bring back some vehicles from the previous game. </p>



<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has been hard at work addressing Helldivers 2’s performance woes, recently reducing the game’s PC file size <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-pc-file-size-reduced-by-85-slim-version-now-available-in-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by 85%</a>. They are simultaneously working on new content as well, such as a prototype of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-are-working-on-a-rogue-lite-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rogue-lite mode</a>, along with ways to improve gameplay. The game’s design director recently spoke about vehicle gameplay. </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-may-get-some-vehicles-from-the-original-game">Helldivers 2 May Get Some Vehicles from the Original Game</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-exosuit-mech-vehicle-gameplay-expansion-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, during the latest episode of ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n4kiFv_gyg&amp;t=1110s&amp;pp=0gcJCU0KAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Democratic Conversation</a>‘ on the Helldivers 2’s YouTube channel, the game’s design director, Niklas Malmborg, spoke about vehicle gameplay when asked about extending the duration of exosuit mechs. Malmborg stated, “We have plans, we are looking at extending vehicle gameplay.” </p>



<p>The design director added that players might remember that the previous Helldivers game had “loads more vehicles”, and maybe not all of them, but “it would be fun to bring back some of them”. He also spoke about looking into “how much you can do with vehicles, and all the nooks and crannies of it.” Malmborg stated, “not guaranteeing” players will be able to, as it works like a temporary buff, but it could include reloading and repairing. </p>



<p>The developer didn’t go into too much detail, but did state that “we are definitely experimenting” and that many other devs in the studio want this kind of stuff. “So if we can make good gameplay with it, we will definitely look into it,” said Malmborg. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Arena Breakout Infinite Finally Getting Proximity Chat, Team Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-proximity-chat-coming/</link>
            <guid>1390102</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>MOREFUN, the developer behind Arena Breakout Infinite, has confirmed that proximity chat is finally in the works. This revelation comes more than a year after the game hit the market, and after months upon months of fans clamouring for the feature to be added.</p>



<p>In the world of extraction shooters, proximity chat is often seen as a <strong>must-have </strong>mechanic. It allows users to team up, beg for their lives, or trash-talk opponents during high-stakes, intense battles. The fact that it has never been added to Arena Breakout Infinite has always been viewed as something of an injustice.</p>



<h2 id="h-proximity-chat-brings-players-closer-together">Proximity Chat Brings Players Closer Together</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Enzo Zhang, the head of the studio at MOREFUN, <a href="https://x.com/Realenzozhang/status/2003105736549896607">revealed that the team</a> is ‘on it now’ when it comes to proximity chat. The central profile for Arena Breakout Infinite followed that up minutes later by saying that the community has been ‘heard’.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to celebrate the move in their responses to the two posts. One wrote, ‘Holy shit finally, that’s gonna be sick,’ while another stressed, ‘Here come teams teaming up to wipe the lobbies.’</p>



<p>Some users were curious about the logistics of proximity chat in Arena Breakout Infinite. One asked:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to know more about how this will work. Specifically, will players be able to turn up music (or something similar) at full volume to block enemy hearing during a raid?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This kind of thing has been rendered punishable in other games. For instance, Escape from Tarkov’s rules of play state that doing that very thing to disrupt other players is something you can legitimately be reported for.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The concept of proximity chat has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. The inclusion of the mechanic often makes for very entertaining sequences for streamers who regularly engage with the folks they meet in-game. This has become more prevalent since the launch of games like ARC Raiders.</p>
