            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios is bringing serious competition to the extraction shooter genre in 2025 with ARC Raiders. The futuristic shooter has all the hallmarks of a classic PvPvE experience, and it would score more points if it were free to play and didn’t have a price to pay. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-steams-most-popular-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders became Steam’s most popular Extraction Shooter</a> with the release of its final test phase before launch—the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-final-open-beta-server-slam-test-start-date-how-to-play-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta Server Slam Test</a>. Developer Embark Studios (known for The Finals) has worked very hard to ensure it learns from its mistakes and stands a chance of survival at release.</p>



<p>One way to get more people on board is to make ARC Raiders free-to-play. Foregoing a price might be a financial gamble, but there would be benefits. Let’s raid the information cabinet for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-arc-raiders-free-to-play">Is ARC Raiders Free-to-Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nothing is free in this world. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders will not be a free-to-play online multiplayer experience, and you will have to pay an initial one-time fee to set foot in Speranza and beyond!</strong></p>



<p>There’s a definite line in the sand when it comes to online shooters now: Those that are free-to-play, and those that want a fee upfront. Naturally, games like Concord have only stoked the fires of the debate more. When you have a Warzone, a Fortnite, a Marvel Rivals, or an Apex Legends charging nothing to play the base game, it’s only natural to question if other new releases should follow suit.</p>



<p>However, EA and Embark Studios have decided against making ARC Raiders free-to-play. It doesn’t mean it won’t make the transition in the future, but for now, you need to dip into your pockets to play it.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-price-explained">ARC Raiders Price, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The base edition of ARC Raiders costs $39.99 or £30.99, whereas you need to stump up $59.99 or £49.99 for the more expensive Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, you don’t need to buy the upgraded version, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-deluxe-edition-content-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deluxe Edition content and bonus rewards</a> are pretty tempting. The Standard Edition offers the thing you’re after the most—the game. If you go early, you might even be able to get your hands on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-pre-order-bonuses-revealed-prices-explained/">ARC Raiders pre-order bonuses</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-might-be-on-ice-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-9-remake-might-be-%E2%80%98on-ice%E2%80%99-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1329331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable insider has speculated that development of the Final Fantasy 9 Remake may have been put on hold for the time being. </p>



<p>Final Fantasy 9 Remake’s development has gone through several significant hurdles since we first heard about it. Most recently, we were told earlier this year that the game’s development is ‘in trouble’ and there’s a chance of it being cancelled. Now, more news that fans will not be happy about has surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-9-remake-s-future-is-unknown">Final Fantasy 9 Remake’s Future is Unknown</h2>



<p>Recently, NateTheHate was asked on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1979261183820431479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) whether he had heard anything new about Final Fantasy 9 Remake’s plans. The insider replied that, for now, he assumes “the game is on ice” and that development may have been paused for the title. Moreover, the post states that it is “unknown” whether Square Enix will decide to “return to it or not.” Seems like Final Fantasy 9’s remake is in real trouble. </p>



<p>Things seemed to be looking bright for Final Fantasy 9 Remake earlier this year, when rumours started to heat up with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-rumors-heat-up-with-new-ff9-website-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new website launch</a> for the 25th Anniversary. A few days later, it seemed like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-seemingly-teased-by-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix was also teasing the title</a>, as they posted a quote from the original game’s ending. However, since then we have only been receiving bad news, with it seeming like FF9 remake will never see the light of day. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Twin Pack Physical Edition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-twin-pack-physical-edition-pre-orders-now-available-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-orders are now available</a> for PlayStation 5. Additionally, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part’s development <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-development-unaffected-by-xboxs-lack-of-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains unaffected</a> by Xbox’s lack of memory.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-to-beat-ninja-gaiden-4-game-length/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-long-to-beat-ninja-gaiden-4-game-length-explained.1329277/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is anything but a pushover. Team Ninja has once again concocted another brutal affair, sure to have you pulling out your hair for hours. If you’re wondering how many hours exactly, we can run through Ninja Gaiden 4’s game length and expected playtime for you.</p>



<p>Team Ninja finally returned to its legendary franchise after a few years away. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> carries on Ryu Hayabusa’s journey and brings back the PTSD instilled by over 30 years of almost hilariously difficult NG games. Don’t get it twisted, we welcome the challenge, and NG games offer a level of challenge not even some Souls games can match!</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 looks to be a violent return to form. If you’re curious as to how much content is in the game, we’ve got all the answers you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-ninja-gaiden-4">How Many Hours To Beat Ninja Gaiden 4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How long can you endure? Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Ninja Director Masakazu Hirayama has said an initial playthrough on normal difficulty should take you “15 to 20 hours.”</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, Ninja Gaiden 4 on a ‘normal’ difficulty is the equivalent of other games essentially being on hard—on steroids. Your mileage will vary when it comes to Hirayama’s window—through <a href="https://next-play.com.au/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-preview-and-development-team-interview-meeting-yakumo-ryus-return-new-weapons-dlc-plans-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NextPlay</a>. If you’re well-versed in hack ‘n’ slash games and used to the difficulty of every combat encounter, then this is a realistic timeframe.</p>



<p>If you’re unfamiliar with Ninja Gaiden and intense action games such as these, your runtime might lean toward the 20-hour window, and <em>beyond</em>. Whereas if you make use of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-disgusting-levels-of-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NG 4’s difficulty settings</a>, you might even clock in at just under 15 hours!</p>



<p>There’s plenty of choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-ninja-gaiden-4-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Ninja Gaiden 4 Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>A completionist run of Ninja Gaiden 4 could feasibly take you 50-100 hours-plus, and there’s a good chance that most people will never be able to complete Ninja Gaiden 4 at all!</strong></p>



<p>If we’re talking about doing everything in Nnja Gaiden 4, this means beating all the extra Missions, Challenges, achieving full weapon mastery, and beating all difficulty levels.</p>



<p>The reason this can take upwards of 100 hours—borderline until the end of time itself—is because of Master Ninja mode. If you go through the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4 trophy list</a>, you’ll see that “Way of the Master Ninja” requires you to “Complete the game on MASTER NINJA difficulty.”</p>



<p>If this is anything like previous games, expect enemies to kill you in barely any hits, insta-kill you with grab attacks, and attack you whilst you’re attacking other enemies—and even if you’re in the air! It’s beyond brutal. It’s sadistic, but a sickeningly good time for Ninja Gaiden enthusiasts.</p>
