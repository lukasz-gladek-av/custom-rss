<p>New Black Myth: Zhong Kui is an in-engine video where the devs have literally and figuratively cooked. </p>



<p>The next title for the highly popular series by Game Science, Black Myth: Zhong Kui, was revealed during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-zhongkui-revealed-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025’s Opening Night Live</a>. The title is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-myth-zhong-kui-a-sequel-to-black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a direct sequel</a> to the series, but shares &nbsp;“the same foundation of ancient Chinese myth and folklore.” Now, a new in-engine video shows what the game could look like. </p>







<h2 id="h-black-myth-zhong-kui-video-goes-full-masterchef-with-monster-ingredients">Black Myth: Zhong Kui Video Goes Full MasterChef with Monster Ingredients</h2>



<p>The latest video for Black Myth: Zhong Kui is a 6-minute in-engine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2tW6ewI5ls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">special</a> created for the Chinese New Year, specifically celebrating the Year of the Horse. The video begins like a typical cooking show, showcasing the character chopping and preparing various ingredients. It starts with the featured character filleting a fish, setting the tone for the cooking theme.</p>



<p>Everything appears normal at first, but then we begin to notice monsters lurking in the background. These creatures are actually assisting the chef. Some scenes in the video may be unsettling for those with a weak stomach, as we see the chef chopping up meat with eyeballs and plucking chives from a creature that resembles a sleeping baby.</p>



<p>The soup is finally prepared and served to a mysterious figure wearing a hood towards the end of the video. What’s exciting is the level of detail and realism displayed by the engine, particularly in how the character interacts with each ingredient. We already knew that Game Science had raised the bar since “Wukong,” but “Zhong Kui” appears to be advancing the series even further in terms of visuals.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds producer has revealed that a new large-scale expansion is in development, matching the likes of Iceborne and Sunbreak expansions for previous games. </p>



<p>Since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-4-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">title update 4</a>, we haven’t received many new details about the game. Last we heard was information through a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-datamine-reveals-graphics-presets-for-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">datamine</a>, which gave us an idea of the graphic preset details for the Switch 2. Now, the developers have arrived with a brand-new update, along with confirmation that a huge expansion is in the works. </p>







<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-new-expansion-confirmed">Monster Hunter Wilds New Expansion Confirmed</h2>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto spoke about the “large-scale expansion” at the end of the update 1.041’s reveal <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/2021026692781965533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a>. Tsujimoto wanted to assure players that they have something big planned next for MHW, a new expansion is in development, matching the likes of MH Worlds’ Iceborne and MH Rise’s Subreak expansion. More details about this update are scheduled to arrive “this summer.”</p>

<p>Iceborne and Sunbreak are some of the biggest expansions in the series. Iceborne almost doubled the content for Monster Hunter World, adding new monsters, story, locales, and so much more. Sunbreak was massive as well, adding a new adventure, enemies, gameplay improvements, and more. So the one for MHW definitely has some work cut out for it, as it has to surpass some huge benchmarks. </p>

<p>Along with the announcement for the expansion, the Monster Hunter Wilds producer also took us through the upcoming update. The highlights include the arrival of 10-star Arch-tempered Arkveld, quests for grabbing weapon designs that won in a contest, a collab side mission with Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, extra side missions, and more. Check out the patch notes <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/update/ver_01_4_1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> and the Monster Hunter Wilds roadmap for February and March events below: </p>
