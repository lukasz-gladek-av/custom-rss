<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 has been rated by The Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1894415561662120432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kurakasis</a> (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-rated-in-singapore-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>), if you head over to the Singaporean ratings <a href="https://imdaonline.imda.gov.sg/Classification/Search/VideoGames/SearchDetail.aspx?sTitle=IDX/2502/000036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will see that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 has been rated ‘General’ and has been ‘approved’ for the region, with the year release section stating ‘2025’. The website also reveals which platforms the game has been rated for, including PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talks about a new Tony Hawks remake game have been making the rounds all week, starting with Professional skateboarder <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-remaster-is-coming-skater-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyshawn Jones’ comments</a>, which pointed specifically towards an upcoming remaster. An industry insider later stated that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 remaster will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow-dropped at the Xbox Summer Games Showcase</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn’t stop there; just a few days after, the game received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-gets-another-major-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another major tease</a>, this time through a game from the same publisher, Activision. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s Grind map features a logo reminiscent of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2, and within the logo is a number, 03.04.25, that could be teasing the arrival of the next remaster. With all the news and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 rating being spotted in Singapore, an official announcement could arrive soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xbox has announced that Fable has been delayed into 2026. The announcement comes via Xbox Studios head Craig Duncan during an episode of the official Xbox podcast.</p>



<p>“We previously announced Fable as 2025,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r1t_oDC7z8&amp;t=853s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Duncan said</a> while talking about his excitement for where the game is. “We are actually going to give Fable more time. It’s going to ship in 2026 now. While I know that’s not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want is to assure people that it’s definitely worth the wait.”</p>



<p>Duncan added: “I just have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team. If you think about their history and legacy for Forza Horizon—the last two games critically acclaimed…and just what they’re bringing to Fable as a franchise, just think of the visuals of what you expect of Playground Games plus amazing gameplay.”</p>



<p>Lastly, Duncan said the new Fable is the “most beautifully realized version of Albion” players have ever seen.</p>



<p>Fable was officially announced in 2020 but didn’t get its first proper trailer until 2023. The game’s 2025 release window was announced in June 2024.</p>



<p>As far as a more specific release window for 2026, that information wasn’t revealed.</p>

<p>Microsoft continues to bring a wealth of old and new titles to Xbox Game Pass, and Balatro continues to be the talk of the town over a year after its release. Here’s the latest update on the roguelike card game being introduced to a hungry public.</p>



<p>Balatro sucked me in within minutes of playing. It’s the kind of game that is instantly accessible but takes a <em>long </em>time to master. The concept of juggling Jokers and collecting cards is overwhelming at first. But it gets easier as time goes and Balatro’s core gameplay loop feeds on your time like a leech.</p>



<p>It’s won countless Game of the Year awards and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-has-announced-its-sold-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 5 million copies</a>. If you’ve not had the chance to play Balatro yet, let’s see if you can through Xbox Game Pass.</p>
