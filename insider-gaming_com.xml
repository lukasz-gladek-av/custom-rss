<p>Plenty of details have been revealed by Nintendo for the upcoming Pokémon Pokopia title, though the most intriguing is the mysterious variants of popular Pokémon.</p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on March 4, 2026</a>, for Nintendo Switch 2, though the game will also be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-will-be-available-on-original-nintendo-switch-sort-of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable in a specific way on the original console</a>, and tasks players, playing as a humanoid Ditto, with restoring a barren environment to attract Pokémon to the region.</p>



<p>While new gameplay mechanics were showcased, showing the game will very much be akin to the Animal Crossing franchise, new variants of Pikachu and Snorlax were shown at the end of the new trailer, raising plenty of questions.</p>

<p>The extended trailer for Pokémon Pokopia, November 13, featured the emergence of a mysterious, monotone Pikachu, appearing almost ghostlike, before the camera zoomed in on a Snorlax covered in moss from head to toe.</p>



<p>Though the trailer itself didn’t showcase too many details, Pokémon’s <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/New-Details-Revealed-for-Relaxing-Life-Simulation-Game-Pokemon-Pokopia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official press site</a> had slightly more information about the ‘peculiar  Pokémon’, including that the pair are called Peakychu and Mosslax, respectively.</p>



<p>The duo, along with Professor Tangrowth, who was seen extensively in the trailer, and Smearguru, a variant of Smeargle, will be encounterable in Pokémon Pokopia—but it’s not clear in what capacity they will appear, nor do we know if they are variant species.</p>







<p>More will surely be revealed on Pokémon Day next year, which takes place just before the release of Pokémon Pokopia and will launch celebrations of the franchise’s 30th anniversary, so we’ll have to be patient until then.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Pokopia Will be Available on Original Nintendo Switch, Sort of]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-will-be-available-on-original-nintendo-switch-sort-of/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-pokopia-will-be-available-on-original-nintendo-switch-sort-of.1352611/</guid>

<p>Fresh details have been revealed for Pokémon Pokopia,&nbsp;and, while the game is advertised as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, it will be available to play on the original Nintendo Switch—with a catch.</p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on March 4, 2026</a>, shortly after Pokémon Day celebrates 30 years of the franchise, and it could be one of a few major Pokémon titles releasing next year.</p>



<p>Initially revealed in September’s Nintendo Presents, Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;is a fresh twist for the franchise with a new style of game, and it turns out that original Switch players won’t be left out after all.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDh6COB0Nqk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">extended trailer</a> for Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;released by Nintendo, it was announced the title will support Gameshare, and that the feature would allow players on Nintendo Switch to join the fun.</p>



<p>However, the title will not be able to be purchased on the original Nintendo Switch. Instead, the only way to play on the older generation of the console will be through the Gameshare feature with somebody nearby using a Nintendo Switch 2 hosting the game.</p>



<p>In small print for the GameShare feature on the trailer, Nintendo states that games “can only be played during that GameShare session” and “up to two players can play via GameShare simultaneously.” Crucially, it’s added that “Nintendo Switch 2 system(s) must initiate a GameShare session.”</p>



<p>To access the GameShare feature, a Nintendo Switch Online membership and Nintendo Account are required on both devices, and the progress will be saved on the host’s world. There’s no ability for a player on the original Nintendo Switch to save any progress from the session.</p>







<p>Although perhaps not the news original Nintendo Switch players had hoped for, it does open the door slightly for players to get a feel for Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;if a friend or relative owns the game before splashing out for the title and a Nintendo Switch 2 console themselves.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-senior-vice-president-says-the-ps5s-biggest-title-is-still-to-come/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-senior-vice-president-says-the-ps5%E2%80%99s-biggest-title-is-still-to-come.1352542/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The PS5’s best-selling catalog is a who’s who of AAA royalty. But PlayStation Senior Vice President Eric Lempel has effectively put the PS5 community on standby by declaring the best-selling game is still to come.</p>



<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, Ghost of Yotei, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shuhei-yoshida-absolutely-wanted-stellar-blade-on-playstation-after-playing-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade</a> barely scratch the surface of games that shipped several million copies on PS5. Sony’s newest hardware has proven to be another hall-of-fame-worthy hardware hero. With more big games still to come, Eric Lempel thinks the PS5 console’s future is bright and sunny, and hasn’t even begun to peak.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-ps5-s-biggest-release-hasn-t-happened-yet-says-playstation-svp">The PS5’s Biggest Release Hasn’t Happened Yet, Says PlayStation SVP</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Astro Bot is one of many success stories. Credit to PlayStation</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ve likely heard the name Eric Lempel at some point, as the current Senior Vice President at PlayStation has been with the company for over 25 years.</p>



<p>They sat down to speak to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy7e352emrro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a> in celebration of the PS5’s fifth anniversary. The console—and Pro models—have now surpassed ‘More than 84 million units worldwide,’ meaning this generation is slowly closing in on the PlayStation 4, slowly but surely.</p>







<p>Lempel said that Sony and PlayStation are “Really hitting our stride now” and that “A lot of great content” is still to come. The most eye-catching part of the interview is when Lempel revealed that the PS5’s best-selling game hasn’t even been revealed yet.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I’m not going to tell you which one, but I think it’s still to come,” </strong>he said.<strong>“</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, this could literally be anything, in reality. We know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolverine</a> is moving along nicely in its development and could be a huge first-party winner. More big-time exclusives could be in the pipeline, or it could be a careful—but realistic way—of saying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-delay-could-impact-halo-remake-gears-e-day-next-call-of-duty/">GTA 6</a> will be the mystery title. Again, it’s unclear if he means first-party or third-party games.</p>



<p>If it’s intended as first-party, then this will likely get people talking about what other surprises PlayStation has up its sleeves. Uncharted? The Last of Us? Killzone? God of War? Your guess is as good as ours.
