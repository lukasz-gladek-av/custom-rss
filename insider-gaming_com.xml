<p>Nintendo has announced that two more Nintendo 64 (N64) games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online in December.</p>



<p>In a trailer posted on Wednesday, it was revealed that Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Tonic Trouble will be available for subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.</p>







<p>Rayman 2: The Great Escape was released in 1999 for the N64, PlayStation, Sega Dreamcast, and PC. It’s the sequel to highly popular Rayman, which first launched for PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Atari Jaguar, and PC in 1995.</p>



<p>Tonic Trouble was also released in 1999, but was only available on N64 and PC. It follows an alien named Ed who has to come to Earth in order to stop Grögh from taking over the planet. </p>



<p>Both games are set to be available starting December 17 on both the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2. You can check out the trailer for the games, below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK) intends to have Rockstar Games investigated for alleged union busting. </p>



<p>During Wednesday’s UK Parliament session, MP Chris Murray asked Prime Minister Kier Starmer about the allegations. Murray said that after meeting with Rockstar over the firings, the company “failed to reassure me they are following employment law and I share concerns about union busting.”</p>







<p>He then asked Starmer if he agrees that <strong>“all companies regardless of profit size must follow UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union.”</strong></p>



<p>Starmer responded by saying that it’s a “deeply concerning case”.</p>



<p><strong>“Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we’re determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don’t face unfair consequences for being part of a union,” </strong>he said. <strong>“Our ministers will look into the particular case that he [Murray] raises and will keep him updated.”</strong></p>



<p>In October, it was reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-workers-fired-prevent-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 30 employees</a> were fired from Rockstar. Immediately, employees and the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claimed it was a “blatant and ruthless” act of union busting. Rockstar, however, denied that claim, saying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employees were fired</a> for <strong>“gross negligence”</strong> after finding that they were <strong>“distributing and discussing confidential information”.</strong></p>







<p>Not long after that, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaked-discord-messages-reveal-why-rockstar-fired-34-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked Discord messages</a> suggest that the information being shared involved discussions of new company policies with other employees, among other messages. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out multiple times to Rockstar for official comment on the claims. As of writing, no responses have been received.</p>



<p>What do you think about the situation with Rockstar and its potential union busting now being investigated by the UK government?

</p></figure>



<p>At Gamescom earlier this year, Insider Gaming got hands-on with the game, calling it “familiar, but entirely different” thanks to the series’ new setting. You can read our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full hands-on preview of Hell Let Loose: Vietnam here</a>.</p>



<p>From our perspective, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is going to be an unforgettable entry into the Hell Let Loose franchise, giving players a fresh and immersive gaming experience that is often overlooked in the first-person shooter scene.</p>



<p><strong>Game features:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Welcome to the Jungle – You and your fellow soldiers will be thrown into dramatic terrains and engage in warfare across 6 new Vietnam maps, featuring dense jungle, twisting deltas, and open clearings that offer unique tactical challenges.</li>



<li>Aerial Units – Allowing&nbsp;fully&nbsp;operational helicopters&nbsp;for troop deployment and fire support.&nbsp;&nbsp;These units play a pivotal role in transporting soldiers to landing zones,&nbsp;delivering supplies to the team in tactical locations,&nbsp;conducting&nbsp;reconnaissance,&nbsp;and offering aerial firepower.</li>



<li>Patrol boats&nbsp;– Take control of heavily armed vessels, such as&nbsp;the iconic U.S. patrol boat, the PBR.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Tunnels –&nbsp;The North Vietnamese forces can construct extensive tunnel networks, offering strategic advantages for surprise attacks and troop movements. This means that mastering tactics will become essential to winning the battle.​&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The Holiday season allows everyone to let off some Steam at the end of the year. Steam Wrapped 2025 is the next-best day outside of Christmas, and it’s a time to rejoice at your year-long Steam stats.</p>



<p>Ever wondered how many games you’ve bought in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-deals-holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> sales? How many hours have you spent in front of your monitor or Steam Deck? Well, Steam Replay 2025 wraps up all of this information into one handy showcase for you.</p>







<h2 id="h-steam-replay-2025-expected-release-date">Steam Replay 2025 Expected Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Steam</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>History suggests the 2025 Steam Replay will release on Thursday, December 18, as this lines up with the last couple of iterations of Steam’s Wrapped.</strong></p>



<p>If you ignore the slight outlier of Steam Replay 2022—made available to all users on December 26—and consider the last two incarnations, the proof is pretty much in the pudding present.</p>







<p>Steam Replay 2023 came out on Monday, December 18, and the year after, the 2024 replay was on Wednesday, December 18. You can see where Insider Gaming is going with this, but logic dictates that the date is the same for the last two years, so why would Steam break a winning habit?</p>



<p>Unless something weird happens or Steam has a Half-Life-sized facility meltdown, Thursday, December 18, seems like a reasonable assumption. Keep checking back on the day to see when Steam Replay 2025 is out.</p>
