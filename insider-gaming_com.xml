<p>Marathon developers have confirmed that players will not need a PSN account to play the game on PC and Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-doesn-t-require-psn-on-xbox-and-pc">Marathon Doesn’t Require PSN on Xbox and PC</h2>



<p>With Marathon being a Sony-backed project, many players worried they might need a PSN account to play the game on other platforms. However, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-wont-require-a-playstation-network-account-on-pc-and-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> spotted, Bungie has removed these worries through a message on the game’s official Discord channel. The developers have explicitly stated, “Marathon will not require a PlayStation Account for players on PC and Xbox.”</p>



<p>Several of PlayStation’s initial releases on PC came with a PSN account requirement. Many might remember the whole <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/negative-helldivers-2-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review-bombing fiasco with Helldivers 2</a> when it was released on Steam in early 2024. Since then, PlayStation has learned that players on other platforms do not wish to use a PSN account and have made the sign-up optional and also tried to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-will-incentive-users-with-psn-accounts-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incentivise </a>it for their recent releases like The Last of Us 2 Remastered, God of War Ragnarök and more. And now, with the latest confirmation, Marathon can be added to the list of games that don’t require a PSN account.</p>



<p>Marathon has been under wraps since its initial reveal, but players will finally learn more about the game on April 12. Bungie has announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-gameplay-reveal-showcase-announced-for-april-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay reveal showcase</a> for their upcoming PvP extraction shooter. In 2023, Insider Gaming exclusively revealed how <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the loot system</a> works in the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-was-announced-3-years-ago-today-and-i-forgot-it-existed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Square Enix celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Kingdom Hearts series in 2022. Kingdom Hearts 4 was unveiled during the special presentation, showing us how glorious a next-gen KH could look, but the project has gone quiet since.</p>



<p>I have played Kingdom Hearts 1 to death, and it’s one of my favourite games ever. Sequels have grabbed my attention, but a warmth resides in me when I think of KH1. Recent Kingdom Hearts titles have so many narrative strands weaving about all over the place that it’s hard to keep up sometimes, but there’s no mistaking the brilliance of the franchise. </p>



<p>Director Nomura Tetsuya has said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-is-heading-towards-the-conclusion-of-the-series-says-game-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 4 is heading toward the end of the series</a>. But many players want to know what they’re getting with Kingdom Hearts 4 before they contemplate the future.</p>

<p>The April 10, 2022, Kingdom Hearts 20th Anniversary Celebration featured trailers for new KH games. The final announcement was for <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-iv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, and featured a set-piece battle between Sora and a skyscraper-sized Heartless boss.</p>



<p>It ends with a comical cameo featuring Donald and Goofy. Those closing moments were the last we’d see for three years. We reported in 2024 that a leaker had outed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 release date for Kingdom Hearts 4</a>. We’re a third of the way through 2025, and still have heard nothing—making this report feel thinner by the day.</p>



<p>The only thing Square Enix has said about KH recently is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-series-is-coming-to-steam-in-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts is finally coming to Steam</a>. It’s at the point now where I’d forgotten KH4 exists until I saw social media today. In today’s ever-evolving and fast-paced game industry, it’s hard to believe it’s been three years since Kingdom Hearts 4 was announced.</p>

<p>Here’s hoping we don’t have to wait too much longer!</p>
