            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/m80-acquire-beastcoast-rainbow-six-team-out/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>M80 has moved to acquire Beastcoast, adding the likes of Dota 2 and Pokémon-focused esports to an already stacked roster. The organisation will now cover these games in addition to Rainbow Six Siege, Counter-Strike 2, and VALORANT, but the move hasn’t been completed without a few upsets.</p>



<p>The losers of this deal are represented by Beastcoast’s former Rainbow Six Siege team, which claimed a victory at the BLAST R6 Major in Manchester, England earlier this year. They’re now left without an organisation to represent at the Six Invitational 2025, which is fast approaching.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-last-minute-change">Last-Minute Change</h2>



<p>M80 posted on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>M80 is pleased to announce we have acquired Beastcoast and their esports and media businesses. Excited to welcome them to the M80 family!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June, Beastcoast and Cloud9 partnered in the Rainbow Six Siege space ahead of the Esports World Cup. It didn’t turn out to be too fruitful a partnership, given that the team failed to qualify for the EWC, but it was also a very short-lived one. Per the <a href="https://m80.gg/article/m80-acquires-beastcoast-moves-into-dota2-pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official statement released by M80</a>, some key staff members are being pulled over from Beastcoast, but it’s bad news for some:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of the acquisition, M80 will absorb several of Beastcoast’s esports operations – including a top team in DOTA 2 – one of the largest Pokemon media businesses in gaming, and key staff, including CEO Grant Zinn. </p>



<p>In his new role at M80, Zinn will serve as Chief Business Development Officer, where he will support M80’s expansion and double-down on fandom in exciting, but underserved esports like Pokemon and fast-growing regions like South America.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The core trio that represented Beastcoast – Hotancold, SpiriTz, and Gaveni – has been left out in the cold following this move. They’ve resigned to stay together and add a couple of new players to their squad, but they currently have no banner to fly at the Six Invitational, which takes place in Boston in February.</p>



<p>Previous members of the Beastcoast roster, dfuzr and Gunnar, have unknown futures ahead of them.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Beastcoast beat Team BDS in an unlikely finish in Manchester to secure the trophy at the BLAST R6 Major, the first such win for the organisation in Rainbow Six.</p>

<p>The Esports World Cup is set to return in 2025 in Riyadh. Over the next month or so, the EWC team will be announcing the full line-up of games appearing at the event, which is expected to top 2024’s showcase in every way possible. It’s the most valuable event in esports where sponsorship and prizes are concerned, and it’s a competitive ground for a staggering array of titles.</p>



<p>Here’s every game announced for the Esports World Cup 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-game-at-the-ewc-2025">Every Game at the EWC 2025</h2>



<p>This list is subject to evolve as the EWC team unveils more games, but here’s the full breakdown so far:</p>



<p><strong>Games Confirmed for Esports World Cup 2025:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>



<li>Honor of Kings</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Warzone</li>



<li>Free Fire</li>



<li>Street Fighter 6</li>



<li>Dota 2</li>



<li>Rainbow Six Siege</li>
</ul>



<p>By the end of January, every game appearing at the Esports World Cup 2025 will have been announced.</p>



<p>The 2024 iteration of the Esports World Cup was a monumental event that saw tens of millions of dollars handed out in prizes. Some of the most prolific competitors in the esports world took to the stage in Riyadh, and despite concerns about the setting of the event, it managed to secure solid viewership worldwide.</p>



<p>I had a chance to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-ralf-reichert-esports-world-cup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview Ralf Reichert</a>, the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation, as the first EWC event came to a close:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t go into detail yet on what you can expect at future events, one thing to be sure of is our commitment to deliver a one-of-a-kind celebration of competitive excellence and gaming culture for our global fans. We’ve set a new standard, and it’s our responsibility to raise it going forward.</p>



<p>All this is part of Vision 2030 and how Saudi has embraced a forward-looking attitude that creates a perfect home for the Esports World Cup. There is long-term thought here that makes me very optimistic about the future of gaming and esports in Saudi Arabia and the MENA region as a whole.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games is hard at work preparing the next major update for Escape from Tarkov. In a series of images uploaded on social media, the team revealed snapshots of the ‘Customs rework’, an overhaul being made to what many consider to be Tarkov’s most popular map.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed when the Customs rework will drop, but it’s expected that it’ll arrive in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Tarkov wipe</a>, due to drop later this month.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-overhauled">Overhauled</h2>



<p>Customs is an extremely popular map in Escape from Tarkov, as it’s often the first environment most players will come to explore when they pick up the game. It’s the host of several early-game tasks, and it has some great PvP engagement areas as well as a couple of boss encounters that make for high XP, high loot runs.</p>



<p>In a series of images uploaded on social media, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov revealed some of the updates being made to Customs.</p>



<p>It started with a shot of a much more detailed and immersive ‘New Gas’ interior, and then hours later, Buyanov showed some new interiors showing remarkable attention to detail.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Recently, the team at Battlestate Games overhauled Factory, taking the small-form map that had existed for almost a decade and turning it into something much more expansive and complex. It became ten times more detailed overnight, with the update adding much more verticality and depth to the iconic map.</p>



<p>In recent years, the squad at BSG has been working to expand and alter almost every map in the game, and it’s all in preparation for Tarkov launching as a full-release game, in ‘1.0’. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-card-game-project-k/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/project-k-league-of-legends-card-game-revealed-by-riot-games.1053606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-card-game-project-k/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot Games has unveiled a League of Legends TCG that’s going by the name Project K. In a four-minute video uploaded today, the team introduced Project K, marketing it as a ‘League IP game that we think deeply serves the need of a different kind of audience’. It’s set to feature recognisable locations, characters, and abilities pulled straight from the League universe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-the-table">To The Table</h2>



<p>Project K is an ambitious game that Riot Games dubbed ‘the best social TCG out there and something that you will really enjoy’. It’s designed to be played with a group in an ideal world, but one-on-one gameplay is also entirely supported.</p>



<p>The team envisions a competitive ecosystem that starts at the grassroots level but escalates to global tournaments.</p>



<p>In the introduction video, the team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to get cards into everyone’s hands as soon as possible. But we do want to ensure that wherever you live, you have the best experience from your day one, including that competitive ecosystem and of course, cards and accessories in your language.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Project K will launch first in China, with Riot Games having already identified a manufacturer and distributor in the region. The English versions of the launch box set will be available to pre-order later this year. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Admittedly, the introduction video was light on the gameplay details, which is uncharacteristic for a TCG that intends to launch internationally within a few months. And of course, many fans were quick to make comparisons to Legends of Runeterra – which surfaces in Project K in some artistic decisions.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts has once again made good on a promise to support inclusivity and accessibility in the games industry. Recently, the company unlocked 23 patents tied to accessibility, including speech recognition and photosensitivity innovations. In 2021, the team pledged to share in-house technology with the wider industry.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sharing-is-caring">Sharing is Caring</h2>



<p>On December 5, Electronic Arts made 23 patents open-source, making them available to third-party developers operating outside of EA. These patents mostly concern speech-based technology and testing tools that recognise photosensitivity issues.</p>



<p>One key deliverable is an Unreal Engine 5 plugin that unlocks EA’s IRIS technology, an analytical tool that can help developers identify photosensitivity issues in their game while testing. It’s now free to use and open-source, which means developers are free to ‘play around’ with the software.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/2024-accessibility-patent-pledge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on EA’s blog</a>, it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For years now, EA has strived to make gaming&nbsp;as inclusive as possible&nbsp;and to minimize barriers between our players and our shared love for video games. And today, in this spirit and following International Day of Persons with Disabilities we have added 23 accessibility-centered patents to our&nbsp;industry-first accessibility patent pledge. </p>



<p>Through this pledge, launched in 2021, we share our accessibility-related technology with the wider industry royalty-free, so that together we can work towards meeting the needs of our diverse gaming community at EA and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>IRIS works by identifying potential issues in a game such as flashing lights and sequences that could trigger something like an epileptic fit or seizure. It compares visuals against a simple baseline that tracks in real-time, assessing whether a sequence is a pass, warning, or fail. </p>



<p>Previously, EA has delivered patents focused on text issues, such as Fontikk, a tool that was open-sourced in 2022 that analyses text to determine its readability.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a good move by EA, or is it just a ploy to earn some positive PR? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/google-genie-2-ai-tech-3d-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/google-reveals-ai-tech-that-can-create-playable-3d-games-in-seconds.1053597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/google-genie-2-ai-tech-3d-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Google has unveiled Genie 2, a revolutionary AI-driven technology that can generate playable 3D environments based on image or text-based prompts in seconds, depending on the level of compute used. In a blog post, the DeepMind team shared footage of explorable worlds being traversed after being created by Genie 2 based on nothing but an initial text prompt.</p>



<p>It’s rudimentary at this stage, but it’s a direct evolution of Genie 1, which could generate 2D environments. It’s enough to make you wonder what Genie 3 might look like, that’s for sure.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-age-of-ai">The Age of AI</h2>



<p>Developers have been toying with AI for a while to <strong>aid </strong>game development, but Genie 2 goes one step further. This technology is a foundational step towards using AI to generate an entire game, as shown by the DeepMind team in a recent blog post.</p>



<p>In one clip, the team prompts Genie 2 to generate ‘a playable world driving a sailboat on a lake’, and although what follows is <span><strong>obviously</strong></span> an AI-generated segment, it’s exactly what the prompt asked for.</p>



<p>In another scene, it’s a robot running around a forest, and in another, it’s someone exploring an abandoned spaceship.</p>



<p>Here’s a description of <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genie 2 from DeepMind</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Genie 2 is a&nbsp;<em>world model</em>, meaning it can simulate virtual worlds, including the consequences of taking any action (e.g. jump, swim, etc.). </p>



<p>It was trained on a large-scale video dataset and, like other generative models, demonstrates various emergent capabilities at scale, such as object interactions, complex character animation, physics, and the ability to model and thus predict the behavior of other agents.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s still limited, though. Genie 2 can only generate consistent worlds for up to 60 seconds. In the showcase, everything from racing gamers to platformers was explored, with Genie 2 going so far as to create interactable environments containing bursting balloons, working doors, and exploding barrels.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/deepmind.mp4"></video></figure>







<p>It can even accurately render reflections and directional lighting, and it can take a single shot of concept art and use it to bring that envisioned environment to life.</p>



<p>Is this technology dangerous or do you want to see more of it? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>There is a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) game is on the way. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown is a turn-based strategy game from developer Strange Scaffold, the team behind El Paso, Elsewhere, Clickolding, and I Am Your Beast.</p>



<p>The first turn-based TMNT game, Tactical Takedown follows what happens after both Splinter and Shredder pass away where a new leader has taken over the Foot Clan. The single-player game features 20 levels that are divided into campaigns that each focus on a single character. Each of the levels will also mutate as the turns pass.</p>



<p>Tactical Takedown features a graphic novel art style with figurines and diorama set pieces.  There will also be customizable movesets for each of the Turtles to shape the game how you’d like.</p>



<p>“This is the next step for Michelangelo, Donatello, Leonardo, and Raphael,” the game’s description reads. “…as the Turtles approach adulthood, they’re not just growing up… they’re growing apart.”</p>



<p>A release date will be announced at a later date, but it is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>, now. You can check out the trailer for the game below.</p>
