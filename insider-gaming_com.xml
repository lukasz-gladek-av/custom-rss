<p>The first Fortnite update of 2026 has arrived, bringing new content and changes to the game, resulting in the customary downtime, and this guide has all the details of when to expect servers to return.</p>



<p>After a packed schedule of Winterfest content, Fortnite still has plenty to offer during Chapter 6 Season 1, which won’t come to an end until early March, and the January 9 update has plenty to offer.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Fortnite downtime duration and what’s coming in the January 9 update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up">When Will Fortnite Servers be Back up?</h2>

<p><strong>Fortnite’s servers will be down for several hours for the January 9 update, and there’s no confirmed time for their return. However, previous downtime indicates how long the game will be unavailable.</strong></p>



<p>Server downtime in mid-season updates typically lasts for three to four hours, though the wait can be longer if any issues are discovered.</p>



<p>This means that servers should be back up after the January 9 update somewhere between 5 AM ET and 8 AM ET, so keep an eye on social media around these times to check if the servers are back online.</p>



<p>Once the servers are back online, make sure to have a look at the latest content on Insider Gaming for guides on all the major additions and tips to help you.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fortnite-january-9-update">What’s in the Fortnite January 9 Update?</h2>



<p><strong>The biggest additions in the January 9 update in Fortnite are the launch of a major South Park collab, introducing new cosmetics in the Item Shop and in-game content.</strong></p>



<p>A free Mini Pass will be available during the South Park collab, along with a makeover to the Wonkeeland POI, which is transformed into Cartmanland, and the addition of the Stick of Truth Mythic item.</p>



<p>The January 9 update will also bring a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-south-park-collab-will-include-limited-time-five-player-playlist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new five-player limited-time game mode</a>, while removing Winterfest content from the game, and there will also be updates to other game modes, including Blitz and Reload.</p>



<p>Full patch notes and content reveals should be shared by Epic Games on the official Fortnite blog during the downtime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Towerborne, a Looter Brawler developed by Stoic and published by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/xbox-game-studios/">Xbox Games Studios</a>, is leaving early access and launching as a full game on February 26, 2026. In addition to the Xbox platforms the game is currently available on, including PC, it will also be available on PlayStation 5. Along with the full launch, many changes are coming as part of the reimagined launch experience update.</p>



<p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/towerborne-launches-february-26-with-massive-full-game-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Per Xbox,</a> one of the major changes that current players may not be happy with is the game moving from free-to-play to a fully paid model. The game will start at $24.99 for the standard release and $29.99 for the more premium deluxe edition. However, one benefit of the new model is that the game will shift from always being online to a title players can buy once and play offline.</p>







<h2 id="h-more-of-the-major-changes-coming-to-towerborne-1-0-in-february">More of the Major Changes Coming to Towerborne 1.0 in February</h2>



<p>In addition to the new paid release model, the game features multiple updates that enhance the player experience. For example, there’s an updated, complete story featuring a major antagonist, side quests, and an overhaul of the Bounty Board. There’s also a reworked difficulty system with a new Brutal difficulty for those seeking a truly challenging experience. Additionally, the <a href="https://www.towerborne.com/FAQ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Towerborne FAQ </a>states that players can continue their character progression from Early Access; however, it recommends starting over and playing the game from the beginning.</p>



<p>During an interview as part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA4J6ByZPR0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New Game+ Showcase</a>, game director Daniel McLaren and design director Shana Markham spoke about how important it was for them to listen to their player base and flesh out the story after it was originally intended for the narrative not to play a major role in the game and be more of a backdrop for the Looter Brawler experience.</p>

<p>Kinetic Games, the development studio behind Phasmophobia, has announced the launch of a new publishing label to provide independent game studios with legal assistance, marketing support, and more. </p>



<p>Named Kinetic Publishing, the company aims to provide the support Kinetic CEO Daniel Knight wished he had when he was the sole developer launching the pivotal horror game in 2020. Kinetic Games has since grown to a team of over 30 individuals.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-vision-behind-kinetic-publishing">The Vision Behind Kinetic Publishing</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/news/announcing-kinetic-publishing" rel="nofollow">In a press release,</a> Knight touted the company’s growth, noting that it now has the capacity to support other studios. He also said that his experience will now allow him to provide the support he would have appreciated.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It’s such an exciting time for indie game development, I can say that in the past five years I’ve learned so much. The fact we’ve grown so much as a company means we’re now in the place where we want to support studios who come under our wing, and provide the support I’d have appreciated at the start of my journey.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Five of Kinetic’s senior members will head the Kinetic Publishing team, each overseeing their respective areas of expertise. Among them is Asim Tanvir, Kinetic’s Director of Marketing and Partnerships. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/phasmophobia-developer-kinetic-games-launches-indie-publishing-label" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Tanvir encouraged developers interested in partnering with Kinetic’s new branch to be authentic and proud of their work, and to provide the best information possible to represent their game’s potential.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Focus on the information that best represents your game and highlights its potential, as this will help you and our team, too. Also, be authentic and proud of what you’re working on. If you are, that will come through and shine in your submission. We’re really looking forward to seeing a variety of pitches come through.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Kinetic Publishing aims to collaborate with small teams and individual developers worldwide. Specifically, they are looking for developers with a clear vision for their game who are about a year and a half from launch. Insider Gaming will continue to track Kinetic Publishing’s growth and provide additional details on the new label as more information becomes available.

<p>Obsidian Entertainment is officially bringing Avowed to the Sony PlayStation 5 on February 17, 2025. In addition, a new anniversary update to the game introduces several new features for players to explore.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA4J6ByZPR0" rel="nofollow">During the New Game+ Showcase on January 8, 2026,</a> Avowed’s gameplay director, Gabriel Paramo, and lead character artist, Dimitri Berman, touted the amount of additions to the game including new character races coming and the feature of the New Game Plus, allowing players to start a brand new game with all of the previous items they collected through their first playthrough. However, weapons will reset to their default levels, requiring players to level them up again.</p>







<h2 id="h-other-new-features-being-added-to-avowed">Other New Features Being Added to Avowed</h2>



<p>Additionally, a new photo mode was announced, allowing players to take photos of their Envoy. There are also new character presets and numerous creative options for players, which Dimitri and Gabriel say they were unable to complete to their satisfaction in the lead-up to the game’s launch. The game, published by Xbox Game Studios, initially launched in February 2025 on Xbox platforms. However, as more Xbox exclusive games begin coming to New platforms with Microsoft’s “Everything is an Xbox” campaign in full swing, PlayStation players are now getting the chance to experience the world of the Living Lands in the Pillars of Eternity universe.</p>

<p>The Obsidian representatives stated Avowed would be available for pre-order on January 8, but as of this Friday, the PlayStation Store has not made the landing page accessible. Insider Gaming will report when PlayStation officially makes the game available for pre-order.</p>

<p>A new Gameplay Overview trailer highlights features of the upcoming Mario Tennis Fever game, coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Among other highlights, it was confirmed that the game will feature the most playable characters ever available in a Mario Tennis game, including the debut of Baby WaLuigi.</p>



<p>Mario Tennis Fever was first announced during the September Nintendo Direct, in a segment focused on the 40th anniversary of the Super Mario Bros. franchise. In the new trailer released on January 8, 2026, there was a more detailed breakdown of the new features, including a look at the full roster, with debuts of Goomba, Baby WaLuigi, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-more-mario-party-tennis-fever-features">More Mario Party Tennis Fever Features</h2>



<p>In addition to the extensive roster, the game features the new Fever Rackets. There will be over 30 rackets, each with its own ability. For example, the Shadow Racket creates a duplicate of the character you’re using to have your opponent see double. There is also a range of new modes. <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/get-ready-for-tennis-with-a-twist-in-the-new-mario-tennis-fever-overview-trailer/">Nintendo describes</a> the Mix It Up mode as a way to play matches with unique twists. For example, Ring Shot Mode, where players try to hit balls through rings to score points. Also, there’s Forest Court Match, where feeding Piranha Plants a stream of tennis balls expands the court.</p>



<p>There’s also the previously announced Adventure Mode, which features Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Wario, and WaLuigi being transformed into babies by monsters. With the help of Donkey Kong, who is acting as a babysitter, they must overcome challenges to return to normal.</p>
