<p>Techland recently surfaced all over social media to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Dying Light franchise. In 2015, the first game was released, introducing a high-octane, intense zombie-slaying title to the world, and it quickly became known as one of the best games in the genre. In 2022, Techland followed up with Dying Light 2: Stay Human, a live-service title that’s going strong today.</p>



<p>As part of the celebration, the team at Techland published a video packed with stats, including a juicy one – <strong>45 million players </strong>have been through the Dying Light universe since 2015.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-populated">Populated</h2>



<p>In a promotional video posted on social media, Techland revealed that across two games, more than 45 million players have entered the Dying Light universe.</p>



<p>Collectively, they’ve played 1.1 billion hours of Dying Light and have killed more than 75 billion zombies – ‘9 times the world population’. By utilising the franchise’s fluid and advanced movement mechanics, players have made the equivalent of <strong>41 trips to the sun and back </strong>on foot.</p>



<p>Dying Light is well known for its aggressive and visceral combat engine, and with that in mind, more than 20.3 billion zombies have been beheaded by players in the last decade. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Since the release of the original Dying Light, we have been blessed with the best fans in the world. So it’s only right that we recognize you. Watch our summary video that shows off all the craziest feats you have achieved in those 10 years!

<p>There’s plenty more to come this year. In the summer, players will get their hands on Dying Light: The Beast, a standalone title that sees the return of Kyle Crane, played by Roger Craig Smith. I had the pleasure of catching up with the iconic actor at Gamescom 2024, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/">we spoke about his role</a> in the upcoming open-world zombie game.</p>



<p>To celebrate the 10th anniversary of Dying Light, Techland has rolled out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/">a series of events and special offers</a> across the universe, present in both Dying Light and Dying Light 2.</p>

<p>The Carolina Royal Ravens have had an unexpected start to the 2025 Call of Duty League season. The squad has put up some impressive numbers since day dot, floating around the top of the CDL standings and knocking the biggest teams in the business down a peg. It all started with a 3 – 0 win over Atlanta FaZe, a feat that any team hadn’t achieved for more than 500 days.</p>



<p>However, FaZe retaliated with a win against the Ravens in the GF of the first CDL Minor. At the Madrid Major, which is unfolding now, the Royal Ravens have kicked off a dominant run through the elimination bracket, after being pushed down into the depths by the LA Thieves.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-eliminations-galore">Eliminations Galore</h2>



<p>In the opening round of the elimination bracket, the Carolina Royal Ravens decimated the Vegas Falcons, producing a 3 – 0 scoreline that included a dramatic reverse sweep in the round of Search. Many have praised the Falcons for their resilience, but the lack of mental composure during much-needed clutch moments is becoming an issue.</p>



<p>Following that round, the Royal Ravens soared onwards, clashing with OpTic Texas, previously the favourite to win the Madrid Major. OpTic managed to close out just one map – the opening Hardpoint. That was as close as close could be, with the scoreline settling at 248 – 250 in Carolina’s favour.</p>



<p>From there, it was a sweep for the Royal Ravens, with the remaining maps including a 3 – 0 wash over OpTic Texas on Protocol Control.</p>



<p>There were concerns about the resilience of the Carolina Royal Ravens following the opening loss against LAT. It was revealed that Reece ‘Vivid’ Drost has an eye injury that he’s dealing with, but regardless of that, he has been frying in-game.</p>



<p>The Royal Ravens will now need to contend with the likes of Toronto Ultra or Atlanta FaZe, two formidable teams that have had a brilliant season thus far. It took a while for Atlanta FaZe to get the wheels turning, but the squad now sits on a solid win streak of nine matches – including a win at the first CDL Minor.</p>



<p>It’s anyone’s game right now, and the $150,000 grand prize is lying in wait for whoever has the talent to secure it.</p>

<p>BioWare’s headcount is . According to a new report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, the company now sits at less than 100 employees after having over 200 people just two years ago.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODM1MTgzMSwiZXhwIjoxNzM4OTU2NjMxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUVlXVThUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.91ztnslkcG02JwTwRRfVCXIJp8FOdqGBjCNQgz-bE8k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The report says</a> that a number of employees who were put “temporarily” on new teams were informed that those moves were permanent. No longer were they BioWare employees helping out in a different area. </p>



<p>Schreier’s report also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-bioware-employees-worried-about-more-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-bioware-employees-worried-about-more-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborates </a>Insider Gaming’s exclusive report that “dozens” of people were let go as part of this wave of layoffs at the studio.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“If they want to work at BioWare again in the future, they would have to look for job openings and re-apply,” Schreier writes. He adds that, for now at least, a small team will  work on the next game in the Mass Effect series. This team is being led by “company veteran who oversaw the development on the original trilogy as well as on 2019’s&nbsp;Anthem”. The goal is to then expand as needed later on in production.</p>







<p>As sources told Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-moves-some-employees-to-other-ea-projects-while-developing-mass-effect-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the memo</a> from BioWare was released, there is still an internal evaluation being done in order to see where things can be improved. There is still a worry from those who spoke under the condition of anonymity that more layoffs and moves within the studio are coming.</p>



<p>Neither EA nor BioWare have responded to multiple requests for comment on the state of things at the studio.</p>
