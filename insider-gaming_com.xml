<p>The next set of new Pokémon TCG Pocket packs is all anyone wants. Genetic Apex has carried the game through a strong beginning, but it’s time for A2 to drop, change the meta, and make collections bigger.</p>



<p>I do every mission, get all rewards, complete events, and open booster packs. As a result, I need very few new cards. I yearn for a new Pokémon TCG Pocket set, and the rumored A2 booster set could be the cure. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-mythical-island-themed-collection-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a> was Pocket’s first proper mini-set, and it had some bangers—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-celebi-ex-meta-deck-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebi ex</a> is a pain, right? </p>



<p>But it’s time to move on to bigger and better things. New packs for Pokémon TCG Pocket can breathe new life into the mobile game, and here’s the latest on set two.</p>

<p><strong>The new Pokémon TCG Pocket packs don’t have an official release date, but it’s widely accepted set two AKA Set A2 is dropping at the end of January 2025</strong>—<strong>likely January 29</strong>.</p>



<p>January 2025’s closing days are huge for Pokémon TCG Pocket. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading is finally coming</a>, along with the rumored and much-anticipated A2 set. </p>



<p>Trading was confirmed by Pokémon TCG Pocket’s X social media page. This is a lock, however; Set A2’s current information is purely from leaks and datamines.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-a2-expansion-leaks-and-rumors">Pokémon TCG Pocket A2 Expansion Leaks and Rumors</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An amazing card design. Credit to Creatures Inc. and DeNA.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pokémon TCG Pocket A2 expansion is believed to be another major booster set featuring over 200 new cards.</strong></p>



<p>Genetic Apex is set one, Mythical Island is mini-set one, and A2 is set two. Get ready for tons of new cards, ex beasts, and Full Art beauties we’re never going to pull. We’ll probably get new Crown rarity pulls too.</p>



<p>Social media personality <a href="https://x.com/PokeGirlLauren"></a><a href="https://x.com/PokeGirlLauren" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PokeGirlLauren</a> posted the game’s future content plans in a <a href="https://x.com/PokeGirlLauren/status/1855266563038892098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message on X</a> at the beginning of November: “Mini #PokemonTCGPocket Set A1a to be released 16th December. <strong>The 2nd set ‘A2″ will be released 29th January</strong>, will contain around 230 cards, and is expected to totally change the meta. Plans are for 4 new sets and 4 mini sets a year.”</p>



<p>We know the A1a leak was true, and this was part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored next expansion leaks</a> way back. Developers Creatures Inc. and DeNA seem to be leaving the same amount of team between set releases. This makes a <strong>January 29 release for A2 extremely likely</strong>.</p>



<p>As for Set Two’s contents, this remains a mystery. Genetic Apex is primarily a Kanto region set, and the assumption is set two is Johto-focused. We take nothing for granted in this respect—always expect the unexpected.</p>



<p>Social media is rife with supposed leaks of A2 card designs, but we remain skeptical. Unlike the concrete leaks for set launches and dates, we’ve seen nothing regarding A2’s designs or cards. <strong>I’d recommend you take any Set A2 designs with a mountain’s worth of salt for now</strong>.</p>

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket has just revealed how the upcoming trading feature will work in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket was set to receive a new trading feature in January 2025, and before its arrival, the developers have <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed </a>how players can trade their cards in the game.

<ul>
<li>Players will only be allowed to trade with friends.&nbsp;</li>



<li>You cannot trade cards of different rarities; both cards must be the same.&nbsp;</li>



<li>When Pokemon TCG Pocket’s trade feature arrives, some cards from the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island cards can be traded. The selection of booster pack players&nbsp;</li>



<li>Players can only trade cards with one-diamond to four-diamond rarity cards and one-star cards.</li>



<li>Lastly, players will have to consume the items to trade them.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The developers of Pokemon TCG Pocket will observe how the community responds to the trading feature and assess future updates accordingly. Additionally, they have announced that the next set of Pokemon TCG Pocket Booster Packs will be released this month; more details about the packs will arrive soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To celebrate the arrival of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth of PC, Apex Legends is hosting a special event called Lunar Rebirth Collection on January 21, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a part of the Lunar Rebirth Collection event, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Items such as Buster Sword R2R5, Hop-Ups and Materia have returned to Apex Legends. Players will also be able to grab the 36 returning FF 7 Cosmetics Items and 6 Iconic Legends skins available for direct purchase in the store. There’s also a Lunar Rebirth Reward track, which provides players with additional rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-buster-sword-and-materia-return-to-apex-legends">Buster Sword and Materia Return to Apex Legends</h2>



<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s Buster Sword and Materia will be available to try in Apex Legends during the Lunar Rebirth Collection event. The Buster Sword can be used to deal damage through light and heavy attacks; players can also use its colossal size to block attacks. Additional abilities include dashing and the iconic Limit Break, whose meter fills whenever the player deals, takes or blocks damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rift Relics can provide players with Materia Hop-Ups, which increase effects and bonuses. Blue Materia can heal the player by absorbing the damage you inflict on enemies.

Lastly, the Red Materia allows players to summon a Nessie companion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another PGA Tour title, another dilemma about which edition to buy. PGA Tour 2K25 has more editions than I have holes-in-one (zero, for what’s it worth), and each one has a unique selling point designed to pull you you in.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> is the next iteration of 2K’s next-gen golf game. 2K23 was a step up from 2K21, but 2025’s big dog is ready to eat. It’s sporting new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-courses-in-pga-tour-2k25-dlc-courses-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">courses</a> and revamped features across the board. It’s like the excitement of the new Driver season where you can’t wait to see what the big brands have been cooking up.</p>



<p>2K hasn’t just been hard at work on gameplay and longevity, we have new editions to peruse.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-pga-tour-2k25-edition">Every PGA Tour 2K25 Edition</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Decisions, decisions. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A Standard, Deluxe, and Legend Edition are available to pre-order for PGA Tour 2K25. </strong></p>



<p>Choosing a new launch’s edition is the equivalent of standing on a tee and deciding whether to slice the ball OB or snap hook it in the trees. All options are possible—and inevitable—but the choice is a tough one.</p>



<p>If 2K25 is your first foray into simulated golf or a new season in your accomplished career, we’ll help you with this agonizing decision.</p>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-standard-edition-explained">PGA Tour 2K25 Standard Edition Explained</h2>

<p>Standard is the basic edition of PGA Tour 2K25. It comes with the game—a cool pre-order bonus—and that’s it! If you’re mainly after 2K25 in its most basic and simplistic form (and cheapest), the Standard Edition is probably the one for you.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you get with the Standard Edition of PGA Tour 2K25:</p>



<ul>
<li>A base copy of PGA Tour 2K25.</li>



<li>Extra Butter x Adidas Pack
<ul>

<li>Extra Butter X Adidas Hat.</li>

<p>Upgrading to the Deluxe Edition gives you a few extra yards off the tee—probably not, but you never know. I can say for sure you get the game, the pre-order bonus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>, and a few more goodies. The Deluxe Edition might be digital-only, meaning you have to buy it from an online storefront if you want it.</p>

<li>7-Day Early Access.</li>



<li>A base copy of PGA Tour 2K25.</li>

<p>If you didn’t think your bag could get any more full, in steps PGA Tour 2K25 Legend Edition. Again, this seems to be a digital-only edition.

<p>Announced today, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC will be playable on the Steam Deck on release day.</p>



<p>When Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC is released on January 23, 2024, Steam Deck owners <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1879895195178901895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can play the game</a> anywhere they want: on the train, in the park, on a flight, or in the car. The official announcement post also features the game running on the handheld console, and it seems the device can handle the title seamlessly, with no visible stuttering or performance issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To celebrate the arrival of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Steam Deck, Square Enix has revealed a limited-edition Fluffy Chocobo Steam Deck. The custom edition covers the entire handheld console in bright yellow Chocobo feathers. The game developers have stated that they don’t advise wrapping up “high-tech gaming gear in fur at home, ” so they have made the casing removable.</p>
