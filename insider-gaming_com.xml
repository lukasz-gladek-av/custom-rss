<p>In a post published on social media by a Call of Duty dataminer, it was suggested that a daily rewards system could be coming to Black Ops 6 when season three drops in March. The season is expected to bring back Verdansk in Warzone for the first time since 2021, so it makes sense that teams are anticipating ways to retain players to make the comeback much more worthwhile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-day-new-rewards">Every Day, New Rewards</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 doesn’t feature a daily login bonus system – even the free rewards periodically unlocked in the store have been paltry. Most players report getting endless strings of Double XP tokens and nothing else, whereas in previous games, players could get charms, sprays, calling cards, and emblems, all for free.</p>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_/status/1895867334948241728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post from realityuk_</a> on Twitter, that might be set to change.</p>



<p>While the dataminer has uncovered nothing more than a menu and a prompt, it’s enough to assume that daily rewards are coming back when season three hits later this month.</p>



<p>In one image, Reality found a ‘Daily Login Reward’ pop-up that read:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To earn all rewards, log in on 7 seperate days before unclaimed rewards expire.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This hasn’t been addressed or even alluded to by the teams working on Black Ops 6, and as it’s a datamined asset, it’s worth taking the imagery with a pinch of salt. These things are always subject to change, unfortunately.</p>



<p>It’s nice if it’s true, though. Despite the state of Warzone right now, the return of Verdansk is guaranteed to bring players flooding back, and nothing makes players happy like free items.</p>



<p>It was suggested recently by a Call of Duty leaker that Verdansk is returning to Warzone as ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/">pretty much the OG version</a>‘ that was released in 2020. That was when Warzone was created, becoming one of the most popular battle royale games in history as tens of millions of players flocked to the title.</p>



<p>Will you be taking advantage of free daily rewards if they come to Black Ops 6? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Raven Forge have announced two brand-new full-scale replica swords from Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Both Yasuke’s Wakizashi &amp; Naoe’s Tantō&nbsp;from Assassin’s Creed Shadows are <a href="https://ravenforge.com/collections/the-raven-forge-legend-collection-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available now for pre-order</a>, with Naoe’s Tantō&nbsp;costing £139.99 and Yasuke’s Wakizashi costing £199.99. </p>



<p>This isn’t the first full-scale replica from Raven Forge on Assassin’s Creed either, as late late year the company announced&nbsp;a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-scale-replica-of-assassins-creeds-altairs-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-scale replica of Assassins Creed’s Altaïr’s Sword</a> from the original game.</p>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-s-wakizashi">Yasuke’s Wakizashi&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The wakizashi, a revered sidearm of the samurai, was traditionally worn alongside a katana—a symbol of status, duty, and skill. This exceptional replica features an intricately wrapped faux rayskin handle and saya (scabbard), custom menuki (handle ornaments), and a tsuba inspired by the crest of the Oda clan. Every detail has been thoughtfully recreated to bring Yasuke’s weapon to life.</p>



<p><strong>Production dimensions:</strong></p>



<div><p>Full Length: 670mm<br>Blade Length: 500mm<br>Grip Length: 170mm<br>Blade Width (base): 30mm<br>Tang: Full<br>Weight: 776g<br>Materials: 3CR13 – Tempered steel<br>Edge: Blunt – Prop replica</p><p><strong>Pre-order ship date: Early August</strong></p></div>



<h2 id="h-naoe-s-tanto">Naoe’s Tantō</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A weapon of both practicality and prestige, the tantō served as a trusted sidearm of the samurai and was also wielded with remarkable skill by the Onna-musha, the warrior women of feudal Japan. This faithful reproduction features a beautifully wrapped faux rayskin handle, ornate menuki (handle embellishments), and a strikingly detailed saya (scabbard).</p>



<p><strong>Production dimensions:</strong></p>



<div><p>Full Length: 430mm<br>Blade Length: 295mm<br>Grip Length: 128mm<br>Blade Width (base): 26mm<br>Tang: Full<br>Weight: 425g<br>Materials: 3CR13 – Tempered steel&nbsp;<br>Edge: Blunt – Prop replica</p><p><strong><strong>Pre-order ship date: Early August</strong></strong></p></div>
