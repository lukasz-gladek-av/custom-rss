<p>Elden Ring’s Game Director Junya Ishizaki has revealed that Elden Ring Nightreign can only be played as a trio or solo.</p>



<p>The news came from a new interview with IGN, where&nbsp;Ishizaki&nbsp;revealed that the game is designed to be played as a three-person team, but you can play solo if you wish. Ishizaki flat-out said that you cannot play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-announced-for-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> as a duo.</p>



<p><strong>Junya Ishizaki:&nbsp;</strong>The game is designed to be played as a three-person team, but you can play it as a solo player.</p>



<p><strong>IGN:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, great. Or in a pair?</p>



<p><strong>Junya Ishizaki:&nbsp;</strong>No, it’s either one-player or three-player.</p>



<p>Ishizaki later continued, “The reason that we went with a three-player focus was that we wanted to retain that sense of accomplishment you get from battling a boss together or from conquering a map together and that sense of enjoyment, but we wanted to recreate that in a fresh way. And we felt like focusing on a three-player co-op experience would provide a brand new sense of accomplishment with it.”</p>

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is scheduled to release sometime in 2025, with players being able to sign up and register to test the game starting January 10. </p>



<p>“The network test is a preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch,” FromSoftware and Bandai Namco said. “Various technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests,” the test description reads. Players can <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/network-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sign up for the test here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Will Cut Back on ‘Toilet Humor’ Says Gearbox]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-will-cut-back-on-%E2%80%98toilet-humor%E2%80%99-says-gearbox.1063209/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Gearbox’s Narrative Director says it will reduce toilet humor for its next installment in the Borderlands series, Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>The revelation came from the X account (formerly Twitter) of Gearbox Narrative Director Sam Wrinkler, who previously worked on both Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands and Borderlands 3. In response to a question about the narrative direction pertaining to jokes, <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1868741632449036648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Winkler said</a>, “Not at liberty to talk much about the content of BL4, but I remain firm in my criticism of BL3’s overabundance of toilet humor.”</p>



<p>He later elaborated, “I’m not gonna say there’s no toilets, but if the word skibidi ships in the game under my watch, I’m gonna cry real tears. Paul Tassi joked that we were gonna have a gun called Hawk 2A and a fellow dev asked me if it was real and I wanted to put my hand down the sink grinder.”</p>



<p>The Borderlands series has always tried to have a boatload of humor, and Winkler’s comments might be a positive sign for those who didn’t enjoy the humor in Borderlands 3, which was criticized for having fairly lousy humor. A simple search on Google (it’s still a thing, ya know?) of Borderlands 3 humor pulls up loads of search results of people criticizing the game and its cringe-like humor.</p>



<p>So, for now at least, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ll have to wait until 2025</a> to know how many toilet jokes are in the game.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is set to launch in 2025 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/game-science-ceo-reveals-his-views-on-black-myth-wukong-not-winning-goty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Game Science’s CEO and founder, Yocar-Feng Ji, recently discussed Black Myth Wukong not winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/black-myth-wukong-game-science-ceo-the-game-awards-criticized-game-of-the-year-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, Yocar-Feng Ji took to the Chinese social media platform, <a href="https://weibo.com/6603744955/5111567333196223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weibo</a>, to express his dissatisfaction with Black Myth Wukong losing out on GOTY at TGA 2024. Feng Ji first spoke about how the award ceremony came along simultaneously with their ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relatively large update</a>‘ for the title and how this project has spanned 7 years. He then talks about how the game was nominated across four categories and won the Best Action Game and Players’ Voice award, with the latter being more satisfying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng Ji reveals that he had “a sense of loss and regret” (as translated by ChatGPT on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1he81dp/game_producer_of_black_myth_wukongs_post_after_tga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/PS5</a>) with Wukong not winning GOTY and states that the games nominated “were all exceptional”. However, he “can’t determine the criteria” for GOTY this year. Feng Ji said that he feels he came all the way to Los Angeles “for nothing”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feng Ji added that he was very confident about Black Myth Wukong winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024, so sure that he had written his acceptance speech “two years ago”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Black Myth Wukong has been a massive success for Game Science, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 10 million copies</a> and breaking several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-player-count-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concurrent player records on Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Black Myth Wukong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/china-gaming-industry-black-myth-wukong-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushed China’s gaming industry to new heights in 2024</a>. Also, check out the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boss Rush update</a> for the game.

            <title><![CDATA[New Tarkov Event Rewards Players With The Game’s Most Coveted Item]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-event-unlock-kappa-dark-times/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-tarkov-event-rewards-players-with-the-game%E2%80%99s-most-coveted-item.1063113/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games has started a new pre-wipe event in Escape from Tarkov, and it rewards players with one of the most coveted, cherished items in the game’s ecosystem: Kappa.</p>



<p>The Kappa secure container is one of the items that the game’s most die-hard fans aspire to unlock after every wipe (read: game reset). It takes a huge amount of effort to grab one, but after completing this relatively simple quest from Battlestate Games, you can get your hands on one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-temporary-greatness">Temporary Greatness</h2>



<p>The only drawback to this event is that you’ll lose Kappa when the game wipes in the coming weeks – but for those weeks, you’ll feel like a legend. Typically, each new wipe brings around a ‘race to Kappa’, with many streamers participating to see who can unlock the aspirational item the fastest.</p>



<p>It’s a beast of a task that requires collecting several rare items and completing dozens of in-game quests. The average player will never get within sniffing distance of Kappa before the game wipes, which is an event that takes place around once every six months.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-unlock-kappa-in-tarkov">How to Unlock Kappa in Tarkov</h3>



<p>To get Kappa, you’ll need to complete the new ‘Dark Times’ quest, given to you by Fence, one of Escape from Tarkov’s traders.</p>



<p>Dark Times requires players to venture into Factory at night and kill 30 targets using nothing but a TOZ-16, one of the game’s most cumbersome and pointless weapons. That being said, if you put the right ammunition into it, there’s no reason why you couldn’t get this task done in just a few raids.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that you need to eliminate 30 <strong>targets</strong>, and not just PMCs. That means you can run in, blitz through fields of Scav enemies, and then hey presto, you’ve unlocked Kappa for the remainder of the wipe.</p>



<p>Have fun while the secure container is in your possession – it’ll be gone soon. Perhaps the added stash space will motivate you to chase Kappa next wipe, who knows?</p>
