<p>Bungie has arrived with new details about Marathon, discussing all the improvements, reconfirming the March 2026 release window, pricing, new features, and more. </p>



<p>Marathon and Bungie have not had the best time since the title’s reveal and initial playtests, thanks to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-artist-satisfied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism fiasco</a> and all the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong player feedback</a>. The title has been undergoing constant playtesting since then, and the developers have finally arrived with new information about their vision for Marathon. </p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-pricing-details-revealed-battle-passes-never-expire">Marathon Pricing Details Revealed, Battle Passes Never Expire</h2>



<p>A new video by Bungie confirms Marathon’s March 2026 release window, reveals pricing details, provides new battle pass information, and much more. The developers are targeting a price of $39.99/€39.99/£34.99 currently and will announce regional pricing closer to launch. Purchasing the title will give players full access to the base game, including free gameplay updates, new maps, Runner shells, events, and more. </p>



<p>Moreover, Marathon Battle Passes will never expire, which means players don’t need to keep logging in due to the “fear of missing out”. You will be able to purchase and unlock prior passes. The developers have also confirmed that “survival will never come down to how much money you spend,” so there will be no pay-to-win elements in Marathon. </p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-devs-reveal-new-features-and-improvements">Marathon Devs Reveal New Features and Improvements</h2>



<p>Coming to the improvements, the new Vision of Marathon video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> reveals all the changes the developers have made since the alpha and their plan for the game. Starting with the latest features since alpha, players will see that Proximity chat and solo queue have been added. There’s also a new Runner Shell called Rook, which is designed to let players enter matches in progress, loot a bit, and escape without too much risk. </p>



<p>The game has also made some improvements to visual fidelity, with corpses now remaining in the match and decaying over time. Additionally, environmental storytelling has been deepened. Immersion has also improved thanks to the role audio plays. The developers have stated that audio is a major gameplay element in Marathon, with every sound serving a purpose. </p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-map-details">Marathon Map Details</h2>



<p>The developers then dived into Marathon’s Zones, the game’s maps. First is Perimeter, which is on the outskirts of the colony and spread out. The next is Dire Marsh, where players not only get a sense of the game’s story but also experience a different style of gameplay, focused more on action. The third map is called Outpost, a UESC facility with many PvE elements, including guards, drones, trip wires, and more.</p>



<p>The fourth map is The Marathon Ship’s Cryo Archive, which is the hardest place to survive in the game, and no point going there without the best loot. Each map features different weather systems and dynamic events. These events don’t happen all the time, but the players will know when they do, and then it is up to them whether they want to risk it all.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-weapons-and-loot-details">Marathon Weapons and Loot Details </h2>



<p>There’s a lot of loot for Marathon players to look forward to, including Runner cores, implants, and over 400 weapon mods. The game also offers a lot of customisation, allowing players to mix and match their weapons in unique ways. The devs showed examples of turning the Battery SMG into a needler and turning invisible with mods on their sidearm. Each of the game’s launch Runner Shell is an archetype of gameplay, which can be upgraded upon. </p>



<p>Lastly, the game has Factions, and agents of these Factions can ask you to jobs like “blow up a UESC dropship”, etc. Factions have upgrade trees and capstone rewards that players can earn each season. </p>
