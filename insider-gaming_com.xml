<p>The Budapest Major 2025 played host to a stunning moment as Mathieu ‘ZywOo’ Herbaut, the Team Vitality frontman, secured his best Major map performance <strong>ever</strong>. This victory came during the win over The MongolZ to kick off the StarLadder Major’s playoffs round, and it landed on Mirage amid the 2-0 sweep that ensured Vitality’s survival.</p>



<p>To secure the map record, ZywOo secured a 2.47 rating, which is the highest he has ever achieved in the Counter-Strike space.</p>



<p>If you want to place a wager on what’s left of the playoffs, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025.

<h2 id="h-stunning-performance-from-zywoo-in-budapest">Stunning Performance from ZywOo in Budapest</h2>



<p>ZywOo’s numbers were nothing short of extraordinary. The masterful competitor secured a ratio of 25 kills to just 8 deaths, and his performance was backed by a blistering 135 ADR. His rating was elevated to unseen levels, indicating exactly why Team Vitality was able to so easily overcome The MongolZ, a team now eliminated from the Budapest Major.</p>



<p>Even on the second map, on Dust 2, ZywOo managed to land a rating of 2.18, walking all over the Mongolian squad.</p>



<p>This performance effectively eclipsed his previous best in Budapest, where he secured a 2.05 rating in a fixture against B8 in the earlier Swiss stages.</p>



<p>Fans of Vitality are now looking to the next match in the lineup: Vitality vs. Team Spirit. It’s a battle of the titans that will see ZywOo contend with the likes of Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets, the prodigy with a mean streak thus far in the event.</p>
