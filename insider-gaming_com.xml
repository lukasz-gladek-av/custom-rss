<p>Battlefield Portal, which was first introduced into Battlefield 2042 will be returning to the next title, DICE has confirmed.</p>



<p>The news came via the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOih6h3VeTE&amp;ab_channel=Flakfire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Flakfire</a>, who had an early online presentation of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> reveal last week. In Flakfire’s latest video, he said that the developers confirmed the return of Portal, a gamemode which introduces classic maps, weapons, and more into the latest game.</p>



<p>“We had surprising confirming in the briefing that Portal will be making a return with the next Battlefield title,” he said. </p>



<p>“Portal could be one of those slices tested under the Battlefield Labs program,” he theorised. </p>



<p>Battlefield Labs is essentially a Community Test Environment, where players can give feedback of specific features in the next Battlefield game and presumably, future DLC, too.</p>



<p>Flakfire pointed out earlier in the video that those who sign up to the Battlefield Labs program will be under an NDA, whcih presumably will still not stop people from sharing footage and information.</p>

<p>While we currently don’t have the name for the next Battlefield title (unless it’s just Battlefield), it has been confirmed that the game will be for current-generation consoles only, meaning it will release on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. According to EA, the game will release later this year.</p>



<p>What remains to be seen is the announcement of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Battle Royale</a>, which has been in development at Ripple Effect for the past couple of years and was exclusively reported on by Insider Gaming in early 2024.</p>
