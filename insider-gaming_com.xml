<p>Nintendo released a notice today announcing the discontinuation of My Nintendo Gold Points.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through the My Nintendo reward program, players could earn Gold Points when purchasing digital Nintendo Switch games or DLC. The earned points could be used towards rewards and discounts on the My Nintendo Store and Nintendo eShop. However, after March 25, 2025, at 1:30, Gold Points will no longer be awarded on eligible purchases.</p>



<p>Fortunately, players can use Gold Points they have already earned for longer, as they are valid for 12 months after receipt. Moreover, there are some cases where Gold Points may be awarded after the discontinuation date; check them out below:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Players will earn Gold Points if they pre-order a downloadable product before the end of the bonus period.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Gold Points can be earned if players purchase a packaged version of software released before the expiration.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Also, suppose players purchase Nintendo Switch (OLED model) White/Customized, Nintendo Switch Customization, or Nintendo Switch Lite Yellow/Turquoise/Grey/Coral/Blue from the My Nintendo Store before the reward expiration date and time. In that case, they will be able to earn Gold Points after the shipping date. Check out more details about earning Gold Points after the discontinuation date <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2025/0218.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-6-devs-are-exploring-user-generated-content-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1111887/</guid>

<p>According to a new report, Rockstar Games plans to make GTA 6 a new “metaverse platform” for user-generated content.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Digiday</a> reports that Rockstar has spoken to some of the best user-generated creators for Roblox, Fortnite, and GTA for their upcoming title, GTA 6. According to the report and three anonymous industry insiders, the developers are exploring the possibility of creating custom experiences in the game, which will allow these creators to introduce their intellectual property to GTA 6’s world while having the ability to alter the existing elements of the game, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fans will appreciate user-generated content in GTA 6 after seeing how well GTA RP servers have done for a game released over a decade ago. Thanks to the user-generated content players experience in the GTA RP servers, GTA 5 remains one of the most popular games on Steam and is followed massively on Twitch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, in 2023, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fivem-redm-rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar had acquired Cfx.re</a>, which brought two of the biggest role-playing communities under its umbrella, FiveM and RedM. At the time, it was speculated that this move would allow GTA 6 to feature role-playing servers at launch or might get them soon after release; however, the developers never confirmed this information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/corsairs-ceo-believes-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-early-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Corsair’s CEO believes</a> GTA 6 will come to PC early next year. Also, GTA 6 release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-release-may-not-be-the-end-for-gta-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may not be the end</a> for GTA online.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-bans-fortnite-cheater-forces-them-to-apologize-and-give-back-winnings/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Epic Games is not letting Fortnite cheaters off the hook, and those caught doing so at the competitive level are getting the strictest punishment: total embarrassment. The punishments levied by Epic are being cheered by the community, with some fans wishing other games would follow suit.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-pro-caught-account-sharing-gets-embarrassed-by-epic-games">Fortnite Pro Caught Account Sharing Gets Embarrassed by Epic Games</h2>



<p>A player caught account sharing in Fortnite has been banned from all tournaments by Epic, forced to donate their prize winnings to charity, and had to make an apology video. </p>



<p>By sharing his account with another Fortnite player, Australian pro Morgan “RepulseGod” Bamford unfairly qualified for the 2023 Fortnite Championship Series (FNCS) Grand Finals. In a 30 second description-less video, RepulseGod <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XouE9KalIVA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> his actions, and explained that he has received a permanent ban and has to forfeit his winnings:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Epic took legal action against me and now I’m banned from participating in Fortnite tournaments forever. I also have to pay a monetary settlement, which includes the prize money I received but did not fairly win, which Epic will donate to charity. Cheating in tournaments ruins the fun for the players who earned their spot in tournaments and I apologise to the Fortnite community for my actions. I won’t ever cheat in Fortnite again.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/FNCompetitive/status/1891564240604999725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted this update</a> and a link to the player’s video on their official FNCS account, effectively laying out a warning to anyone else who cheats. In a similar method as Valve took with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-pros-caught-matchfixing-finally-unbanned-after-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the iBUYPOWER match fixing scandal</a>, Epic is setting a very high punishment standard in an attempt to deter future cheaters.</p>



<p>Many players online have now seen this from Epic and want to see it implemented in other titles, such as Call of Duty. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-ranked-play-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The release of Black Ops 6’s ranked mode was plagued by a prominent amount of cheaters</a>, and many would like Activision to take a firmer stance like Epic’s. Since RepulseGod cheated to qualify for tournaments and win actual money, their punishment was more severe, but Call of Duty fans still want to see cheaters shamed like this.</p>



<p>What other games should see this sort of anti-cheat action? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
