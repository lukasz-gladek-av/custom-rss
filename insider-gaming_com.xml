<p>Support for the original Nintendo Switch isn’t going to end just because its successor, Nintendo Switch 2, is heading to market. During its Q3 FY2025 earnings call on Tuesday, Nintendo said that they will continue to support the console if demand requires.</p>



<p>As part of their latest earnings call on Tuesday, Nintendo gave an update on the Switch business as a whole. The company announced that the console had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-has-now-sold-over-150-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 150 million units sold</a>, creeping closer to the 160M of the PlayStation 2. It was also revealed, however, that sales have slowed quicker than the company expected. That required Nintendo to lower its operating profit by 22% due to Switch sales falling by 30% for the quarter.</p>



<p>As far as why the drop, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa doesn’t believe the announcement of the Switch 2 has led to a slower sales rate of the original console.</p>



<p>“We don’t think the impact of the reluctance to buy is that great, and we think that it is solid for the eighth year, but we have not been able to reach the plan,” he said according to <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250204-KB2S2JK245IALH4D6JO4NVHOZU/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sankei</a>.</p>



<p>Going back to support for the original Switch, it’s not out of the norm for Nintendo to support a console for at least a few years after its predecessor made it to market. The Nintendo Wii was released in 2006, but Nintendo kept services online until May 2014. For the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, online services lasted until April 2024. Whether continued online services means games will still be releasing for the original Switch two, three, or more years after Switch 2’s launch remains to be seen.</p>



<p>How long do you think Nintendo will continue to support the original Nintendo Switch? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>According to the latest announcement, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has sold more than 5 million units globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bandai Namco’s 2024 3D arena fighter, the latest instalment in a decade-old game series, has hit a major sales milestone. Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, the successor to the iconic Budokai Tenkaichi series, has sold over 5 million units across PlayStation, Xbox Series X/S, and PC since October 8, 2024 (less than 4 months since release). The developers have <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1886686193535848650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thanked</a> the fans for their passion and support in helping them achieve this milestone. </p>



<p>Moreover, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has shown no signs of slowing down. The developers have already released the first DLC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-hero-of-justice-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero of Justice</a>. The latest expansion introduces 11 new playable characters, with the likes of Beast Gohan, Orange Piccolo, Cell Max and more from Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie joining the roster. The developers have also released a new game mode and fresh cosmetics with the new DLC. 2 more DLCs are planned, introducing more than 20 characters to the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are several reasons why Dragon Ball Sparking Zero has sold 5 million units. Most importantly, fans appreciate that the developers stayed faithful to the source material. They built upon the already perfected gameplay from the Budokai Tenkaichi series by enhancing it with stunning visuals, destructible arenas, and a roster of nearly 200 characters. Additionally, the game’s multiplayer aspect is easy to access, and the story mode offers a refreshing experience with new Episode Battles and Custom Battles.</p>



<p>In other news, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sparking-zero-is-one-of-the-best-selling-bandai-namco-games-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bandai Namco’s best-selling games</a>.

<p>VALORANT is one of the most popular online multiplayer titles in gaming, attracting thousands of players a day to the tactical shooter genre. With so many agents and abilities, the game consistently receives fixes when these abilities aren’t working properly, like the one in today’s 10.02 patch.</p>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown of bug fixes coming to <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT</a> in Patch 10.02.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-valorant-10-02-patch-notes">VALORANT 10.02 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>VALORANT Patch 10.02 doesn’t feature any significant gameplay changes or improvements, save for one to Killjoy’s Alarmbot. It features a number of bug fixes, primarily targeting agent abilities that were bugged. Here are those changes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Vyse</strong>: Fixed an issue where Arc Rose and Razorvine were visible when placedon specific water surfaces.</li>



<li><strong>Tejo</strong>: Fixed an issue where players could rarely survive running straight through the full duration of Armageddon.</li>



<li><strong>Killjoy: </strong>Fixed an issue where Killjoy’s recall minimap indicator could get stuck in a state where it was invisible.</li>



<li><strong>Killjoy: </strong>Alarmbot logic has been updated to be more intelligent.
<ul>
<li>In niche circumstances, <strong>the Alarmbot will now path towards players if they are on ledges and explode on them</strong> if they would be hit by the size of the explosion rather than trying to run extremely long paths around the map.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where certain types of damage could leave players with Regen Shields at 1 HP when the damage should have been lethal.
<ul>
<li>This also fixed issues where <strong>Clove</strong> could tank lethal damage specifically when Regen Shield and Pick Me Up were active at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed a bug where Observers were seeing inconsistent player team outline colors.</li>
</ul>



<p>The following fixes to Premier, VALORANT’s seasonal competitive mode, apply only to PC players: </p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where long team names could overlap each other on the playoff bracket screen.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where dropdowns on the standings sometimes cut off text.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the division name text was not always correctly aligned on the match history screen</li>
</ul>



<p>Since his arrival at the start of the season, Tejo has become a popular fixture amongst competitive and pro players. However, his destructive ultimate Armageddon was sometimes not killing players caught in it’s full blast. Now, thanks to patch 10.02, players caught in the full duration will die.</p>



<p>Arguably the biggest change in VALORANT Patch 10.02 is the improved intelligence of Killjoy’s Alarmbot. Players are no longer safe from the Alarmbot if it they’re up on a ledge above it.</p>



<p>What changes do you want to see added to VALORANT in a future patch? Let us know down below and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>According to the latest earnings release, the Nintendo Switch is now a step closer to the PlayStation 2 in sales, having sold more than 150 million units.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/switch-worldwide-sales-top-150-86-million-super-mario-party-jamboree-tops-6-17-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>, the Nintendo Switch sold 150.86 million units as of December 31, 2024, just 10 million shy of the best-selling video game console of all time, PlayStation 2. The 2017 console sold 4.82 million hardware units and 53.7 million units at this time. Interestingly, Nintendo has yet to beat DS’s sales numbers with the Switch, as the former has sold 154.02 million units in its lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-best-selling-first-party-nintendo-switch-games">Best Selling First-Party Nintendo Switch Games</h2>



<p>Nintendo also released its best-selling first-party Switch games, with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe still leading the pack, selling 67.35 million units. The next three in the list feature Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, selling 47.44 million, 35.88 million and 32.62 million units, respectively. The last title in the top 5 best-selling games for Nintendo Switch is Super Mario Odyssey, with 29.04 million units sold.

<p>Nintendo also revealed sales numbers for its newly announced first-party games, with Switch Sports selling 15.74 million units. Newer games like Super Mario Party Jamboree and Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership have sold 6.17 million and 1.84 million units, respectively. Other recent games, such as The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, sold 3.91 million units, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door sold 2.06 million, and Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD sold 1.80 million units.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-revises-forecast-again-nbsp">Nintendo Revises Forecast Again&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Nintendo sold 9.54 million hardware units, a 30.6% decrease year over year. On the software side, 123.98 million units were sold, a 24.4% decrease year over year. Hence, the console manufacturers have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lowers-annual-forecast-after-switch-sales-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revised their financial forecast </a>for March 2025 again. This change was made “in consideration of the sales trend through the nine months ended on December 31, 2024.” The hardware and software unit sales forecasts have also been revised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new estimates for net sales are 1.19 billion yen, down from 1.28 billion yen. The operating profit forecast was decreased from 360 million yen to 280 million yen. The ordinary and net profit estimates have also changed, down from 420 million yen and 300 million yen to 370 million yen and 270 million yen, respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Insider Gaming has learned that new Elden Ring Nightreign details are scheduled to be released next week, including a release date.</p>



<p>That’s according to source familiar with the games plans, who said that information will be released on February 12. It’s understood that the announcement will include media previews and a final release date for the game, which is currently slated for the end of May.</p>



<p>For those out of the loop, the timing could make a lot of sense, too, as a recent rumor has also suggested that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play could be taking place in the same week</a> (although it could just be a coincidence). </p>



<p>But likely, the announcements and embargos are because of the Elden Ring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-will-have-a-network-test-starting-february-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightreign network test</a>, which takes place on February 14 – 17, which is undoubtedly going to see the games contents leak online. So it would make sense for FromSoftware to get ahead of the them with official announcements.</p>



<p>Announced during The Game Awards 2024, Nightreign is a cooperative experience that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can only be played solo or in a trio</a>. FromSoftware has already confirmed that the game cannot be played as a duo.</p>



<p>Elden Ring’s Game Director Junya Ishizaki clarified why such a decision was made, ““The reason that we went with a three-player focus was that we wanted to retain that sense of accomplishment you get from battling a boss together or from conquering a map together and that sense of enjoyment, but we wanted to recreate that in a fresh way. And we felt like focusing on a three-player co-op experience would provide a brand new sense of accomplishment with it.”</p>



<p>The game is scheduled to release on the PlayStation 4, Play7sTation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>
