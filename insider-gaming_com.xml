<p>Black Friday is just a few weeks away, and gamers are already trying to get the best deals for PS5s, PS5 games and more. Here is a list of the best Black Friday deals for PS5s.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-ps5-black-friday-deals">Best PS5 Black Friday Deals</h2>



<p>Earlier, PlayStation accidentally leaked that it may be including a PS5 Slim deal on Black Friday, which would be a huge win for those looking to purchase the popular system. The leak revealed that the PS5 Slim would be brought down to $379.99 USD on Black Friday, which is $70 cheaper than regular.</p>



<p>However, there have been no actual released Black Friday deals for PlayStation yet, but there are plenty of <em>early </em>Black Friday PS5 deals to hop on.</p>

<h2 id="h-early-black-friday-deals">Early Black Friday Deals</h2>



<p>At the moment, PlayStation has already released quite a few different deals, including discounts on systems, controllers games and more. </p>



<p><strong>Below is a list of PlayStation equipment players can buy for a discount ahead of Black Friday:</strong></p>

<p>Many other sites include potential deals, too, so keep your eye out when web surfing. There will also be quite a few deals in stores, too.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ps5-black-friday-predictions">PS5 Black Friday Predictions</h2>



<p>While we do not know of too many PlayStation deals yet, could only be assumed that a variety of PS5 bundles will be on sale.</p>



<p>Also, many stores usually include sales of games, including Walmart, Amazon, Target, Best Buy and more. One game to watch out for is Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, as the game seems to always drop in price for Black Friday every year.</p>



<p>Your best bet is to keep your eye out on websites and stores as more and more will begin releasing PS5 Black Friday information soon.</p>

<p>EA Sports and the Professional Women’s Hockey League (PWHL) <a href="https://www.thepwhl.com/en/news/2024/november/13/pwhl-to-be-featured-in-ea-sports-nhl-25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have announced</a> that the league will be coming to NHL 25 in December.</p>



<p>Starting December 5, all six PWHL teams — Boston Fleet, Minnesota Frost, Montréal Victoire, New York Sirens, Ottawa Charge, and Toronto Sceptres — will be added to the game to play in a number of modes. Those include Play Now, Online Versus, Shootout and Season. In addition to being playable in modes, PWHL content will be added to the World of Chel as well Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT).</p>



<p>The launch comes alongside the start of the PWHL’s second season.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to bring the PWHL into NHL 25 as part of a massive holiday update, giving players all-new ways to play, starting in a couple of days with the frenetic energy of NHL Arcade through to the launch of 4 Nations Face-Off in the New Year,” NHL 25 Executive Producer Bill Dollar said.</p>



<p>Women’s hockey has been a growing presence in the EA Sports NHL series for a number of years with international teams being a part of the last handful of games. The PWHL marks the first women’s league to be added to the franchise. In the past, EA Sports did speak with the NWHL about possible inclusion, but no deal was ever reached.</p>



<p>As far as this update is concerned, not all likenesses will be scanned and into the game when the update comes. That said, there is a plan to add more via updates to NHL 25.</p>



<p>In addition to the PWHL, EA Sports announced that the Four Nations Tournament and a new Arcade mode are both coming to NHL 25.</p>



<p>What do you think of the PWHL coming to NHL 25? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>
