<p>If Sniper Elite Resistance’s base content isn’t enough, the Season Pass offers more stealth and sniping. It also brings back a familiar face seen throughout Sniper Elite’s DLC over the years. There’s plenty to admire about Resistance’s Season Pass, so let’s take you through it.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> DLC is forthcoming about what it provides. Unlike Sniper Elite’s various editions, there aren’t multiple Season Pass choices, just a standard set of new goodies. It’s a one-off transaction for a big bundle of new Sniper Elite content set to add many hours to its already generous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-sniper-elite-resistance-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game length</a>.</p>



<p>Whether you’re gripped by the tone of Harry Hawker’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-voices-harry-hawker-sniper-elite-resistance-voice-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voice actor</a> or need more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">missions</a>, the Season Pass has it all.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-sniper-elite-resistance-season-pass">Everything Included in Sniper Elite Resistance Season Pass</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We meet again. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Sniper Elite Resistance Season Pass includes new weapon and character skins, fresh guns, and four brand-new missions to complete.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick rundown of every piece of new content included in the Season Pass:</p>



<ul>
<li>1 Character Skin Packs.</li>



<li>3 Campaign Missions.</li>



<li>3 Weapon Packs.</li>



<li>3 Weapon Skin Packs.</li>



<li>Target Führer Campaign Mission—Lights, Camera, Achtung.</li>
</ul>



<p>There aren’t many specifics when it comes to the nature of the skins or weapons. However, thanks to the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3258690/Sniper_Elite_Resistance_Season_Pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Page</a>, we know to expect “A bolstered cache of authentic World War II weapons.”</p>



<p>Lights, Camera, Achtung is a day-one release. The series tradition of having a DLC mission where you kill Adolf Hitler makes a return. Infiltrate the German leader’s secure area and take him out in a variety of creative ways.</p>



<p>The rest of the content is expected to drop between “<strong>January—March 2025</strong>.” Many Season Passes and instances of post-launch content are dropped periodically in the months after release. So at least you don’t have to wait too long to get everything extra you’ve paid for! </p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-sniper-elite-resistance-season-pass">How Much is The Sniper Elite Resistance Season Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s $34.99 or £29.99 if you want the Sniper Elite Resistance Season Pass on your platform of choice.</strong></p>



<p>With Lights, Camera, Achtung, and an extra three missions on the way, this represents many hours of new content. Given Sniper Elite’s penchant for replayability, this DLC is sure to occupy your time.</p>



<p>Also, if you’re only interested in the Lights, Camera, Achtung Hitler mission, it’s available as a standalone purchase for <strong>$6.99</strong> or <strong>£5.79</strong>.</p>

<p>Atlanta FaZe just pulled off a remarkable reverse sweep at the Call of Duty League Major in Madrid. After a fairly dominant opener that saw LAT blitz FaZe, Atlanta switched things up during the mid-series Control and never slowed down. It boiled down to a round eleven showdown during map five that was quickly mopped up by FaZe.</p>



<p>The LA Thieves will now fall into the final fixture of the elimination bracket, going head-to-head (again) with the Miami Heretics. Earlier in the tournament, the LA Thieves booted Miami into the lower bracket after a 3-0 sweep.</p>



<p>Talking on stage after the match, Drazah had some choice words for the LA Thieves.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rivalry-renewed">Rivalry Renewed</h2>



<p>The LA Thieves and Atlanta FaZe represent two of the biggest dogs in the CDL fight. They’re fronted by some of the sharpest talent in the Call of Duty League, and they have the most valuable rosters to boot.</p>



<p>This face-off series was never going to go any other way than to the wire – which is exactly what happened. With it coming down to single-digit kill counts, Atlanta FaZe prevailed, earning the first ticket to the grand final series of the Madrid Major.</p>



<p>On stage in the post-match interview, Drazah fired shots at LA Thieves:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m feeling great – those guys are <strong>frauds</strong>. It’s Sunday, we’re on LAN, reverse-sweep, this shit is easy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the last few weeks, the LA Thieves roster has been wrestling with the title of ‘Super Team’, which was branded upon the squad when it was assembled last year. For many, LAT hasn’t yet lived up to those lofty expectations, which is a sticking point for sure.</p>



<p>LA Thieves will now contend with the Miami Heretics for the sole remaining spot in the grand final. There’s a $150,000 prize awaiting the winner of Major I – who will secure it? Find out in just a couple of hours.</p>

<p>DICE and EA have announced that the first details on the next Battlefield’s community test program will be revealed tomorrow.</p>



<p>The announcement was posted on the official X (formerly Twitter) account, where it was said, “Tune in tomorrow at 5PM CET / 8AM PDT for more on the upcoming <a href="https://x.com/hashtag/Battlefield?src=hashtag_click">#Battlefield</a> community testing program.”</p>



<p>Last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-playtests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported that Battlefield playtests</a> were once again ramping up to test the multiplayer and Battle Royale experiences of the game. </p>



<p>While details on what will be announced tomorrow are incredibly slim, several sources have suggested that we’ll get our first look at pre-alpha gameplay of the game (abliet, only a few seconds).</p>



<p>Insider Gaming also understands that playtests for the next Battlefield title have been a weekly occurrence for months, with DICE and the other Battlefield studios relentlessly gaining player feedback; something they didn’t do for Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>From small feedback sessions to large-scale player tests, Battlefield is now taking the much-needed “player first” approach to ensure that the next Battlefield game is a success, with the teams leaning from its mistakes of the series’ past couple of installments. </p>
