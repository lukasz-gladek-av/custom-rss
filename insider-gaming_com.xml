<p>King of Meat has announced it will shut down in April. The game was released less than 6 months ago.</p>



<p>An <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/amazon-games/" id="52194">Amazon Games</a> release, the dungeon-crawler x action-brawler hybrid <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/king-of-meat/" id="3030">King of Meat</a>, launched in October 2025. It was a rough launch, described as “disastrous.” Two months after the game’s launch, several developers at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/glowmade/" id="3031">Glowmade</a>, the game’s development studio, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/king-of-meat-glowmade-layoffs/" id="162870">were laid off</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming exclusively reported that leadership hoped the game would reach a concurrent player count of at least 100,000. As of this writing, there are 11 concurrent players on Steam, and the game’s all-time concurrent player peak was 320 on November 15. </p>



<p>They’d even put up a multi-million-dollar video from Mr. Beast’s gaming YouTube channel, featuring a custom set and several content creators. They also had custom-wrapped buses in London to market the game, and were even looking at an animated TV pilot.</p>



<p>The game has announced it will be shutting down, and players will receive a full refund.</p>







<h2 id="h-king-of-meat-plans-to-shut-servers-down-in-early-april">King of Meat Plans to Shut Servers Down in Early April</h2>



<p>King of Meat’s servers will shut down on April 9, meaning the game will be offline just a few days past the 6-month mark.</p>



<p>The development studio thanked players who gave the game a chance, but ultimately admitted the game did not find the audience it was looking for. </p>



<p>“King of Meat, the game has unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and King of Meat’s servers will close on April 9, 2026,” <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement</a> reads.</p>

<p>Seamus Blackley believes the recent changes at Microsoft Gaming are intended to sunset the Xbox brand.</p>



<p>Seamus Blackley was a game developer who helped create the original Xbox, which launched 25 years ago. In the last quarter-century, the Xbox brand has reached the heights and fallen quite far from that perch.</p>







<h2 id="h-seamus-blackley-thinks-xbox-s-end-is-near">Seamus Blackley Thinks Xbox’s End Is Near</h2>



<p>Recently, Microsoft Gaming underwent a massive restructuring,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-sarah-bond-resigns/" id="178338"> with Phil Spencer retiring</a> and Asha Sharma becoming the new CEO. Now, Blackley is speaking out about why he believes this move will ultimately spell the end for the Xbox brand.</p>



<p><a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with GamesBeat</a>, Blackley explained that he believes many Microsoft businesses that aren’t related to the CoreAI business, the department that Sharma worked at previously, are being sunsetted. As such, he believes that Sharma’s role is to move the Xbox brand out of the picture.</p>



<p>“Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren’t the core AI business, is being sunsetted,” he said. “They don’t say that, but that’s what’s happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night. It just seems really true.”</p>







<h2 id="h-asha-sharma-s-public-stance-has-been-polar-opposite">Asha Sharma’s Public Stance Has Been Polar Opposite</h2>



<p>Publicly, Asha Sharma, who officially assumed her duties today after the announcement on Friday, February 20, has touted a rebirth of the Xbox brand. She claims that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asha-sharmas-full-memo-following-promotion-to-ceo-of-microsoft-gaming/" id="178373">she’s focused on revitalizing the brand</a> and recommitting to core Xbox players. A social media account tied to her has even been hearing out fans’ suggestions, including<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-xbox-ceo-responds-to-fans-desire-for-console-exclusives/" id="178442"> a return to console-exclusive games.</a></p>



<p>Everything is still fresh regarding the changes at Microsoft, but time will tell whether this is a reset or the sunset for the Xbox brand. Another thing that’s fresh is Asha Sharma’s gamer profile.
