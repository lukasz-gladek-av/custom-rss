<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 started as a single-player exclusive game, and then along came GTA Online. This live-service, open-world epic has been the backbone of the GTA franchise for more than a decade, and it’s where friends and foes alike congregate to share their crime-fuelled adventures.</p>



<p>Sadly, GTA Online is inherently tied to the wonders of the internet on PlayStation. That means if PSN goes offline, GTA 5 will be down – and <strong>that means </strong>that GTA Online will be offline too. In this guide, we’re taking a look at what to do if GTA Online stops working and answering a key question: ‘Is GTA 5 down on PlayStation?’</p>



<p>Let’s find out how you can check the GTA Online PSN server status.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-gta-down-on-ps5">Is GTA Down on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>GTA Online is down at the time of publishing due to an ongoing global issue with the PlayStation</strong> <strong>Network </strong>(last checked 08/02/25).</p>



<p>On February 8, the PlayStation Network buckled, crashing worldwide and plunging tens of millions of gamers into darkness. The major outage was a show-stopping event, taking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all PSN services offline</a> in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>For future reference, there are things you can do to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check the PSN server status</a>, but in most cases, it’s a matter of just waiting until the network comes back up again.</p>



<p>If GTA Online is down on PS5, you can bet your last dollar it’s offline on PS4, too.</p>



<p>Read on to check how you can figure out whether it’s a global outage or a more localised issue that’s taking GTA down on PlayStation.</p>

<p>Call of Duty has become a mammoth network of games culminating in the infamous CoD HQ hub. But if you’re having trouble playing Warzone, Black Ops 6, or any other Call of Duty game on PlayStation, the serves could be an issue. Let’s take a look at the latest happenings.</p>



<p>Activision has so many CoD games live at once it’s untrue. There are so many different eras of CoD you can enjoy and gameplay styles too. Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer, and Battle Royale, mean there’s something for everyone. Every now and again <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-down-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD’s servers</a> go down, and it can be due to issues with Activision’s servers.</p>



<p>There are other circumstances where everything breaks too. If you’re a PlayStation user trying to get into CoD but can’t, the PS servers are probably a big reason why.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-call-of-duty-servers-down-right-now-on-playstation">Are Call of Duty Servers Down Right Now on PlayStation?</h2>

<p><strong>The Call of Duty PlayStation servers are not working due to an issue with the PlayStation Network.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been wrapped up in work, your busy life, or anything else, you might not have heard about PSN. PlayStation’s online infrastructure mysteriously went offline on February 8, causing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worldwide outage of PlayStation online services</a>.</p>



<p>No one knows for sure <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-psn-down-how-long-is-it-down-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why PSN is down</a>, and the only details so far come from the <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ask PlayStation X page</a> on social media. The page officially addressed the problem with a quick message: “<strong>We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN</strong>.”</p>



<p>This does mean <strong>all forms of Call of Duty work elsewhere</strong>. Warzone, Black Ops 6, and any other CoD game currently work just fine on Xbox, PC, and other applicable platforms. If you have another console, or maybe COD Mobile on your phone, this might have to keep you ticking over until the maintenance issue is sorted.</p>



<p>We have pages dedicated to checking the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSN server status</a>, to make sure you know the latest information and updates. Other online multiplayer games are being affected, with PlayStation Network’s issues affecting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fortnite-down-on-playstation-now-fortnite-psn-servers-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s online server status</a> too.</p>



<p>Keep checking back to Insider Gaming for the latest updates on the PlayStation Network <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">servers</a>. Let’s hope this isn’t a repeat of the infamous 2011 PSN outage that lasted several weeks!</p>



<hr>



<p>This is especially bad timing with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-play-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty having a free weekend for Black Ops 6</a>. It’s also Double XP too. Are you hoping Activision extends the free trial and Double XP Weekend for all those affected. Discuss it in the comments.</p>



<p>Forget about the PSN troubles for now and check out some CoD content while you wait. We have guides on completing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-the-tomb-main-quest-easter-egg-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tomb Easter Egg</a> and building the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-build-staff-of-ice-wonder-weapon-the-tomb-zombies-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Staff of Ice Wonder Weapon</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-is-psn-down-how-long-is-it-down-for.1103937/</guid>

<p>PlayStation Network being down is a catastrophic issue for the company and players. Millions of users (myself included) are subscribed to PSN and use PlayStation services regularly. But PSN is down, so let’s look into why this and how long the outage is expected to last.</p>



<p>I still vividly remember the great PlayStation Network outage of 2011. From April 20 to May 14, the community could not use PSN services. This meant no online play, messaging friends, or buying games using the PlayStation Store. It was an awful time, and I wanted to play Call of Duty and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield</a> with my friends.</p>



<p>Déjà vu has struck again in 2025. On February 8, PSN suddenly went down without notice, and it’s been off ever since.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-playstation-network-down-right-now">Why is PlayStation Network Down Right Now?</h2>

<p><strong>The only thing any of us have been told so far is Sony is “currently experiencing issues” with its PlayStation Network service.</strong></p>



<p>A closer look at the PSN server status tells us “Some services are experiencing issues,” and this applies to all PSN media: Account Management, Gaming and Social, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Social, and PlayStation Direct.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ask PlayStation X page</a> posted a single message <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888041723831484682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saying</a> “<strong>We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN</strong>,” on February 8, and has neglected to comment since. PlayStation further cemented this mystery by having its main X page repost the Ask PlayStation message to its 42 million followers on the platform—but provide no statement itself.</p>



<p>Sony nor PlayStation have commented on the issue. Like PSN right now, we are all in the dark, and the community is understandably getting frustrated at the lack of updates. </p>



<p>With the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-play-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 getting a free weekend</a> and Double XP to boot, many gamers were probably looking forward to kicking back over the weekend and enjoying some gaming.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-psn-coming-back-online">When is PSN Coming Back Online?</h2>



<p><strong>We still don’t know when PSN is coming back online, and there are zero updates or hints as to when.</strong></p>



<p>I wish I could give you more information, and we are doing our best to get the latest on the outage. Keep checking back as we intend to inform you as soon as we can. Furthermore, we have a separate page letting you know the latest on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Network being down</a>.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for updates as we hope and pray PSN comes back online sooner rather than later.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Shotzzy is Still Haunted by THAT Interview and Needs to ‘Get His Get Back’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shotzzy-haunted-interview-london-cod-league/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shotzzy-is-still-haunted-by-that-interview-and-needs-to-%E2%80%98get-his-get-back%E2%80%99.1103892/</guid>

<p>Shotzzy is one of the most decorated esports players in the business. He’s one of just two competitors to secure a world title in <strong>two </strong>games, and he’s a multi-time champion and MVP. In the Call of Duty League, he’s known as one of the most consistently entertaining and capable players, taking up a key spot on OpTic Texas.</p>



<p>But he’s still not over the interview he gave in London in 2020. During the Madrid Major between January and February 2025, I sat down with Shotzzy and Huke behind the scenes, asking them where they’d like to go next in Europe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-redemption-story">Redemption Story</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas fell hard in the Madrid Major, being knocked out of the elimination bracket by a dominant Carolina Royal Ravens side. For a while, OpTic Texas was the favourite to win, coming into the season hot off a win at COD Champs 2024. The team put up a solid fight, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the competition.</p>



<p>Most recently, OpTic Texas was in the news because Pred, who went on a hiatus from the squad in December 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pred-optic-texas-call-of-duty-league-retur/">rejoined the team</a>, knocking Huke out of his temporary spot on the roster.</p>



<p>In 2020, Shotzzy journeyed to London with Dallas Empire, the team with which he’d win the Call of Duty League Championship later that year. He gave an iconic interview, but it seemed that the bright lights of the big stage put the young superstar on edge, and this was the result:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MOST AWKWARD ESPORTS INTERVIEW EVER!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZ6fz8StG8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-shotzzy-wants-more-eu-majors-thanks-to-madrid-crowd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Shotzzy</a> in Madrid, I learned that the interview had never left his mind. When I asked if he and Huke would consider going to London for another Call of Duty tournament, Shotzzy said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d say London, yeah. I need to do — I had a really bad interview back then, in London. I’ve got to get my get back on that interview.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since that interview, Shotzzy has gone on to win two world championships in the Call of Duty space and is one of the most entertaining and charismatic players on the mic, so it’s safe to say that if he goes back to London, he’ll be able to ‘get his get back’.</p>
