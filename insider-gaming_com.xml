<p>Pokémon Winds and Waves was revealed to the world during the Pokémon Day showcase on February 27, including the first look at the Gen 10 starters.</p>



<p>Releasing as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive in 2027, Pokémon Winds and Waves is the tenth generation of the franchise and will bring a heap of new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> into the fray.</p>



<p>While there were no new wild Pokémon revealed in the trailer, a detailed look at the Gen 10 starters was shown, and Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-pokemon-winds-amp-waves-starters">What Are The Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves Starters?</h2>



<h3 id="h-browt">Browt</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Angry bird. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Browt is a small, angry-looking bird-type Pokémon that serves as the Grass starter in Winds and Waves, standing at a measly 0.3m tall and weighing 3.5kg. It is described as the ‘Bean Chick Pokémon’, with the Overgrow ability.</p>



<p>Bird-like starters are not a new concept for the Pokémon franchise, with Browt joining the likes of Torchic and Rowlet in the category.</p>



<h3 id="h-pombon">Pombon</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Bark. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pombon is a brown, dog-like Pokémon that resembles a pomeranian, though it’s mane has some lion similarities. Pombon is 0.4m tall and weighs 6.7kg. </p>



<p>Described as the “Puppy Pokémon,” Pombon has the Blaze ability, and joins a long list of dog-like Pokémon in the franchise’s history, including Growlithe and Arcanine, who are also Fire-type.</p>



<h3 id="h-gecqua">Gecqua</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dive in. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gecqua is the Water-type starter in Pokémon Winds and Waves, standing at 0.3m tall and weighing 4.3kg. Described as the “Water Gecko Pokémon,” it has the Torrent ability.</p>



<p>Similarities will certainly be made with Treecko, another Gecko-like starter Pokémon from Ruby and Sapphire, but it’s a good choice to fit the environment of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-evolved-forms-of-the-pokemon-wind-amp-waves-starters">Do We Know The Evolved Forms of The Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves Starters?</h2>



<p>No further details are known about the Pokémon Winds and Waves starters, including their evolved forms, and reveals could be hidden until the game releases in 2027.</p>



<p>While there is certainly more to be shown from Pokémon Winds and Waves ahead of release, Pokémon always keeps a tight lid on major reveals like the fully-evolved forms of the starter Pokémon.</p>



<p>Additionally, the mid-evolution lines for the Gen 10 starters are unlikely to be shown until release, and spoilers will be at a minimum as the game is Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, meaning it can’t be datamined.</p>

<p>Pokémon Go is going all-out in a special 30th anniversary event next month, bringing back “almost all” Pokémon that have ever appeared in the game.</p>



<p>Although details were not revealed for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a>‘s 10th anniversary, which takes place later this year, a 30th anniversary event next week brings back the majority of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> that have ever featured in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-go-announces-30th-anniversary-all-out-event">Pokémon Go Announces 30th Anniversary: All Out Event</h2>



<p>Following a brief teaser during the Pokémon Presents showcase, Niantic revealed full details on the 30th Anniversary: All Out event, which takes place Saturday, March 7, to Sunday, March 8.</p>



<p>From 10am local time on the Saturday to 8pm local time on the Sunday, “almost all” Pokémon that have ever appeared in Pokémon Go will appear in specific biomes.</p>



<p>While this brings back a host of Pokémon into rotation, there are some exceptions. Mythical Pokémon, Ultra Beasts, and species of Pokémon not normally found in the wild will not feature.</p>



<p>Additionally, certain Pokémon will continue to only be available in certain regions or hatchable from eggs, and costumed Pokémon will not appear in the wild.</p>



<p>Finally, for Pokémon with multiple forms, not all forms will appear in the wild.</p>
