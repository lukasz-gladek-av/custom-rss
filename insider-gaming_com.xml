<p>The Grand Theft Auto franchise was very close to branching out with a game set in the Japanese capital of Tokyo, a former Rockstar dev confirmed, before eventually being scrapped.</p>



<p>GTA has become synonymous with the USA over the years, with Rockstar creating the likes of Liberty City, San Andreas, and Vice City as counterparts to New York, California, and Florida, and it’s been over 25 years since GTA briefly visited the streets of London, and an exit from North America now seems extremely unlikely.</p>



<p>However, a game based in Tokyo was on the agenda in the past and “almost happened,” though the idea was later scrapped.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesHub</a>, former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij, who worked on the likes of GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas, confirmed that discussions did take place for a Tokyo-based version of the game to release.</p>



<p>“We had ideas about GTA games in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and Istanbul. Tokyo almost actually happened. Another studio in Japan was going to do it, take our code and do GTA: Tokyo. But then that didn’t happen in the end,” he said.</p>



<p>With the GTA franchise ballooning further since the release of GTA V, and the huge anticipation for GTA 6, Vermeij believes the time has passed for a move to another continent to take place, and believes it wouldn’t work.</p>



<p>“People love having these wild ideas, but then when you’ve got billions of dollars riding on it, it’s too easy to go let’s do what we know again, and also America is basically the epicentre of Western culture, so everybody knows the cities, even people who haven’t been there. They have a mental image of the cities.</p>



<p>“I think it’s unlikely it’s going to be in Bogota next time, especially since there’s just more and more money involved as the project gets bigger. It doesn’t make sense to set it in some left-field location for novelty. GTA: Toronto? It just wouldn’t work.”</p>



<p>Additionally, while fans have been holding out hope for the bottom of the GTA 6 map to be expanded to include some of the Caribbean, or even Colombia, Vermeij believes it’s still unlikely to happen, even though he admits it’s something he would enjoy.</p>



<p>“I would love that. I think drug running is a good match. I was actually constantly trying to push to get that into the earlier games but it never happened. But is that what Rockstar are doing? I don’t think so. It doesn’t really make sense. It’s a lot of extra work for what it would be.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Details On Romero Games’ Xbox Title]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When Microsoft and Xbox held its wave of mass layoffs in July, one studio that was impacted in a major way Romero Games. Founded by the creator of Doom and founder of Id Software, John Romero, Romero Games had a publisher agreement with Xbox on a new title.</p>



<p>That agreement was ultimately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/romero-games-denies-its-closed-after-game-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled over the summer</a>, with the future of Romero Games left up in the air. At one point there were even rumors of the studio being shut down due to the funding being pulled, but that was denied and Romero Games moved forward.</p>







<p>Fast-forward to December, and Romero confirmed that not only is the studio moving forward, but it’s working on a new game. But what about the game that was in development. Up until now, information has been scarce. However, Insider Gaming has learned a few details about what the game was.</p>



<p>As first reported on Episode 44 of Insider Gaming Weekly, the game was known as “Hellslayer” and centered around the idea of a priest fighting demons. It was also set to be a first-person shooter that had inspiration from games like Hotline Miami in the sense that if you die, you would instantly restart the area. Sources say that it was a game that had been in the works for nearly a decade, but has been ended in its current state to move forward with a new project.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The new game is a “completely redesigned” title that takes elements from the original game. At a panel in early December, Romero said that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/john-romeros-canceled-game-has-been-saved-sort-of/">new project wasn’t being started</a> from scratch, but it will still be a “different game” than what was first planned.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned of some of those features, but to protect the source, can’t divulge them publicly at this time. Romero said that the new game was something he never played before, but if you were a fan of the older Id Software titles, you’ll likely enjoy many of the features of the new title if and when it’s finally revealed to the world.</p>
