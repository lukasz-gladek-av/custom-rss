<p>No one saw the success of Ball X Pit coming. It’s a big win for Kenny Sun and Devolver Digital that the ball-bouncing title has been such a success, and to celebrate this achievement, the first free expansion is on the way—the Regal Update due for release.</p>



<p>The name doesn’t give much away, but in essence, you descend deeper into a pit and use an assortment of balls to bat away foes and bring home resources and success. The deeper you delve, the harder it gets, and the formula has been a rip-roaring success. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-devs-announce-3-free-content-updates-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ball X Pit</a> has cleared 1 million in sales (and counting), and it’s just getting started.</p>



<p>Time to find out what’s known about the Regal Update.</p>

<p><strong>January 2026 is the launch window for the Ball X Pit Regal Update, and while the exact date isn’t known, this is confirmed to be the release window for the Regal update.</strong></p>



<p>A post on the Ball X Pit <a href="https://x.com/BALLxPIT/status/2008986900657565711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page was posted on January 7 to reassure game owners about the first proper new content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re back at full speed for our first free DLC release this month! More details are coming soon, but for now, we can confirm it will bring features many of you have been asking for since launch.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s January 8, as of writing, which means there shouldn’t be too many more days now between the debut of the update. Stay tuned for further updates and details on its arrival.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-included-with-ball-x-pit-regal-update">What’s Included With Ball X Pit Regal Update?</h2>



<p><strong>Kenny Sun hasn’t specified exact details for the Regal Update, but it promises community-driven features and at least two new characters.</strong></p>



<p>A general outlook on incoming features was revealed in the BALL x PIT Roadmap 2026 video. Updates include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Balls</li>



<li>New Evolutions</li>



<li>New Buildings</li>



<li>New Characters</li>
</ul>



<p>There will be stuff in addition to this. It’s not made clear if all of these will appear in every update.</p>



<p>Ball X Pit came out of left field to be one of the year’s best and most fun indie games. Do you think we’ll see any more updates after the initial three? What could a sequel improve upon?

<p>A new report reveals that the Nintendo Switch 2 failed to match the original console’s sales during the first holiday period. </p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been going strong in sales since its release, helping boost hardware sales across multiple months. The new console also reached a sales milestone of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-10-million-sales-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million units</a> in November 2025; however, it seems things have been declining since then. </p>



<h2 id="h-switch-2-sales-fall-over-first-holiday-period">Switch 2 Sales Fall Over First Holiday Period</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-sales-stumble-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Business</a> reveals that Switch 2 sales have slowed during the holiday period, with the change more evident in Western markets. The Switch 2 fell short by 35% in the United States when compared to the original Switch in the same period in 2017. The situation is somewhat similar in Europe, with sales of the new console 16% lower than those of the previous one in the same period in the UK. However, overall Switch 2 sales in the UK were 6% higher than Switch 1’s. </p>



<p>A senior Nintendo employee revealed that a “complicated economic landscape” and “the absence of a major Western game” make it tough to compare the Switch to the original Switch; however, the team is happy with the overall performance. Moreover, sales were down in Japan during the holiday period as well, with the Switch 1 selling 1.39 million units during its first holiday period and the Switch 2 selling 1.32 million. When taking the whole year into account in Japan, Switch 2 sales were up 11% compared to the original console. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Netflix’s new post has confirmed that 2026 is the year in which The Witcher series comes to an end. </p>



<p>We were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-final-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">informed</a> back in 2024 that Netflix’s The Witcher series would be renewed for its fifth and final season. Now that the fourth season has aired and the fifth season has been filmed, all we need to wait for is the last season to air. Netflix has confirmed that the fifth season will end its run in 2026. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-s-season-5-will-end-in-2026-bringing-the-series-to-a-close">The Witcher’s Season 5 Will End in 2026, Bringing the Series to a Close</h2>



<p>The confirmation that The Witcher series will end in 2026 comes from a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/new-shows-on-netflix-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tudum</a> post by Netflix, which talks about all the content releasing this year. The summary states that “the time of the end is nigh,” and that dark forces will be coming together across the continent to target Ciri. If Geralt and Yennefer wish to save their daughter and reunite as a family, they will have to face never-before-seen obstacles and enemies. The fifth and final season of the show will air in 2026.</p>



<p>The Witcher series is highly revered in the fan base, even after going through a major recasting with Henry Cavill exiting for Liam Hemsworth to take his place. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witchers-ciri-had-considered-leaving-with-henry-cavill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actress</a> who plays Ciri in the series also recently stated that she had considered leaving, along with Cavill. Still, she ultimately decided to return and take Henry’s role as “knowledgeable and loyal to the books,” as well as pushing for “certain lines to be included.” Even amid these twists and turns, the series has remained strong, and now fans are eagerly awaiting its epic conclusion. </p>
