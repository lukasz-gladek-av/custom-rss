<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight was easily one of the biggest reveals for Gamescom 2025. Fortunately, Insider Gaming had the chance to try the preview build of the upcoming LEGO Batman game at the event, and here are our early impressions on the preview build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight took the audience by storm at Opening Night Live, showcasing the Caped Crusader in a brand-new light, featuring iconic moments from his cinematic and comic universes while adding the beloved LEGO touch.&nbsp;It features a vast, open-world Gotham City and a narrative experience that begins with Batman’s origins and culminates in his transformation into a living legend. </p>



<h2 id="h-it-s-arkham-but-in-lego">It’s Arkham, But in LEGO</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The preview build at Gamescom allowed players to take on the roles of Batman and Commissioner Gordon as they worked together to take down crime and explore Gotham City. Both characters were unique in their functional abilities, with Batman more attuned to hand-to-hand combat, whereas Gordon focused on ranged attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both combat and movement styles are unique for the characters, each having two side abilities to choose from: Batman has a batarang that can stun enemies and the batclaw, which can grapple enemies. Gordon, on the other hand, has two types of guns: one that shoots pellets and the other that glues the enemy into a mold.&nbsp;The game also features a variety of gadgets that aid in puzzle solving; however, we have yet to see them in action. </p>



<p>The combat takes huge inspiration from the Arkham games, featuring various types of unique takedowns, stealth mechanics, and even a dodge ability that lets you vault over your enemies. Vast hordes of enemies will surround players during most situations, and they are spread across the city, breaking all kinds of laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even for a preview build, gameplay feels solid, and the developers have done a great job in finalizing the combat and traversal mechanics, allowing you to really get into the shoes of Batman.&nbsp;</p>

<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://legobatmangame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TT Games</a> has also successfully captured the essence of Gotham City. The dark and gritty vibe is on point. Moreover, there are various ways to traverse the city, including batmobiles, gliding, batclaws, and more. Just like the Arkham games, players can perch over rooftops, use the focus bar to build momentum, and transition straight into a glide to explore the city from the heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world itself is pretty extensive, not only featuring iconic locations that you may remember from the comics and the movies, but also featuring a plethora of puzzles spread across the city. Players have a lot to do in the game even when they aren’t playing the story mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts </h2>



<p>Overall, my early impressions of the game are that the developers are doing many things the right way. The gameplay and exploration are on point, and I was left wanting more as soon as my time was up. Now all we need to see is how TT games approach the story, different levels, and characters for the final build. However, given their current situation, it seems highly promising and has massive potential.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>“This actually made me Pre-Order [sic] Battlefield 6.” </strong>That sentiment is seemingly felt among a number of players as the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 gameplay reveal trailer is being hammered by the community, with many claiming they’re moving to EA’s Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two days after its reveal</a>, the Black Ops 7 trailer sits at just 42,000 likes despite having over 28 million views. That puts it at one of the lowest-liked reveal trailers in the franchise’s history. Moving to the dislikes shows even more bad news, at least on the surface. </p>



<p>Thanks to a browser extension, it shows that the Black Ops 7 gameplay trailer has 235,000 downvotes as of publishing. And it only seems to be growing in number.  For comparison purposes, the Black Ops 6 reveal trailer has just 5,452 dislikes after more than a year while the gameplay reveal is no longer available on the official Call of Duty YouTube channel.</p>

<p>Moving to the comments shows a drastically different story. Many of the top comments mention Battlefield 6, and how players are more excited or moving over to the game.</p>



<p>The previously mentioned comment about pre-ordering Battlefield 6 sits at 108,000 likes. Another comment  that says <strong>“From a COD player- thank you for making it easy to choose Bf6”</strong> has 41,000 likes.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-explained%E2%80%94possible-start-times-release-date-confirmed.1277115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After years and years of waiting, the release of Hollow Knight: Silksong is rapidly approaching, and it’s not too much longer until you can finally get your hands on the title. We’ve got all the details on the release date.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong thoroughly impressed us in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, and the positive reception immediately led to a desire from players for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-download-the-hollow-knight-silksong-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong demo</a> to be downloadable.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to add the Hollow Knight: Silksong release date to your calendar and potentially prepare to call in sick from work or school, we’ve got the precise details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-hollow-knight-silksong-coming-out">When is Hollow Knight: Silksong Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get ready. Image via Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>After years of waiting, Hollow Knight: Silksong finally has an official release date and will be available worldwide on September 4.</strong></p>



<p>First announced in February 2019, and even having a playable demo at E3 that year, it’s been a long six-year wait for fans waiting for the title. At times, you’d be forgiven for wondering if you’d be stuck waiting for the release until the end of time.</p>



<p>Team Cherry has delivered, though, with a release date much sooner than many may have expected, so it won’t be too much longer until the long wait comes to an end and you’re experiencing a historic moment in gaming history.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-hollow-knight-silksong-s-start-times">Do we Know Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s too early to provide an exact start time for Hollow Knight: Silksong and when exactly it will be playable, but we might be able to hazard a guess.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/hollow-knight-silksong" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is confirmed to be a day-one launch on Xbox Game Pass, which has a fairly set schedule for releases and the majority of titles become playable at 7am PT/9am CT/10am ET/3pm BST/12am AEST.</p>



<p>That’s only an estimate, however, but bookmark this page as we’ll update the article as soon as we have an accurate start time. For now, the release date is the most important piece of information, and after years of waiting for that to be revealed, I’m sure you can cope a little while longer for start times.</p>
