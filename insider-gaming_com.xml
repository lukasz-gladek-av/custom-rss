            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Reanimal is officially ready for launch. Publisher THQ Nordic has announced that the upcoming horror game has gone gold two months ahead of its February release.</p>



<p>The announcement came via a media release and social media post on Tuesday.</p>







<p><strong>“Co-op horror adventure Reanimal from Tarsier Studios, the creators of Little Nightmares I and II, has officially gone gold,” </strong>the publisher said. <strong>“THQ Nordic has confirmed that the game is now complete and on track for a cross-platform launch on Nintendo Switch 2™, PC, PlayStation®5, and Xbox Series X|S on Friday, February 13th, 2026!”</strong></p>



<p>Reanimal going gold signals that, aside from anything major happening, the game won’t be delayed past it’s launch date. Obviously, anything can happen so it’s not a 0% chance, but it’s a bet worth making.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, Reanimal will be <a href="https://reanimal.thqnordic.com/#order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available on current gen consoles and PC</a>. The <strong>standard edition of the game retails for $39.99</strong>. If you want a bit more, you can pick up the <strong>Digital Deluxe version for $59.99</strong>, which comes with a copy of the game, its season pass for all three chapters of DLC, and exclusive Foxhead and Muttonhead masks. </p>







<p>Want even more, the <strong>$199.99 Collector’s Edition</strong> comes with everything in the Digital Deluxe edition of the game along with the pre-order DLC, a PVC Pig Statue, metal key ring, a map poster, an 80-page hardcover artbook, three sticker sheets and a “high-quality collector’s box”.</p>



<p>If you aren’t sure if Reanimal is a game for you, there is a demo available now to download.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-divinity-will-feature-turn-based-and-co-op-gameplay-developers-confirm/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Larian has confirmed that the upcoming Divinity game will be a turn-based title with co-op gameplay. </p>



<p>For those unaware, during The Game Awards 2025, Larian came with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise announcement</a> for a new Divinity game, after saying that there were no current plans for Divinity: Original Sin 3. Days after the reveal, the developers have finally arrived with answers to the many questions players might have about the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-fans-of-baldur-s-gate-3-will-like-divinity">Fans of Baldur’s Gate 3 Will like Divinity </h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/divinity-turn-based-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gamer</a>, Larian Studios founder Swen Vincke confirmed that Divinity will feature turn-based gameplay and multiplayer. Vincke first spoke about the criticism against Baldur’s Gate 3, stating that many players felt that it was Divinity Original Sin 3 as a lot of the DNA was brought to the title. However, if players liked Baldur’s Gate 3, they will enjoy this one as well, as “it’s a turn-based RPG”, and it’s got co-op multiplayer.</p>



<p>That clears the confusion about Divinity’s gameplay style, which many players were curious about after dropping the ‘Original Sin’ from the title. Now, players want to see how developers will innovate in the turn-based genre, without incorporating Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules. They have the Original Sin series’s gameplay structure to fall back on, but it will be exciting to see how they can improve on that. </p>







<p>In other news, Divinity Original Sin 2 has received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-original-sin-2-gets-free-current-gen-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free current-gen update</a> for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2.

We had some idea about what to expect from this mod, with things like races, clique battles, first-person shooter arenas, boxing matches, and more teased. Now, we have the exact details. </p>



<h2 id="h-bully-online-mod-is-available-to-download-now">Bully Online Mod is Available to Download Now</h2>

<h2 id="h-how-to-download-bully-online">How to Download Bully Online?</h2>



<p>Check out the steps below to learn how to download the Bully Online mod on your PC. </p>



<ul>
<li>Players need to have Bully v1.200&nbsp;installed without mods, and it shouldn’t be a pirated copy of the game. </li>



<li>Then, players should download the latest version of derpy’s script loader and drag the ASI file into the game’s folder. The player should also ensure they have an ASI loader installed (such as&nbsp;dinput8.dll&nbsp;from Ultimate ASI Loader).</li>



<li>The players should download the latest&nbsp;Bully Online Launcher Pack from this <a href="https://swegta.com/online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>. </li>



<li>Players will also have to create an account on the website and then connect to swegta.com using the launcher. </li>



<li><span>Players can only use mods that change files in the&nbsp;World.</span>img&nbsp;/&nbsp;World.dir and TXD folder. Apart from that, SilentPatchBully, One Percent Better Project, and focus.asi are the only other accepted mods. If any other mods are found, the player risks being banned. </li>

            <title><![CDATA[Hollow Knight: Silksong Sea of Sorrow DLC Release Period, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-dlc-release/</link>
            <guid>1384672</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong was excruciating, but everyone is hoping the Sea of Sorrow DLC release doesn’t take years. This guide has the latest on the expansion’s release period and more.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-shadow-drop-release-was-callous-says-hell-is-us-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> finally rewarded everyone in 2025. The breathtaking Metroidvania challenged the patience of many, but piqued the interest of millions. The indie title has won awards, recouped millions in sales, and Team Cherry has already revealed the game’s first expansion.</p>



<p>As long as things go to plan, the wait won’t be anywhere near as long, which would be the Team Cherry on top of the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-dlc-releasing">When Is Hollow Knight: Silksong Sea of Sorrow DLC Releasing?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Please stick to this! Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Cherry has told everyone to expect the Hollow Knight: Silksong Sea of Sorrow DLC in 2026 and won’t disclose any further details until then.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming wishes it had more news—as the team is looking forward to more Silksong content just as much as you—but developer Team Cherry is likely aware of the pressure that comes with the release date for new Hollow Knight content.</p>



<p>Silksong descending into limbo for years was painful for everyone. It must have been just as torturous for Team Cherry, knowing the developer probably wanted to just release the content and end everyone’s wait. The wait ended up being worth it, and Silksong is one of 2025’s Game of the Year contenders.</p>



<p>This means there’s even more pressure on Sea of Sorrows (and any subsequent DLC) to be just as good. Don’t be alarmed at the sight of the word, but if the content ends up being bigger than Team Cherry plans (like Silksong), a <em>delay </em>to 2027 may not be out of the question. </p>



<p>So keep your hopes in check until further notice.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Save your Rosary Beads. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Sea of Sorrow DLC is a free expansion for Hollow Knight: Silksong owners and comes as part of the full package, and the content looks to be “nautically” themed.</strong></p>



<p>To be clear, Team Cherry could easily have charged money for whatever expansion or new content was coming the game’s way. Sea of Sorrow will do no such thing. It’s a free expansion and adds even greater value to Silksong’s already alluring and generous price tag.</p>



<p>Check out the dev’s official words on the content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“New areas, bosses, tools, and more! Hornet’s adventures continue in our nautically themed expansion, coming free for all players next year.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the Sea of Sorrow DLC trailer.</p>
