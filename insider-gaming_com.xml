<p>The Call of Duty League has published the full spread of competitive settings ahead of the 2025 season. On social media, the unveiling caused some issues with fans worldwide, especially concerning the mapset that has been lined up for the CDL 2025 season. It’s not amazing, and many fans are clinging to the hope that a resurgence of old maps will make their way into the pool.</p>

<h2 id="h-cdl-2025-season-settings-unveiled">CDL 2025 Season Settings Unveiled</h2>



<p>The map list for the 2025 season of the Call of Duty League isn’t amazing, and many are wondering why Control is still a thing.</p>



<p>Here’s the spread:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hardpoint: </strong>Protocol, Red Card, Rewind, Skyline, Vault</li>



<li><strong>Search and Destroy: </strong>Protocol, Red Card, Rewind, Skyline, Vault</li>



<li><strong>Control: </strong>Protocol, Vault</li>
</ul>



<p>Having just two maps for Control is a bit of a nightmare, and it’s yet another year that fans are clamouring and asking for a different mode to fill the competitive slot. For the longest time, people have asked for something like CTF or Blitz to make a return to the Call of Duty esports scene, to no avail.</p>



<p>The settings put forward by the Call of Duty League <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/competitive-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a recent guide</a> are mostly typical and nothing has changed from last season, but it’s in the restricted items that things start getting interesting. During the pre-season window, we’ve seen plenty of GAs get lobbied around, but the official rules from Activision are something else.</p>



<p>As usual, the need to keep things as balanced as possible is front and centre, and with that in mind, almost every perk and streak is eliminated. Only the RC-XD and Hellstorm missiles remain in the scorestreak selection.</p>

<p>As someone still actively playing Gray Zone Warfare as a sherpa for new players, I am excited and eager to try out the upcoming update. I’m certainly not alone. Most players can’t wait to return, but they want quality-of-life tweaks and AI improvements before returning. I can’t blame anyone, especially when helicopter wait times prove formidable. But this new Gray Zone Warfare update should change everything!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-next-gray-zone-warfare-update-release">When Does the Next Gray Zone Warfare Update Release?</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-night-ops-update-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next major update</a>—0.2 Night Ops—is out on <strong>November 27</strong>. We’re many months out since release, with the game launching in Early Access on April 30. Most players finished the entire storyline and all available quests within the first month of the game’s lifespan and have since eagerly awaited more or moved on to a different tactical shooter. A few of us continue playing, repeatedly running the same tasks and points of interest.</p>

<p>This is a major game update, and alongside countless fixes for the AI and additional content, like weapons, tasks, and night operations gear, there’s a wipe. Essentially, this means you’ll lose all your current progress and equipment, resetting to zero alongside everyone else.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-does-the-next-gray-zone-warfare-update-include">What Does the Next Gray Zone Warfare Update Include?</h2>



<p>The next major update for Gray Zone Warfare, dubbed Night Ops, focuses primarily on resolving many of the community’s notable issues with the gameplay experience, namely helicopter wait times and AI one-shotting everything in sight. However, it’s not without significant content additions. The update expands the core gameplay with a day and night cycle, night vision optics, IR laser sights, canted sights, new weapons, and tasks. Here’s an overview of what’s to come:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Day/Night Cycle</strong>: A 2:1 ratio with three hours of real-time gameplay making up a single day in Lamang.</li>



<li><strong>Exterior and Interior Lighting</strong>: In addition to NVGs, you can activate lamps, light barrels, and candles and illuminate or snuff out the light in your environment to gain an advantage.</li>



<li><strong>New Missions</strong>: This update features 22 tasks across the various vendors, with some designed specifically for nighttime.</li>



<li><strong>AI Improvements</strong>: AI will no longer one-shot players; they now adapt to their surroundings, taking cover and hiding in the tall grass, and will pose unique challenges by patrolling or remaining indoors at night.</li>



<li><strong>New Equipment</strong>: Night vision goggles, flashlights, laser sights, and new weapon customization attachments enter the fray.</li>



<li><strong>New Weapons</strong>: MP5, AKS-74U, and various modern AK variants.</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, we’ll see high-value loot, in-game economy alterations, reduced landing zone times, an aim-down-sight toggle option, enhanced progression systems, and more!</p>
