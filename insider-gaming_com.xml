            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 is, as we still know, coming out in November 2026. This has been reiterated numerous times by Take-Two and Rockstar Games since the original release date was pushed back <strong>for the second time</strong>. It has been a painful wait, but as far as we know, we’re getting ever closer… For now.</p>



<p>Recently, it was noted that a fresh wave of Grand Theft Auto 6 ‘title IDs’ was added to the PlayStation database, which could indicate that pre-orders are about to start rolling.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-6-could-be-priced-up-soon">GTA 6 Could Be Priced Up Soon</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, PlayStation Game Size revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">GTA 6</a> title IDs have surfaced in the PlayStation back-end. This is usually one of the last steps before pre-orders open up for a game, but there’s no hard and fast rule as to <strong>how long it takes </strong>between the IDs being listed and the prices and pre-order packages being confirmed.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Grand Theft Auto VI title IDs have been added to the PlayStation database.  </p><p>I expect we’ll see something about the game soon, probably the start of pre-orders. <a href="https://t.co/PBda1Jvr5p">pic.twitter.com/PBda1Jvr5p</a></p></div>— PlayStation Game Size (@PlaystationSize) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlaystationSize/status/2027951263602626570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>But this puts us one step closer to knowing how much GTA 6 will cost and what the pre-order bonuses for the game will be.</p>



<p>Recently, a digital storefront listed GTA 6 with a placeholder price of as much as $120, prompting concern from fans worldwide. We still have no idea how much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rockstar-games/" id="1648">Rockstar Games’</a> latest open-world epic will cost, and it’s a wildfire point of contention.</p>



<p>PlayStation Game Size addressed in a comment how long it might be before we see pre-orders go live:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To be honest, it completely depends on the publisher, and it’s not something I know for sure. </p>



<p>But I don’t think there’s going to be a long wait.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA 6 pre-order listings would represent a critical last step before a concrete launch. As they’d be digital, they’d reveal the game’s final price point, as well as what users <strong>receive </strong>for pre-ordering the game. It’ll be in-game items of some kind, but at this point, the bonuses are 100% based on conjecture.</p>







<p>Will you pre-order GTA 6 as soon as the listing becomes available? Let us know what you’re planning on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
