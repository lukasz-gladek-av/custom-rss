<p>I wasn’t very fortunate growing up when it came to gaming-based technology. I was always a generation behind, and I <strong>never </strong>got games when they were released – I’d wait to get them second-hand further down the line. When I caught up with Abubakar Salim at the BAFTA Games Awards, he echoed that with a similar sentiment – when he was young, it was one or two games a year, <strong>tops</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s partly why he posted a bold statement <a href="https://x.com/Abzybabzy/status/1907522479008203189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> when the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 console (and, by association, the games) was revealed a few days ago. He stressed that there was a good reason why he ‘fought’ to get Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the first game from his Surgent Studios, on the market with a $20 price tag.</p>



<p>Check out the full video interview here before jumping in:</p>

<h2 id="h-why-make-it-harder">‘Why Make it Harder?’</h2>



<p>The price of the Nintendo Switch 2 shocked some fans when it was revealed last week – and the price of software left more than a few folks with slack jaws. It’s a world away from the Nintendo Switch and much more than you’d expect to pay for a console that is known far and wide as <strong>the </strong>family platform.</p>



<p>But don’t worry – Nintendo has advised that if you can’t afford the Switch 2, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cant-afford-a-nintendo-switch-2-buy-a-switch-1-nintendo-says/">just opt for the first console</a> that was released back in 2017.</p>



<p>Don’t even get me started about GTA 6 and the $100 base price tag…</p>



<p>As I caught up with Abubakar at the BAFTA Games Awards in London, we got onto the topic of his post on social media and took a trip down memory lane together:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I kind of look back to myself as a kid and what I was allowed to play, and you know, I had like my one or two games that I got a year, right? </p>



<p>I’m now in a position where I’m able to play more, but I think about the kids of today and what they’re able to play and what they have access to, and I think, you know, the reason why we made Zau $20 was because it was like, ‘What’s the price of pizza? What’s the price of something that you’ll get mates around and enjoy and have an experience with’, and that was essentially where that mentality was.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a phenomenal point, and it’s at the forefront of the minds of everyone trying to pre-order a Nintendo Switch 2 as I write this. We’ve already seen the scalpers selling their pre-orders on eBay for exorbitant sums, as if it wasn’t hard enough to get one already. </p>



<p>We then started discussing Nintendo’s position in the wider industry:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>People kind of forget that accessibility also accounts to socio-economics – money, man. </p>



<p>We’re in a very tough time at the moment, so why make it harder and have that bar eventually so high? </p>



<p>Yeah, I was a bit upset about the price changes, because Nintendo is a family game, Nintendo is a family genre. It’s a family platform.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Looking to the future and what we dubbed ‘the next generation’, Abubakar explained: “I know that there’s going to be a kid out there that’s going to be inspired to play games and do what I do.”</p>

<p>Whether you are on PlayStation 5, PC, or Xbox Series X, here is everything you need to know about the cost of Blue Prince and whether the game is free.  </p>



<p>Game prices are a hotly contested topic at the moment. Nintendo fans were shocked when it was revealed that Switch 2 games cost $80 instead of $60, as seen on the first Switch console. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo defended the decision</a> by arguing that it was due to the game’s value to players. </p>



<p>Additionally, physical Switch 2 games cost more than digital and will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost up to $98</a> when converted from Euros. This is, of course, in addition to the console itself, which is expected to cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$450</a> or more. Playing video games has always been a rather expensive hobby, but not all titles are increasing in price, as is the case with Blue Prince. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-blue-prince-cost">How Much Does Blue Prince Cost?</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/BluePrince" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dogubomb community manager</a>, <strong>Blue Prince costs $29.99 / €29.99 / £24.99 on PlayStation 5, Steam, and Xbox.</strong> </p>



<p>Players can purchase the game digitally on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/blue-prince/9PFRTPRQ569Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft Store</a>. Blue Prince will not be available physically, and there is only one edition, meaning there aren’t any pre-order bonuses or early access. </p>



<p>Blue Prince will not be available on the Epic Games Store or GOG at launch. Dogubomb revealed that the game will be Steam Deck compatible, but that won’t be until a later date. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-blue-prince-free-to-play">Is Blue Prince Free to Play?</h2>



<p><strong>Blue Prince is not free to play</strong>, but it is available as a day-one release on PlayStation Plus Extra and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. </p>



<p>An Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription costs $19.99 a month, and it will set you back $14.99 a month to become a PlayStation Plus Extra member. </p>



<p>Blue Prince isn’t the only game coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-playstation-plus-game-catalog-games-announced-for-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Plus in April</a>. The fresh batch of PlayStation Plus Extra upcoming titles includes the likes of Hogwarts Legacy, EA Sports PGA Tour, and Battlefield 1. </p>



<p>As for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>&nbsp;are both day-one releases for the service. And if that wasn’t already enough,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 5</a>&nbsp;is also coming to Game Pass on April 15. </p>
