<p>Ubisoft has announced a new 60 FPS update for The Division on PS5, making the game better suited for current-gen consoles. </p>



<p>In 2025, all we have heard about the Tom Clancy’s Division franchise is details on the sequel. Last we heard about the game was in August, when we received the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-year-7-roadmap-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 7 Roadmap</a>, and it was also revealed that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘saved’ by a team of 5 developers</a>. Now, towards the end of the year, a new announcement has arrived for the 2016 The Division game. </p>

<p>Revealed by a new post on <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Tom Clancy’s The Division is the latest 2016 title to receive a current-gen update in 2025. However, the new update only increases the framerate to 60 FPS; there are no details about the resolution. The blog post states that players can expect smoother gameplay in the snow-covered streets of New York thanks to the enhanced performance. </p>

The title features a massive co-op campaign, where you can join other agents to fight the outbreak in Manhattan, across a wide range of story missions and open-world activities.
