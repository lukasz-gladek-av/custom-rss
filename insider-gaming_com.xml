<p>Nintendo has officially announced Mario Kart World for the Nintendo Switch 2. After being teased during the console’s initial reveal, we have confirmation it’s skidding onto the Switch 2 as a debut launch title.</p>



<p>The long-awaited reveal came during the company’s Nintendo Direct Switch 2 unveiling event on April 2. Mario Kart World, AKA Mario Kart 9, is the follow-up to 2014’s Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U. The game was also rereleased on the original Nintendo Switch in 2017 as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Since then, it has grown to receive dozens of new tracks and many new characters for players.</p>



<p>But it’s time for a pit stop as we’re ready to go full throttle in Mario Kart World.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World will support races with up to 24 players, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-9-could-feature-new-24-player-races/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirming what many believed</a> after the original tease in January, and introduces new dynamic levels and even rail grinding!</p>



<p>We’ve only seen a handful of Mario Kart World footage, but I can already tell you we’re going to lose hundreds of hours to Mario-theme circuits all over again!</p>

<p>It’s time for another breakout sensation in the indie gaming space. We always love to see it, and Schedule 1 has come out of nowhere to occupy millions of hours of players’ playtime to create kingpins in the making.</p>



<p>Step aside, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a>, it’s time for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-i-continues-soar-patch-notes-fifth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> to shine. I say that, but REPO continues to smash it and show there’s hope for all indie titles. Now and again, a game comes out of nowhere to RKO the gaming scene. Balatro did it in 2024, Among Us before it, and now Schedule 1 is doing the same. </p>



<p>Oddly enough, unlike REPO, which attracted a decent amount of Steam Wishlist interest, Schedule 1 has been even more low-key. This hasn’t stopped hundreds of millions of players from literally cooking up a storm.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-schedule-1">What is Schedule 1?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Check that RV for bullet holes. Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p>Schedule 1 is a crime simulator where you need to cultivate drugs and grow your vast empire across Hyland Point. Its official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> says: “Produce a range of&nbsp;drugs&nbsp;to satisfy your customers, each one with its own unique production process. Discover&nbsp;special recipes&nbsp;to create new drug variants with special properties.”</p>



<p>I can’t think of many drug simulators off the top of my head. This is probably why Schedule 1 has amassed an <strong>all-time peak of 412,713 concurrent players</strong>. We’re only 10 days removed from launch, making this figure even more staggering.</p>



<p>Right now, <strong>Schedule 1 is currently fourth in Steam’s “Top Games” list</strong>, and word of mouth is spreading minute by minute. For comparison, <strong>REPO’s all-time peak is 266,908</strong>—another unbelievable feat.</p>



<p>The sky is currently the limit for Schedule 1. With an extensive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap of content</a> already planned and potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console ports</a> on the cards, we’ll take a step back now and enjoy this high.</p>



<p>Head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a> to discuss your Schedule 1 experience with other members.</p>

<p>Schedule 1 attracted several hundred thousand players in its first week alone. The developer has outlined a consistent line of plans and future content updates for Schedule 1 through a detailed roadmap.</p>



<p>If you took one look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> as an outsider, you’d think it was a South Park-inspired game about drugs. The art style could sway this argument, but Schedule 1 is big and beastly enough to cement its own identity and status as one of 2025’s biggest indie titles. </p>



<p>Developer TVGS is releasing a lot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-i-continues-soar-patch-notes-fifth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patches</a> to keep the experience smooth and steady. But Schedule 1’s future is looking very bright, and we’ve looked at what we’ve all got to look forward to.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-upcoming-schedule-1-content">All Upcoming Schedule 1 Content</h2>

<p>Here’s a look at the developer’s ideas for Schedule 1 and which category they fall under. We love the transparency, and it means if you’re enjoying Schedule 1, you have tangible reasons to keep coming back.</p>

<h2 id="h-schedule-1-roadmap-explained">Schedule 1 Roadmap Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The official Schedule 1 Trello board has an extensive list of “Monthly Update Ideas and “Smaller Additions/Improvements.” These are listed under the “Schedule 1 Roadmap,” and each list features an assortment of new activities, gameplay ideas, mechanics, and quality-of-life ideas.</strong></p>



<p>An “In Progress” column also exists. As of writing, this is empty, so we presume TVGS is focusing on either taking some downtime to recover from the overwhelming start, hasn’t updated the <a href="https://trello.com/b/VQQpru3F/schedule-i-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schedule 1 Trello</a> yet, or is getting ready to work on a new update.</p>



<p>We’ll keep checking in to see what new ideas are floating around for Schedule 1.</p>

<p>It’s amazing what the power of the grapevine and word of mouth can do. 2025’s indie sensation was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> for the longest time, but in the blink of an eye, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-i-continues-soar-patch-notes-fifth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> kindly asked it to move over. Your meteoric ascendancy to head of Hyland Point is fueled by drugs, and the unique gameplay has turned more than a few heads.</p>



<p>Its player count has dominated the top of Steam Charts for a while, so let’s see if PlayStation and Xbox users can get in on the deal.</p>

<p><strong>As per the Schedule 1 Discord, you can’t play the crime simulator on PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 as it stands.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1256767987873091664/1267444919295803544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schedule 1 Discord</a> is home to all answers and questions about the game. But one that pops up frequently is if the title is lining up a PS4 or PS5 experience anytime soon.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the answer is a definite no for now. This might change in the future, though, depending on the success of the indie title—although if it carries on this way it won’t be “indie” for much longer!</p>

<p><strong>It’s also bad news for Microsoft fans as Schedule 1 isn’t available on Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>Let’s head back to the Schedule 1 Discord for a second. An official question is posed asking: “Will it (Schedule I) be available on Xbox/Playstation?” The developer has answered this: “<strong>Unfortunately not on release, but potentially in the future, depending on how gracious Sony/Microsoft are.</strong>“</p>



<p>I’m not entirely sure what they mean by “how gracious Sony/Microsoft are.” This might relate to the nature of the content and not allowing it on the PS or Xbox Store, but I feel this is unlikely, as we’ve seen worse. Regardless, like any indie hit on Steam, the initial buzz for Schedule 1 is outrageous, and it’s a huge success.</p>



<p>If the game can buck the trend of seeing its initial popularity disappear and become a long-standing hit in the vein of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/among-us-animated-series-trailer-revealed-during-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Us</a>, it would be <em>dope </em>to see it on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later on.</p>
