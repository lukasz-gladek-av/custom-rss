<p>The CEO of Take-Two Interactive has confirmed that no generative AI is used in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="114633">Grand Theft Auto 6.</a></p>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/strauss-zelnick-generative-ai-has-zero-part-in-what-rockstar-games-is-building-with-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick discussed his take on generative AI, stating that while he is personally enthusiastic about the technology and its practical uses in terms of saving time and money, he does not believe these tools can create great entertainment on their own and affirms that there is no generative AI usage in the upcoming release in the Grand Theft Auto franchise. </p>



<p>He would go so far as to say that GenAI has no part in what Rockstar is building and that the worlds are handcrafted.</p>



<p>“Specifically with regards to GTA 6, Generative AI has zero part in what Rockstar Games is building. Their worlds are handcrafted. That’s what differentiates them,” he said.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-6-will-have-a-physical-release">GTA 6 Will Have a Physical Release</h2>



<p>In debunking a rumor, Take-Two confirmed in its quarterly earnings report that Grand Theft Auto 6 will have a physical release. Also, marketing is slated to begin this summer. The game remains on track for release on November 19, despite several delays.</p>







<p>Generative AI is on the rise in gaming. PlayStation recently announced plans to use the technology to create podcasts featuring video game characters. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-gen-ai-fake-podcast-playstation-characters/">here</a>.</p>
