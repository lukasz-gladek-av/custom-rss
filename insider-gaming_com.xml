<p>Battlefield 6 has a huge task on its hands when it comes to the longevity and stability of the game. The beta kicked off just a couple of days ago, and the Javelin anti-cheat engine has already contended with more than 330,000 cheating attempts.</p>



<p>Recently, clips started circulating on social media showing malicious operators cheating during the beta (which is weird, stop doing that). The SPEAR team that manages Javelin (see what they did there?) pointed out that all is well, the community is making plenty of reports, and cheaters are being actively banned.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-bother">Why Bother?</h2>



<p>It’s bizarre that people are cheating during a <strong>beta </strong>of all things, but I guess these slimy, oddball cheat manufacturers have to perfect their craft somewhere ahead of the game’s release on October 10.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a report published</a> on the EA forum by the SPEAR anti-cheat team, the scope of the cheating situation was outlined:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Javelin has prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls.</p>



<p>You’ve reported 44,000 instances of potential cheaters during day one and another 60,000 so far today.</p>



<p>We are already using these with our own Gameplay Integrity team to add and improve our detections for Battlefield 6. They are also working with the Battlefield Positive Play team, to actively remove those reported we confirm to be cheaters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In recent days, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-hit-by-cheaters-clips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clips of blatant cheaters</a> captured from their perspective were uploaded and circulated on social media, putting a sizeable chink in the armor of an otherwise perfect beta.</p>



<p>It’s unsurprising, though. These days, no multiplayer game is safe from cheaters, and some have it worse than others. For instance, Escape from Tarkov’s developers recently published a file showing that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-bans-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3,600 cheaters were banned</a> in three weeks, and that kind of report comes out every few weeks from the firm.</p>



<p>Have you run into a cheater yet in the Battlefield 6 beta? Let me know what you’ve spotted on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rod Fergusson, who has served as general manager (GM) of Diablo for the last five years, is leaving Blizzard.</p>



<p>He announced the news via social media on Friday afternoon.</p>



<p><strong>“After five years of driving the Diablo franchise forward with four big launches, it’s time for me to step away from Blizzard/Microsoft, sword in hand, and see what’s next,”</strong> Fergusson <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rodfergusson.bsky.social/post/3lvvud767y223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in his post.</a> <strong>“The teams are set up for success, with an exciting slate of releases ahead. I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together and looking forward to what comes next for Diablo, and for me.”</strong></p>



<p>Fergusson joined Blizzard in 2020 after spending years working on the Gears of War franchise at The Coalition under Xbox and Epic Games previously.</p>



<p>After the move was announced, Blizzard president <a href="https://x.com/Joh_Burg/status/1953884570316943653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Johanna Faries said</a>, <strong>“Guiding a franchise like Diablo takes rare talent, vision, and collaboration. Thank you, Rod, for bringing all of those in spades. Sanctuary’s future is brighter because of the impact you’ve had!”</strong></p>



<p>Xbox head Phil Spencer added: <strong>“You brought strength, hellfire, and vision to one of gaming’s most iconic franchises. Playing Diablo IV with you was a blast—thanks for everything you gave to the game and the community.”</strong></p>



<p>As of publishing, no replacement has been named nor was a reason given for Fergusson’s departure.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima is Working ‘All By Himself’ on Physint]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-is-working-%E2%80%98all-by-himself%E2%80%99-on-physint.1265946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima’s ‘spiritual successor’ to Metal Gear Solid (if Death Stranding 2 isn’t already that) has been floating around for a while, but beyond the name, we don’t know anything else about it. It’s named Physint, and it’s an all-new action espionage title, just like Metal Gear Solid was (and remains to be).</p>



<p>It’s set to be another cinematic epic from Kojima, further blurring the lines between cinematic production and traditional video game development. However, in a recent interview, the man himself confirmed he’s working solo at the moment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-alone">All Alone</h2>



<p>Fans of Hideo Kojima’s work are nothing short of excited about the creator’s imminent return to the action espionage space, a decade after he left Konami and turned his back on Metal Gear Solid. It was a few days ago that he was grilled on the MGS series, and when asked if he plans to play the Snake Eater remake, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he just laughed</a>.</p>



<p>The expectation is that Physint, whatever form it takes, will emerge on whatever comes next for PlayStation, which right now is looking like the PlayStation 6. Did you really expect another naming convention to pop up?</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Indie Wire</a>, Hideo Kojima explained the lay of the land with Physint, mentioning that he’s working on a solo bid at the moment. It wasn’t much, but it was something:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;(I’m) also doing ‘Physint’ all by myself because that’s at the conceptual stage.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He’s planning Physint alongside the ongoing development of OD and the post-launch support of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which dropped just a few weeks ago and has been turning heads ever since.</p>



<p>The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, and the single step here is good old Hideo, using that raw brain power to create a concept that only he can concoct.</p>



<p>Do you have high hopes for Kojima’s return to action espionage games? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
