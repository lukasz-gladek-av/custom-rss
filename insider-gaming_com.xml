<p>Valve has announced a brand new limited edition white Steam Deck OLED. It will be released on November 18, 2024, at 3 PM PST and will be priced at $670 in all shipping regions for the Steam Deck. The list also includes Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong via Komodo, as well as new customers in Australia.</p>



<p>The Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White features the exact specifications as the 1TB model, the only difference being the handheld console’s new white and grey encasing. The limited edition model will also have an exclusive white carrying case and a white microfibre cloth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Valve has revealed that the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White was manufactured in “limited quantities,” and the stock has been allocated proportionately across the available regions. Hence, the US, CA, UK, EU, AU, and Komodo regions will have individual availability. Moreover, to ensure that more customers can buy this limited edition console, purchases have been restricted to 1 unit per account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, to be eligible for the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White, you will need a Steam account that has made a purchase before November 2024. Lastly, this is a limited edition release, and Valve has explicitly stated, “We will not be making more of this particular design. Once we are sold out, we will be sold out.”&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-class-action-lawsuit-shutting-down-the-crew/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft shut down the servers for The Crew in March 2024, and this decision has not been well received by the community. While fans understood the removal of the multiplayer aspect of the game, they were frustrated that the single-player mode was also made inaccessible. Now, fans have filed a lawsuit against the publishers for failing to provide an offline mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/476979/ubisoft-the-crew-shut-down-lawsuit-class-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/790913960/Crew-Lawsuit-via-Polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">court document</a> reveals that plaintiffs Matthew Cassel and Alan Liu have brought this class action against Ubisoft Entertainment S.A. and Ubisoft, Inc. on behalf of themselves and “all others similarly situated” for shutting down The Crew.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs have accused Ubisoft of duping them in several ways. Firstly, they stated that Ubisoft “misled consumers by telling them they were buying a game, when in fact, all they were renting was a limited license to access a game.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs have also alleged that Ubisoft “omitted material facts from the packaging and marketing” of The Crew. It was stated that Ubisoft didn’t mention that The Crew’s servers could be shut down at any point “without providing, at a minimum, an offline mode for consumers to continue to access the game they paid for”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, they bought physical discs, believing “The Crew itself was encoded onto physical disks consumers could buy or the digital files consumers could pay to download.” Instead, the game was on a remote server, and the physical disc acted as a key to access this server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs stated that when they purchased The Crew’s physical discs, they believed the game would be playable indefinitely without the risk of it being disabled. They also gave examples stating that Ubisoft had shut down online servers for games like Assassin’s Creed 2, Assassin’s Creed 3, and more in the past, but it patched an offline mode later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, in the case of The Crew, even after the community backlash, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-feature-offline-modes-for-long-term-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a>, stating that offline features of other games from the Crew franchise (The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest) would be preserved. But the original The Crew was left out of the list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs have demanded a trial by jury and “the aggregate claims of all members of the proposed class are in excess of $5,000,000.00, exclusive of interest and cost” as this is a class-action lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a group of modders have announced their commitment to resurrect The Crew. Also, Rainbow Six Siege made more money than any other Ubisoft franchise.

<p>It is no secret that PUBG Mobile is just as popular as its console version, PUBG: Battlegrounds. The game also has its very own ranked mode, which has a large number of players competing to climb through the system every day. But how easy is it to rank up in PUBG Mobile? Here is a list of all the PUBG Mobile ranks and how you can rank up to the top.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-pubg-mobile-ranks">All PUBG Mobile Ranks</h2>



<p>PUBG Mobile has its own set of ranks just like any other competitive game. However, a few of the game’s ranks are a bit different than the average shooter Battle Royale. </p>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in PUBG Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze</strong> (III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Crown</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Ace</strong></li>



<li><strong>Conqueror</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>PUBG Mobile’s final rank, Conqueror, is made up of the top 500 players in the server you play on, making it incredibly hard to reach. So, how does some a player get to Conqueror?</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-conqueror-in-pubg-mobile">How to Get Conqueror in PUBG Mobile</h2>



<p>Ranking up in PUBG Mobile, like any other Battle Royale, relies heavily on placement points. The longer you stay alive in a match, the more points you earn. Obviously, if you win a game, you will earn the most points. </p>



<p>But placement is not the only way to climb the ranks in PUBG Mobile. Kills are an essential aspect of ranking up in the game, as the more kills you get in a game the more points you end up with. </p>



<p>Even looting and getting assists will help you rank up in PUBG Mobile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-points-needed-to-rank-up">Points Needed to Rank Up</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the points needed to move up a rank in PUBG Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze:</strong> Below 1500</li>



<li><strong>Silver:</strong> 1500 – 1999</li>



<li><strong>Gold:</strong> 2000 – 2499</li>



<li><strong>Platinum:</strong> 2500 – 2999</li>



<li><strong>Diamond:</strong> 3000 – 3499</li>



<li><strong>Crown:</strong> 3700 – 4199</li>



<li><strong>Ace:</strong> 4200 – 4699</li>
</ul>



<p>Will you be trying to hit Conqueror in PUBG Mobile?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-halo-infinite-ranks-how-to-hit-hero/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-halo-infinite-ranks-how-to-hit-hero.1033113/</guid>

<p>Halo Infinite has a bit larger ranked system compared to other video games, with quite a few levels within each rank. However, this just adds to the thrill of trying to rank up in the game. Here are all the Halo Infinite ranks and how you can hit the final rank, Hero.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-halo-infinite-ranks">All Halo Infinite Ranks</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in Halo Infinite in order from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recruit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Onyx</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hero</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Progressing through the ranks listed above is a bit different of a system compared to other games. Let’s break it down.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-progress-through-halo-infinite-ranks-and-hit-hero">How to Progress through Halo Infinite Ranks and Hit Hero</h2>



<p>Hitting Hero in Halo Infinite is no easy feat. There are quite a few different ranks you have to climb through before getting there. Each main rank is broken up into the following smaller ranks. Below is a list from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cadet</strong></li>



<li><strong>Private</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lance Corporal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Corporal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Staff Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gunnery Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lieutenant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Captain</strong></li>



<li><strong>Major</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lt. Colonel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Colonel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Brigadier General</strong></li>



<li><strong>General</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s Military-styled system applies to all ranks except Recruit and Hero. To hit Hero, you must climb through the entire ranking system. To do so, all you have to do is play the game’s Ranked mode. </p>



<p>Losses will push you back in rank while wins and high-kill games will skyrocket you forward. Every player’s rank is also showcased on their individual profile, letting other players know just how good they actually are at the game.</p>



<p>Special events, like Double XP, do not count towards your rank progression, however. What’s even more interesting, is one’s rank does not apply skill-based matchmaking. You will be playing with random ranks as you progress through the game’s levels.</p>
