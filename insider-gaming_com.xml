<p>A huge changing of the guard has occurred behind the scenes at Sucker Punch Productions. The mega-successful developer has announced that co-founder Brian Fleming has left, and two new faces will oversee the company’s future moving forward. </p>



<p>Since 1998, Brian Fleming has served as co-founder and producer of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-ghost-of-yotei-possible-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sucker Punch</a>. The team has created banger after banger through a myriad of Sly Cooper games, inFamous titles, and the acclaimed ‘Ghost’ series, from the PlayStation 1 all the way to the PS5. But December 16 is a significant day in the studio’s illustrious history.</p>

<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment announced the big news through a blog <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/the-next-chapter-of-sucker-punch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> on December 16.</p>







<p>The article states that “The Next Chapter Begins” with Jason Connell and Adrian Bentley teaming up to take the studio forward with new releases and ideas. The statement rather transparently reveals that Fleming has actually ‘worked closely with PlayStation Studios to ensure that Sucker Punch was in the best hands moving forward’ for the last year.</p>



<p>Here’s a more in-depth look at the statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Jason and Adrian have been instrumental in shaping the creative and technical direction of Sucker Punch in recent years. Jason, who served as Co-Creative Director on the Ghost franchise, has helped define the studio’s visual identity and storytelling style, bringing cinematic depth and emotional resonance to PlayStation players around the world.</p>



<p>Adrian, as Technical Director, has led the studio’s engineering and production efforts, driving innovation across development tools and game systems that make Sucker Punch’s worlds so immersive. Together, they represent the perfect blend of creative vision and technical excellence that has always set the studio apart.</p>



<p>Nate Fox will continue as Co-Creative Director to complete the overall creative leadership team.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It closes by wishing Fleming the best and reassuring fans that Sucker Punch is in good hands with its new direction. There’s also a little eyebrow-raising line at the bottom about “Crafting new adventures.”</p>



<p>This is nothing new, as it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sucker Punch might make a new Sly Cooper or inFamous game after Ghost of Yotei</a>. There’s still no word on the studio’s next game, but it will be under new leadership.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/unrecord-tencent-investment/</link>
            <guid>1385056</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The developers behind the viral game ‘Unrecord’ have announced that it has received investment from Tencent to accelerate its development.</p>







<p>In a report via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-makes-minority-investment-in-frances-drama-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gamesindustry.biz</a>, it was said that Tencent bought a “minority stake” in Unrecord publisher Drama Games, but the percentage and investment amount was not disclosed.</p>



<p>“Since the surge of attention after our initial trailer, we’ve worked relentlessly to build a game that meets the expectations of our community,” Drama studios CEO and founder Theo Hiribarne said.</p>



<p>“In Tencent, we found not just a world-class partner, but a team genuinely passionate about our game and vision. Despite its scale, Tencent has approached this partnership with humility, respect, and a real appreciation for our creative identity. It believed in Unrecord early and has supported us at every stage of our growth. We’re confident this collaboration will help us reach our full potential.”</p>



<p>Tencent Games Europe’s VP of partnerships, Mark Maslowicz, said“Tencent believes deeply in creative talent. We’ve been consistently impressed by the drive and dynamism of Drama Studios, and the remarkable progress it has made on Unrecord, especially with such a small team and limited resources. This investment will help the studio unlock their full potential and deliver the first of many outstanding games. We’re excited to be part of Drama Studios journey.”</p>



<p>Unrecord currently has no set release date and it only targeting PC, but is currently number 9 on Steam’s wishlist chart.</p>







<p>The studio received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unrecord-developer-drama-studios-secures-2-5m-in-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.5 million in a seed series investment</a> from The Games Fund in September 2024.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Todd Howard’s Elder Scrolls 6 Comments Conflict with Fallout Claims]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-elder-scrolls-6-comments-conflict-fallout/</link>
            <guid>1384999</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Todd Howard has been all over the place recently. The visionary developer has been at the forefront of a marketing streak for the new season of the Fallout TV show, the first episode of which drops in mere hours. He has found himself staring down the microphones of many outlets, but he might have gotten a bit mixed up on recent quotes.</p>



<p>In a newly revealed interview with Game Informer, Howard said that ‘the majority of the studio’ is working on The Elder Scrolls 6, but just days ago, he was captured saying that <strong>Fallout </strong>is the franchise that the team is working on the hardest.</p>







<p>To give Howard credit, his interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a> did mention that the majority of his team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6, <strong>but </strong>the company is ‘used to overlapping development.’</p>



<p>However, stressing that most employees are engaged on The Elder Scrolls 6, while also saying that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fallout is the franchise</a> that Bethesda Game Studios is ‘doing the most in right now’ is a little confusing.</p>



<p>GamesRadar captured <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/bethesdas-todd-howard-says-fallout-76-is-the-game-were-still-doing-the-most-work-in-and-fans-of-the-prime-tv-show-should-give-it-a-try/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another quote</a> where Todd was talking about a similar topic and said that Fallout 76 is specifically ‘the game we’re still doing the most work in.’</p>



<p>Perhaps Todd Howard is jetlagged from flying all over the world to promote the Fallout television show. From what we know, The Elder Scrolls 6 is the next game in the pipeline once Starfield’s development cycle has wrapped (although it might have already), and then Fallout 5 comes next.</p>



<p>In the interim, fans of the post-apocalyptic series are still expectant of a Fallout 3: Remastered or a Fallout: New Vegas 2. Aside from years-old rumors and old documents, there’s little to suggest they’re close to being released.</p>



<p>Would you rather have The Elder Scrolls 6 or Fallout 5 right now? Let us know how you’d decide on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-new-experience-dying-light-universe/</link>
            <guid>1384918</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Techland released Dying Light: The Beast in September, and it became regarded as one of the gems of the ten-year-old franchise. It reintroduced Kyle Crane to the series, cast players into a gorgeous, dense world, and kick-started more games with something of a cliffhanger ending.</p>



<p>Now, thanks to a new job listing uncovered at the heart of Techland, it seems that the developer is already hard at work on the next Dying Light experience. The team is looking to expand, adding a Lead Online Game Designer to lean into a new ‘online experience in the Dying Light universe.’</p>







<h2 id="h-is-dying-light-3-coming-soon">Is Dying Light 3 Coming Soon?</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast was viewed by Techland as Dying Light 3, even if it didn’t adopt that moniker. The game, which is one of our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-review/">top-rated games of 2025</a>, was incredibly well-received by fans of the zombie-slashing franchise. The closing moments of the game reveal that more is incoming, but there’s no indication of <strong>when </strong>we’ll get another game.</p>



<p>It might not take <strong>that long</strong>, as Techland appears to have entered development on whatever might come next.</p>



<p>Whether that’s a full-fledged game or something of a spin-off, like many thought The Beast was, we just don’t know. From speaking to franchise director, Tymon Smektala, we know that there are stacks of ideas in the pipeline for Dying Light.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dying-light/new-game-techland-job-post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a> uncovered a job listing at Techland for a Lead Online Game Designer. Amongst other things, the listing said that the successful candidate will ‘define the framework and structure for a new online experience in the Dying Light franchise’.</p>



<p>Technically, every Dying Light game since the first surfaced in 2015 has been an online game, so there’s nothing new there, but the uttering of that very word, ‘new’, is enough to get fans salivating.</p>



<p>For now, we should stress again that nothing is confirmed until it’s confirmed, and this might be for nothing more than a small spin-off game.</p>
