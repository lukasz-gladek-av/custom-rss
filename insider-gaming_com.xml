            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kyedae and TenZ, the esports and content sweethearts who got engaged almost four years ago, have announced an amicable split on social media. The pair, who made their name competing in and streaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/valorant/" id="215">VALORANT</a>, became an iconic duo and one of the most recognisable romantic powerhouses in the modern gaming space.</p>



<p>In a lengthy post on social media, Kyedae revealed that they’ve been separated for ‘quite some time’ and that the break-up hasn’t come from a place of resentment or failure.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-did-kyedae-and-tenz-split-up">Why Did Kyedae and TenZ Split Up?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/kyedae/status/2020324209852031174" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full post</a> from Kyedae on social media outlines the situation:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey everybody,</p>



<p>Tyson (TenZ) and I feel ready to share some personal news.</p>



<p>We’ve actually been broken up for quite some time now. Toward the end of our relationship, we came to a realization that wasn’t easy to accept: we had stopped growing as individuals.</p>



<p>For most of our relationship, we did everything together.<br>Work — together.<br>Hobbies and interests — together.<br>Pretty much everything — together.</p>



<p>We’ve even joked in the past that although we were together for six years,&nbsp;<strong>it felt like at least thirty</strong>.</p>



<p>We moved in together just weeks after meeting, and from ages 17 to 24, that was all we knew. Over time, it became clear that we needed space to grow into our own people.</p>



<p>We know the internet often looks for “the tea” but the truth is sirnple —&nbsp;<strong>we grew apart</strong>.<br>There was no wrongdoing, no resentment, and no single event that caused this.</p>



<p>We still care deeply about each other and genuinely want the best for one another,<br>We’re also incredibly grateful for the time and life we shared together!</p>



<p>Thank you for respecting our privacy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rumors concerning the split had been circulating in streaming and social circles for some time, and this post effectively puts a nail in the coffin for them.</p>



<p>The pair were quick to get ahead of comments claiming that their engagement post from August 2022 ‘did not age well’, poking fun at themselves in a self-deprecating manner to beat the trolls.</p>



<p>It has admittedly been a rocky few years for the duo. TenZ announced his retirement from competing last year, and in 2023, Kyedae revealed <a href="https://x.com/kyedae/status/1631452687077363713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a cancer diagnosis</a> that eventually took her out of the streaming space indefinitely.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam’s Newest Feature is Huge for Early Access Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-new-early-access-feature-huge-for-games/</link>
            <guid>1429279</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Have you ever invested time, money, and effort into an early access game on Steam and wondered exactly when it’ll <span><strong>leave&nbsp;</strong>early access and graduate to</span> a full release? You’re not alone, and Valve has recognized that. In a recent update, the team behind Steam revealed that a new feature will give early access games greater transparency into their schedules.</p>



<p>When developers list early access products on Steam, they now have a visible field to indicate when the game will leave early access, whether that’s the <strong>year </strong>or the <strong>exact day</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-early-access-games-are-some-of-the-best">Early Access Games Are Some of the Best</h2>



<p>In the last few years, we’ve seen countless early access titles surface on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/steam/" id="173">Steam</a> and flourish, using the time granted by an earlier push to generate funds for the full development of a new title. In some cases, early access games flounder and fall, especially if they take a long time to <strong>leave </strong>that state.</p>



<p>But sometimes, an early access gem will appear, stick to a roadmap, and hit a full launch deadline without any issues.</p>



<p>The most recent example that rings true to that is Endnight’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/sons-of-the-forest/" id="320">Sons of the Forest</a>, which was released in early access and then launched as a full game exactly one year later, storming to success on Steam.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/500597484211404992?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new blog post</a>, Valve revealed that the early access date field is being added to promote better transparency for early adopters.</p>



<p>The team explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Occasionally, developers with a game in Early Access would ask us proactively if there was any official place to display a planned 1.0 date. They wanted existing and potential players to know about their plans. Many studios were already sharing their 1.0 dates in other places– within the text description on the store page, via Steam Event news posts, on social media, in their forums, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, they advised against using it <strong>just to use it</strong>, stressing that developers should only add a date if they’re relatively confident they’ll hit it. Otherwise, they risk running into trouble with their prospective fans.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout 76 Crossplay is Closer Than Ever and Fans Remain Hopeful]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-crossplay-closer-than-ever/</link>
            <guid>1429276</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Anyone who is anyone in the <em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout-76/" id="438">Fallout 76</a></em> space knows about the game’s glaring lack of crossplay mechanics. It has been one of the biggest sticking points for players over the years, exacerbated by the fact that <strong>so many similar games </strong>have crossplay features.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios is well aware of the yearning players have to blow open the Fallout 76 ecosystem. Last year, we sat down with the team in Los Angeles and learned how difficult it would be to <strong>add </strong>crossplay to Fallout 76, and in a new interview, that was reiterated.</p>



<p>But the way it was framed suggests <strong>it’s now a plan</strong>… <strong>Almost</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-fallout-76-ever-get-crossplay">Will Fallout 76 Ever Get Crossplay?</h2>



<p>In June 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-still-thinking-about-fallout-76-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we sat down with Bethesda’s</a> Jon Rush and Bill LaCoste to talk about Gone Fission, the most recent Fallout 76 update at the time. One of the key questions we asked concerned crossplay and cross-progression mechanics, to which Bill said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>People ask us that all the time. And the thing for us, it has been more of a technical challenge for us to be able to do that. It’s not that we don’t think about it,&nbsp;<strong>we think about it often</strong>.</p>



<p>But, overall, <strong>no real plans</strong> right now to introduce crossplay, but certainly, we get asked to consider it very often, so we do.</p>



<p>Maybe in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In October, another interview surfaced between Bethesda Game Studios and the Iron Lords, and <strong>again</strong>, it was stressed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/its-never-a-no-fallout-76-crossplay-addressed-by-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they’re asked about Fallout 76 crossplay</a> all the time, but there were ‘no real plans’ to introduce the feature, much to the chagrin of players:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s never a no, right?</p>



<p>But what I will say, is that those are decisions usually made at the very beginning of development, and right now it’s a huge technical lift for us to have crossplay or cross-progression on it (Fallout 76).</p>



<p>It’s something we get asked about constantly from players. I understand why, I feel the same way. I’d love to go play on Steam and then go play on Xbox or PlayStation and just have my character, but right now, <strong>it’s a little bit too difficult for us to pull off</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>But then </strong>the pair appeared in yet another interview, this time with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout-76-crossplay-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, and it seems things have changed. Rush and LaCoste altered their direction on the Fallout 76 crossplay topic, going from ‘too difficult’ and ‘no real plans’ to something much more tangible.</p>



<p>Jon Rush said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are looking into it, and we have plans to try to scope out what that work is going to entail for us.</p>



<p>It’s just not in the immediate plans for us. We know players want it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And he was backed up by LaCoste:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What we can promise players is that we will continue to investigate, we will continue to try to establish plans to make that a thing in the future, just not in the short term.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a little weak, but Jon’s comment about ‘we have plans’ and ‘we are looking into it’ is perhaps the closest we’ve ever gotten to the Fallout 76 crossplay debate being resolved. If they’re sizing up the technical delivery of crossplay mechanics, we’re one step nearer to playing with our friends across those gaming borders.</p>

<p>WWE 2K26’s gameplay designer, Cornell Gunter, is very excited about the ragdoll physics in the upcoming video game. He says the new gameplay tweaks will allow wrestling moves to connect properly with weapons instead of being hampered by invisible barriers.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> is set to release worldwide on March 13. This year’s game features the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273">several match types</a> to WWE video games, including Inferno Matches and 3 Stages of Hell, and several new gameplay improvements. </p>







<h2 id="h-no-more-invisible-walls-when-slamming-wrestlers-onto-weapons-in-wwe-2k26">No More Invisible Walls When Slamming Wrestlers Onto Weapons in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/m935QSZHAfI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JustBryan,</a> WWE 2K26 gameplay designer Cornell Gunter said his favorite improved gameplay mechanic is the addition of ragdoll physics to the game.</p>



<p>Gunter praised the removal of “invisible walls” and how it allows players to use weapons in more creative ways, enhancing the realism that sometimes occurs in wild, anything-goes matches on WWE television.</p>



<p>“Being able to remove that invisible wall when you’re performing moves and performing certain things like that, which is very important to us,” he said. “Being able to watch the collision and the figures of how the superstars react when they’re hitting weapons and all those kinds of things… Those are the things I’m really excited about for gameplay.”</p>

<h2 id="h-more-features-in-wwe-2k26">More Features in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 also features several improvements that give players more control over the realism in matches, starting well before the bell rings. Players can customize how much pyro goes off, which camera angles are used, and more during wrestler entrances this year.</p>



<p>Also, there’s a new AI customization that lets players create sequences of moves the AI will always try to hit in succession, adding realism to every match.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="96820">Embark Studios</a> CEO Patrick Söderlund responds to players who aren’t fully satisfied with the current ARC Raiders roadmap.</p>



<p>In a sea of live service games that can turn into a watery grave far too soon, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a> has managed to catch on and become a hit with players worldwide. It even won Best Multiplayer Game at the Game Awards in 2025.</p>



<p>Embark recently released a roadmap for the game detailing upcoming additions, including new maps and more. However, not all players are fully satisfied with the game’s current direction, as they feel the roadmap doesn’t provide enough incentive to keep playing.</p>







<h2 id="h-embark-ceo-acknowledges-player-frustration-with-arc-raiders-roadmap">Embark CEO Acknowledges Player Frustration With ARC Raiders Roadmap</h2>

Notably, he wants dissatisfied players to understand that they are heard, and he even claims he would feel the same if he were in their shoes, but only because they do not yet have full details.</p>



<p>“If we get into the studio development schedule and make that public, we’re probably going to be in a world of hurt,” he said.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Söderlund stated that they are developing things as they go. However, he says players will see that the patch notes are very detailed and that the organization wants to be seen as transparent. He knows that some won’t forgive if they cannot deliver on certain wants, but his main goal is to provide continuous updates to the game, saying he feels it’s worth its $40 price tag.</p>



<p>“From the beginning of January, whenever everyone was back, we’re working around the clock to deliver as much content as we can to players,” he said.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cold Snap is Coming Back to ARC Raiders as a Regular Map Condition]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cold-snap-coming-back-arc-raiders/</link>
            <guid>1429084</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Cold Snap, the festive-themed update that introduced Candleberries, a new event, and some harsh, inclement weather, is <strong>coming back to ARC Raiders </strong>as a map condition in the regular rotation. This will join the pool made up of the likes of Harvester, Hidden Bunker, and Electromagnetic Storm, even if it <strong>doesn’t make much sense</strong>.</p>



<p>In December, Cold Snap came around because it was a winter-themed event bursting with festive potential. It existing beyond that feels a little strange, and it’s being passed off by Embark Studios as ‘sporadic snowfall’.</p>







<h2 id="h-doesn-t-make-sense-but-okay">Doesn’t Make Sense, But Okay</h2>



<p>Cold Snap was a limited-time map condition that existed to serve a purpose, and that was the facilitation of the new festive LTM and new player project. Now that the festive window is over, the condition has understandably moved on, arguably to make way <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-arc-raiders-map-condition-named-toxic-swamp/"><strong>for more </strong>map conditions</a>, coming as soon as later this month.</p>



<p>But <strong>wait!</strong></p>



<p>Embark Studios has taken Cold Snap and injected it back into the map rotation for ‘the foreseeable future’. From February 10, Cold Snap will be a playable condition once again, with blizzards freezing maps, blanketing them in thick snow, and making it a hazardous concept to even creep outside.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Clear skies and sunny temperatures are predicted for Topside this weekend, but don't pack your winter gear away yet folks; the weather towers are predicting sporadic snowfall in the foreseeable future!<br>The Cold Snap returns to our regular rotation of conditions from February 10… <a href="https://t.co/J4OACyBc9y">pic.twitter.com/J4OACyBc9y</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2020180761849331776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Fans were quick to point out that this is the epitome of reusing and recycling content, and it comes mere weeks after the map condition was <strong>removed </strong>from the pool, which was always going to be the plan.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-four-months-content/">ARC Raiders roadmap</a> suggests we’re getting a new map condition soon, and based on earlier scouting, it should be <strong>Toxic Swamp</strong>, but it could still be up to three weeks away.</p>

<p>Another week draws to a close, and hopefully, your NYT Connections streak <strong>persists</strong>. We’re cutting fast through February and will be bidding farewell to the winter months soon enough, but you know what we’re <strong>not </strong>bidding farewell to today? That’s right – today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full scope of today’s NYT Connections answers, to get this puzzle done as quickly as possible.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>
