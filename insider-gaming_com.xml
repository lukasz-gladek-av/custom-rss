<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943650/FragPunk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FragPunk</a>, the newly released tactical hero shooter from Bad Guitar Studio, features a cast of playable characters called Lancers. Each Lancers has their own set of abilities, providing multiple ways for players to utilize and maximize the Shard Cards that make each round unique.</p>



<p>At time of writing, less than a week after the game’s March 6th release, there are 13 playable Lancers in FragPunk. The variety in Lancers means there’s a character for every playstyle, but some are simply stronger than others. Here are the best Lancers in the FragPunk roster right now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-fragpunk-lancers">Best FragPunk Lancers</h2>



<h3 id="h-hollowpoint">Hollowpoint</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hollowpoint excels at gathering info and holding angles. Her railgun, Meteora, is a single-shot sniper rifle that deals maximum damage after a short charge, and it also recharges ammunition over time. Paparazzi is a trap that automatically attaches to and reveals enemy players, making it super useful when defending sites or catching flankers.</p>



<p>Smoke Screen is a slow-moving source of cover that blocks off wide angles and highlights enemies hit by it. It can be stopped manually as well to close off a chokepoint, and it can go through walls to reveal unsuspecting enemies.</p>



<h3 id="h-pathojen">Pathojen</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Pathojen is the perfect support Lancer, providing healing to the whole team plus abilities that can hinder attacker plants and defender retakes. Her Emotional Rescue ability is a wide area-of-effect healing ability that heals everyone in range. If your team took damage getting into the site, they can all huddle together and heal before the opposing retake try occurs.</p>



<p>Pathojen can also throw down her Killer Queen trap, which deals damage over time to enemy players after it is triggered or activated manually. Finally, her Shroom Wall can block the enemies from rushing into site or pulling off a quick flank.</p>



<h3 id="h-broker">Broker</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Broker is the very first Lancer you get to play, via the tutorial, but he’s one you should consider sticking with. His most prolific ability is Goddard’s Vengeance, an easy to use but explosive rocket launcher that deals massive damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cherry Bomb is a very useful ability as well, as it creates a cluster of energy bombs that will pretty much vaporize anyone who touches them. They’re easy to spot and destroy, but even doing so will give Broker players information about where the enemy is coming from. Finally, his Smokestack Lightning ability creates a huge wall of smoke that can provide extensive cover for his whole team.</p>



<h3 id="h-corona">Corona</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re a fan of the duelist class of agents in VALORANT, then Corona is the perfect Lancer for you. Fast Lane, while ironically sharing the name of a Neon ability from Riot’s shooter, is more like Jett’s Dash. Corona can use Fast Lane to dash forwards or upwards, allowing him to get to cover and take space.</p>



<p>Ashes to Ashes is a powerful molotov-like throwable that damages enemies caught in it, but it also provides Corona with damage reduction and a speed boost. In a pinch, Corona can use it on himself to give him the edge in a firefight. Finally, Corona can use Hothead to blind all enemies looking at him after a short charge. This flash ability is so unique compared to traditional thrown blinding abilities that you’re certain to catch numerous enemy players off guard.</p>

<p>FragPunk is a fresh tactical hero shooter with a unique twist, and the debut title from Bad Guitar Studio is already attracting a steadily growing player count in 2025.</p>



<p>There’s certainly no shortage of live-service online multiplayer titles, and in recent years there’s been an increase in tactical shooters and hero shooters. FragPunk falls under both categories, so how well is it doing in attracting players? The game only just released on March 6th, but the early results for FragPunk are pretty positive.</p>



<h2 id="h-fragpunk-player-count-march-2025">FragPunk Player Count (March 2025)</h2>



<p>FragPunk’s player count peaked at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2943650/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">113,946 players on Steam</a> during the game’s opening weekend. In the game’s first three full days, FragPunk reached a new peak each day: 63,958 players on March 7th, 85,203 on March 8th, and 113,946 on March 9th. Almost more impressively, FragPunk drew a player peak of over 100,000 players on March 10th on a Monday.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Currently, the numbers for FragPunk are only for PC players on Steam. Just before the game’s PC launch, the devs announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-console-release-latest-playstation-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the console versions for PS5 and Xbox had been delayed</a> due to “unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaptation.” The console release for FragPunk has now been pushed back to an undetermined date.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fragpunk-worth-playing">Is FragPunk Worth Playing?</h2>



<p>As a free-to-play game trying something new in the hero/tactical shooter space, FragPunk is certainly worth trying and playing in 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What sets FragPunk apart from other shooters in the genre is its reliance on Shard Cards. In the game’s standard mode reminiscent of CS2, VALORANT, and Call of Duty’s Search &amp; Destroy mode, the attacking team attempts to plant a Converter at a site while the other team defends. Players earn Shard points, and a team can use those points on Shard Cards in between rounds for unique buffs and effects. There are 169 different Shard Cards, each with its own unique effect. These effects range from basic movement or damage buffs to a “Turtleback” that blocks bullets from behind, or a snow effect that lets players slide around the map.</p>



<p>For the collector types, there are weapon skins, Lancer skins, stickers, and emotes to collect.</p>

<p>Postal 2 is back for a brand new audience. Developer Running with Scissors has revealed Postal 2 VR for PlayStation VR2, Steam VR, and Meta Quest.</p>



<p>The VR port comes 22 years after the game’s original release in 2003.</p>



<p>“For the first time ever, POSTAL 2 is fully reimagined for VR, bringing its dark humor, open-world mayhem, and unapologetic absurdity to an entirely new level,” the game’s description reads. “Step into the well-worn boots of The POSTAL Dude, a hapless everyman just trying to get through the week in the bizarre town of Paradise, Arizona. Whether you choose to play it cool or go completely POSTAL is entirely up to you.”</p>

<p>According to the developers, the game will “take full advantage of virtual reality”.</p>



<p>“Feel every reload with manual weapon handling, interact with NPCs like never before using gesture-based reactions, and navigate the chaos with an overhauled inventory and minimap system designed specifically for VR,” they said.</p>



<p>“This is POSTAL 2 like you’ve never experienced before—fully unhinged, wildly immersive, and ready to let you loose in the most chaotic VR playground imaginable.”</p>



<p>An official release date will be announced in the future. In the mean time, you can check out the official reveal trailer for the game, below.</p>
