<p>Intel is preparing to reveal its next generation of graphics cards, and it looks like some early specs have been leaked thanks to a, now removed, store listing.</p>



<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gxp8e0/amazon_has_leaked_a_few_intel_arc_b580_gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">accidently listed</a>, then removed, what appeared to be two Intel Battlemage GPUs from ASRock. According to the store listing, the Intel Arc B580 features 12GB of GDDR6 memory with a speed of 19Gbps. The card also features a 192-bit memory bus which would result in a 456 GB/s or so bandwidth.</p>







<p>A couple interesting bits from the listing were the cards being PCIe x8 only as opposed to x16. Regarding boost frequency, the listing suggested a 2.8 GHz boost frequency compared to a 2.0 GHz from the Arc A580.</p>



<p>When reached for comment in the past, Intel has declined to comment on any rumor or speculation. That said, a store listing adds credence to rumors that an announcement of their new graphics cards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was set to come in December</a>.</p>

<p>Fortnite has officially confirmed the return of one of the most popular meta moves in the game, Double Pump. Players can Double Pump their way to a Victory Royale with the start of OG Chapter 1 Season 1 on December 6, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite revealed the return of the Double Pump for OG Chapter 1 Season 1 in a unique way this time. Before officially confirming on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1860006119420174525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the official Fortnite Twitch account took the chats of certain popular streamers to make the reveal. Streamers like <a href="https://x.com/DrLupo/status/1860003558051184758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr Lupo</a>, <a href="https://x.com/sparkles_qt/status/1860001598971478132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">100T Sparkles_qt</a> and more saw Fortnite enter their chat to state, “hey, chat…double pump returning December 6 with OG chapter 1 season 1, btw”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the announcement of Double Pump’s return to Fortnite, fans have started speculating what else could return along with OG Chapter 1 Season 1. Players wonder whether other elements, such as original weapon models, the UI, the OG Scar Sound, and more, could also make an appearance. As we all know, Fortnite’s OG Chapter 1 Season 1 has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-fortnite-map-returning-permanently-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to return permanently</a> this December, so the developers might have a lot more planned this time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Double Pump was one of the most popular moves during standoffs in OG Fortnite. Players would set two Pump Shotguns next to each other in their inventory and swap while shooting to fire multiple bullets in quick succession. Thanks to its aggressive approach, Double Pump became one of the most used tactics in the original chapter, and fans are delighted to see the return of this meta move.&nbsp;</p>
