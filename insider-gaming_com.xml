<p>Marvel Rivals is gearing up for Season 5 and its first anniversary celebrations, but teases for the next two characters potentially being introduced in the game have surfaced—including Deadpool.</p>



<p>Season 5 is bringing X-Men duo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-trailer-officially-reveals-rogue-and-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gambit and Rogue into the fray for Season 5</a>, with the former available from the season start on November 14, expanding the roster of characters available to 45, and there are no signs of stopping.</p>



<p>NetEase has regularly teased which characters are coming soon in in-game lore, which previously teased the additions of Angela and Daredevil in Season 4, and fresh teases that may have revealed the two characters coming in Season 6.</p>







<h2 id="h-deadpool-amp-elsa-bloodstone-teases-in-marvel-rivals-season-5">Deadpool &amp; Elsa Bloodstone Teases in Marvel Rivals Season 5</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Deadly. Image via Marvel</figcaption></figure>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAssembled/status/1988511207569895885" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RivalsAssembled on X</a>, the Season 5 gallery card drops a major hint that Deadpool and Elsa Bloodstone are lined up as the next two characters to join the game.</p>



<p>On the gallery card, it teases “Earth-born operatives” that have been “working behind the scenes,” describing the pair as including a “blathering, foul-mouthed mercenary and a monster hunter as deadly as she is beautiful.”</p>



<p>The brief descriptions certainly fit Deadpool, widely known as the Merc with a Mouth, and, while Elsa Bloodstone isn’t as much of a mainstream name as Wade Wilson, the description accurately highlights her.</p>







<p>Of course, nothing is guaranteed at this stage, but Marvel Rivals developers have always been very clever with their placement of easter eggs in the game, following them up with full reveals later down the line.</p>



<p>The pair aren’t the only teases from Season 5, however, as the reveal trailer included a shot of Cyclops attending the wedding of Rogue and Gambit, while Professor X’s voice played over part of the video.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is rapidly approaching its first anniversary, and NetEase has revealed that all players will receive 2500 Units later this month to celebrate.</p>



<p>The PvP hero shooter has come on leaps and bounds in the past year, with regular seasonal transitions introducing new characters, maps, and game modes, and Season 5 is making some major changes.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-trailer-officially-reveals-rogue-and-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X-Men Rogue and Ga</a>mbit headline the additions for Season 5, but it’s a gift from the developers that will catch the eye of most players.</p>

<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20251111/40954_1270383.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dev Vision video</a> ahead of the start of Season 5 on November 14, Marvel Rivals director Guangguang revealed that players will receive 2500 Units, the equivalent of $25, in-game as part of the Anniversary Celebration kicking off on November 27.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Celebration event will also allow players to earn a free Legendary Jeff the Land Shark skin, while other Anniversary-themed costumes will be added to the game to purchase.</p>



<p>Season 5 in Marvel Rivals also has plenty of other big additions to the game, including a new social hub that can fit up to 100 players, the long-awaited introduction of cross-progression in the game, and placement matches being added to Ranked—something that the community has been crying out for.</p>







<p>Season 5 kicks off on Friday, November 14 and will last until January 2026, with a mid-season break to introduce Season 5.5 that brings Rogue to the game as the latest playable character.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The extraction genre is having a defining moment. From the gritty realism of Escape from Tarkov to the retro-futuristic chaos of ARC Raiders, gamers are flocking to these more challenging-than-most titles that fuse looting, survival, and high-stakes choice-and-consequence gameplay loops.</p>



<p>Even satirical titles like Escape from Duckov, packed with absurd mechanics and visuals, are finding solid audiences and millions of sales. But why? Because extraction shooters tap into something deeper than just gameplay: they simulate risk and tension in a way that no other genre can.</p>











<p>At their core, extraction shooters are typically built around loss aversion and delayed gratification concepts. Every raid is a gamble, every crate or box opened is like spinning a slot machine, and finishing up an intense, high-value run releases an immense burst of dopamine-fuelled satisfaction that’s almost unmatched in gaming.</p>



<p>Players entire deeply hostile zones in extraction shooters, and set about completing quests, gathering loot, and fighting enemies both human and AI-driven. The kicker is that they <strong>must </strong>extract to keep their loot, and a single misstep can lead to crumbling fortunes.</p>



<p>Every decision – engage or evade, loot or leave – is loaded with consequence and consideration. This mirrors real-world psychological triggers, and it gets those synapses firing.</p>



<ul>
<li>Loss Aversion, otherwise known in the extraction space as ‘Gear Fear’, gives you a sense of acute ownership over the loot you collect, and the thought of losing it again increases anxiety</li>



<li>Variable Rewards, which tie into the gambling mechanic, mean that you never know what you’ll find in a room or a box, which makes you want to keep opening more, especially when you get a rare item</li>



<li>Mastery and Progression, the mechanics of which encourage players to learn the best loot routes, methods, combat metas, and more, in a bid to become as wealthy or powerful as possible</li>
</ul>



<p>This sublime cocktail of tension, reward, and trepidation creates a psychological loop that’s more potent than traditional run-and-gun multiplayer shooters.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-arc-raiders-different">Why is ARC Raiders Different?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>ARC Raiders is changing the face of the genre</figcaption></figure>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is the number one extraction shooter on the market right now, and it has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-steam-majority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved millions of sales</a> and record-high scores for the genre. It’ll be challenged by Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release, set to drop on November 15, but for now, it’s doing just fine.</p>



<p>Embark Studios poured a little something special into the extraction shooter formula in ARC Raiders, and it has proven to be a huge success. In ARC Raiders, players are encouraged to lean on team synergy, social mechanics, and more intricate player guidance systems to enjoy a much more accessible entry point into the extraction shooter genre.</p>



<p>That mainstream appeal has brought fresh eyes into the genre, which has long been gatekept by its own intensity and inherently challenging aura.</p>



<p>The shift opens up the genre to players who might have bounced off Escape from Tarkov’s steep and unforgiving learning curve. It’s proof that extraction shooters don’t have to be exclusive to ‘talented’ gamers, and it also proves that you can get that dopamine hit and gambling-like gameplay loop in a game that some consider ‘easier’.</p>











<figure><figcaption>10 years later, Escape from Tarkov is being released</figcaption></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov is about to debut on Steam, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hitting a 1.0 state</a> after <strong>ten years </strong>in testing. It’s one of the biggest evolutions the game will have ever seen, and it’ll propel the title into a place of extreme popularity once again.</p>



<p>In the meantime, ARC Raiders will continue to soar, hold a solid community, and receive updates from Embark Studios that keep it fresh and engaging.</p>



<p>We can easily expect more extraction shooters to surface soon. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-extraction-shooter-dumb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s Marathon</a> is set to be released by March 2026, and there is every opportunity for top-tier titles like Call of Duty and Battlefield to dip back into the extraction market.</p>



<p>It might be that we see cross-genre blending become more prevalent. How about a horror-based extraction shooter or one with deeper RPG mechanics and progression paths?</p>



<p>There’s a lot of potential in this space, and love them or hate them, extraction shooters are here to stay.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blast-r6-major-munich-playoffs-bracket-is-set%E2%80%94let%E2%80%99s-talk-predictions.1350829/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Swiss Stage of the massive BLAST R6 Major in Munich has just wrapped, slicing out half the competing teams and leaving us with the final eight squads fighting for the lion’s share of the $750,000 prize pool. The winner also unlocks direct qualification to the Six Invitational, so there’s plenty on the line.</p>



<p>Leading the charge are M80 and Team Falcons, sitting in a prime position after earning byes by topping the board in the Swiss Stage. It’s a mixed bunch that’s left, but which team is most likely to walk away with the trophy at the BLAST R6 Major in Munich? Let’s take a look at the predictions.</p>







<h2 id="h-blast-r6-major-munich-predictions">BLAST R6 Major Munich Predictions</h2>



<p>The BLAST R6 Major Munich playoffs kick off in just a few hours, opening with a tense match between FaZe Clan and Wildcard. The grand final is set for November 16, and there’s a lot of ground to cover before then.</p>



<p>M80 and Team Falcons have proven to be something special thus far in the tournament. They’ve emerged with some aggressive map control and clean strats, pushing M80 especially into the limelight with an undefeated streak.</p>



<p>But will either team be able to secure the trophy this time around?</p>



<p>M80’s discipline might edge out any opponents coming forth, but FaZe Clan has a chance to make an upper bracket run after a tumultuous Swiss Stage. Some are hoping that Wildcard can make a break for the grand final, which, if it does, will make history as it’ll be the furthest an APAC team has got in years.</p>







<p>It’s a stellar run thus far for M80, relying on the old beastcoast squad that dominated the BLAST R6 Manchester Major in 2024 to lift the organization’s first trophy. Could the team pull off another huge win here in Germany?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-nexon-ceo-defends-ai-voices/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-ceo-defends-arc-raiders-ai-voices-and-says-%E2%80%98every-game-company%E2%80%99-is-doing-it.1350811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Unless you’ve been hiding away under a rock somewhere, you’ll likely have heard about the ongoing debate regarding ARC Raiders and Embark Studios’ use of AI to create dynamic voices in the game. It warranted one particular outlet to give the game a shockingly low score, prompting the game’s Metacritic rating to tank by a couple of points.</p>



<p>In a bid to defend the game, Nexon’s CEO Junghun Lee has taken to the airwaves to suggest that more developers are using AI than you realize. He directly suggested that ‘every game company’ is using AI in some capacity, and that the ‘AI voice debate’ in the ARC Raiders world is a non-starter.</p>







<h2 id="h-should-we-ignore-the-ai-generated-voices-in-arc-raiders">Should We Ignore The AI-Generated Voices in ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p>The presence of AI-generated voices in ARC Raiders is a point of contention for some, but for the majority, it’s not an issue. The game has managed to sell four million copies in a week and has peaked on some platforms with staggering concurrent player counts.</p>



<p>By numbers, <a href="https://loaded.pxf.io/4G1L4L" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-highest-rated-multiplayer-shooter/">highest-rated multiplayer shooter</a> in a decade, and the top-rated extraction shooter <strong>ever made</strong>.</p>



<p>But that hasn’t stopped some from lambasting the post-apocalyptic shooter on socials, striking it down for what seems to be a misunderstood use of generative AI. Embark Studios has been transparent and pointed out that voice actors provided their talents to be replicated by AI and were paid fairly for their work, but that’s not enough to placate some.</p>



<p>Junghun Lee, CEO of Nexon, the parent company of Embark Studios, explained <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in an interview</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI. But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness.</p>



<p>AI has definitely improved efficiency in both game production and live service operations.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Using AI allows Embark Studios to bring this game to the market and float it with updates that are delivered faster and more cost-effectively. The team also uses machine learning algorithms to encourage dynamic animations of the game’s ARC enemies, but it’s the AI voices that most people have issues with, as it walks a blurry line that many are reluctant to accept as becoming the de facto standard.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s anything to be concerned about regarding Embark Studios’ reliance on AI for voice lines? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to several gaming insiders, Ubisoft is currently working on a new multiplayer shooter. Furthermore, some concept art and even an in-progress screenshot of the game have been shown.</p>







<p>Ubisoft has had a fair share of shooters over the past 40 years. From the iconic Tom Clancy series to the wild Far Cry franchise, it’s served up quite a few good ones. Still, the company has only managed one success in the multiplayer FPS world: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege</a>. With many companies like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-marathon-fy25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation/Bungie</a> and EA getting in on the trend, a supposed leak teases that Ubisoft wants in. Now, we may know what that vision the team is shooting for may look like, and it’s literally out of this world.</p>



<h2 id="h-project-scout-an-fps-sci-fi-competitive-shooter-from-ubisoft-possibly-leaked">Project Scout, An FPS Sci-Fi Competitive Shooter from Ubisoft, Possibly Leaked</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Twitter/X leaker Shiny <a href="https://x.com/Shiiny77/status/1988305728784744488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted a message</a> surrounding a new multiplayer title from Ubisoft. The FPS, supposedly made in <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>, takes place in <strong>a sci-fi world</strong>. It would include <strong>competitive multiplayer</strong>, including <strong>crossplay</strong>, and be on <strong>a larger scale</strong> than other titles. </p>



<p>Later on, user 6leaks furthered Shiny’s claim, <a href="https://x.com/6leaksgg/status/1988397275266334782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posting screenshots of the title</a>, known as <strong>Project Scout</strong>. The images, seen above, show what appears to be a loading screen with concept art and an in-game screenshot with developing assets and the game’s UI. We can also see one of the characters on the bottom left, as well as some interesting interface systems like a compass and ‘crew level’.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that <strong>Ubisoft has not confirmed Project Scout or any new multiplayer game</strong>, so <strong>take the news with a grain of salt</strong>. We have reached out to Ubisoft to confirm and will update if and when we get a response. Regardless, the concept does look pretty cool, and it’ll be interesting to see, if true, how the core gameplay will work. </p>







<p>What do you think of Ubisoft’s Project Scout? Do you think it’s real? Do you want it to be? Think it can make another multiplayer shooter and succeed?

For refresh rates, the monitor supports up to 240 Hz on PC and 120 Hz on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles as well as Variable Refresh Rates (VRR). </p>



<p>One of the more unique features is the built-in charging hook for DualSense and DualSense Edge controllers.</p>







<p>Input wise, it has two HDMI 2.1 inputs and one DisplayPort 1.4 input. There are also two USB-A ports and one USB-C port. Lastly, the monitor has a built-in speaker and 3.5mm audio output while also being VESA compatible for mounting. </p>



<p>The PlayStation gaming monitor will launch sometime in 2026 though no sepecific date or price was confirmed. What was announced, however, was that it will only be available in the United States and Japan.</p>
