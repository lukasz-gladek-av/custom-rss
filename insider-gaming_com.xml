<p>Delta Force and its Black Hawk Down Campaign gameplay need a console release. The title is having great success on PC, but a lack of console presence can be a killer. Let’s see what developer Team Jade has planned for the shooter’s future.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Hawk Down Campaign</a> kickstarted a new wave of interest in Delta Force. The military shooter has gained a sizable following due to its no-nonsense first-person shooter gameplay. Bullets and bombs are all part and parcel of the deadly Delta Force experience. 2025 saw the game’s official launch, and Black Hawk Down is a piece of free, single-player Campaign DLC.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Hawk Down has been perceived as too difficult</a> in some corners of the internet. But console players are desperate to judge this for themself. Let’s find out the latest on Delta Force coming to consoles.</p>

<p><strong>Team Jade has postponed Delta Force’s original console release date, meaning the Black Hawk Down content has also been delayed. There is no new revised released window for the first-person shooter title on either PlayStation or Xbox for now.</strong></p>



<p>A video featuring one of <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delta Force</a>‘s devs talked about the game’s release on console. They said “The release date may have to be postponed” and cited “input fairness” and controller/aiming as a problem the team was having a tough time translating to console.</p>

<p>But they were quick to indicate “development of the console version is going well,” meaning we, hopefully, shouldn’t have to wait too long. We should learn more soon enough as the official Delta Force X account has indicated a “<strong>console roadmap</strong>” is gearing up to be shared with the community.</p>







<p>For the time being Delta Force—and the Black Hawk Down content—is only playable on PC until a new announcement is made. Be sure to check in with the guide as we anticipate an update from Team Jade.</p>

<p>Star Wars Eclipse developer Quantic Dream has said that the studio is unaffected by the recent restructuring by NetEase.</p>



<div><p>Taking to LinkedIn, Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière made a statement on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-studio-closures-dozen-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs and studio closures</a> from NetEase saying,</p><p>“We were deeply saddened to learn about the recent layoffs and studio closures affecting some of the NetEase group’s divisions. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted, and we sincerely hope that they quickly find new opportunities.</p><p>David Cage and I would like to express our gratitude to the fans and friends who have reached out to us in recent days regarding QUANTIC DREAM. We want to reassure everyone that our studios in Paris and Montreal remain unaffected. We are continuing to develop our projects at full pace, with several open positions available in both locations (please visit <a href="https://lnkd.in/e_AJFbUa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://lnkd.in/e_AJFbUa</a> for more details).</p><p>Founded 28 years ago, QUANTIC DREAM remains committed to the strategy outlined by David and I in 2019, when NetEase initially acquired a minority stake in our company. Over the past six years, NetEase has been a dedicated partner, providing us with creative freedom and the financial resources necessary for our studio to grow and strive. In 2022, QUANTIC DREAM became a wholly owned subsidiary of NetEase, aligning with our shared vision for the future.</p><p>In 2024, we achieved the highest revenue in our history, driven by the exceptional performance of our back-catalogue titles. Notably, Detroit: Become Human reached 11 million units in global sales across PlayStation and PC last year, a remarkable 2 million increase year-on-year, demonstrating the lasting appeal and quality of our titles. The developments of our current projects are progressing as planned, and we are fully committed to delivering and launching these innovative, high-quality titles in the future.”</p></div>



<p>Quantic Dream is currently developing several new games, it’s biggest of which is Star Wars Eclipse. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-eclipse-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported earlier this year</a>&nbsp;that Star Wars Eclipse was targeting a 2026 release date, but was struggling to find to hire staff following allegations of workplace issues, including&nbsp;sexual harassment, crunch, and toxic work culture.</p>



<p>Star Wars Eclipse is described as, “a new action-adventure, multiple-character branching narrative game set in the&nbsp;High Republic era&nbsp;of the iconic<em>&nbsp;Star Wars</em>™ galaxy.” In September 2023, Quantic Dream’s Vice President of development said that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-eclipse-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“simmering” in development</a>.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to star Wars Eclipse? What do you think about the NetEase restructuring? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Delta Force is back with a full-scale release in 2025. Its platforms are the big topic of conversation with eager gun-toting, first-person shooter enthusiasts eager to satisfy their trigger finger.</p>



<p>Developer Team Jade has been working hard to ensure 2025’s Delta Force is up to the task. It’s part of the less-heralded shooter series but demands the same respect. The title has been through rigorous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-into-the-delta-force-hawk-ops-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alpha</a> and beta testing. It was finally released on January 20 to acclaim—with many fans loving the shooter’s tough and gritty feel.</p>



<p>Delta Force is officially out, but we’re here to let you know which platforms it’s on.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-on-pc-can-you-play-black-hawk-down">Is Delta Force on PC? Can You Play Black Hawk Down?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to go loud. Credit to Team Jade</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Delta Force is available to buy on PC through Steam and the Epic Games Store. You can play the free-to-play Black Hawk Down Campaign.</strong></p>



<p>All of the early testing for <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force</a> was conducted through PC. It’s only fitting the full release arrived on PC too. It seems likely any content—at the very least—is coming to PC before anywhere else.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force Black Hawk Down Campaign</a> is the perfect example of this.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-on-playstation-can-you-play-black-hawk-down">Is Delta Force on PlayStation? Can You Play Black Hawk Down?</h2>



<p><strong>Delta Force is coming to PlayStation at some point in the future, unfortunately, it’s not available to play on either PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 for the time being—which means no Black Hawk Down Campaign for now.</strong></p>



<p>The first quarter of 2025 is when Delta Force was supposed to be released on PlayStation. However, complications have arisen in the game’s development, causing the developer to delay the console launch.</p>



<p>A new release period hasn’t been confirmed as yet. One of the Team Jade staff declared in a <a href="https://x.com/ZeeUltra_/status/1892589196952359064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a> that “input fairness” on console was one of the key factors in the postponement. It remains to be seen how much longer PlayStation users need to wait for an update on a Delta Force platform update.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-on-xbox-can-you-play-black-hawk-down">Is Delta Force on Xbox? Can You Play Black Hawk Down?</h2>



<p><strong>Like PlayStation, a Delta Force Xbox release is assured, but development constraints have forced its release date—and subsequently Black Hawk Down Campaign content—to be postponed.</strong></p>



<p>It’s an identical situation for Xbox users. The issue relating to inputs and aiming equally applies to Xbox as it’s also a console issue—breaking things down as simply as I can. Keep checking back to this guide as we will update once we hear when Delta Force is finally coming to Xbox consoles.</p>



<hr>



<p>Does Delta Force have the pedigree to compete with other military shooters such as Call of Duty or the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Battlefield</a> game? Are you downloading it for consoles on day one when the time comes? Let us know.</p>



<p>The game has undergone significant changes for sure. Not only is it no longer called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-name-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hawk Ops</a>, but its Black Hawk Down Campaign means business—even if it is considered “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Too difficult</a>.”</p>
