<p>It’s that time of the year when you finally treat yourself or someone takes pity on you and buys you that one piece of tech you’ve been eyeing all year. For many, that’s the Steam Deck. If you woke up and unboxed a Steam Deck, well, congratulations! But here are a few of the games you should check out first on your new PC handheld!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-games-on-steam-deck-for-new-owners">The Best Games on Steam Deck for New Owners</h2>



<p>The list of available titles for the Steam Deck grows seemingly daily, with new game releases and old titles finally receiving verification. Before long, everything will be playable on the handheld. But for now, you must still pick and choose, though it’s from an absolutely astounding library of games. Here are just a handful of what you can expect to enjoy on your new Steam Deck:</p>



<h3 id="h-balatro">Balatro</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>I think Tom would be rather upset with me if I didn’t mention Balatro. But more so than that, it’s an incredible roguelike deckbuilder with innovative gameplay, that borderline enthralling one-more-turn style of gameplay we love, and quite accessible mechanics that warrant a playthrough or ten. Oh, and don’t worry if you don’t know poker because Balatro is so simple to grasp!</p>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via ConcernedApe</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not ashamed to admit that Stardew Valley is one of my all-time favorite titles to date. I used to play a ton of Harvest Moon, and then I graduated to Stardew on release day and never looked back. I’ve spent nearly 300 hours playing the indie farming simulator on Steam Deck alone, as it’s such a simple game to pick up and play with the handheld. It runs smoothly, the battery life is excellent, and the game functions better with a controller than with a mouse and keyboard, in my opinion.</p>



<h3 id="h-baldur-s-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Don’t expect to play Baldur’s Gate 3 on Steam Deck for extended periods, as the massive role-playing game will burn through the handheld battery quickly. That said, the turn-based combat and easy maneuverability of the game work splendidly on the handheld controls of the Deck. If you want a game that will suck up countless hours of your free time without leaving the couch, Baldur’s Gate 3 is the go-to choice for many.</p>







<h3 id="h-hades-or-hades-2">Hades (Or Hades 2!)</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>I was initially unsure about Hades, as I was still relatively new to the roguelike genre upon its release. However, after too many recommendations, I gave it a shot and immediately fell in love. It’s a challenging yet satisfying action hack-and-slash in which you’ll power up your abilities and move over time, delving further into the Underworld as you go. It functions perfectly on Steam Deck, and the bite-size maps allow you to play on your own time.</p>



<h3 id="h-cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cult of the Lamb was my Game of the Year in 2022, and an absolute surprise that I wasn’t sure I’d enjoy until my wife bought it for me as an early birthday present. Well, I was hooked. I immediately sunk 50 hours into a single playthrough, and then I did it again on PC. Then, I started playing on Steam Deck and wound up with another four complete playthroughs on the handheld. It runs well and has impressive battery life. But the technical stuff, while fun, is only a small part of the experience. You can run a cult, build your base, and venture into the wilds with powerful weapons and spells!</p>

<p>Ubisoft has had a torrid 2024, facing one low after another. While the company is looking to reform itself moving forward, I want to take some time to look back on one of the company’s biggest shining lights few people are talking about—despite it being one of the games of the year.</p>



<p>Where do I even begin with Ubisoft’s wretched 2024? <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-ubisoft-from-low-morale-to-internal-tensions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Low Morale and internal struggles</a> kicked off the turbulent year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-has-canceled-the-division-heartland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Division Heartland</a> became one of several project casualties, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a> began to happen behind the scenes, and the long-time-in-development XDefiant announced it was already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-xdefiant-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down</a> within a year of its launch. </p>



<p>To be honest, this barely scratches the surface of the last 12 months for one of the most famous game studios in the world. However, a ray of light shone on this dark cloud; a beaming beacon of hope that a credible game studio lies dormant behind its cookie-cutter RPGs and by-the-numbers sequels.</p>



<p>I’m talking about Ubisoft’s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-lost-crown-is-lost-amongst-the-shuffle">The Lost Crown is Lost Amongst the Shuffle</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fluid and nearly flawless. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ll admit, I barely paid much attention to Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown when it was announced. Whisper it, but I only remembered it existed a handful of weeks out from release. The Lost Crown looked like a decent Metroidvania clone on the surface, and I had one clear thought as its debut drew near—where the hell is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-remade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a>?</p>



<p>However, after 10-15 hours with The Lost Crown, I was forced to eat my words and tuck my tail between my legs. I was suddenly less eager for a Sands of Time Remake, and <strong>far more keen for The Lost Crown to get a sequel</strong>. This drastic turn of events was propagated by some of the silliest and smoothest gameplay I’ve ever played in a Metroidvania title.</p>



<p>Sargon heads up The Lost Crown, and he has personality and life. The world around him is a stunning palette of cel-shaded visuals and distinct biomes. It feels innovative and refined, and there were times <strong>I was genuinely questioning if this was a Ubisoft game</strong>. The same studio planning to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-games-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two Assassin’s Creed games every year for the next 10</a>. The same studio still pushing the dead concept of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-another-push-into-nft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFTs</a> deep into 2024.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown’s 86 rating on Metacritic</a> is a testament to the game’s brilliance. It was crowned champion of “Innovation in Accessibility” at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>, and was rightfully nominated for “Best Action/Adventure Game.” Recency bias may have hurt The Lost Crown’s chances of more awards and wins, but make no mistake, this was the highlight of Ubisoft’s year. As Linkin Park says though: “In the end, it doesn’t even matter.”</p>



<h2 id="h-a-sequel-is-probably-buried-in-the-sand">A Sequel is Probably Buried in the Sand</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One more game, please. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>We exclusively reported on Oct. 23, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia devs were being moved to different projects at Ubisoft</a>. The reason is twofold: To aid the progress of other titles, and because of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-management-to-blame-for-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sales-issues-baldurs-gate-3-exec-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lost Crown’s disappointing sales</a>—a recurring theme for Ubisoft throughout 2024.</p>



<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown reportedly sold in the region of one million copies. This was far below Ubisoft’s lofty expectations and has me questioning Ubisoft’s targets and wondering if they’re overinflated—but this is for another time. For now, <strong>don’t expect a sequel anytime soon</strong>, with the sad reality being this is a one-and-done type of deal.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-reveals-why-the-game-was-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadow delay to improve its quality</a> and reported changes to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry 7 and its gameplay formula</a> sounds like the winds of change to me. It feels like 2025 is a crucial year for the French company to get back on track, alter its perception, and rewrite the narrative moving forward.</p>



<p>If we never end up getting a sequel to Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, I’ll still remember it fondly. Ubisoft took a chance on it, and it was a success in the eyes of players. If you get time, I’d highly recommend checking out this little gem, and maybe one day it’ll become popular enough to become embroiled in its own remake development hell.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-biggest-surprise-hit-of-2024/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-community%E2%80%99s-biggest-surprise-hit-of-2024.1068933/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-biggest-surprise-hit-of-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>There were a lot of games that came out of nowhere to become smash hits in 2024. Across all genres and scale, some games just grabbed fans in ways that we weren’t expecting. But no game stood out more than Helldivers 2 from Arrowhead Game Studios.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>, a vote was held to determine what you, our readers, thought was the biggest surprise of 2024 in gaming. With a number of great games to choose from, it turned out to be the closest vote of the six categories we had this year with Helldivers 2 and second-place Balatro being separated by just 3% of the votes.</p>



<p>But what made Helldivers 2 so surprising and special to the players?</p>



<p>The game was nearly a decade in the making and was a complete change up from the twin-stick shooter gameplay of the original. When it finally released in February, Helldivers 2 burst onto the scene with nearly 500,000 concurrent players on Steam and even more on PlayStation 5. The launch was so successful that developer Arrowhead Game Studios had to hire more staff to work on the game’s servers just to keep them online and functional.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2’s launch showed what could happen with a game-as-a-service when it’s released properly. Not only is the gameplay fun, but the lore that was developed, the story being told, and connection being forged by the community made for an experience many players hadn’t felt in quite some time. To add to it, it felt like those building the game actually had a passion for what they were creating and putting out.</p>



<p>Of course, the game has had its fair share of hiccups since the fast launch, and its player numbers have fallen a bit. But it’s still one of the most popular games on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> daily, and should only stay strong as more is added for players.</p>



<p>What do you think was the biggest surprise gaming hit of 2024? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Move aside AAA games, it’s time to recognize the lesser-known, not-as-well-funded titles this year. The best 2024 indie titles have delivered immeasurably, with one, in particular, achieving GOTY talk—so let’s go through the contenders and our winner.</p>



<p>Indie games can’t die. While the big-time developers and publishers push big-budget, large-scale-production blockbusters, the lifeblood of indies mustn’t dry up. For every copy-and-paste open-world game, someone has the vision to turn a crab into a soulslike superstar, or have you complete odd jobs in a bizarre English town.</p>



<p>The best indie games of 2024 have all shown ingenuity, and proven they can hang with the big boys, and every nomination on this list deserves to be played.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-indie-title-of-2024-winner-balatro">Best Indie Title of 2024 Winner — Balatro</h2>

<p>Poker has been around since the 1800s, but I’m sure its creator didn’t think to combine the card game with intricate roguelike mechanics to create an infinitely replayable breakout hit that would go toe-to-toe with multi-million projects for the GOTY crown. This is what LocalThunk have been able to achieve with Balatro.</p>



<p>Balatro starts you off with a traditional deck of 52 cards comprised of four suits going from Ace to King. The format of the game revolves around you beating increasingly tougher decks requiring higher point totals achieved with high-scoring poker hands. Balatro is a basic poker game at its atomic level, but if we break down its complexities, it’s so much more than this.</p>



<p>You can buy Jokers to add devious and cunning modifiers to your deck—increasing the points earned—allowing us to overcome harder “Blinds.” The roguelike loop means failing is encouraged because you learn the intricacies of the mechanics and understand hands and scoring better. Plus, who can resist one “final” run?</p>



<p>Balatro’s impact in 2024 is tangible. It’s a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-all-nominees-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of the Year nominee</a>, already won the Indie Game of the Year award at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/golden-joystick-awards-2024-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Joystick Awards</a>, and sold well over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-hits-2-million-units-sold-major-gameplay-update-coming-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two million copies</a>. Balatro is a simple idea executed flawlessly, and it’s a worthy recipient of our Best Indie Title of 2024 award.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-indie-games-of-2024-nominations">Best Indie Games of 2024 Nominations</h2>



<p>Balatro has us all in, yes, but we haven’t revealed our full hand yet. If you’re tired of the monotony of mainstream gaming, 2024 has produced some whoppers in the indie game category.</p>



<h3 id="h-animal-well">Animal Well</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Unnerving. Credit to Shared Memory</figcaption></figure>



<p>Animal Well makes me uncomfortable from start to finish: The sound design, the enemies, the edgy and retro-inspired visuals—and I love it. It’s a basic, 2D Metroidvania adventure relying on backtracking and memorization to progress, but its array of items and delicate world-building make the journey seamless.</p>



<p>The mini-boss encounters are low-key terrifying, the puzzles are logical and lucid, and the sense of progression is satisfying. I took umbrage with the map which becomes intensely layered and obfuscated the greater it unravels, and the platforming can be a bit floaty. Animal Well was developed by a single person, and this fact alone turns my mind to mush. If you have a weekend to spare, I implore you to check this out as it pushed Balatro close.</p>



<h3 id="h-hades-2">Hades 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I can’t wait until this is finished. Credit to Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hades is on my Mt. Rushmore of roguelike entries—and it could be all four heads, honestly. Saying goodbye to Zagreus and making merry with Melinoë is tough, but within the first hour, I was saying Zagreus who? The Princess of the Underworld is just as engaging as her brother, and Supergiant Games has pretty much reinvented the Hades universe. New weapons, abilities, and a curious underground and surface mechanic are some of the new additions to the roguelike formula as you battle through brand-new, enemy-filled biomes.</p>



<p>Predictably, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-are-the-hades-2-voice-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> misses out because it’s not finished yet. 2024 is only the beginning of the Hades 2 adventure, testing the soul-filled waters of the Underworld with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-ii-early-access-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>. Its full release is looking likely for 2025, and there’s every chance this sequel can go one better than a nomination next year.</p>



<h3 id="h-little-kitty-big-city">Little Kitty, Big City</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Honestly, the cat alone could’ve won this. Credit to Double Dagger Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let me preface, I’m a cat person. I’ve owned cats before, and I own cats now. They are the greatest creatures walking the Earth, and I care for them more than most humans. Little Kitty, Big City appeals to the cat connoisseur in me, and everything our purring protagonist does causes me to unconsciously let slip a squeak. Little Kitty, Big City’s charming appeal is letting you be a cat: You nom bread, carelessly walk into people to knock them over, use random objects as scratching posts, and there’s a dedicated meow button—à la Stray.</p>



<p>Its cutesy nature aside, Little Kitty, Big City is a self-contained open-world platformer. The world itself isn’t gigantic, but has lots of depth and verticality. You’re encouraged to explore, find fun side missions, and claim collectibles. It’s not genre-defining, it’s fairly predictable and can be completed in one sitting. Nevertheless, it’s a lot of fun and whiskers away from being a-meowzing.</p>



<h3 id="h-palworld">Palworld</h3>



<figure><figcaption>What a visual. Credit to Pocket Pair</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Pokémon with guns” there, I said it, I said <em>the </em>line. Palworld has been associated with Pokémon since day one, although it’s not hard to understand the comparison. Pocket Pair’s creature-collecting, monster-battling open-world title has a deep Paldeck full of weird and wonderful specimens to fight and befriend. Once you do this, you assign them to various work jobs: Kindling, Lumbering, Transporting, and other labor-intensive tasks—there might be an RSPCA issue here.</p>



<p>The big headline grabbers are the ability to shoot Pals, have them shoot other people, butcher Pals, and even capture humans. Blatant murder and human trafficking aside, Palworld is an extremely diverse RPG. Hopefully, it comes through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo-Palworld lawsuits</a> unscathed and adds to its Early Access build—as this is still a game very much in progress and lacking a bit of depth.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-2024-video-games-you-should-replay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For many, the holiday season is the only time of the year they get off from work. It’s a chance to sit back on the couch, relax between chores around the house, and play a video game or two. You might even have time to beat one. If you’re on the fence about what to play, however, we can help. Here are the five best video game releases from 2024 worth replaying this holiday season!</p>



<h2 id="h-top-5-game-releases-worth-replaying-in-2024">Top 5 Game Releases Worth Replaying in 2024</h2>



<p>It was a big year in gaming, with too many new releases to count, and more than a handful of standout releases. If you were unable to keep up with all the new launches, or have a handful of favorites that you’d like to return to, this holiday season is a good time!</p>



<h3 id="h-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, which features <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo or three-player co-op</a> play, many of us fully intend to return to the world of The Lands Between this holiday season. But more importantly, it’s an excellent time to dive into the expansion, which is absolutely massive and, in some cases, more challenging than the vanilla game.</p>



<h3 id="h-slay-the-princess-the-pristine-cut">Slay the Princess – The Pristine Cut</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s like Groundhog Day but more twisted. Slay the Princess is an existential horror game in which your dialogue choices change the course of the story across various timelines. Each world varies in some way, from a different setting to a different princess altogether, and your choices can either set off a chain of events that end the world or save everyone at a significant cost.</p>



<h3 id="h-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>While it didn’t fully stick its landing, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is still an exceptional RPG with so much depth and potential. There’s a lot to explore, from countless quests to mini-games to collectibles. It’ll eat up most of your vacation time, and you might finish it if you’re lucky, but now’s a good time to try before the third entry releases.</p>



<h3 id="h-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you only want to play one game this holiday season, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth will eat up every second of your free time. It’s a massive, lengthy RPG featuring Ichiban Kasuga, the loveable underdog, and Kazuma Kiryu, the broken fighter, exploring a huge landscape with countless turn-based battles and memorable minigames to play.</p>



<h3 id="h-balatro">Balatro</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p>What’s left to say about Balatro? It’s one of the more unique releases of the past year, focusing on roguelike deck-building and out-there poker mechanics that make for an enthralling experience. It’s one many were hoping would win Game of the Year, though Astro Bot beat it, as expected, but that shouldn’t stop anyone from sitting down for a hand or two or fourteen this holiday season!</p>
