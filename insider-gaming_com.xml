<p>The VALORANT Esports division of Riot Games announced today that Sony gaming gear brand INZONE will operate as a primary sponsor for the VCT EMEA league through the end of 2026. INZONE branded monitors will be primary display used at the Riot Games Arena in Berlin.</p>



<hr>



<p>Officially, INZONE will act as a “Main Partner and the Official Gaming Display Partner” for the VCT EMEA league. INZONE is no stranger to VALORANT sponsorship: the brand already sponsors the use of its headsets in the VCT. Two prominent organizations in Fnatic and ZETA DIVISION also have pre-existing sponsorship deals with the company. INZONE says Fnatic even helped design the monitor used on stage, which features a unique picture mode optimized for VALORANT.”</p>



<p>As part of the sponsorship deal, INZONE will put INZONE M10S OLED monitors in “coach rooms, practice areas, and co-stream rooms,” per the official announcement. They will also be highlighted at the “1v1 station in the fan zone” during match days. INZONE branding and advertisements have already been featured on the broadcasts, alongside other sponsors PaysafeCard and Red Bull.</p>



<p>While the addition of INZONE as a main sponsor is a welcome addition to VALORANT Esports and Riot Games, many viewers are curious to see if and when gambling sponsors are eventually implemented. This past December, Riot confirmed to Insider Gaming that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-policy-change-betting-sponsorships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teams in Americas and EMEA would be allowed to “explore” partnerships with Riot approved betting platforms</a>. At the time, Riot stated that no betting brands would appear on broadcasts or socials: “Riot-owned channels will stay betting-free.” But based on the success of betting partnerships with teams, Riot could easily change the rules. Back in 2021, after barring TSM from using cryptocurrency exchange partner FTX in their name, Riot themselves <a href="https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/sources-lcs-lands-seven-year-ftx-sponsorship-deal-as-first-crypto-exchange-partner-of-any-riot-league" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">landed a seven year sponsorship deal</a> between the LCS and FTX.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-16-xbox-release-announcement/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>An insider has claimed that Final Fantasy 16’s Xbox release announcement will arrive soon. The game’s release seemingly is planned for the “first half of 2025.” The leaker also revealed details about Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by IdleSlothVGT on <a href="https://x.com/IdleSlothVGT/status/1887250040491745562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, NateTheHate recently spoke about Final Fantasy 16’s release plans for Xbox on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/page-103#post-135340638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>. According to Nate, the announcement should come shortly, but “not in the near future” if the developers aren’t implementing any “late changes”. Also, Final Fantasy 16 is scheduled to release for Xbox in the first half of 2025, “spring basically”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nate also spoke about Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth’s release plans on Xbox. The first instalment from Square Enix’s Remake Project is scheduled to arrive for Xbox “later this year,” and Rebirth is planned for 2026. Nate is unsure about the time but speculates that Final Fantasy Remake, Rebirth and FFXVI for Xbox “will be announced at the same time for maximum impact”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NateTheHate also mentioned Final Fantasy’s plans for Nintendo’s highly anticipated console, the Switch 2. It seems that the developers have decided to prioritise Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth for the Switch 2 over Final Fantasy 16. Regardless, it is exciting to see Final Fantasy embrace a multi-platform future for the franchise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth broke the franchise’s<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-single-player-record-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> single-player record on Steam</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/feast-for-the-poor-quest-guide-how-to-complete/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/feast-for-the-poor-quest-guide-%E2%80%93-how-to-complete-this-kcd2-side-quest.1101807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/feast-for-the-poor-quest-guide-how-to-complete/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll eventually be offered a side quest with an interesting premise. You’ll need to break into a military encampment and steal King Sigismund’s prized sausages reserved exclusively for royalty. However, the camp is heavily guarded and you’ll be challenged whenever you walk towards the gates.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about the solution for Feast for the Poor and figure out how to get the sausages from the camp in the easiest way possible.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-solve-feast-for-the-poor">How to Solve Feast for the Poor</h2>



<p>Feast for the Poor seems like a simple enough quest at first blush, but it’s tricky. Even going into the camp at night spells trouble, as you’re almost guaranteed to be seen by the many guards patrolling the area.</p>



<p>If you want to accept a challenge, you can dress in dark, light clothing and sneak into the camp after distracting a gate guard with a rock. Around the back of the camp (in the blue circle in the image below), you’ll find a barn with a window at the side of it – it’s quite visible.</p>



<p>If you climb up into that window, you’ll find yourself in the loft of a hay barn, and from here, you can get the best access to the camp without being challenged by a guard:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Blue = Entry, Green = Sausage</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instead of picking around the camp looking for the sausages, you can just head to the green circle on my map above. It’s here that you’ll find a painted chest in a circular tent – that’s the box containing the sausages.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it’s a ‘very hard’ lock, so unless you have a high lockpicking skill, you’ll need to kill and loot a guard <strong>or </strong>pickpocket them for a set of keys. Once you’ve got the keys, you can get the sausages.</p>



<p><em>Remember that the bonus objective is to leave a head of cabbage in the box, but it doesn’t have much of an impact on the outcome if you forget</em>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Spoiler Note:</strong></p>



<p>If you wait until you complete the main campaign, the camp will no longer be off-limits, allowing you to walk in unchallenged and find the sausages. You’ll still need to get the keys or pick the lock, but at no point will guards demand you or attack you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now that you’ve got the sausages, you can leave and pick up the next part of this quest. You’ll need to head into Kuttenberg and find people begging in the streets, giving them sausages and choosing who you want to name as the responsible donor. </p>



<p>That’s how to complete Feast for the Poor in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 in a nutshell.</p>
