<p>Following a hectic period before Citizencon, during which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staff were mandated to work 7-day work weeks</a>, Cloud Imperium Games have just reportedly laid off some of its staff.</p>



<p>The information comes from an <a href="https://x.com/Gillyburd1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ex-CIG employee</a>, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to say that their former employer “is letting a lot of staff go over the last two days with zero compensation right after working them to the bone without even much as a thanks,” and that a “formal announcement” should be “soon.”</p>



<p>Speaking with our own sources, we can confirm that Cloud Imperium Games has been letting some of its staff go these past couple of days, but we’re currently unable to verify the extent of the layoffs. At the time of writing, several sources said the layoffs have mainly affected the studio’s QA department and that the number of those laid off isn’t as large as initially made out to be, with one source estimating around a dozen currently affected (around 1% of its total workforce). </p>



<p>That being said, it’s still early days fairly early days yet, and Cloud Imperium Games has a history of laying off its staff over an extended period. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CIG quietly laid off an estimated 100 or so staff members</a> at its Austin and LA offices which took weeks and  even making affected employees sign NDAs to prevent them from talking about being laid off.</p>



<p>Cloud Imperium Games has yet to make an internal or public announcement to its staff on the layoffs and any possible restructuring. </p>



<p>We will update this article as we hear more.</p>

<p>Victor von Doom is just as menacing as his name suggests, and the villain—sometimes anti-hero—is a natural fit for Marvel Rivals. We already know the imperious presence of the doctor is confirmed, so let’s check out the latest on his arrival and see if he needs an appointment.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has a blockbuster, star-studded cast of characters befitting of a Marvel shooter. Meaning, that it makes sense to have (arguably) one of the most influential and memorable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-characters-are-in-marvel-rivals-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters</a> in the biggest attempt to date to bring the epic universe to games.</p>



<p>It’s no secret Doctor Doom is coming to Marvel Rivals, that much is certain. However, a lot of confusion is directed toward his potential debut—let’s take a look.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-doctor-doom-coming-to-marvel-rivals">When is Doctor Doom coming to Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The faces of evil. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Neither NetEase nor Marvel has given an official launch date for Doctor Doom in Marvel Rivals—and there aren’t even any leaks to give us a glimmer of hope.</p>



<p>The lack of a Doctor Doom announcement is bizarre given the character’s eponymous trailer back on July 26: “Marvel Rivals | Cinematic Trailer | No One Rivals Doom.” While the majority of the trailer features an array of the Rivals stars fighting each other, the main focus is on Doctor Doom.</p>



<p>Curiously, he doesn’t feature on the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes/index.html?heroId=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals hero page</a>—despite his trailer—and if he doesn’t appear at launch, I’d expect him to be the focal point of at least one of the first two seasons.</p>



<p>If anything spells bad news, it’s two Doctor Dooms, and yet we’re here unable to verify the launch date of one—keep checking back as we wait for official confirmation from either developer or publisher on the character’s Marvel Rivals launch.</p>

<h2 id="h-who-is-doctor-doom-in-marvel-rivals">Who is Doctor Doom in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>Doctor Doom’s origin story is as sinister and foreboding as any: His mother was taken by Mephisto, and his father succumbed to death as an indirect effect of someone else’s actions. Cue the warpath of the vicious Victor von Doom. His brilliant use of magic and a mind for inventing and creation makes Doctor Doom one of the most-feared villains in Marvel—and history, to be honest.</p>



<p>He’s a genius, and Fantastic Four lovers will be intimately acquainted with Victor as they regularly clash. Hardened fans will debate for weeks on end who the greatest supervillain in the Marvel universe is; however, you only need to check different ranking lists to see Doom’s name appear at the top—in many cases <em>the </em>top spot.</p>

<p>Do you think Doctor Doom is the greatest Marvel villain ever? Or does someone else breed evil that tiny bit better?

<p>Tencent have announced with developer Polaris Quest that it will be releasing a new game called ‘Light of Motiram’ for PC which looks awfully like Horizon Zero Dawn.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://lightofmotiram.com/EN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> came yesterday (first spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/mechanimal-open-world-survival-crafting-game-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>), revealing that the game will launch for PC on Steam and the Epic Games Store, but the publisher did not give an official release date.</p>



<p>The game has already been ripped apart on social media for being a fairly blatant Horizon Zero Dawn ripoff, but we’ve attached some images below to make up your own minds.</p>
