            <title><![CDATA[Sleeping Dogs Film Adds Nobody 2 Director]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-film-director-timo-tjahjanto-simu-liu/</link>
            <guid>1393381</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The upcoming live-action adaptation of Sleeping Dogs has found its director. As of now, the film is set to star Shang-Chi actor Simu Liu as Wei Shen with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-film-script-simu-liu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a script complete</a>.</p>



<p>Released in 2012, Sleeping Dogs has become quite the cult classic. Following an undercover Hong Kong police officer, players explore an open world with parkour abilities and martial arts. Despite earning positive reviews, low sales led to the series being dead in the water. </p>



<p>However, Hollywood has gotten its hands on it, now reinvigorated by MCU’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-adaptation-and-sequel-mentioned-by-simu-liu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shang-Chi actor Simu Liu</a>, who’ll star as protagonist Wei Shen. A script was revealed to be complete for the project earlier in the year, but it was unknown where it would lead. Now, an up-and-coming action film director is about to take on the long-awaited adaptation.</p>







<h2 id="h-timo-tjahjanto-to-direct-sleeping-dogs-starring-mcu-s-simu-liu">Timo Tjahjanto&nbsp;to Direct Sleeping Dogs, Starring MCU’s Simu Liu</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a post from <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/2005248803172135343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simu Liu</a> on Twitter, it has been confirmed that Timo Tjahjanto&nbsp;will direct Sleeping Dogs. The Indonesian director has&nbsp;done a few films but is just starting to get onto bigger projects. His latest movie, Nobody 2, was a worthy follow-up to the 2021 Bob Odenkirk action flick. He is also attached to direct the sequel to the Jason Statham-led project, The Beekeeper, and a possible Hollywood sequel to <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/new-lines-train-to-busan-timo-tjahjanto-1234696403/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Train to Busan</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Timo Tjahjanto has been an advocate for Sleeping Dogs to hit the big screens for a while. In response to Simu Liu’s post on the game’s lack of movement anywhere, the director <a href="https://x.com/Timobros/status/1885391495785832519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explains its biggest problem</a> was a lack of understanding from executives. When asked about directing the film adaptation, he sent a smiling gif, which has aged incredibly well given today’s news.</p>



<p>The film has yet to acquire a studio or a release date. Still, with a director, writer, script, and Marvel actor at the forefront, it may not be long before one is revealed. Sleeping Dogs has been a work-in-progress in Hollywood, as previous attempts didn’t pan out. Legendary action star Donnie Yen (Rogue One, John Wick: Chapter 4), was attached to play Wei Shen, but it never came around. Hopefully, the film will see the light of day and Sleeping Dogs can get the love it deserves.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-insider-gaming-community-2025-indie-game-of-the-year/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Indie games don’t all fit into the same box anymore. Some are made by small teams taking big creative swings, while others come from well-funded studios operating outside the traditional AAA system. What ties them together isn’t budget, but identity—games built around a clear vision, willing to do things differently, and often unafraid to take risks.</p>



<p>That range was on full display in the Insider Gaming community’s Indie Game of the Year poll, which featured everything from long-awaited sequels to experimental standouts. And when the votes were counted, one title ultimately rose to the top as Hollow Knight: Silksong was voted as the 2025 Indie Game of the Year.</p>







<p>The long-awaited sequel finished first with 21.7% of the vote, just beating out Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s and Dispatch’s 18.9%. Other games in the running were Ball x Pit (8.5%), Peak (7.5%), Hades 2 (7.5%), Absolum (6.6%), Blue Prince (5.7%), and Schedule I (4.7%). </p>



<p>What makes Silksong’s win stand out is the anticipation for it seemingly paid off upon release, with the game receiving acclaim from players far and wide. But in the end, the results reflect what makes the indie scene so compelling. There’s no single formula for success, only games that connect with players in different ways. This year, the Insider Gaming community made it clear that Hollow Knight: Silksong stood just a bit taller than the rest.</p>

<p>Sports games in 2025 were a mixed bag for some fans. But standing out in a crowd of less-than-impressive titles were games that provided both the enjoyable gameplay and depth that fans look for from their sports titles. Insider Gaming has a team that has played as many sports games as possible throughout the year, and it’s been narrowed down to find the best sports game of 2025.</p>



<p>From a multiplayer soccer game to a remaster of a classic, these are games the games that keep you immersed in one way or another to the point you don’t want to put them down. So, without any further delay, let’s find out the top sports game of the year along with those that were nominated.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-sports-game-of-2025-winner-rematch">Best Sports Game Of 2025 Winner — Rematch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Players will be punished if they actively sabotage games. Image via Sloclap</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.net/visit/rematch-pc-loaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rematch</a> offers one of the freshest takes on soccer in years by embracing fast, chaotic, arcade-style action instead of pure realism. With no fouls, no offsides, and constant play, matches are all about momentum and creativity, perfect for players who want quick, high-energy sessions rather than slow build-up play.</p>



<p>Its multi-position gameplay that relies more on positioning and teamwork than other soccer games give it the feel of a competitive action game wrapped in a sports shell. Rematch earns its spot as the best sports game for 2025 because it brings something genuinely different to the genre: a fun, accessible football experience that emphasizes excitement over simulation.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/7-biggest-arc-raiders-features-we-want-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1393246</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is one of the biggest games of 2025 by far, boasting a massive player base, a stunning delivery, and the promise of plenty more content to come. It’s an electrifying extraction adventure that millions of people have bought into, and it’s challenging the likes of Escape from Tarkov with<strong> ease</strong>.</p>



<p>However, regardless of how good ARC Raiders is, there are still plenty of features players want to see added in 2026. What follows below are the <strong>7 </strong>features that we want to see added to ARC Raiders in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-7-arc-raiders-changes-we-want-to-see">7 ARC Raiders Changes We Want to See</h2>



<h3 id="h-pve-servers-or-modes">PvE Servers or Modes</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fighting other players in ARC Raiders is a core part of the central gameplay experience, but it would be nice if there were also a PvE-exclusive mode or server selection that users could jump into to have an ‘easier ride’. For some, PvP is too punishing and stressful, and it would be great if Embark Studios could accommodate those players with their own ‘ecosystem’.</p>



<p>If Escape from Tarkov can muster up a PvE mode, then ARC Raiders should be able to do it too.</p>



<h3 id="h-better-outfit-customization">Better Outfit Customization</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders has a stunning array of outfits, but they’re just that, <strong>outfits</strong>. It would be brilliant if players could cherry-pick parts of outfits to equip on their character, rather than throwing on something whole and mostly static. What if I love the helmet on one outfit but think it would go better with a jacket on another outfit?</p>



<p>It would likely be hard to implement as the outfits are intricately designed one by one, but some kind of transmog feature in ARC Raiders would be great.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-maps">New Maps</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>This is an obvious one, but we want to see more maps in ARC Raiders in 2026. The game has a neat assortment of maps already, but there’s a world of potential out there. It’s a known fact that Embark Studios plans to add plenty more, but it’s not just about getting new maps; it’s about getting <strong>quality maps </strong>that are a wonder to explore.</p>



<p>The first new map, released in November 2025, was Stella Montis, and it proved to be a die-hard PvP map with tight quarters and narrow sightlines.</p>



<h3 id="h-item-insurance">Item Insurance</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In some extraction games, <strong>item insurance </strong>is a core mechanic that allows you to recoup some losses when you’re killed in action. In ARC Raiders, that’s not a feature. If you die in the field, your equipment will be lost forever. The only difference to that rule is when you’re killed by a cheater, Embark Studios will refund your equipment.</p>



<p>If they can do it for cheaters, then surely they can implement a mechanic that allows users to insure their items, so if they die in a raid, they get their loadout back after a few hours.</p>



<h3 id="h-less-punishing-stamina-mechanics">Less Punishing Stamina Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The stamina mechanics in ARC Raiders are a bane for many players. They’re too strict in many ways, and when your stamina bar empties while you’re running away from an engagement, you’ll find that you almost stop dead on the spot, unable to move. In a desperate situation, it’s far too unrealistic, and it leaves players feeling frustrated quite often.</p>



<p>Even when you’ve maximized your stamina-focused skill points, it still feels as though your stamina bar empties too quickly. Better stamina mechanics would make for a new feature in ARC Raiders in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-expedition-adjustments">Expedition Adjustments</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Expedition Project is the optional wipe mechanic in ARC Raiders, and it allows players to donate stacks of resources to escape Speranza into the great beyond. Once they’ve done that, they’ll be left with a new and fresh character, ready to go again. However, the requirements for completing an Expedition Project are pretty insane.</p>



<p>To get the maximum rewards possible from completing an Extraction Project, you need to have a stash value (coins included) of <strong>five million</strong>. It feels inaccessible for the more casual gamers who will be left out in the cold when they realize they won’t gain much from their Expedition Project.</p>



<h3 id="h-more-achievements">More Achievements</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>ARC Raiders has a fine assortment of achievements and trophies, but they’re far too easy to unlock just by exploring the game and ticking a few boxes. As the game is a live-service title that’s set to evolve over a number of years, it would be good to see more achievements surface with the successive updates that hit the game.</p>



<p>This keeps completionists occupied and able to enjoy the game more. If you play ARC Raiders for around 50 hours and see all there is to see, it’s a fair chance you’ll have almost unlocked all the achievements.</p>







<p>What would you like to see added to ARC Raiders in the next year or so? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
