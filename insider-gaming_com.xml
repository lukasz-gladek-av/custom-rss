<p>Counter-Strike 2 keeps breaking the all-time high record for peak concurrent players on Steam. It seems as though a new record is being set every week at this point, and the latest figure is a <strong>doozy</strong>. Hours ago, the game hit 1.82 million peak players, which represents solid growth since the last time the record was broken with 1.74 million peak players.</p>



<p>As I write this, 1.5 million people around the world are playing Counter-Strike 2. The next top title on Steam is PUBG, the free-to-play battle royale game, which has 659,000 people playing.</p>



<p>Nothing comes close to Counter-Strike 2.</p>

<h2 id="h-here-we-are-again">Here We Are Again</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 has secured another peak player record, and at this point, it’s becoming <strong>at least </strong>a monthly affair. More people are playing Counter-Strike than ever before, and it never leaves the top spot on Steam unless something remarkable hits the market, like Palworld.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It doesn’t end there, though.</p>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 is also the most popular game on Twitch by a mile, boasting 381,000 concurrent viewers at the time of writing. In second place is Just Chatting, with 316,000 viewers – the next top <strong>game </strong>on Twitch is Dota 2, with 183,000 viewers.</p>



<p>It helps that Counter-Strike 2 has a phenomenally popular esports scene, and that’s where much of the viewership and player count records come from. Most of the top channels on Twitch broadcasting Counter-Strike 2 are co-streaming the ESL Pro League, which is unfolding as you read this.</p>



<p>Whenever a top-tier esports tournament unravels in the Counter-Strike 2 space, it makes people flood the game, all eager to replicate what they’ve seen the best Counter-Strike players do on stream.</p>



<p>When did you last play Counter-Strike 2? Perhaps you’re playing it right now, loading into a match as you read this. Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Last night, OpTic Gaming’s Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez published a lengthy video exploring the ‘curse’ that lingers over OpTic Texas in the Call of Duty League. Hours later, the team suffered another loss, hitting a map record of 0-18, which is one of the worst records in the history of Call of Duty esports.</p>



<p>Not only that, but in the series against the LA Theives, the most dominant team in the CDL right now, OpTic’s Kenny secured the lowest KD in competitive COD history. Curse or not, something has to change for OpTic Texas, which is on an unrivalled bad luck run.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-to-bottom">Top to Bottom</h2>



<p>Last year, OpTic Texas claimed the Call of Duty League Championship, the most prestigious award in the ecosystem. The team netted the first world title for OpTic in Call of Duty in several years, and everyone lauded this incredibly talented team.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and the fans are rebelling against the same roster, which has put up one of the worst records in competitive history. In the last batch of matches played, OpTic Texas has gone 0-18, failing to secure a single map in six fixtures.</p>



<p>It was noticed shortly after the recent match finished that Kenny had dropped a 0.3 KD ratio, which is, according to statistics aggregation platforms, the lowest kill-death ratio in Call of Duty esports history. That’s a record set by a two-time world champion, which just seems bizarre at this point.</p>



<p>In the round of Hardpoint against LA Thieves, Kenny set a woeful record, pulling just <strong>11 kills </strong>in what was a complete thrashing from the Thieves.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hecz-curse-optic-texas-cdl-woes/">recent video published by HECZ</a>, the OpTic Texas team was all smiles as they pondered what could be wrong, with the entire office believing that a curse was upon the squad. Fans worldwide are pleading for a change, but nobody has a solid grip on what needs to be altered to get OpTic Texas winning maps.</p>



<p>What’s worse is that in just a few days, Major II will unravel in Texas, backed by OpTic. The team will start in the worst position at its home event and will have just <strong>one chance </strong>to stay in the running.</p>



<p>What do you think needs to change at OpTic Texas?</p>
