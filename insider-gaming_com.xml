<p>The post-launch roadmap and DLC for Civilization 7 have been revealed. During a special 90-minute stream on Thursday, developer Firaxis announced the plans for the game through its first nine months.</p>



<p>The reveal came after a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-dlc-leaked-ahead-of-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">media outlet leaked details</a> of the first few post-launch leaders and civilizations ahead of the announcement. </p>



<p>Civilization 7 will launch in “early access” on February 6 and will include a Day 0 Patch for those who buy the Deluxe and Founders Edition of the game. For everyone else, it will be available starting February 11.</p>

<p>From there come the planned “Collections”.</p>



<p>March brings the first DLC with the Crossroads of the World Collection. In Early March, Release 1 introduces Ada Lovelace as a new leader, along with Carthage and Great Britain as playable civilizations and four new natural wonders. A major update—Update 1.1.0—will also roll out, featuring the Natural Wonder Battle event and the addition of the Bermuda Triangle as a new wonder. Later in the month, Release 2 brings Simon Bolivar, along with Bulgaria and Nepal, plus more free content, including the Marvelous Mountains event and Mount Everest as a new natural wonder.</p>



<p>At some point between April and September, the Right to Rule Collection expands the game even further, introducing two new leaders, four new civilizations, and four new world wonders. Free content updates will also continue, adding new events, challenges, and updates for all players.</p>



<p>Firaxis also promised more updates for players in October and beyond for the first Civilization game in nine years. </p>



<p>A specific release date for the Crossroads of the World collection will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>
