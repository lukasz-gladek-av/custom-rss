<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 roadmap is live now. It provides new details about the Zombies mode, including the Shattered Veil map and new enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-zombies-season-3-map-shattered-veil">Black Ops 6 Zombies Season 3 Map: Shattered Veil</h2>



<p>Shattered Veil is the new map for Black Ops 6 Zombies Season 3 on April 2. It is set in an old mansion called Colton Hall. Players have arrived to meet S.A.M. with the Sentinel Artifact in their possession. They must unlock the mysteries of this artefact with the help of S.A.M.’s synthetic mind; however, things will not be that easy for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players must enter Colton Hall and confront the new tyrant from the next chapter of the Black Ops 6 Zombies narrative. The map features different areas to explore, including a main hall with a massive fossil exhibit, an outdoor area, and a basement to unearth all kinds of mysteries.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-brings-new-zombies-enemies">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Brings New Zombies Enemies</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap has revealed brand new enemies for the Zombies mode. First up is the Elder Disciple, a strange floating apparition found in the mansion’s estate. These enemies can use dark magic to summon more undead to the battle and even force them to evolve. Low-ranking zombies can transform into a Doppelghast or some other sinister form with the help of the Elder Disciple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zombies Season 3 also sees the arrival of other entities from the Shattered Veil. Players should keep an eye out for the toxic zombie, as it can leave a damaging pool of acid around it. However, it is easy to spot, with its greenish hue and more skeletal exterior, and it makes shrieking sounds when close.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-zombies-season-3-new-weapons">Black Ops 6 Zombies Season 3 New Weapons</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap has introduced two new wonder weapons for the Zombies mode: the Ray Gun Mark II and the Wunderwaffle DG-2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ray Gun Mark II allows players to attack multiple Zombies simultaneously through a three-round burst of energy and doubles as a bludgeoning instrument. Players can also test three different variants of the Ray Gun Mark II. The W variant provides similar bullet patterns as a submachine gun, the P variant mimics a shotgun, and the R variant can be compared to a Marksman Rifle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other new weapon is Wunderwaffle DG-2, the best way to electrify hordes of zombies quickly. Players can use this weapon to inflict chain-lighting bolts that can stun crowds and provide terminal damage over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Warner Bros. Games has canceled the planned Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition. </p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new report</a> from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, the definitive edition and DLC’s cancellation comes as part of “an ongoing restructure at the entertainment company’s video game unit.”</p>



<p>The project was officially canceled this week “due to concerns that the amount of content was not substantial enough to justify the price being considered.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> exclusively first reported</a> on the development of the Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition and DLC back in October 2024. The new version of the game was scheduled to include 10-15 hours of additional content, including a new story quest, side quest, activities, and outfits.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-exclusive-yves-guillemot-s-internal-memo-on-ubisoft-and-tencent-s-new-subsidiary">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXCLUSIVE – Yves Guillemot’s Internal Memo on Ubisoft and Tencent’s New Subsidiary</a></h6>



<p>In addition to the definitive edition of the game, the DLC was expected to be available separately for those who already owned the base game.</p>



<p>With no extra content now planned for Hogwarts Legacy, the studio seems to be moving forward focusing on the eventual sequel to the popular game. Back in November, outgoing Warner Bros. Games president <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-in-production-at-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Haddad said that Hogwarts Legacy 2</a> was a “very big priority” for the company and that production on the game was in progress.</p>



<p>The sequel is being developed by the same studio—Avalanche Software—that developed the first Hogwarts Legacy. The original game has sold nearly 35 million copies, and has remained a top-selling game each month since its February 2023 release.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 roadmap has revealed new multiplayer maps, modes, additional equipment, and multiplayer ranked play changes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-maps">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Maps</h2>



<p>In Black Ops 6 season 3, players can check out five new maps and a variant. Barrage is a 6v6 medium-sized Core map set in 1968 Vietnam. Nomad is a 6v6/2v2 small-sized Strike map where players battle in the ruins of a fortified settlement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next up is the return of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beloved-cod-maps-coming-back-to-black-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan-favourite map</a>, Firing Range. Black Ops 6 Season 3 has received a remastered version of Firing Range, a 6v6, medium-sized Core map that finally returned to the series after Black Ops 4 in 2018. Next is Haven, a 6v6, medium-sized core map set in a KGB Safehouse in 1991.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last up is Signal, which is again a 6v6/2v2, small-sized Strike Map. Players start their battles from opposing submarine bays while going through the Control room of an ocean rig numbers station. Additionally, a Nuketown variant called Blazetown will be released for a limited time mid-season.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-multiplayer-modes">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Multiplayer Modes</h2>



<p>Coming to the new multiplayer game modes revealed in the Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap, players will see the return of two classic modes, Sharpshooter and Demolition. There’s also a limited-time mode called Joint Operators.</p>



<p>Sharpshooter is a free-for-all party mode where every player needs to use the same loadout, and it changes every 45 seconds. Every time it changes, you will receive a new primary weapon, secondary Weapon, dedicated melee weapon, tactical equipment and lethal equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In Demolition, players will alternate between attacking and defensive positions across two bomb sites. The attacking team wins when it destroys the bomb and receives a time bonus for the first detonation. All the players from the attacking team spawn with bombs, and there are multiple respawns for both teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Joint Operators, players need to test their skills in a gauntlet of five Core mode variants in a single match: Head Stash (TDM), Inhalation (Domination), Hotbox (Hardpoint), Very High Target (HVT), and Munchies (Kill Confirmed). The modes will include some modifiers, too, like double health, low gravity, hallucinations and third-person POV.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-perks">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Perks</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap reveals additional equipment, such as two new perks and a scorestreak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Close Shave is an Enforcer type Perk, which automatically uses the player’s Dedicated Melee attack when they perform a weapon butt attack. Vendetta is a Recon-type perk that arrives mid-season. When the player respawns, it makes their killer’s last known location for a short duration—bonus points for exacting revenge. Death Machine is the new Lethal type Scorestreak.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-multiplayer-ranked-changes">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Multiplayer Ranked Changes</h2>



<p>Lastly, Black Ops 6 Season 3 roadmap has revealed new changes and additions for Multiplayer Ranked Play. Players can take their competitiveness to the next level as the same settings, maps, modes, and weapon restrictions used by the Call of Duty League have been added to the game. Winning matches rewards players with SR (Skill Rating), and progressing through the ranks will reward players with Rank Skins and Win Challenge rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the developers have added Retroactive SR Adjustments to reverse the impact of cheaters. When a Ranked Cheater is banned, any players that lost against them will be refunded their SR. Also, a new feature has been added that lets you rejoin Ranked Matches if they were disconnected. However, players need to rejoin within 5 minutes. Check out Ranked Play rewards and Weapon Blueprints <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-three-critical-launch-announcement#MULTIPLAYER" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Employees Worried About Layoffs After Tencent Deal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-worried-about-layoffs-after-tencent-deal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-employees-worried-about-layoffs-after-tencent-deal.1147008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-worried-about-layoffs-after-tencent-deal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Thursday afternoon, Ubisoft announced that it was forming a new subsidiary company with Tencent that will include the company’s three biggest franchises along with a number of studios. This has led to a number of employees within Ubisoft to become worried about mass layoffs happening in the coming months either before or after the deal with Tencent is completed.</p>



<p>Not long after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the deal was announced</a>, multiple current Ubisoft employees reached out to express feelings of uneasiness and concern about the future of the company. Specifically, those not working on Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internal email acquired</a> by Insider Gaming, Ubisoft’s Marie-Sophie de Waubert said that she understands that there is uncertainty and questions surrounding what’s going to happen. She also tried to calm any worries about those not working on the three franchises.</p>



<p>“I also want to be clear: if you’re not currently working on these brands, it doesn’t mean your work matters any less,” she said. “This agreement will benefit all of Ubisoft, giving us the means to spark more innovation and creativity across the board. This marks the beginning of a new chapter, and you play a vital role in shaping it.”</p>



<p>Despite the messaging, however, some aren’t buying it.</p>



<p>“We feel [expletive] if we’re not on the big three,” one current Ubisoft employee said under the condition of anonymity. “They can say these things in an email, but when it comes down to it, we feel like we know where priorities are.”</p>



<p>Said another employee currently working on an unannounced project, “I want to think our team is okay right now, but we don’t know. You’d think they’d have at least some sort of clarity for us before publicly announcing the deal.”</p>



<p>The other messages received all relayed similar sentiments. There is some excitement and hope that a turnaround is coming for the company, but until questions about their status are answered, those in various areas of the company don’t want to get happy.</p>



<p>“We just want to know what’s going on,” one source said. “They promised transparency and regular communication with us, but we’ll see if that actually happens.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft regarding what the deal with Tencent means for its employees and the possibility of layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to the article.</p>



<p>Ubisoft anticipates the full deal to be completed before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for employees at Ubisoft? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1775/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
