<p>Through a new <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1899863156995903687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter), the official Assassin’s Creed account confirmed that Shadows will be playable through the Steam Deck on the day the game releases.

<p>Cloak &amp; Dagger is the most picked hero during Marvel Rivals Season 1.5 across both competitive and quick play. But the duo’s massive popularity isn’t deterring the balance team at NetEase from giving them a significant buff to their direct healing ability.</p>



<p>An already incredibly pick rate for Cloak &amp; Dagger could skyrocket even more after this next Marvel Rivals balance update.</p>



<h2 id="h-cloak-amp-dagger-will-get-buffed-in-marvel-rivals-season-1-5-balance-update">Cloak &amp; Dagger Will Get Buffed in Marvel Rivals Season 1.5 Balance Update</h2>



<p>As part of a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250311/41667_1217797.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“mid-season balance update for Season 1.5,”</a> Cloak &amp; Dagger is receiving a strong buff to the direct healing power of Dagger’s Lightforce Dagger. <strong>The direct healing effect from Lightforce Dagger on hit allies is increasing from 10 to 16</strong>. To balance this, the “spell field healing amount” that heals another nearby ally is being reduced from 18 to 16. </p>



<p>While this does mean Cloak &amp; Dagger’s ability to heal a wider group with their primary fire is slightly decreased, the amount of direct healing done to one target is getting a huge boost. Cloak &amp; Dagger’s full “clip” of 12 Lightforce Daggers will provide 192 points of healing to one ally instead of 120. Given that Dagger’s Light Explosion and Dagger Storm abilities are more geared towards healing a larger group anyway, these changes to Lightforce Dagger are a huge improvement.</p>

<p>According to Marvel Rivals pick data websites <a href="https://rivalsmeta.com/characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsMeta</a> and <a href="http://While this does mean Cloak &amp; Dagger's ability to heal a wider group with their primary fire is slightly decreased, the amount of direct healing done to one target is getting a huge boost. Cloak &amp; Dagger's full &quot;clip&quot; of 12 Lightforce Daggers will provide 192 points of healing to one ally instead of 120. Given that Dagger's Light Explosion and Dagger Storm abilities are more geared towards healing a larger group anyway, these changes Lightforce Dagger are a huge improvement." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsTracker</a>, Cloak &amp; Dagger is the most picked hero in both competitive and quick play. Both sites claim Cloak &amp; Dagger has a 50.44% pick rate in competitive play. The next highest is Invisible Woman at 44.39%, and then it’s a big drop down to number three: Rocket Raccoon at 28.99%. RivalsMeta tracks far fewer matches for quick play matches, but lists Cloak &amp; Dagger as the second most picked hero in that mode behind Invisible Woman.</p>



<p>Human Torch and Iron Man will also receive changes in the mid-season balance update for Season 1.5. Human Torch’s primary Fire Cluster projectile speed and count are increasing, and his Supernova ultimate is getting a damage increase but with an increased energy cost. The direct damage of Iron Man’s primary Repulsor Blast is getting decreased, but the damage dealt by the pulse is increasing.</p>



<p>How high do you think Cloak &amp; Dagger’s pick rate will get? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
