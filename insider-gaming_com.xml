<p>With Marathon’s most recent Closed Technical Test behind it, a new Community Playtest has been announced. Details are already available on how to sign up, but it brings more focus on the fact that there’s no sign of a Marathon release date.</p>



<p>October’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-marathon-closed-technical-test-dates-platforms-nda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Closed Technical Test</a> is done. Bungie has inevitably learned valuable data about the extraction shooter, and Insider Gaming has reported before that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has confirmed that Marathon will launch by March 2026</a>.</p>







<p>We’re one step closer to another test, but no closer to knowing when before March 2026 the full release will happen.</p>







<figure><figcaption>This feels like a marathon in itself. Credit to Bungie</figcaption></figure>



<p>The official <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Marathon/Playtests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marathon</a> website is now advertising and recruiting for the ‘Marathon December Community Playtest’ taking place in December 2025.</p>







<p>You can try out the latest extraction shooter build for yourself. It’s playable across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam, and Bungie has said this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Marathon December Community Playtest will run from December 12th to the 15th from 2PM PT to 8PM PT each day.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like before, the playtest is under a strict NDA, so you can’t share your footage or experience. It’s only for North America, so if you’re based outside of here, you’ll have to wait for the next one!</p>



<p>It’s true that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-leaks-closed-test-reveal-positivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks from the recent Closed Test were positive</a>. However, Bungie needs to commit to a release date soon and has to make sure it can compete with the dominance of ARC Raiders and Escape From Tarkov.</p>



<p>How is Marathon shaping up? Are you interested in it? Share your thoughts on the shotoer through the Official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios recently spoke about their next title, revealing that it shouldn’t be too far from Helldivers.</p>



<p>We have been hearing a lot about Helldivers 2 recently, with the developers also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-ceo-comments-on-switch-2-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commenting on a Switch 2 port</a>. However, we have yet to hear new details about the next game that Arrowhead Game Studios has been working on. The latest comments from the devs don’t provide too much information, but should be enough to make Helldivers fans happy. </p>



<h2 id="h-arrowhead-studios-next-game-will-not-be-too-far-from-helldivers">Arrowhead Studios’ Next Game Will Not Be ‘Too Far’ from Helldivers</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowheads-next-game-wont-be-something-thats-too-far-off-from-helldivers-2-creative-lead-says-were-looking-to-continue-the-legacy-of-what-weve-created/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Arrowhead Game Studios CCO, Johan Pilestedt, spoke a bit about their next title. Pilestedt first revealed that the game is currently in his favorite phase, the part he loves the most. The CCO revealed that he loves getting a new team together, breaking down boundaries among themselves, and getting to the heart of “who we are as people, and what games do we want to make together.”</p>



<p>Talking about what Arrowhead devs want to make, Pilestedt states that the team is “looking to continue the legacy of what we’ve created already.” The CCO added that the next title is “something that’s too far off from Helldivers”, which means that people who are massive Helldivers fans will be able to jump into their next game and “recognise the DNA” they have become familiar with over the years. The devs didn’t provide any more details about the game or explain how Helldivers will inspire it. </p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2’s Xbox port helped increase the sales and engagement for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 and PC versions</a>.

<p>The team behind FiveM has officially announced support for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition, allowing users to convert Legacy assets for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition through a new tool called Alchemist. </p>



<p>As we wait for Rockstar’s next big thing to arrive, GTA 6, players still have time to sink their teeth into all that Grand Theft Auto 5 and GTA Online have to offer. Recently, we were informed that GTA Online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-now-included-with-gta-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be included</a> with a GTA+ membership. Now, the modding community has some good news to celebrate, thanks to mods being updated for Enhanced Edition support. </p>



<h2 id="h-alchemist-will-convert-fivem-mods-for-gta-online-enhanced-edition">Alchemist Will Convert FiveM Mods for GTA Online Enhanced Edition</h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-alchemist-for-fivem/5366795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> by Cfx.re (via <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/new-fivem-conversion-tool-released-by-rockstar-games-owned-team/#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Intel</a>), Alchemist is the first tool in a series of updates set to arrive for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition to support FiveM. The new tool will allow players, server owners, and creators to convert assets that were originally made for the GTA 5 Legacy edition and make them compatible with the Enhanced Edition. Alchemist also lets users refine existing Legacy assets to address potential formatting or compatibility issues introduced by earlier tools.</p>



<p>The Asset Conversion feature in Alcehmist allows users to convert a folder and all its content automatically. When choosing the folder, Alchemist can identify all GTA 5 Legacy assets inside the subfolders and “convert them to the GTAV Enhanced format inside the selected target directory.” The tool will also copy scripts, interfaces, and configuration files without altering them. </p>



<p>In other news, GTA 6’s delay could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-delay-could-impact-halo-remake-gears-e-day-next-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact the launches</a> of Halo Remake, Gears E-Day, and the next Call of Duty. Additionally, Rockstar’s recent firings have led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-after-firings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal issues</a> with IWGB.
