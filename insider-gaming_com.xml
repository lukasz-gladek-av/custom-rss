<p>It was recently revealed that Death Stranding 2 will be released worldwide on June 26. Alongside the reveal, Hideo Kojima’s team at Kojima Productions released a new trailer to showcase the ambitious (and somewhat confusing) sequel to the 2019 epic that sold almost 20 million copies. The trailer, which was bursting with cinematic quality, boasted a runtime of a whopping 10 minutes.</p>



<p>In the trailer, we get a look at Neil, a mysterious character played by Luca Marinelli. If you get Solid Snake vibes from his character’s reveal, that’s because it’s almost by design.</p>

<h2 id="h-solid-stranding">Solid Stranding</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDMIVpVnef5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an Instagram post</a> from 2020, Hideo Kojima noted that Luca Marinelli had ‘caught his eye’. He remarked that the actor would be the ‘spitting image of Solid Snake’ if he put on a bandana, and lo and behold, he does just that in the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2 all these years later.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Luca Marinelli’s reveal in the Death Stranding 2 trailer could be pulled straight out of a Metal Gear remake – but the similarities to franchise that arguably made Kojima more than two decades ago don’t end there.</p>



<p>Further in the trailer, we get our first look at ‘Magellan Man’, a hulking construct that could be an alternate rendition of a Metal Gear weapon.</p>



<p>We don’t see much of Luca’s character in the Death Stranding 2 trailer, but like everything else featured, it’s more than enough to get the hype train stoked a little further. This is easily one of the most highly anticipated releases of 2025, and it promises to be a cinematic showstopper.</p>



<p>In tandem with the development of Death Stranding 2, Hideo Kojima is working with A24 to produce a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-adaptations-kojima-confirm/">Death Stranding movie</a>, as if the man wasn’t doing enough with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-od/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OD</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-physint-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physint</a>.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach has been a long time coming – are you excited about the impending release? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/motive%E2%80%99s-iron-man-game-might-be-demo-ready-at-gdc.1129704/</guid>

<p>In just a few days, GDC will take place in San Francisco (and <strong>Insider Gaming </strong>will be in attendance!). It’s a proving ground for countless developers and publishers to show off what they’re working on, as well as for manufacturers to reveal the latest and greatest in gaming technology.</p>



<p>One topic that has surfaced recently concerns EA Motive’s Iron Man game, which has been kept mostly under wraps since it was revealed more than two years ago. In a recent schedule post, it was revealed that Motive will be presenting <strong>something </strong>to do with Iron Man at GDC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-becoming-stark">Becoming Stark</h2>



<p>Almost nothing is known about the Iron Man game being pieced together by Motive, but there are high hopes that it’ll deliver nicely on expectations. Fans are wishing for an open-ended game with full suit customisation that allows them to immerse themselves in the role of Tony Stark.</p>



<p>In September 2022, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motive-studios-officially-announces-new-iron-man-game/">revealed that Motive</a> is working on the game, as well as contributing to the ongoing development of the next Battlefield title. Historically, Motive has contributed to the Dead Space Remake, Star Wars Squadrons, and Battlefront II.</p>



<p>On the Iron Man front, all we know right now is that it’s a single-player, third-person action title. Shortly after the game was announced, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motives-iron-man-game-already-starts-playtesting/">we covered the playtests</a> that were going on behind closed doors, and since then, production has kicked off in earnest, so it must be in a much better state by now.</p>



<p>Recently, eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j7gl6h/motive_may_show_off_iron_man_game_at_gdc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit users</a> discovered an Advanced Graphics Summit segment <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/advanced-graphics-summit-revolutionizing-texture-pipelines-eas-journey-with-texture-sets/909461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taking place at GDC on March 17</a>. The session is being led by a technical artist from Electronic Arts, and the content is set to be focused on the development of texture sets for Dead Space and Iron Man at Motive. </p>



<p>The belief is that Motive will be showing off at least <strong>something </strong>from Iron Man during this segment, which would represent our first look at the game since it was announced in 2022. Even if the technical demo provides little more than <strong>a look </strong>at Iron Man’s suit, fans will be satisfied.</p>



<p>As you need certain credentials to access the tech summit hosted by EA at GDC, it’s highly unlikely that anything will be released publicly around this time, but you never know. It’s also entirely possible that we’ll see some kind of demo or trailer revealed during the Epic Unreal showcase at GDC, given that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-iron-man-game-to-use-unreal-engine-5/">Iron Man is being built in UE5</a>.</p>



<p>What hopes do you have for Motive’s Iron Man? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-insider-claims.1129701/</guid>

<p>Recently, rumours started circulating that developers are starting to prepare games for the ‘next Xbox’. The focus title of these rumours was Call of Duty 2026 – it was claimed that it’d be released on whatever hardware the tech titan produces next, but a recent insider has suggested that might not be the case and that the next Xbox device will likely arrive in 2027 <strong>and not </strong>2026.</p>



<p>It was also suggested that the next Xbox won’t be a console at all, but more of a gaming PC with defined hardware that developers can better work with.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-consoles-for-xbox">The End of Consoles for Xbox</h2>



<p>For a while, Xbox has been teetering on a precipice. The brand has well and truly lost this generation of home consoles to the PlayStation 5, and the Xbox One generation should be forgotten about entirely at this point. Recently, a marketing campaign from Xbox proved that ‘everything is an Xbox’ and that you don’t even need a console anymore to be an Xbox-based gamer.</p>



<p>A former Xbox executive even went on record suggesting that Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-consoles-microsoft-would-not-make-choice/">would stop making hardware</a> right now if it had the choice.</p>



<p>In a segment on the most recent episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAOt7CKUEFY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Xbox Two podcast</a>, Jez Corden, an insider with a solid track record, mentioned that something drastic might be on the horizon.</p>



<p>Instead of creating a full-fledged Xbox console for a 2027 release, he said that Microsoft will instead produce ‘a PC in essence but with a TV-friendly shell that also has a specific set of specs in mind.’</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Developers will be building for a Windows PC in a way but in such a way that they know exactly what the specs will be, so they can optimise exactly for it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Corden also leaned towards writing off the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/">Call of Duty 2026 rumours</a>, explaining, <em>‘the devkit talk is more about what kind of specs they’ve been told to target for the next Xbox. I’m pretty sure the new hardware is not 2026; it’s 2027.’</em></p>



<p>The general assumption now is that the next Xbox will be a micro-form Windows-powered PC in a ‘console-like’ shell and chassis that can sit nicely under a television. </p>



<p>It’ll be compatible with all manner of peripherals and inputs, and it’ll likely have a ‘switchable mode’ that ports between a gaming interface and a general Windows layout, so you can treat it like a desktop PC as much as you would a home gaming console. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-lost-15-maps-back-to-back/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>OpTic Texas has found itself in a sticky spot since 2025 kicked off. The team’s last win in a qualifying stage was at the end of January, and at the Major in Madrid, the team crashed out after winning just one series in the lower bracket. The squad is on a historic losing streak, losing 15 maps in sequence and sitting one from the bottom in the CDL stage standings.</p>



<p>The team is drawing a 50-50 win-loss record right now in the overall season standings, but one more loss will push them into negative ground and could move them further down the leaderboard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-texas-in-turmoil">Texas in Turmoil</h2>



<p>The impact of the losing streak has been visible on the faces of the OpTic Texas crew in recent weeks. They’re looking sullen and extinguished on their camera feeds, and the energy that usually drives them is sorely lacking.</p>



<p>Recently, the organisation’s owner, Hector ‘H3CZ’ Rodriguez, made a controversial statement on stream, dubbing the squad the worst OpTic team ever. This losing streak is indeed like nothing we’ve ever seen for the organisation.</p>



<p>This stage alone, OpTic Texas has lost with an 0 – 3 scoreline against:</p>



<ul>
<li>Toronto Ultra</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Minnesota Rokkr</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe</li>
</ul>



<p>The running joke now is that even the Vegas Falcons, a team that has lost two dozen Hardpoint rounds since the season started and sits on a record of 0 – 16 overall has put up a better fight this stage.</p>











<p>OpTic’s most recent loss came at the hands of Toronto Ultra, which laid the utter smackdown against the team from Texas. In this series, JoeDecieves (ULT) set a new KD record at 2.05, helped by going double positive in the opening Hardpoint.</p>



<p>It was a crushing blow for Texas through and through, and the closing round of Control was a 3 – 0 masterclass from Ultra. Ironically, this is OpTic Texas’ Major event. The upcoming LAN tournament will be played at the arena in which they won their CDL Championship last year, and they’re entering the running in the worst position possible.</p>



<p>On social platforms everywhere, fans of the OpTic franchise are writhing and desperately figuring out a plan to right the ship. The consensus is that a major roster change is needed, but nobody seems to know who is at fault. The finger pointing is generally levelled at Kenny, and one of the most common claims is that Huke never should have been pushed back out for the return of Pred.</p>



<p>What do you think needs to be done for OpTic Texas to win a series? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>It’s theorised that the announcement could come during Kojima’s appearance at SXSW 2025, where Kojima Productions is set to host a panel. </p>



<p>If the pre-orders are not announced during the panel, then it’s almost certain that an announcement will be made later this month, as billbil-kun obtains his datamined information from the backend of websites and stores, meaning that the information has recently been uploaded to the backend and thus, ready for an announcement.</p>



<p>According to the leak, the game will have two different physical editions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;Edition : 79.99 euros / 69.99 US dollars / 69.99 pounds sterling</li>



<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Collector’s&nbsp;Edition : $229.99 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>As pointed out in the leak, the contents of the editions are currently unclear, but at a hefty $229.99 price tag for the collectors edition, it’s likely to contain some kind of statue. The original Death Stranding collectors edition featured a Baby BB Pod Replica.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2 was officially revealed at the Game Awards in 2022 and is set to launch on the PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>
