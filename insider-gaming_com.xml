<p>It has been estimated that there is rampant growth for the Indian gaming sector on the horizon. Per a recent report published by Lumikai, it was predicted that the region would see a CAGR of 20% leading to 2029, causing the market’s valuation to grow from around $3.8 billion today to $9.2 billion by 2029.</p>



<p>It was noted that gaming is India’s ‘fastest-growing new media segment’ behind video and OTT media.</p>

<h2 id="h-to-the-future">To The Future</h2>



<p>India boasts an audience of 591 million gamers, with a split of around 44% – 66% in favour of male players. Mobile games are king in the country, and Lumikai estimated that India is the second-largest consumer of mobile games in the world. That’s why games like BGMI, Call of Duty Mobile, and Free Fire do so well in the country.</p>



<p><em>As a side note, if you’re a Free Fire fan and are looking to score some free Diamonds, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-diamonds-in-free-fire-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out our guide</a>.</em></p>



<p>In recent years, the numbers have shown that Indian gamers (particularly those in the 18 to 30-year-old age group) have boosted their average weekly gaming time by around 30%. We’re also seeing a rapid expansion of the region’s esports industry, with more competitive gamers than ever appearing across the country.</p>



<p>Lumikai, a data aggregation firm, revealed that when it started collecting data in 2020, there were just 25 notable gaming companies in India. In the most recent pass, more than 2,300 companies (‘leads’) were recorded in the country. One senior associate at Lumikai, Aditya Deshpande, suggested that the growth of gaming will <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/indias-game-market-could-grow-from-3-8b-to-9-2b-by-2029-lumikai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">surpass the value of Bollywood</a> in the coming years.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that <a href="https://www.lumikai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lumikai</a> is an Indian venture capital firm <strong>focused </strong>on the Indian market, but external firms have predicted similar growth.</p>

<p>The 2025 iteration of the Grammy Awards is fast approaching, and once again, the nominees for ‘Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media’ have been revealed. Put simply, it’s the award that crowns the best soundtrack from a video game that has emerged in recent months, but the line-up is slim and PlayStation has dominated this time around.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-games-nominated-for-a-grammy">Games Nominated for a Grammy</h2>



<p>Ubisoft and PlayStation are dominating the nominee roster this year for the ‘Best Video Game Soundtrack’ category at the Grammy Awards:</p>



<ul>
<li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</li>



<li>God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla</li>



<li>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws</li>



<li>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</li>
</ul>



<p>Bear McCreary (God of War) is a regular nominee at this point—he’s had his name thrown into the pot during every Grammy Awards ceremony where this category has existed. The category was only opened up in 2023, and previously, it was won by Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla in 2023 and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor in 2024.</p>



<p>Could Ubisoft go for the triple header and win again this time with Star Wars Outlaws or Avatar?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, fans have had issues with this category at the Grammy Awards since it debuted in 2023. Back then, the likes of <strong>Call of Duty </strong>made it into the running, which rankled with gamers worldwide. It seemed then – and it still seems now – that indie titles with better soundtracks are being snubbed for the big, mainstream names.</p>



<p>It reached a point where one of the voting board members <a href="https://x.com/masonlieberman/status/1592916480160473088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to social media</a> to explain how things work behind the scenes. He explained that low participation led to few nominations and that the vast majority of the voters on the board were film composers who rarely – if ever – interacted with the video game world.</p>



<p>This year, the only game that isn’t one of the ‘bigger hitters’ is a remake of a game that was released in 1980, which feels almost shoehorned in to hit a diversity requirement.</p>



<p>Do you want to see more diversity in this category at the Grammy Awards? Let us know in the comments.</p>
