            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-will-compete-with-other-extraction-shooters-by-not-competing-interview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon is set to be a game-changing extraction shooter, but it’s hard to break into a genre that’s so dominated by existing titles. For instance, Escape from Tarkov has held the top spot in that vertical for many years, and those that have tried to challenge the game have ultimately failed or fallen to the wayside.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon will attempt to rival the likes of Escape from Tarkov by <strong>not </strong>rivalling Escape from Tarkov. That’s straight from the mouth of the game’s director, Joe Ziegler, who recently sat down with Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky to discuss all aspects of the upcoming shooter.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-most-interesting-stories">‘The Most Interesting Stories’</h2>



<p>Joe Ziegler was transparent when talking to Jake Lucky about Marathon following a recent behind-closed-doors playtest. He suggested that the reason why extraction shooters fail is because they come in and worry about competing with other, existing titles – but it’s all about trying to be <strong>different enough </strong>to live alongside those top dogs.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>In another recent interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-boss-says-industry-doomed-to-unnecessarily-brutal-layoffs-while-chasing-after-the-battle-royales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arrowhead’s Johan Pilestedt</a> explained that trying to replicate the success of a game like Escape from Tarkov will always be fruitless because people don’t want to play the same game over and over again.</p>



<p>That’s what Ziegler alluded to in his interview with Jake Lucky:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I might be naive in saying this but I’ll be honest… To me, I don’t think of making games as like, directly competing and trying to eat a bunch of other people’s lunch. For me, whenever I think about it, it’s like, how do we offer something that’s interesting and cool and can live in its own space alongside other titles and be just as big and important as others.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that being said, Bungie has worked from a variety of perspectives to make Marathon as unique as possible.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We really do want to create some of the most interesting stories you’ve ever had, and we’re inputting a lot of dynamics to make that happen. At the end of a night of playing Marathon, we want you to tell a really cool story to somebody else, you know? To be excited.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team is also making Marathon the most accessible extraction shooter in the market, doing away with punishing mechanics and a steep learning curve to make something that everyone can play and enjoy. They’re hellbent on ‘breaking the already existing military space’ and making something much more adventurous in Marathon.</p>



<p>Do you think Marathon can exist happily alongside a dominant extraction shooter like Escape from Tarkov? Let me know in the comments what you think, or visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-doesnt-have-proximity-chat/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-%E2%80%98social-extraction-experience%E2%80%99-but-the-game-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-proximity-chat.1163091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-doesnt-have-proximity-chat/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been confirmed that Bungie’s Marathon will not have proximity chat despite the developers wanting the game to be a ‘social extraction experience’.</p>



<p>The news of no proximity chat came via a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/marathon-wont-have-proximity-chat-because-itd-be-way-too-toxic-i-dont-think-anyone-has-a-good-solution-to-that-just-yet/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>, game director Joe Ziegler told PC Gamer that they don’t “have a solution yet” when it comes to the toxicity that proximity chat brings to players.</p>



<p>“I don’t think anyone really has a good solution to that just yet. Because we’re so dedicated to making sure that we’re creating a safe space where we don’t have players just flaming each other or doing terrible things to one another, I think we’re not ready to invest in prox chat until we have a solution,” he said.</p>







<p>The comments come <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-social-extraction-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following an interview that we published in collaboration with Jake Lucky</a>, where in the same day of interviews Joe Ziegler told Lucky that they want the game to be “more of a social extraction experience”.</p>



<p>Ziegler explained, “The key thing for us was making Marathon a little bit more of a social extraction experience where there’s a lot value in playing with other people that you know or people that you want and you all feel like you can create that adventure together and we’re not trying to fragment you all the time, you know?”</p>



<p>In the interview, Ziegler gave the example of being able to be respawned instead of just watching your teammates complete the match, or another example of “data cards” where your entire team can cash them out together.</p>



<p>However, I think a <strong>big point</strong> is being missed here and the conflicting comments are a bit of a head scratcher. Proximity chat ADDS the much-needed social aspect to a game and while I understand Bungie’s stance on toxicity, surely players who don’t want to engage with proximity chat can just… you know… turn it off? Or better yet, just give players the ability to report others for toxicity. These are not new ideas and with the right infrastructure (moderation), they are the solution that Bungie is looking for.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, you’re never going to stop people from being toxic, no matter what you do.</p>



<p>Without proximity chat, Bungie is missing the mark entirely on not only what makes extraction shooters fun and exciting and to be honest… Makes the whole ‘social extractions shooter’ comment laughable.</p>



<p>Marathon is set to be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on September 23, 2025.</p>

    <div>
        
<p>A new list of characters that are supposedly coming to Fortnite in the near future have been leaked online.</p>



<p>The leak comes courtesy of ShpeshalNick of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnJBa4Q0JSw&amp;ab_channel=XboxEra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra podcast</a>, who has a tendency to be fairly accurate when it comes to Fortnite information. According to Nick, the following characters are coming to Fortnite sometime in the future:</p>



<ul>
<li>Jack Black (apparently its just Jack Black and not connected to the Minecraft release)</li>



<li>More Mortal Kombat Characters</li>



<li>Death Stranding Characters</li>



<li>Tony Hawk Pro Skater Characters</li>



<li>DOOM The Dark Ages Doom Slayer (a DOOM slayer version of The Dark Ages model)</li>



<li>Double Dragons Characters (Billy and Jimmy)</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Characters</li>



<li>Agent 47 (Hitman)</li>



<li>Marvel Characters (in a pixel art style)</li>



<li>A player from the NBA</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-tony-hawk-fortnite-event">Tony Hawk Fortnite Event</h2>



<p>Another surprising detail to come from the leak is that Nick also revealed that there is going to be some kind of Tony Hawk Pro Skater event, but what that looks like is currently unknown and which characters will be coming to Fortnite from the game is unclear (obviously we can assume Tony Hawk himself is one).</p>



<p>You can watch the full discussion of the leak below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 has already been confirmed to release on July 11</a>, 2025, so it’s entirely possible that the event will be take place around the release. But as Nick points out, Epic Games has been notorious in the past with not abiding by any key dates, so it could release before or after the games release.</p>



<p>Which characters are you most looking forward to seeing coming to Fortnite?&nbsp;Let me know what you think on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>, or post a comment below.</p>

<p>Hideo Kojima recently revealed on an episode of the Koji Pro radio broadcast that Death Stranding 2 will have a unique boss battle mechanic. If you succumb to a boss, you’ll have the option to simply move on and soak up everything you need to know about that boss fight via a ‘visual novel’ feature.</p>



<p>This is good news for players who traditionally struggle with intense boss fights, which are often front and centre in Kojima’s games.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-effortless-victory">Effortless Victory</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/koji10_tbs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Koji Pro radio broadcast</a> uncovered (and helpfully translated) by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1910720581085126707" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki_JPN</a> has revealed that boss fights in Death Stranding 2 can be walked through without any effort. If you want to skip through the game as quickly as possible, you simply need to <strong>lose </strong>the boss fight and select an option on the death screen to ‘skip over’ the boss.</p>



<p>Some have complained that this is giving in to the ‘hand-holding’ trend that’s coming up far too often in video games, but I, for one, am happy to see it. There’s a reason why I don’t play games like Elden Ring, and it’s because I suck ass at boss battles.</p>



<p>Instead of seeing the results of a successful boss battle, the player will see a breakdown of the fight through a ‘visual novel’ mechanic that gives them the full scope and ensures they’re not missing any lore or context.</p>



<p>I love this, and I really hope it catches on.</p>



<p>It was noted by Kojima in the same segment that Death Stranding 2 is now ‘95% complete’.</p>



<p>Do you think this kind of mechanic is babying players, or are you happy to see it? Let me know what you think on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>, or post a comment below.</p>

<p>The most insane losing streak in the history of esports has just been broken as the Vegas Falcons <strong>finally </strong>found a win over OpTic Texas in the Call of Duty League. It was a loss streak of 20 matches back-to-back for the Vegas Falcons, and it took a monumental roster overhaul for the first victory to be found.</p>



<p>Given some of the changes between teams, the win over OpTic Texas is nothing short of poetic.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-falcons-soar">Falcons Soar</h2>



<p>Before this fixture against OpTic Texas, the Vegas Falcons sat on <strong>zero wins </strong>in the CDL 2025 season. From Major to Minor and through the qualifying stages, the team failed to gain traction in a single series, falling against all comers in historic fashion.</p>



<p>It was harsh, but several elements contributed to the streak, such as an ever-changing lineup of players that never let chemistry be made. The all-Saudi roster was recently refreshed with North American players, except Exnid, who has been a consistent talent in recent weeks.</p>



<p>One of the most talked-about signings was Pred, the SMG aficionado who came over from OpTic Texas mere days ago. Pred won the CDL Championship with OpTic Texas last season, but a troubled hiatus and a paltry return to the roster led to this change landing.</p>



<p>In the series against OpTic Texas, the comms were on point, the team was frying, and the movement was slick. In the last week, something stunning must have happened to the Vegas Falcons because this win revealed a hunger to succeed.</p>



<p>It was as though every map was neck-and-neck. The opening Hardpoint was evenly matched, the first Search went to an eleventh round, and the Control was a back-and-forth. The final Hardpoint was all Falcons, though. That sealed the deal and landed the organisation its first win in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Damn.</p>

<p>It’s a bold move to stand up an extraction shooter game in this day and age. Many have come before and have fallen short of expectations, and the ones that have stuck around have effortlessly dominated the scene – I’m looking at <em>you</em>, Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Regardless, Bungie is breaking into the genre with Marathon, an upcoming extraction shooter set in a sci-fi universe. In a recent interview, Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky sat down with Joe Ziegler, the game’s director, to learn <strong>exactly why </strong>the team wants to try making a success of an extraction shooter when so many have failed.</p>

<p>The extraction shooter model ebbs and flows, but it’s fast becoming a staple of the wider industry, with many developers having thrown their hat in the ring. The next biggest studio working on an extraction shooter is Bungie, breaking into the vertical with Marathon, a reboot of a game from the 1990s.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

<p>When Jake Lucky caught up with Joe Ziegler after a session testing Marathon, he asked <strong>why </strong>the team had aimed to produce an extraction shooter when the market has a tentative reception at best for new games in that space.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Extraction shooters to us symbolise this rare circumstance in gaming where you have a lot of different choices inside of a game experience, and all of them become meaningful in a weird way. As you’re playing it, you get these really dramatic stories that occur about survival. Every decision you make kind of becomes a point of regret or a point of excitement.</p>



<p>This idea that behind the corner there’s this brand new light that could exist there or this dark hole that you will get destroyed in. That adventurous aspect of trying to survive a dangerous environment is just super exciting and super unique, and I think that’s really why the extraction shooter was such a perfect game for us to make. </p>



<p>It’s because, the studio likes to do these crazy FPS experiences that really have uplifting and very emotionally engaging moments – we wanted to take that to the next level with something like Marathon.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team explained that, with Marathon, they want to create a social extraction experience that’s more enjoyable, accessible, and entertaining. It’s not trying to become the next Escape from Tarkov and it’s certainly not as punishing as the 10-year-old Battlestate Games extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Marathon is all about revelling in an adventure with friends, that’s why the core gameplay loop is accessible only in a team format – for now. Bungie wants players to have an exciting experience that never culminates in a depressing loss after an hour in a single raid, which can be typical for Escape from Tarkov players.</p>

<p>Marathon is Bungie’s latest stab at a new genre, with the team attempting to break into the extraction shooter market. It’s a game set within a distant universe, with players controlling cybernetic soldiers fighting to survive across a variety of maps and environments.</p>



<p>The team revealed today that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-access-marathon-alpha-closed-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alpha is lined up for the game</a>, set to take place in the next couple of weeks. That’s all well and good, but when it finally hits the market, will Marathon be free to play, or will it have a premium price tag?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-marathon-price-guide">Marathon Price Guide</h2>



<p>Marathon is a sci-fi extraction shooter with more unique elements under the hood than the average player might realise. It’s an attempt from Bungie to disrupt the genre and challenge games like Escape from Tarkov, which have long held the top spot in the market.</p>



<p>It’s been widely speculated that Marathon will be a free-to-play title, however, in an announcement following the games reveal, that’s simply not the case.</p>



<div><p>Taking to the official X account, the Marathon account said, “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-is-not-free-to-play-will-be-a-premium-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon will be a premium title</a>. Marathon will not be a ‘full-priced’ title.”</p><p>“We’ll announce details this Summer,” they continued.</p></div>



<p>It means that you will be expected to part with some cash in September, but as to how much is currently unclear. The going rumors suggest that the game will have a $40 price tag, but so far, no one has stepped forward with a concrete report. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-marathon-on">What Platforms is Marathon On?</h2>



<p>Marathon will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. The recently revealed alpha will be available across all platforms, and the full release will have crossplay and cross-save functionality.</p>



<p>How much will you pay for Marathon when it launches? Do you think Bungie have missed out on not making Marathon free to play? Let me know what you think in the comments, or check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-reveals-marathon-gameplay-during-extended-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the full gameplay reveal for Bungie’s extraction shooter Marathon</a>, it’s been reported that the game will be a “premium” release that players pay for, but the exact pricing has not been made official yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-won-t-be-full-price-but-players-will-still-have-to-pay">Marathon Won’t Be Full Price, But Players Will Still Have to Pay</h2>



<p>In a lengthy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon impressions piece</a> on GameSpot, Tamoor Hussain writer wrote that Marathon will launch September 23rd as a “premium product, meaning players will be asked to pay full price.” Hussain also confirmed that the game will feature a seasonal content model with its own battle pass, three maps at launch (a fourth coming later), and a persistent story.</p>



<p>Before players panic about having to pay $70 though, it’s already been reported that Marathon’s price point won’t be close to that figure. Forbes gaming writer Paul Tassi, who’s long covered Bungie and Destiny, <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1911124290545549611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated on X</a> that they’ve received confirmation that Marathon is not $70, and will be “not even close” to that number. The official Marathon account has since confirmed that the game will be a premium title, but not full-priced, and stated that more details would be announced in the summer.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Marathon will be a premium title. Marathon will not be a ‘full-priced’ title. 

We’ll announce details this Summer.</span></p></article></div>



<p>As Tassi wrote in an earlier post, releasing closer to $30 or $40 “of course still comes with its own risks.” Several players reacting to the reveal that Marathon won’t be free-to-play immediately are already making comparisons to Concord. Concord, a multi-player shooter released in 2024 as the debut game for Firewalk Studios, launched at a $40 price point for its standard edition. Sadly for Firewalk, the game received luke-warm receptions from critics, and failed to establish any sort of reliable player base. Within two weeks of launch, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game was shut down</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-shut-down-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Firewalk Studios was closed two months later</a>, in what’s considered one of the biggest launch disasters in gaming history.</p>



<p>While Bungie has the distinct advantage of a far more impressive track record to boast, Marathon will still face the same challenge: attaching a premium price point for a game that will compete in a saturated market of free-to-play titles.</p>
