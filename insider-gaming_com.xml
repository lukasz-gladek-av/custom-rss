<p>Gamescom is set to unveil a flood of news, reveals, and trailers, with Future Games Show taking a central role with a lengthy livestream, and we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<p>The latter end of 2025 is shaping up to be a big one with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> among the big releases, though the calendar will likely be even more stacked following all the reveals at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-start-date-times-how-to-watch-how-long-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Opening Night Live</a> may take the majority of the headlines, plenty more will be shown at Future Games Show, so we’re providing the details so you don’t miss out.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-future-games-show-at-gamescom">When is Future Games Show at Gamescom?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big names. Image via Future Games Show</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Future Games Show at Gamescom takes place on Wednesday, August 20, the day after Opening Night Live, with a host of new reveals and news.</strong></p>



<p>Gamescom itself runs until Sunday, August 24, with a host of in-person events and showcases streamed online. This includes several Future Games Show streams, though the main one is on Wednesday.</p>







<p><strong>Future Games Show at Gamescom takes place at 8pm CEST, which is 11am PT. We’ve got a full breakdown of timezones below.</strong></p>



<p>The showcase will start bang on time, with no countdown beyond the start time, so make sure you’re locked in ahead of time. If you do miss any announcements for one reason or another, we’ll have all the biggest news and reveals on Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Check out the table below to see the start time of Future Games Show in your timezone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">13:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">14:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">19:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">04:00 (August 21)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-future-games-show-at-gamescom">How to Watch Future Games Show at Gamescom</h2>



<p><strong>Future Games Show at Gamescom will be available to watch directly on YouTube and Twitch, along with TikTok, and plenty of other streaming platforms.</strong></p>



<p>From experience, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/futuregamesshow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> is the best place to follow the live stream as it’s often slightly ahead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZVRK-bSdkjo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, so if you’re scrolling social media at the same time, I highly recommend watching via Twitch to avoid spoilers.</p>



<p>Choose whichever platform works for you, though, and keep Insider Gaming open to track all the biggest news as it breaks.</p>







<p><strong>Future Games Show takes place on the ground at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, the home of the event.</strong></p>



<p>The showcase will be hosted by David Hayter, the voice of Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid franchise, and Maggie Robertson, the star behind Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil: Village. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-future-games-show-at-gamescom">How Long is Future Games Show at Gamescom?</h2>



<p><strong>The main Future Games Show stream is 90 minutes long, though it will be immediately followed by FGS Live, a 40-minute show with additional trailers and reveals.</strong></p>



<p>Given the show is set to be action-packed from beginning to end, I’d advise making sure you have everything you need to lock in for over two hours so you don’t miss any of the reveals.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kai Cenat has unveiled his Fortnite Icon Series skin and announced his next Mafiathon, both of which arrive in September.</p>



<p>Cenat used the Las Vegas sphere to show off the first look at his Fortnite skin, alongside announcing the start date of Mafiathon 3—with both landing on the same day.</p>



<p>Fortnite and Cenat had already teased the reveal of the skin, which came on the eve of the latest Fortnite update that drops August 19, and big things lie ahead.</p>



<h2 id="h-kai-cenat-fortnite-skin-lands-september-12">Kai Cenat Fortnite Skin Lands September 12</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1957670133281018326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Las Vegas sphere unveiling</a> from Kai Cenat showed off the Icon Series Skin alongside what appears to be an aura emote, while his hamster, Lil Cenat, also featured—which may be a hint towards the drop of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pets-are-reportedly-being-reworked-to-be-a-bit-more-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s leaked companion update</a>.</p>



<p>Releasing September 12, the drop of Cenat’s Fortnite skin coincides with the start date of his mega Mafiathon 3 streaming event. The previous event, held in December 2024, saw the streamer reclaim the Twitch subscriber record.</p>



<p>Mafiathon has featured a host of special guests in the past, with the next event set to be no different, and, with the start on the same date as the Fortnite skin drop, we can expect Fortnite to feature heavily.</p>



<p>Cenat is the third content creator to receive an Icon Series skin in 2025, following on from Clix and Sparx in March. Other Icon Series skins released this year include baseball star Shohei Ohtani, former Tottenham captain Son Heung-Min, and the stars of Fortnite Festival seasons.</p>

<p>The initial release is not the end of the road, however, with plans to support the title moving forward with additional content, and the first DLC has been revealed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sega.com/news/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-dlc-speedrun-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SEGA announced</a> the SEGA Villains Stage will be released in early 2026, featuring iconic Sonic the Hedgehog villain Dr. Eggman, with two additional villains due to be announced.</p>



<p>Although a precise release date for the DLC was not shown, more news could be on the horizon as the release date edges closer, and the news continues SEGA’s heavy crossover content.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing Crossworlds, another SEGA title due to launch on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworld-release-date-trailer-features-minecraft-persona-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 25</a>, has already announced that characters from Minecraft, Persona, SpongeBob SquarePants, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will feature.</p>



<p>SEGA’s push to revive its dormant franchises, like Shinobi, after over 14 years, could bring a new audience to the title, particularly with additional crossover content.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals developer Netease has free rein to create and introduce original characters to the game, it has been confirmed.</p>



<p>Though the game already boasts a stacked roster of fan-favorite characters, alongside an almost endless list of Marvel names that could be brought into the fray, the door is open for the developers to create original characters.</p>



<p>Confirmation came via game director Guangguang, who didn’t confirm whether it was something Netease has planned, but it was clear there was a possibility—though it remains to be seen whether it could happen in the next year, a period in which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-marvel-rivals-devs-have-a-years-worth-of-characters-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters have already been prepared</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-stay-tuned-for-marvel-rivals-original-characters">‘Stay Tuned’ For Marvel Rivals Original Characters</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Original characters could be created. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/netease-green-light-marvel-create-original-characters-marvel-rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, Guangguang adopted his customary “stay tuned” response when asked if original characters were planned to be introduced, but confirmed Marvel has given permission for them to be created.</p>



<p>Though this might seem surprising given Marvel Rivals has over seven decades of comic book history and characters to fall back upon, it wouldn’t be the first time a new Marvel character has been introduced in a video game.</p>



<p>Luna Snow, who has become one of the most popular characters in Marvel Rivals, is the best example, having been created for Marvel Future Fight before making a comic book debut in 2019.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has shown that it can bring lesser-known characters into the limelight to become household names, as shown by the popularity of Jeff the Land Shark, so there’s every chance an original character could make waves.</p>



<p>Another example of a successful character being introduced outside of comic books comes from DC with Harley Quinn, who is now one of the most popular characters under the DC umbrella. She was first introduced in the Batman Animated Series in the 1990s.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Trailer Leak Confirms Release Date, Vault Edition, and ‘Mega Jump’ Boost Pack]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-trailer-leak-release-date-vault-edition-boost/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-trailer-leak-confirms-release-date-vault-edition-and-%E2%80%98mega-jump%E2%80%99-boost-pack.1273431/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eagle-eyed users have found an ad for Black Ops 7 that seems to have aired too early, promoting the game’s pre-order availability, release date, and Vault Edition pack. In the short, fifteen-second ad, we get a first look at boost jump abilities, a mission containing hulking mech suits, and some kind of dream sequence pitting players against a human enemy several storeys tall.</p>



<p>This ad was mistakenly released mere hours before Black Ops 7 is set to be revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-release-date-confirmed-in-leaked-ad">Black Ops 7 Release Date Confirmed in Leaked Ad</h2>



<p>On social media, users started circulating a screengrab of an ad for Black Ops 7. In this fifteen-second clip, we see highly vertical combat aided by ‘mega jump’ boost packs, <strong>not </strong>jetpacks. In the sequences that unfold, the player character leaps high into the air and coasts over the battlefield, which is a representation of the traversal in this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>We also see a snippet of a mission showing a fight against an enormous and heavily armed mech. In classic Black Ops style, things appear to get a little trippy as the player is forced into a battle against a Galactus-sized enemy in what looks like a dream sequence.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer (might have been removed by the time you read this):</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The screen grab is low resolution, but we get a look at the Vault Edition components, too. It looks like the skins that were previously leaked, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/">the Reznov Challenge Pack</a>, are all coming. When you pre-order, you’ll get early access to the beta, but the date for that test wasn’t revealed.</p>



<p>The release date was confirmed as November 14, which was suggested <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/">in an earlier leak</a>.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
