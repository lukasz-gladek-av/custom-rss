You can level up and master your weapons at your own pace, free from the pressure of competing against other players.</td><td data-align="center">Solo gamers who want to practice and XP farm before entering a long multiplayer session.

<h2 id="h-are-battlefield-6-portal-xp-farms-being-nerfed">Are Battlefield 6 Portal XP Farms Being Nerfed?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Battlefield Studios will be adjusting Battlefield 6’s Portal mode to “Diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences.”</strong></p>



<p>We can’t have nice things, can we? It depends on how you look at it, really. Battlerfield Portal probably wasn’t designed to be an XP grind; it was supposed to be a creative playground filled with fun-filled rides packed with madness. However, the community got smart and used Portal to level up player ranks, weapons, and more much quicker.</p>



<p>Depending on when you read this guide, the nerfs might have already happened. But we know for sure that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Portal XP Farms will be patched</a>.</p>

<p>The Horizon Zero Dawn movie aims to start shooting in 2026 and release in 2027. </p>



<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-copying-the-horizon-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony is fighting Tencent</a> for allegedly copying its Horizon series in its upcoming title, Light of Motiram. Sony recently described the title as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-calls-tencents-defense-in-horizon-clone-lawsuit-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blatant knock-off</a> of their game. Now, new documents have revealed more information, including the release plans for the Horizon Zero Dawn Movie. </p>



<h2 id="h-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-has-a-working-script-and-is-looking-for-a-director">Horizon Zero Dawn Movie Has a Working Script and is Looking for a Director</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-filming-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, the head of PlayStation Productions, Asad Qizilbash, spoke about the release plans for the Horizon Zero Dawn movie in a sworn declaration. Qizilbash stated that a film based on the Horizon series is in development in partnership with Columbia Pictures, with whom they have already partnered on the Uncharted and Gran Turismo films in 2023 and 2023, respectively. </p>



<p>Qizilbash added that they “already have a working script and are actively searching for a director.” The team aims to start “shooting the picture in 2026 and releasing it in 2027.” In the declaration, the PlayStation Productions head also spoke about Aloy’s significance as a brand, not just to the Horizon franchise, but to Sony PlayStation itself. The declaration doesn’t mention anything about the upcoming movie’s cast or plot. </p>



<p>In other news, Tencent had responded to Sony’s copyright and trademark infringement lawsuit with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-claps-back-at-sony-playstations-horizon-clone-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion to dismiss</a>. Additionally, Splash Damage, the studio behind Gears Tactics, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splash-damage-breaks-tencent-gears-tactics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has separated from Tencent</a> with the help of private investors.
