<p>If you had any doubts over the legitimacy of the recent wave of gargantuan Pokémon leaks, then The Pokémon Company COO Takato Utsunomiya calling for them all to be removed is probably the most telling piece of evidence you can ask for.</p>



<p>October 13 saw a seismic influx of Pokémon leaks hit the internet. We learned about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Generation 10’s Wind and Wave</a>, a bunch of new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon games, and the DLC Roadmap</a>, not to mention potential Pokémon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-reveals-boss-fight-and-mmo-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MMO Details</a>!</p>



<p>It’s been a rip-roaring few days, and we don’t think The Pokémon Company has taken too kindly to it all.</p>

<figure><figcaption>We’ve learned so much already. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Centro LEAKS</a> has become one of the go-to accounts in all of social media where Pokémon leaks are concerned. Some would argue it’s the account everyone refreshes. It posted a bunch of leaks ahead of Pokémon Legends Z-A, and it’s a regular source of Pokémon leaks for Pokémon Pocket and other associated media.</p>



<p>The page reported on October 16 that it had been contacted directly by The Pokémon Company.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Takato Utsunomiya, the Chief Operating Officer of The Pokémon Company, has personally sent an email to Centro Leaks / X to take down the Pokémon leak images.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Centro LEAKS has reiterated that it will not be removing any such leaks or images. In fact, the page has doubled down on its findings and revealed that among the images they want removed are the alleged Pokémon Wind and Wave logos.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The social media page has now pinned a message from Oct. 17, 2024, saying: “If only he knew that laws don’t exist in Perú.” </p>



<p>The message was presumably another instance of copyright issues between the page and The Pokémon Company, and it’s clear that Centro LEAKS’ stance won’t change in 2025. So, unless The Pokémon Company has something stronger in mind, Centro LEAKS will have all the original leaks on its page for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>Which of the leaks has intrigued you the most? Do the new Wind and Waves designs look good?

<p>Dead Space 4 is a wishlist game for many survival-horror fans. Glen Schofield is the genius behind the original title, and while he didn’t have any direct involvement in its sequels, the creator wants to return and get horrible again with Dead Space 4.</p>



<p>It was almost a year ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/glen-schofield-dead-space-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schofield revealed EA turned down Dead Space 4</a>. There’s a wide belief that the Dead Space Remake didn’t meet sales expectations for Krafton. This is likely why we haven’t heard a sniff about a <a href="http://Dead Space 2 Remake Shelved for Battlefield, It’s Claimed – UPDATE: EA Denies Claim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Space 2 Remake</a>, let alone a fourth game. However, Schofield has reiterated his desire to return to the world of nail-biting terror and necromorphs.</p>



<h2 id="h-glen-schofield-wants-to-make-dead-space-4">Glen Schofield Wants To Make Dead Space 4</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One more round? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Schofield declared in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I have quite a few ideas that I’m ready to go with, and one of them is Dead Space 4. The fact that EA just got bought, I think there’s an opportunity. I’m already making calls.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He revisited his trip to EA, which we’ve already mentioned above, and doubled down on the fact that EA has seemingly moved on from Dead Space:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I went to [EA] recently and they’re like no, we’re not interested anymore. I said, I can get back the leadership team. I need the models from EA Motive [Dead Space Remake creator] and I can save you 30 to 40 million dollars on the idea that I have. And, they’re like, ‘no.'”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Dead Space creator believes the $55 billion takeover of EA could lead to some changes, though: “I am more optimistic because somebody new could buy [the rights to the Dead Space IP].”</p>



<p>EA did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-space-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ask if fans were interested in more Dead Space Remakes</a> shortly after the 2023 release. However, it appears that all plans are on hold for now. Would you like to see a Dead Space 2 Remake? Or can we go one better and finally get the Dead Space 4 sequel we’ve all been waiting for?

<p>Glen Schofield co-founded Sledgehammer Games and would later go on to become the CEO of Striking Distance Studios. But it’s at Sledgehammer where the director was able to flex his creative chops on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Advanced Warfare, and WWII.</p>



<p>Schofield left Sledgehammer in 2018, and new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-the-haunting-2025-unveiled-poster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> titles have appeared across multiple studios: Black Ops Cold War, Vanguard, the modern-day Modern Warfare Remakes, and new Black Ops games. The former Call of Duty director believes the quality of the games has diminished in recent years.</p>



<h2 id="h-glen-schofield-slams-current-call-of-duty-era">Glen Schofield Slams Current Call of Duty Era </h2>



<figure><figcaption>He masterminded Dead Space and several important CoD titles. Credit to Glen Schofield Official Instagram</figcaption></figure>



<p>“As a matter of fact, Modern Warfare 3 (his CoD directorial debut) was the last Call of Duty to win Action Game of the Year, and my other two games were nominated for it. But now, you know, you don’t see them.” Schofield said to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/interview-glen-schofields-plan-to-save-the-games-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>.</p>



<p>He was asked about the ‘Call of Duty machine’, and it operates now. The franchise continues to make ridiculous sums of money, but there’s constant criticism about the direction of games, their content, and many other issues.</p>



<p>The former director thinks that it hasn’t been the same since he left Sledgehammer and stopped having creative and directorial input into Call of Duty.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ll give you one selfish example, I hate doing this, but since I left&nbsp;Sledgehammer, none of the games have been very good. I mean, the last one [Modern Warfare 3 (2023)] was a 50. They still sell well. They just aren’t as good. They aren’t the same.&nbsp;Treyarch’s still really good but you know…I&nbsp;got lucky. I feel like I was at the heyday of EA during my time there. I mean, it was a who’s who working there. And then when I got to Activision, I made Modern Warfare 3 (2011).”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Schofield is currently enjoying a break after leaving Striking Distance Studios, following the unsuccessful launch of The Callisto Protocol.</p>



<p>Do you agree that Call of Duty games haven’t gotten near the level of 2011’s Modern Warfare 3? Can CoD ever get back to these glorious heights?

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A has plenty to discover and enjoy in Lumiose City, and there are special rewards available through the game’s Mystery Gift feature with specific codes.</p>



<p>With the return of Mega Evolution starring in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, bringing the likes of Mega Charizard and Mega Gyarados back into the fray alongside new Pokémon, any additional bonuses you can get your hands on can make a big difference in your pursuit of success.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt to make sure you don’t miss out on any Mystery Gift codes in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Grab it early. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A does not have any specific redeemable codes right now, but there are three rewards available in-game through the Mystery Gift function.</strong></p>



<p>Since the game has just launched, it’s not surprising that there are not too many rewards available right now, with the only ones available being through purchases and pre-orders. Nevertheless, they’re important goodies to claim if you are entitled to them.</p>



<p>Additional Mystery Gift codes are likely to be made available in future, just like they have been in previous Pokémon titles like Scarlet &amp; Violet. Previous rewards in those games included sandwich ingredients, cosmetic items, special event Pokémon, Pokéballs, and usable items.</p>



<p>A full list of the available rewards through Mystery Gifts in Pokémon Legends: Z-A is shown in the table below. Be sure to bookmark this page, as we’ll update any further rewards as soon as they become available.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Reward</th><th data-align="center">Redemption Code</th><th data-align="center">Expiry Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Ralts &amp; Gardevoirite</td><td data-align="center">Via Internet (None)</td><td data-align="center">Feb. 28, 2026</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">100x Poké Balls</td><td data-align="center">Unique code from Legends: Z-A Digital Version</td><td data-align="center">March 10, 2026</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">3x Fast Balls<br>3x Heavy Balls<br>3x Level Balls<br>3x Lure Balls</td><td data-align="center">Unique code from Mega Dimension DLC purchase</td><td data-align="center">March 10, 2026</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>To redeem codes and claim rewards, make sure your console is connected to the internet and you have progressed through the early parts of the story in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. We’ve got the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pre-order-bonus-redeem-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full steps in the process outlined in this guide</a>, in case you get stuck.</p>

<p>In a recent trademark filing, it was discovered that Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ Donaldson, the world’s most-watched YouTube creator and a prolific entrepreneur, is planning to open a financial institution. The filing names the endeavour as ‘MrBeast Financial’, and categorizes it as ‘downloadable software in the nature of a mobile application for banking services’.</p>



<p>The filing went on to explain that MrBeast Financial would be used to provide short-term cash advances, cryptocurrency exchange services, investment banking services, and consumer lending services.</p>



<h2 id="h-from-youtube-to-big-banking">From YouTube To Big Banking</h2>



<p>Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ Donaldson is more than ten years into his journey as a YouTuber, and in that time, he has risen to become the number one personality on the platform. He’s worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and from chocolate bars to restaurants, his entrepreneurial spirit has led him to kickstart many spin-off labels.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=99440901&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent filing</a> with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, it was discovered that Donaldson’s next foray might be into the financial world, with MrBeast Financial, a banking app, having been uncovered.</p>



<p>The MrBeast Financial platform has been described as:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Software as a service (SAAS) services featuring software for banking services, investment banking services, investment management services, providing financial advisory and providing financial consultancy services.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/mrbeast-files-trademark-for-banking-app-with-a-focus-on-crypto-3269568/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The entity would have the power to provide cash advances, issue debit cards, process electronic credit card transactions, and operate a cryptocurrency exchange, amongst other things.</p>



<p>This is all up in the air, as while the application has been submitted, it’s not a promise that such a platform <strong>will surface</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-boss-confirms-ubisoft-asked-him-to-%E2%80%98step-aside%E2%80%99.1327333/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The news broke recently that Marc-Alexis Côté, a Ubisoft veteran and strategic leader of the Assassin’s Creed series, had departed the company after more than two decades. In the reports that surfaced after Côté’s withdrawal from the firm, it was suggested that he was offered a leadership role in the newly formed Vantage Studios, but wasn’t happy with the position and stepped back.</p>



<p>In a new post on social media, Côté has set the story straight and explained that he remained business as usual until Ubisoft asked him to step down. He expressly confirmed that <strong>he did not walk away </strong>from the company he has called home for twenty years.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-truth-of-why-cote-left-ubisoft">The Truth of Why Côté Left Ubisoft</h2>



<p>In a lengthy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcalexis_the-past-24-hours-have-been-deeply-emotional-activity-7384672277055012864-87QR/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn post</a>, Marc-Alexis Côté explained why he’d departed Ubisoft after twenty years, the latter portion of which had been spent managing the strategic direction of Assassin’s Creed. In his words, it wasn’t his choice, and he did not walk away willingly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it.</p>



<div><p>The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.</p><p>Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure.<br>A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years.</p></div>



<p>But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly:</p>



<p>I did not walk away.</p>



<p>I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It mostly gels with what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/head-of-assassins-creed-has-left-ubisoft-after-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original report</a> referenced, in that Côté left the company because of a situation related to the new Vantage Studios, formed after the merger between Ubisoft and Tencent.</p>



<p>Côté’s statement indicates his expectations were that he would <strong>lead </strong>the direction of the Assassin’s Creed franchise at Ubisoft, but that wasn’t the case. When that didn’t come through, Côté took it very personally and turned down whatever else was offered as a compromise, ultimately being asked to step down by Ubisoft because he (most likely) had no home in the new organization.</p>



<p>Côté wrapped up his post by saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As someone who grew up inspired by Star Trek (TNG!), in the later years of my career I came to see myself as the captain of the Assassin’s Creed ship, someone who leaves only once every soul on board is safe.</p>



<p>And that is exactly what I have done for as long as I could.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Were you surprised to see Côté leave Ubisoft, or are you expecting these kinds of departures as the merger continues to take shape? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
