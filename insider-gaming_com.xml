<p>The head of Sonic Team has commented on potentially adding “deep-cut” Sonic characters to the game’s roster in future Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds DLC.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was released in 2025 to critical acclaim. As part of the game’s hook, several crossover characters from other universes were added to the roster and the possibilities. These characters include SpongeBob, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Minecraft characters, and more.</p>



<p>However, there is a catalog of Sonic characters lost to time that could also have their moment in the new racing game.</p>







<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-should-represent-all-eras-of-sonic">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Should Represent All Eras of Sonic</h2>



<p>Takashi Iizuka was recently interviewed by <a href="https://mcvuk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MCV Magazine </a>(<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonic-boss-says-hes-open-to-adding-deep-cut-sonic-characters-as-crossworlds-dlc/">h/t: Video Games Chronicle</a>). In the interview, he was asked about seeing deeper cuts from Sonic lore coming to the game as possible downloadable content, specifically characters from the ’90s animated TV series or the IDW comics.</p>



<p>Takashi Iizuka noted that he sees the passion around the extended universe and wants all eras of Sonic represented, so anything’s possible with the opportunity feels right.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a lot of passion around the extended Sonic universe, and we’re open to including the ‘deep cut’ characters if the opportunity feels right,” Iizuka replied. “We want Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds to represent all eras of Sonic.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While this doesn’t confirm the return of fan-favorite characters like Sally Acorn, it does leave the door open for that level of surprising additions in the future.</p>







<p>Speaking of Sonic’s deep history, the franchise is currently celebrating its 35th anniversary. As part of that celebration, a new audio drama is coming to podcast platforms based around the Chaotix.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kota Furushima, the game director of Beast of Reincarnation, has commented on Game Freak’s history of criticism for how its 3D open-world games look and run.</p>



<p>Game Freak is best known for its work on the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon, while a beloved IP, does not feature 3D games that fully maximize hardware potential in 2026. Sometimes, recent Pokémon games have struggled to function properly. However, Beast of Reincarnation, the new game from Game Freak, looks to be a game on par with most.</p>







<h2 id="h-game-freak-prioritizes-creating-experiences">Game Freak Prioritizes Creating Experiences</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Kota Furushima addressed these criticisms. He noted that, overall, they’re always striving to create a unique experience rather than hyper-fixating on reaching a certain quality Benchmark.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, he spoke about the game being centered on natural environments and very rooted in Japanese inspiration. He also noted that the video game’s score was rooted in themes of loneliness and isolation, while also emphasizing the importance of learning to rely on others.</p>







<p>Beast of Reincarnation is slated to release this summer.

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero will be receiving some new DLC in the near future.</p>



<p>The Dragon Ball team has announced that the latest console game in the Dragon Ball franchise, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, will receive a major DLC release this summer. The DLC was released as part of the franchise’s 40th anniversary celebration. As part of the celebration, a trailer revealed that Super Android 17 would be coming to the game. </p>



<p>As well as the ‘Great Demon King’ Piccolo, the villainous version of Piccolo from the original Dragon Ball series. Super Saiyan Bardock is also on his way to the franchise. More names are also planned to join the lineup.</p>



<p>Additionally, there will be new cosmetics and other skill customizations. The trailer also teases a new single-player game mode. More is expected to be announced in the coming months.</p>

<h2 id="h-there-s-also-a-new-dragon-ball-game-coming-in-2027">There’s Also A New Dragon Ball Game Coming in 2027</h2>



<p>Additionally, the celebration revealed that a new game project is in the works. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/">Known as “Age 1000,</a>” it was accompanied by a brief trailer. Work on Age 1000 began more than 5 years ago, and Akira Toriyama, the franchise’s creator, worked on the game’s world-building and even on some brand-new characters. Great news for longtime fans of the series who thought that Toriyama’s passing in 2024 might have meant that the last of his work had already been seen.</p>







<p>More information about the forthcoming game will be revealed during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in April.</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is currently available for purchase on all Xbox consoles, PlayStation 5, Steam, and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>The game currently has a mixed reaction on Metacritic with a 70 Metascore. The user rating is a little more unforgiving, currently at 4.8.

<p>The latest trailer for the Super Mario Galaxy movie reveals a couple of fan-favorite characters. Also, it shows that the upcoming film has taken more inspiration from recent Mario games than was once believed.</p>



<p>In a special Nintendo Direct specifically for the Super Mario Galaxy movie, Shigeru Miyamoto revealed the latest trailer for the upcoming film. The trailer begins with Mario and Luigi traveling through the Sand Kingdom from Super Mario Odyssey. They run into several Tostarenans who are excited to see the plumbers. </p>



<p>They point them toward the disturbances they’ve been experiencing. This leads to a dark cavern, requiring Mario and Luigi to use a fire flower, and when they reach the center warp pipe, Yoshi is revealed. At first, they are just as afraid of Yoshi as he is of them, but they quickly realize that they have found a new companion in everyone’s favorite green dinosaur.</p>



<p>Yoshi was previously teased in the end credits scene following the Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023.</p>

<h2 id="h-yoshi-is-not-the-only-character-revealed-in-this-new-trailer">Yoshi Is Not the Only Character Revealed in This New Trailer</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In addition to Yoshi, there was a brief fight scene featuring Princess Peach and Birdo, paying homage to the fact that Birdo was a boss battle in the second Super Mario Bros game. In the trailer, Birdo was shooting eggs at Princess Peach with great ferocity. There was also a brief moment of Luigi wearing a frog suit. Lakitu was also briefly shown.</p>



<p>Keegan-Michael Key’s Toad also returns, and he is initially annoyed at the fact that Yoshi immediately joins the group. The whole gang is later seen running away from the realistic dinosaur featured in Super Mario Odyssey. During the scene, it was revealed that Mario and Luigi were in their baby forms and were being carried by Toad.</p>







<p>Chris Meledandri from Illumination also appeared at the end of the presentation to say that the movie was currently in post-production and had finished animation. The movie will be released in theaters on April 1.</p>
