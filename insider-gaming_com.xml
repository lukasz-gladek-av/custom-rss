<p>The first game in the next season of Supermassive Games’ Dark Pictures anthology is now available for pre-order.</p>



<p>As revealed in a new trailer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/directive-8020/" id="90789">Directive 8020</a> will release on May 12, and players can now pre-order it for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles. The game was originally scheduled for early October 2025; however, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/supermassive-games/" id="1159">Supermassive </a>announced layoffs in July 2025, which pushed the release to 2026.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-directive-8020">What to Expect From Directive 8020</h2>



<p>Directive 8020 is a Sci-Fi survival horror game where the Earth is dying, and a crew travels to a new planet that can hopefully be the next home for Humanity. However, the planet is home to an alien organism that can take the form of any crew member, setting the stage for a tense experience.</p>



<p>Lashana Lynch, known for her work in The Woman King, stars in the title, where choices matter and will affect the outcome of the main campaign.</p>



<p>This is the first non-VR Dark Pictures Anthology game since 2022’s The Devil in Me. The games were originally released annually, but the team ultimately decided they didn’t want to be tied to such a demanding schedule.</p>



<p>“We don’t want to be tied down to a game every six months or one every year or anything like that. This game’s big, and we want it to be treated as such,” Will Doyle, creative director of Directive 8020, told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/directive-8020-is-a-notable-upgrade-to-the-dark-pictures-anthologys-formula" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer </a>back in 2024 about the upcoming title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You’re midway through the week, and I hope I’ve helped you figure out the NYT Connections answers more than once! This Wednesday, you’ve got a doozy of a challenge to solve, but guess what? I’m here, as always, with the NYT Connections hints you need to either get one step closer to or ultimately <strong>solve </strong>today’s puzzle.</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections hints and answers you need!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>
