            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 has revealed three new cast members at Comic-Con, with two directly related to the series.</p>



<p>A sequel to the original 2023 film adaptation, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 plans to up the stakes and deliver some quality scares. The story will seemingly see the animatronics of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria unleashed to the public. New to the film are the Toy animatronics from the video game’s sequel. Now, confirmed at Comic-Con, we have a fresh new look at them, alongside who will be voicing them.</p>



<h2 id="h-megan-fox-matpat-cast-as-toy-animatronics-in-five-nights-at-freddy-s-2">Megan Fox, MatPat Cast as Toy Animatronics in Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>During a panel for Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 at New York Comic-Con, it was announced that the Toy animatronics will have some well-known actors attached to them. As Toy Freddy, the role will be played by VA Kellen Goff, who voices Glamrock Freddy in Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach. For the role of Toy Bonnie, MatPat, former host of Game Theory and FNAF icon, will voice the robotic bunny. Finally, and perhaps the most out-there, Transformers actress <a href="https://x.com/FNAFMovie/status/1976815880626679994?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Megan Fox</a> will voice Toy Chica.</p>



<p>Megan Fox’s addition to Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is an interesting one, though not too far-fetched. Previously, the Jennifer’s Body actress voiced Nitara in Mortal Kombat 1. She has stated to be a fan of games, so being in FNAF is a no-brainer. MatPat (Matthew Patrick), interestingly enough, already cameoed as a waiter in 2023’s Five Nights at Freddy’s film. Still, given his contributions to the fandom, it’s a great role for him, especially considering his acting background. </p>



<p>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is set to hit theaters on December 5th, 2025. A new poster, showing off the Toy characters, is <a href="https://x.com/FNAFMovie/status/1976814091596619866?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">above</a>. If the film is anything like the original, fans are in for one fun ride.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FBC: Firebreak still isn’t having the success Remedy was hoping for, despite the massive new update, the studio confirms.</p>



<p>As Remedy Entertainment’s debut with multiplayer, FBC: Firebreak released earlier this year to not-so-shining reviews. Set in the Control universe, the title was met with many complaints for its opening and lack of substance. Last month, a new update, called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breakpoint</a>, aimed to fix those issues and add more content like new Crises and weapons. While it seemed like it would do the trick, Remedy has confirmed that it has not done that just yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-fbc-firebreak-did-not-meet-internal-targets-at-remedy-studio-confirms">FBC: Firebreak Did Not Meet Internal Targets at Remedy, Studio Confirms</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Remedy</figcaption></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an investor’s post</a> on the company’s website, Remedy Entertainment confirms that, despite the overhaul, FBC: Firebreak has not met internal targets for sales. The news comes before the studio’s actual investors’ reports, set for October 29th. In a statement from CEO Tero Virtala, he states,</p>



<p>“Remedy is recognizing a non-cash impairment of capitalized development costs and allocated purchased publishing and distribution rights related to&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>,” says Virtala. “While we balance future investments to the title, we continue developing and improving the game in line with our updated long-term sales forecast.”</p>



<p>The aforementioned non-cash impairment is up to 14.9 million EUR, with a majority of it representing the game’s development costs and publishing and distribution rights. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-launch-deemed-unsatisfying-and-underperformed-major-update-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disastrous launch</a> of FBC: Firebreak is one the studio wasn’t expecting and perhaps had too much faith in. Curiously, it seems Remedy wants to continue working on the title despite its continued failure. The company is known for crafting some amazing experiences like Control and Alan Wake, so it is possible. However, it may not be worth it for FBC: Firebreak, which currently has players in the double-digits.</p>



<p>What do you think about FBC: Firebreak’s failure for Remedy? Did you play the title at launch? Return to it after the Breakpoint update? Did you enjoy the game? Let us know in the comments, forums, and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/gufNW2YhJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Breached by Notorious Hacker Group, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-breached-by-hacker-group-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-breached-by-notorious-hacker-group-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1322659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent hours, it has been claimed that Nintendo has been ‘breached’ by Crimson Collective, a notorious hacker group that most recently claimed responsibility for an attack on Red Hat,  breaching the prolific technology firm and stealing 570 GB of data. The group has been tracked for the last couple of months, and it has now been claimed that they’ve breached <strong>Nintendo</strong>.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, a screenshot uploaded by Crimson Collective seems to show a repository of Nintendo folders, but the legitimacy of the breach is yet to be addressed.</p>



<h2 id="h-has-nintendo-been-hacked">Has Nintendo Been Hacked?</h2>



<p>On social media, an image has surfaced, allegedly coming from the Crimson Collective hacker group, that shows a library of Nintendo folders. At face value, these folders contain information regarding new games, development assets, production admin files, and backups.</p>



<p>It was mentioned by <a href="https://xcancel.com/H4ckmanac/status/1976895206273220758#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hackmanac</a> on socials that hackrisk.io has been tracking the purported breach, and in a comment accompanying the screenshot, Crimson Collective wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Who said we did not have Nintendo topics files?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nintendo has suffered from several key breaches historically, including a massive leak that circulated between 2018 and 2020 and saw source codes for classic games emerge online. In 2020, a Nintendo Network ID breach occurred, impacting more than 300,000 user accounts.</p>



<p>We’ve reached out to Nintendo for comment, but at present, it’s worth taking this with a pinch of salt. We’ll know soon if this is a legitimate breach. If it is, fans are now concerned that a mass wave of Nintendo’s unannounced projects could be cast into the open without warning.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you think about this news.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gone-hunting-codes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gone-hunting-codes-october-2025.1322647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gone Hunting is, as the name suggests, a game that revolves around the subtle art of hunting in the wild. Players need to use traps, rifles, and other such tools to hunt down a variety of different animals. An experienced hunter will tell you that the most underrated quality in a good hunter is patience, and this game requires players to have plenty of that. Hunting isn’t as easy as just picking up a gun and shooting at the first animal you see; it’s a far more methodical process that can go wrong if one bad step is made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players have to use items like tranquilizer guns, traps, and fishing rods to hunt down their prey. Fishing is another major gameplay element of Gone Hunting. What sets Gone Hunting apart from the competition is the fact that you don’t merely kill animals in this game, but rather, you capture animals using non-lethal weapons. These weapons can be upgraded using the in-game currency, and although you can get plenty of it by simply playing the game, one of the easiest ways to get some free money is using these Gone Hunting codes.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-new-gone-hunting-codes-october-2025">All New Gone Hunting Codes (October 2025)</h2>



<p>We currently only know of two active codes in Gone Hunting, which are listed below:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>RELEASE</strong>: 250 Coins (NEW)</li>



<li><strong>GONEHUNTING</strong>: 30 Mins of Luck Boost (NEW)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-gone-hunting-codes">Expired Gone Hunting Codes</h2>



<p>There is currently only one expired code for Gone Hunting, but sometimes its worth trying expired codes as they could become active again.</p>



<p>The expired code is:</p>



<ul>
<li>BIGPLANS</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-gone-hunting-codes">How to Redeem Gone Hunting Codes</h2>



<p>If you’re ready to hunt down some animals, using these Gone Hunting codes can be a good way to give yourself a head start. Redeeming codes in Gone Hunting is a simple and rather straightforward process. Players aren’t forced to follow any social media accounts or to join the Roblox game group. Instead, all players have to do is navigate through the menus of the game and simply input one of the active codes given above. For newer players who may be unfamiliar with the menus, here’s a step-by-step guide to redeeming Gone Hunting codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Gone Hunting</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Shop’ icon at the top&nbsp;</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Codes’ button</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the provided text box</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Redeem’ button to instantly receive your rewards</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-gone-hunting-codes">How to get more Gone Hunting Codes</h2>



<p>Although there are only two active Gone Hunting codes right now, players can rest assured, as given the current popularity of the game, new codes are surely in the works. While following the game’s socials and Discord server is one way to get the codes, manually scrolling through all the posts to find the codes you’re looking for can be quite a hassle. Instead, players are urged to <strong>keep this page bookmarked</strong>, as we update it as soon as any new Gone Hunting codes drop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ever dreamt about running your own store that sells premium makeup and skincare products? If yes, then this is going to be an unforgettable experience for you. The main point of Makeup Store Simulator is to make the most amount of money possible every day, all while keeping customers happy and the stock in check. Makeup Store Simulator throws you into the deep end in terms of the makeup business, in that you have to buy and sell high-end makeup products at a profit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you try to sell at too low a price, you won’t make any money, whereas if you try to make a lot of money by boosting the prices, your customers will stop buying. As with most businesses, it’s a matter of acceptable margins, and Makeup Store Simulator will teach you how to walk that tightrope. One thing that all businesses need, however, is money, and you can earn some extra free cash by redeeming the following Makeup Store Simulator codes.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-new-makeup-store-simulator-codes-october-2025">All New Makeup Store Simulator Codes (October 2025)</h2>

<h2 id="h-expired-makeup-store-simulator-codes">Expired Makeup Store Simulator Codes</h2>



<p>The following codes are currently expired for Makeup Store Simulator:</p>



<ul>
<li>LIPSTICK2025&nbsp;</li>



<li>MakeUp&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Although there are only two expired codes in the game currently, more will likely be added to this list as new Makeup Store Simulator codes drop. With just one active code in the game at this moment, the likelihood of new codes being released by the developers in the near future is quite high. Although there’s no defined date for when new codes might be released, considering how popular the game has become, the release of new Makeup Store Simulator codes is a likely eventuality at this point.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-makeup-store-simulator-codes-nbsp">How To Redeem Makeup Store Simulator Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Unlike in real life, free cash in this game is extremely easy to get, thanks to the Makeup Store Simulator codes. All players have to do is redeem active codes to get their rewards, but sometimes, that’s easier said than done. Some games force players to complete additional steps before they’re allowed to redeem codes, such as following the game’s socials or joining their Discord server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Makeup Store Simulator, however, hasn’t imposed any such criteria on its players. All you have to do to receive this free cash is navigate to the codes option in the game and input one of the active codes given above. Here’s a step-by-step guide to redeeming your Makeup Store Simulator Codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Makeup Store Simulator</li>



<li>Hit the ‘Z’ button on your keyboard to bring up your mobile phone</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Codes’ button to open the text box</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box</li>



<li>Hit the ‘enter’ key on your keyboard to receive your rewards</li>
