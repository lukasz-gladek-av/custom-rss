<p>How has your week started? I hope it has kicked off with another couple of wins in your NYT Connections pot. If not, you’re in the right place, as I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions you need to smash today’s challenge.</p>



<p>Scroll down to check out the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, and to unlock a few tips to help you figure it out for yourself as quickly as possible!</p>











<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

<p>Interested players can get a feel for The Witcher 4 early through the new Dawn over Korvir mod for The Witcher 3. </p>



<p>The Witcher 4 has a long way to go, with the latest reports revealing that the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not release in 2026</a> and that the new trilogy will stick to the 6-year plan. From what we know about the next title, Ciri is going to be taking centre stage, and now players can get an early glimpse of what it could be like through the latest mod. </p>







<h2 id="h-witcher-4-can-be-experienced-early-through-new-witcher-3-mod">Witcher 4 Can be Experienced Early Through New Witcher 3 Mod</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/ciri-story-mod-dawn-over-kovir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, the new Witcher 3 mod, called Dawn over Korvir, was recently uploaded to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11831?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus Mods</a>. The mod itself adds a new questline that players can take on as Ciri. What’s more, it takes place in a brand new region called the Kingdom of Kovir, which was inspired by the cinematic reveal trailer for The Witcher 4. </p>



<p>The mod took 800 hours to develop and provides players with 45 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes of content. There are some requirements to download this mod, including that players have already downloaded the Blood and Wine and Hearts of Stone DLC. Also, you will need Custom Player Characters and Community Patch -Shared Imports mods downloaded. </p>



<p><strong>Here’s the description for The Witcher 4-inspired mod:</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Fight. Make moral choices. Accept the consequences.</em></p>



<p><em>While hunting monsters, Ciri increasingly finds them not in the forests, but in people. Disillusioned with humanity, she balances between compassion and rage. Will the witcheress be able to master her anger and avoid becoming a monster herself?</em></p>
</blockquote>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty Hit by WARDOGS Comment: ‘No Nikki Minaj Skins’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bulkhead-wardogs-call-of-duty-comment-nikki-minaj/</link>
            <guid>1429906</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last week, Bulkhead revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wardogs/" id="3558">WARDOGS</a>, a developing first-person tactical shooter with an impressive amount of ambition. It has been in development for several years and shone brightly in the game’s first trailer, which offered a tasty lay of the land for what’s set to come.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the team at Bulkhead was explaining how many aspects of WARDOGS will work, including monetization. In a thinly-veiled stab at Call of Duty, they stressed that there will be ‘No Nikki Minaj skins. No bullshit.’</p>







<h2 id="h-wardogs-is-all-about-realism">WARDOGS is All About Realism</h2>



<p>WARDOGS is bursting with potential and has already garnered a sizeable following since dropping its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wardogs-reveal-trailer-100-player-tactical-warfare/">inaugural trailer last week</a>. It’s a large-scale, wide conflict game with destruction elements, vehicles, a unique economy model, and above all else, <strong>realism</strong> running deep in its veins.</p>



<p>That’s why the team recently addressed the game’s monetization model and said that there won’t be any battle pass features or ‘Nikki Minaj skins’.</p>



<p>This is a reference to Call of Duty, which has spent the last few years promoting inane crossover cosmetics packs that have featured the likes of Nikki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, Family Guy, Beavis and Butthead, and Squid Game, to name a few. It has long since diluted the Call of Duty name and made it feel like something closer to Fortnite.</p>



<p>Here’s the full post from the team at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bulkhead/" id="3559">Bulkhead</a>, WARDOGS’ developer:</p>

No Bullshit.</p><p>Earn cosmetics by playing.</p><p>WARDOGS is an immersive, Tactical All Out Warfare FPS that doesn't forget it's a game… <a href="https://t.co/Yp3d280XxQ">pic.twitter.com/Yp3d280XxQ</a></p></div>— WARDOGS (@WARDOGS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WARDOGS/status/2020591501785678082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>WARDOGS doesn’t have a release date yet, nor does it have a testing window arranged, but prospective fans are being invited to sign up to receive updates on that front as soon as they’re available.</p>



<p>In WARDOGS, players start a match with $10,000 in their pocket, and as they play, they earn more money. That money is then spent on weapons, vehicles, upgrades, and other items designed to turn the tide of battle. It’s a large-scale concept that can be scaled right down to the individual player, of which there are 100 in every match.</p>
