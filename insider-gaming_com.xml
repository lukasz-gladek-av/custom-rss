<p>Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund is already one of the wealthiest and most influential financial forces on the planet, and rumours of its interest in acquiring a major stake in Electronic Arts have been circulating for months. Now, newly surfaced information has clarified just how substantial that takeover may be.</p>



<p>For those who haven’t followed the developments, this move forms part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/could-saudi-arabia-pif-want-larger-ownership-in-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saudi Arabia’s broader push</a> to grow its global footprint through high-profile investments. The PIF has poured billions into sport, gaming, entertainment, and media over recent years—and EA now appears to be the next major name in its sights.</p>







<h2 id="h-pif-will-own-over-93-of-ea">PIF Will Own Over 93% of EA</h2>



<figure><figcaption>EA could soon be under their control. Credit to Game Developer</figcaption></figure>



<p>As was reported by <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/saudi-arabias-pif-will-own-over-93-of-ea-if-deal-goes-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Gaming Zone</a> (through a paywalled Wall Street Journal report), the Saudi PIF will acquire a massive 93.4% of EA if the deal is finalized. The remaining shares will be split between Silver Lake (5.5%) and Affinity (1.1%), making PIF the overwhelming majority owner by a huge margin.</p>



<p>The WSJ also states that the fund will need to contribute roughly $29 billion to complete the takeover—a staggering figure even by modern gaming industry standards. </p>







<p>Despite PIF’s dominant control, filing reports suggest EA will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-it-will-keep-creative-control-if-saudi-arabia-sale-goes-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retain full creative independence</a>. In theory, EA and its various teams will continue operating without interference in development decisions, future titles, or internal strategy.</p>



<p>Whether that promise holds true in the long term remains to be seen. Ownership changes of this scale often reshape companies in ways that aren’t immediately obvious. For now, all eyes will be on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-employees-publicly-oppose-sale-saudi-arabia-equity-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how EA navigates the transition</a>—and what influence, if any, its new majority owner will ultimately exert.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-ps5-review-even-better/</link>
            <guid>1371718</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl was released on PlayStation 5 on November 20, 2025, a full year after it dropped on Xbox and PC platforms. It arrives on PlayStation 5 along with all the upgrades and enhancements that have been applied over the last twelve months, which means players flying the blue banner are getting a ‘better product’ than when the game first launched in 2024.</p>



<p>I’ve been toying with STALKER 2 since it dropped on PlayStation 5, getting to grips all over again with one of my top games of 2024. In my first STALKER 2 review, I said, ‘I cannot dredge up a single reason why you shouldn’t invest in STALKER 2,’ but is that still true after a year of evolution and the game launching on a new platform?</p>



<p>To find out, read on and explore my full STALKER 2 PS5 review.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-stalker-2-worth-it-on-ps5">Is STALKER 2 Worth It On PS5?</h2>



<p>STALKER 2 had a fair few issues when it was released in 2024. It needed some serious upkeep, and in the weeks that followed the launch, GSC Game World applied many fixes and patches to address the game’s biggest concerns. It stabilized, and hundreds of thousands of people poured into the game over the next year or so.</p>



<p>Today, STALKER 2 isn’t too much of a different beast, but enough has been done for it to finally feel much more polished. The game’s unique elements, like the ‘A-Life’ AI engine that was promised ahead of launch, still aren’t where they should be, but it’s a sight better than it was when it dropped on Xbox and PC in November 2024.</p>



<p>If you’re unfamiliar, STALKER 2 throws players into a harrowing, harsh post-apocalyptic environment called The Zone. It’s worth stressing that the rest of the world is mostly fine, it’s just The Zone that’s post-apocalyptic. This irradiated, mutant-infested space surrounds Chornobyl, the ill-fated nuclear power plant found in Ukraine.</p>



<p>In STALKER 2, players must contend with the threats of The Zone, both human-based and mutated, to uncover shocking revelations, align with or dispute against factions, and resolve the protagonist’s story and reason for being there in the first place.</p>



<p>It’s a pretty challenging game, and at times, it has been compared to the likes of Escape from Tarkov and Fallout, which is mostly accurate. Imagine if Fallout were set in Russia and you’re basically there.</p>



<p>STALKER 2 represents hours of gaming wrapped up in an attractive package. There’s a solid story there that takes players across a massive, mixed map, presenting them with plenty of weapons, outfits, and equipment items to get to grips with.</p>



<p>It’s <strong>worth </strong>the investment to secure a copy on PlayStation 5, but let’s go a little deeper.</p>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-is-better-than-ever">STALKER 2 is Better Than Ever</h2>



<figure><figcaption>‘Gorgeous’ isn’t the word</figcaption></figure>







<p>I’ve already sunk many hours into STALKER 2 on PlayStation 5, and I can attest to it being better than ever. My first review in 2024 was glowing, but the PS5 release takes things to the next level. It’s a marvel of a thing to come back to a game an entire year later and be presented with almost a different version, and the comparisons are pretty easily made.</p>



<p>The overall optimization of STALKER 2 has been improved; it runs better and smoothly, and there are fewer bugs throughout. New quests, UI elements, customization options, and details have been added over the last year, and some nice-to-have features like an ‘immersive mode’ are now present.</p>



<p>Even on the PS5 Slim, not even a PS5 Pro, the game looks phenomenal. The vistas in this game are something special to behold, and the weather effects, physics, and sound engine are all on point. This game has one of the best dynamic weather engines I’ve ever seen in a game, and it lacks much of a backing soundtrack, so the ambience immerses you to the max when you’re walking around The Zone.</p>



<p>The game’s difficulty balancing can be a little skewed at times, but it’s plenty forgiving if you play on a lower difficulty.</p>



<p>My favorite thing in STALKER 2 has to be the combat. Whether you’re fighting the game’s more fearsome mutants or the many human enemies that roam The Zone, you’re in for a treat. Combat is versatile and pretty dynamic, and everything from stealth to all-out guns blazing feels viable.</p>



<p>Talking about roaming The Zone, you’ll also have a great time digging through all the nooks and crannies of this game. It’s packed with secrets, collectables, side missions, and ad-hoc objectives that pop up as you probe the wider map. The world-building is phenomenal, and the atmosphere created in some environments is to die for… Literally.</p>



<p>We should also be getting some kind of expansion in the future, too, so if you get it, you’ll have more to look forward to down the line. GSC Game World is not finished with STALKER 2 by any means.</p>







<h2 id="h-verdict-4-great">Verdict: 4 – Great</h2>



<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl represents many hours of entertaining (if a little morbid at times) gameplay for anyone fond of the post-apocalyptic settings found in the likes of Fallout and Metro. It’s a stunning game that might present some issues at times, but GSC Game World has worked hard to optimise it over the last year or so.</p>



<p>It remains one of my favorite games in the genre, and I’d take a third playthrough in a shot, especially if GSC ever implements a more major update or some kind of expansion.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[BACKBONE ONE Review—Small But Mighty for Mobile Gamers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/backbone-one-review-mobile-gaming/</link>
            <guid>1371655</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I’ve never been a huge mobile gamer, but I can fully appreciate that it makes up a <strong>massive </strong>portion of our industry. In recent years, mobile games have become increasingly intelligent, and AAA titles are finding their way onto mobile devices both natively and via cloud streaming services.</p>



<p>It stands to reason that, if you want to enjoy mobile gaming as much as possible, you’ll want a solid controller with which to do so. That’s where the BACKBONE ONE comes in, an innovative, handy, and powerful little device that holds your phone and provides a solid base on which to build a strong mobile gaming experience.</p>



<p>I’ve been trialling the BACKBONE ONE for a couple of weeks and have been nothing but impressed. Here’s my full BACKBONE ONE review.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-backbone-one-worth-99-99">Is The BACKBONE ONE Worth $99.99?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing this BACKBONE ONE review, the device was selling for $99.99. I’d picked up the ultra-limited Death Stranding 2 edition, which came in a fabulous themed box and boasted a unique shell that’s to die for, but the standard is much more accessible and easier to find online.</p>



<p>As I write this, the <a href="https://backbone.com/pages/death-stranding-2-le">Death Stranding 2 edition</a> is fully sold out, but BACKBONE has teased that another wave might arrive soon. If you’re a fan, you’ll want to secure one of these, as it’s a gorgeous item to have in your collection, even if you don’t actively play mobile games.</p>



<figure><figcaption>My BACKBONE ONE Death Stranding 2 Edition is a beautiful thing.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Now, to the BACKBONE ONE review.</p>



<p>The BACKBONE ONE is a relatively simple thing that works right out of the box with almost no setup required. You simply pull it apart, insert your mobile device, and snap it closed again. It has a USB-C connection (or a Lightning connection) built into the device, which means it works with almost all modern devices.</p>



<p>If you’re in the market and looking to make known your allegiances, you’ll be happy to know you can purchase the BACKBONE ONE in both an Xbox or PlayStation-based theme.</p>



<p>It basically takes your phone and turns it into a cheap, portable gaming device, which, when paired with something like Game Pass, becomes a formidable thing. It’s small but mighty, and while the inputs and the overall form factor are pretty tiny compared to something like an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, it’s perfect for gaming on the go.</p>



<p>In recent years, BACKBONE has evolved this device, and now, there’s a handy app, more responsive inputs, magnetic adapters that ensure a better fit for a wider range of devices, and more tactile buttons. There’s even a nice 3.5mm headset jack on the side if you want to game on a train or while sitting in an Uber.</p>



<p>It really is that simple.</p>



<p>I’d say it’s worth $99.99, without a doubt. If you want to game while travelling and don’t want to splash out almost $1,000 on a top-tier handled gaming device, this is where you’ll want to get involved. It weighs almost nothing, shrinks down into the tiniest space in your backpack (or even a pocket), and it looks nice.</p>



<p>It’s also durable, which I’ve tested by aggressively pulling it open and shut again and dropping it a few times. There’s very little in the way of working parts inside the BACKBONE ONE, so you don’t have to worry about it being devastated by a slip of the hand. Just try to make sure your phone isn’t in it when you do drop it, because that’s not guaranteed to be protected.</p>



<p>If there’s one thing I can complain about, it’s that my ‘armoured’ phone protector couldn’t fit properly in the BACKBONE ONE as the charging port was a bit obscured, but that’s a ‘me’ problem.</p>



<p>I’d recommend the BACKBONE ONE if you want to game on the go on the cheap; it’s that simple.</p>
