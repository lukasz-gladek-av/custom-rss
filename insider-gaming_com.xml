<p>The Finals was released in December 2023, shadowdropped to an audience that was all too eager to receive it, and for a while, it turned heads. It wasn’t long before the free-to-play, live-service shooter dwindled a little, but it remains relatively innovative and fresh, boasting solid destructive mechanics, an entertaining gameplay loop, and a unique aesthetic.</p>



<p>Recently, Embark Studios revealed that an esports scene is on the way and that in 2025, a $100,000 Major will take place. That’s all the information the company parted ways with, but right now, <strong>not</strong> <strong>one organisation </strong>has invested in The Finals, which leaves us wondering who’s going to compete.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-who-will-play-at-the-finals-major">Who Will Play At The Finals Major?</h2>



<p>The Finals Major 2025 is a $100,000 tournament with an undetermined format, structure, and schedule. Nobody knows what it’ll look like, where it’ll be played, or which organisations will field a squad.</p>



<p>The Finals has been around for an entire year, and in that time, it has retained a decent core following.</p>



<p>If we use Steam as a representative example, we can see that the game peaked at 242,000 players when it came out, and right now, it floats around an average of about 14,000 – which <strong>isn’t bad</strong>. It’s a brand-new shooter that had absolutely no following when it dropped, so for it to still be securing those numbers on <strong>one platform </strong>is great.</p>



<p>On social media, Embark Studios posted a short teaser trailer promoting the impending $100,000 Major, but it could be several months before it takes shape.</p>

<p>On social media, claims have surfaced suggesting that Huke is stepping in to replace Pred in OpTic Texas’ starting roster.</p>



<p>Presently, there isn’t much information accompanying the rumoured move, and it’s yet to be confirmed by OpTic Texas, but several sources close to the change have corroborated it on socials.</p>



<p>It’s expected that the change will be temporary as Pred is reported to be ‘dealing with something’ out of the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes">Changes</h2>



<p>In a claim leaked first on Twitter by <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1866933336565846433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostofHope</a>, it was suggested that Cuyler ‘Huke’ Garland will be slotting into the OpTic Texas starting roster in replacement of Amer ‘Pred’ Zulbeari.</p>



<p>This was then followed up <a href="https://x.com/TheFlank/status/1866943980723966192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by The Flank</a>, which posted on socials that Pred could be dealing with ‘out-of-game’ issues’. That’s also unconfirmed at present, but Seth ‘Scump’ Abner, who has been aligned with OpTic for many years and is one of the game’s most prominent legends, said Pred’s switch is down to personal reasons.</p>



<p>The flip would see Huke return to the OpTic Texas roster after a hiatus lasting a year and a half. In June 2023, the former Call of Duty world champion departed OpTic Texas and shortly after, was picked up by Seattle Surge (now Vancouver Surge).</p>



<p>Whatever the reason may be, it looks as though Huke could be filling in for Pred when OpTic Texas meets Vancouver Surge this Saturday, which is a bizarre turn of events for the pro player.</p>



<p>I’ve reached out to OpTic’s representatives for more information, if at all possible.</p>
