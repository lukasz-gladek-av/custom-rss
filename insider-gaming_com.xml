            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The stage is officially set for the penultimate stage at IEM Krakow this weekend. We’re about to see the final four teams battle for the lion’s share of the prize pool in Poland, welcoming scores of visitors to the Tauron Arena in Krakow, as many as <strong>22,000</strong>.</p>



<p>MOUZ enters the weekend riving an immense wave of momentum after totally dismantling G2, Team Vitality steps into the ring after a solid group stage, Team Spirit has batted down all comers, and FURIA has spent the last few weeks doing what FURIA does best, securing a clean high-tier finish.</p>



<p>But what are the most accurate IEM Krakow predictions looking like?</p>







<h2 id="h-which-team-will-win-at-iem-krakow">Which Team Will Win at IEM Krakow?</h2>



<p>If you’re a fan of Counter-Strike betting, you’ve almost certainly got a wager fluttering around on the outcome of IEM Krakow. If you’ve waited this long, hopefully you can get your slip in today, but if you’ve had a stake running this whole time, hopefully you’re still in play.</p>



<p>There’s a dense weekend of entertainment lined up at IEM Krakow. Here’s what the schedule looks like:</p>



<p><strong>February 7</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Team Spirit v. FURIA</li>



<li>Team Vitality v. MOUZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>February 8</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>TBC v. TBC (third-place match)</li>



<li>TBC v. TBC (grand final)</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s a whopping $400,000 prize on the line for the first-place team in Krakow, but at this point, every organization walks away with a sizeable chunk of cash in their pocket.</p>



<p>The four teams left represent a real test. MOUZ has come into the semifinals with some stellar momentum after tearing through G2, but the team has to contend with Vitality, an inherently challenging prospect. In 2025, Vitality scooped <strong>nine </strong>trophies across the Counter-Strike space, and it’s going to be a tough hill for MOUZ to climb.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you’ve got FURIA v. Team Spirit, and that promises a different kind of battle. FURIA just wiped Aurora from the running with a monstrous performance (shout out KSCERATO), but Team Spirit has shown a resilient streak to get this far.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that Vitality remains the statistical favorite, but MOUZ could serve up a slight underdog edge to snatch the trophy. The safe money will be on Vitality, but there are only four teams to choose from at this point, so it’s not a huge pool if you’re making a Counter-Strike wager.</p>







<p>Which team do you think has the IEM Krakow trophy in the bag? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Star Addresses Whether The TV Show is ‘Fallout 5’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-star-addresses-tv-show-fallout-5/</link>
            <guid>1428856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Fallout television series, backed by Amazon’s Prime Video, is one of the most beloved live-action adaptations ever made. It’s an award-winning show that boasts an original story fused with elements pulled straight from the post-apocalyptic game franchise, and it just wrapped its second season and is moving onto the third with immense gusto.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, one of the series’s most iconic stars addressed a fan theory. He recognizes that people are curious whether the Fallout TV show ‘is’ or perhaps is setting up for <strong>Fallout 5</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-fallout-tv-show-leading-to-fallout-5">Is The Fallout TV Show Leading to Fallout 5?</h2>



<p>We could have <strong>ten years </strong>of the Fallout TV show, including the two that we’ve already had. There’s an abundance of world-building for the showrunners to pull from, and production on the third season is already underway.</p>



<p>In December, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-todd-howard-confirmed-fallout-5-details/">made a bold statement</a> about <strong>both </strong>the future of the television show and Fallout 5, showing how they’ll intertwine:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a recent supersized interview breakdown with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/FalloutOralHistory-PartIII" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, Walton Goggins, who plays Cooper ‘The Ghoul’ Howard in the television show, echoed that sentiment, saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;In some ways, people have said, “Is it Fallout 5?” That’s way above my paygrade.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not clear what he’s referring to, but it’s <strong>most likely </strong>a nod to those who believe that the television show’s original content, which is set further in the future than anything ever created in the Fallout universe, is building up to Fallout 5’s story.</p>



<p>That original production was also addressed by Goggins:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They did their homework, and it was built into the DNA of the story that they created, and this isn’t like Fallout 1, Fallout 2, or Fallout 3… it’s its own thing. It’s original content within the Fallout world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Whatever happens, it could be at least another four or five years before we see <strong>anything </strong>to do with Fallout 5. Bethesda still needs to wrap development on Starfield’s second expansion (and whatever comes next), <strong>and </strong>deliver The Elder Scrolls 6. There’s a lengthy wait in store, but fans might be able to tide themselves over with upcoming releases like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fallout-3-remastered-out-now-shadowdrop-rumors-explained/">Fallout 3 Remastered</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bend Studio’s Cancelled Live Service Shooter Surfaces Online Again]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-cancelled-shooter-surfaces-online/</link>
            <guid>1428850</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bend Studio was forced to shut down the ongoing development of an unannounced live-service shooter last year amid restructuring and layoffs that led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-lays-off-around-30-of-staff-following-live-service-game-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30% of the company</a> disappearing. The game that was cancelled would have been a third-person, military-themed shooter, but we know little more than that about the abandoned title.</p>



<p>Recently, fresh files surfaced online from the project, taken from a former Bend Studio animator responsible for designing turrets, character gait, and some minor animations, such as throwing knives and deploying drones.</p>







<h2 id="h-mirror-pond-animations-appear-online">‘Mirror Pond’ Animations Appear Online</h2>



<p>It’s not a huge leap into uncovering Mirror Pond, which was the project name for Bend Studio’s cancelled third-person shooter, but it’s <strong>something</strong>. In the files pulled from a former animator’s portfolio, we can see a third-person perspective (which we already knew about) explored from a more technical standpoint.</p>



<p>What’s assumed to be a player character model walks across the screen, brandishing long firearms and traipsing with a traditional military movement pattern. In another clip, we see the same character throwing what looks like knives, before shooting something from a forearm-mounted device, and deploying a small drone mounted on their back.</p>



<p>There’s also a shot of a turret activating and firing at an unseen target.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>These files were uncovered by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-bend-studio-cancelled-live-service-title-mirror-pond-animations-surfaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">M</a>P1st, but no source was given.</p>



<p>It all points to Mirror Pond having been planned as a near-future third-person shooter of sorts, perhaps aligning with the bygone days of Syphon Filter. That’s one of the franchises that allowed Bend Studio to cut its teeth in the gaming world, and it featured spycraft, a third-person perspective, and techy gadgets.</p>



<p>In September 2025, Bend Studio opened up and started hiring again for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-hiring-for-a-new-multiplayer-game/">new, unannounced multiplayer title</a>. What that is remains to be seen, but it could be an attempt to recover the fragments of the cancelled live-service ‘Mirror Pond’.</p>



<p>Fans have long hoped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">a new Days Gone project</a> would surface, but as we all know, that’s very unlikely.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Isabela Merced is slated to star in a movie adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega’s </a>House of the Dead franchise.</p>



<p>It seems like video game franchises are being adapted for film and TV at a rapid pace. Not only are video game stalwarts like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog starring in brand-new movies, but more recent video games such as The Last of God and Uncharted are being adapted for TV series.</p>



<p>As first reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Isabela Merced, known for her work in the aforementioned The Last of Us TV series, will be in a leading role in a new film about the House of the Dead. Paul W.S. Anderson will write and direct the project. He previously adapted the Resident Evil franchise for the big screen over 20 years ago.</p>



<p>He also adapted the Monster Hunter series for a 2020 film, but it was not nearly as well-received as the Resident Evil movies.</p>



<p>In 2003 and 2006, two House of the Dead films were released, but they were critically panned.</p>



<h2 id="h-history-of-the-house-of-the-dead">History of the House of the Dead</h2>



<p>How’s the dead began life in 1997. It was originally a light gun arcade game. Games were regularly released up until House of the Dead 4 in 2005. An arcade release in 2018 was titled “Scarlet Dawn.”</p>



<p>There were also spin-offs, such as 1999’s The Typing of the Dead, designed to improve typing; it was later re-released for the Sega Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. 1999 also saw the arcade release of Revenge, a beat-’em-up take on the franchise.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming will keep you up to date with all the latest news regarding the House of the Dead movie.</p>

<p>Another short trailer for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/" id="3170">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a> just dropped, and Yoshi again takes center stage, taking out one of Bowser’s most well-known minions in the most Yoshi way possible.</p>



<p>The new trailer, with the tagline “Level Up,” features previously seen clips of Bowser Jr., Mario, and Luigi. However, there are also new images of Princess Peach with Toad in a cyberpunk-looking environment, and at one point, they appear to enter a bar, with several low-level enemies from Mario video games giving them a dirty look.</p>



<p>Yoshi is also shown riding a motorcycle, similar to what Mario and Luigi did in a previous trailer. He also confronts Kamek, swallows him whole, lays an egg with Kamek’s glasses on it, and then pilots the vehicle Kamek had been piloting. Princess Rosalina is also seen in a brief action shot towards the end.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-this-movie-takes-inspiration-from-several-generations-of-super-mario-video-games">This Movie Takes Inspiration From Several Generations of Super Mario Video Games</h2>



<p>This movie is named after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/super-mario-galaxy/" id="2961">Super Mario Galaxy</a> video game, which was released on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-wii/" id="1031">Nintendo Wii</a>. but takes inspiration from many Mario games that came before and after the classic game from 2007.</p>



<p>A previous trailer showcased Birdo and Mouser from Super Mario Bros. 2. Baby Mario and Baby Luigi were also on display, being carried by Yoshi as they ran away from the realistic dinosaur featured in Super Mario Odyssey.</p>



<p>There has been no sign yet of Donkey Kong or any of the Kongs that were featured in the first Super Mario movie.</p>







<p>The movie is slated for release on April 1. It was previously noted that the movie was in post-production after animation was completed.</p>
