            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dayz-developer-responds-to-frostline-dlc-review-bombing-over-price/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Review bombing is a practice that’s picked up steam over the last handful of years when players of a game feel they’ve been  wronged  in some way. For fans of DayZ, that happened when the Frostline DLC launched in October.</p>



<p>Over the last <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968040/DayZ_Frostline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">30 days on Steam</a>, the DLC has a 77% negative reaction with players upset about a variety of things. The bulk of it, however, involves the DLC’s cost of $26.99 and what fans see as not much content for their money.</p>



<p>“DayZ itself is great for the price, this price for just a map alone is not worth it, especially when there are so many better modded maps out there for free,” one player wrote. “Do not waste your money on this map, you are not missing out on much sadly.”</p>



<p>Said another: “For this price, they’ve handed us a rehashed map from Arma 3, stripped-down content, broken balance, and shamelessly copied ideas.”</p>



<p>In a response to the backlash on <a href="https://x.com/maruksp/status/1861353665455366218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Marek Spanel, head of developer Bohemia Interactive, said that players aren’t being forced to buy the DLC. </p>



<p>“Did you know that 8 million users for whom we have data on Steam played for an average of 188 hours and paid an average of 30 USD gross in DayZ?” Spanel asked.</p>



<p>“That means we received less than 10 cents for an hour of live online gaming, for which we host the online infrastructure and have been updating it for 10+ years. Yet Dayz Frostline is currently being review-bombed on the same platform for being too expensive: $26.99 for ‘just a map’, and some users demand ‘gimme more for less money’.”</p>



<p>In a separate social media post, the game’s official account said that they are reading the feedback received and “always try to make the most of it.”</p>



<p>“The DayZ dev team continues working hard to pack in more awesome content with each update,” the post reads. “We read carefully your feedback and always try to make the most of it. We also don’t forget about our amazing modding community – and yes, they’ve got tons of free maps that’ll keep you busy if you are not ready to join people on frosty Sakhal just yet!”</p>

<p>While there aren’t too many weapons available in Gray Zone Warfare currently—it’s still early days for the tactical shooter—you do have a few highly customizable options. Perhaps the most accessible is the M4, the go-to rifle for most players from the early game through Tiger Bay. Once you enhance the gun with the right attachments, it becomes an absolute monster in most scenarios. Here’s how to construct a Gray Zone Warfare M4 build that is ideal for CQB scenarios!</p>



<h2 id="h-an-sbr-m4-in-gray-zone-warfare-is-peak">An SBR M4 in Gray Zone Warfare is Peak</h2>



<p>I’m a huge fan of an SBR M4 build in Gray Zone Warfare, as it allows for tight, controlled movements in primarily close-quarters environments like the starting town. While you won’t immediately have access to all these attachments, leveling up Gunny will unlock a large selection of viable components to make or break this build.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>M4 Lower</strong></li>



<li><strong>M4 Upper</strong></li>



<li><strong>M4 Buffer Tube</strong></li>



<li><strong>AR-15 M401 Nylon Stock</strong></li>



<li><strong>AR-15 Barrel – 10.5″</strong></li>



<li><strong>DD MK12 Low Profile Gas Block</strong></li>



<li><strong>KAC M4QD Flash Hider</strong></li>



<li><strong>SCH 5.56 Charging Handle</strong></li>



<li><strong>Torque Pistol Grip</strong></li>



<li><strong>DD RIS II 9.5</strong></li>



<li><strong>RVG Foregrip</strong></li>



<li><strong>HWX EXPS2 Holographic Sight (Circle 1-Dot)</strong></li>



<li><strong>AR-15 5.56x45mm 30-Round PMAG Magazine (5.56x45mm AP (M855)</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-short-barrel-m4-stats">Short-Barrel M4 Stats</h2>



<p>First and foremost, you should know that, as the game remains in Early Access, weapon and attachment stats may vary and change over time. These are accurate now but could change in a future balancing patch or content update. You’ll find this particular short-barrel rifle excels at taking down targets in close to mid-range encounters with ease, with relatively straightforward recoil and stamina drain. That said, handling does take a minor hit.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Accuracy</strong></td><td>3.89 MOA</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Recoil Control</strong></td><td>+24%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Arm Stamina Drain</strong></td><td>+4%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weapon Handling</strong></td><td>-8%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Reload Time</strong></td><td>-9%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weapon Type</strong></td><td>Assault Rifle</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fire Rate</strong></td><td>800 RPM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fire Mode</strong></td><td>Single/Auto</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Manufacturer</strong></td><td>COLT</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Stand back everyone, some heroes are coming through. Marvel Rivals is barreling its way into 2024 with a stacked superhero roster full of world-saving icons and heinous villains. We won’t pick sides yet though, instead, we’re going to tell you the Marvel Rivals release date to get you pumped. </p>



<p>The MCU has catapulted the Marvel universe to heights never thought possible. The fictional world was already ridiculously popular thanks to decades of compelling, Stan Lee-created comics, characters, and capers; but year’s worth of superhero films and billions in profits is the tip of the iceberg.</p>



<p>What better way to capitalize on the marvel (pun intended) of superheroes than by launching a full hero shooter featuring the best the fictitious world has to offer?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-marvel-rivals-release-date">When is the Marvel Rivals Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We are Rocket Raccoon. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Marvel Rivals release date is Dec. 6</strong>, and it seems like it will be a midnight regional rollout—unless we hear otherwise. The release date applies to all available platforms too including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>Despite the infamous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-marvel-rivals-money-laundering-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals money laundering controversy</a>, nothing seems like it can stop Rivals’ momentum. The summer saw some very positive Alpha and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-beta-surprises-players-with-thor-and-another-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beta testing</a>, with thousands of players getting involved, and NetEase responding to feedback encouragingly.</p>



<p>With a hefty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-roadmap-reveals-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> of content and leaks already in the pipeline, the Marvel Rivals release date and launch are only the beginning of (presumably) more success.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-marvel-rivals">What is Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is a third-person, online multiplayer shooter featuring characters from the Marvel Universe.</strong></p>



<p>Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Rocket Raccoon, Venom, and The Punisher are some of the pickable heroes in Marvel Rivals, with many more to come. All heroes are going to be free—avoiding the ugly strategy of paywalls—and it’s set to be an all-encompassing shooter.</p>



<p>The title also takes inspiration from modern-day contemporaries such as Overwatch by having players team up into two separate squads comprised of various roles from Offensive heroes to all-out Support superstars. Marvel Rivals also learns from other shooters in the market by making the entire experience <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marvel-rivals-free-to-play-cost-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play</a>. If you want, you don’t have to contribute even a single cent or pence toward the shooter.</p>

<p>Within the first month of launch, I spent 100 hours grinding through every task in Gray Zone Warfare. I don’t regret the journey one bit. In fact, I’m looking forward to more. Finally, the wait for more is over, with the launch of the Gray Zone Warfare Night Ops update featuring additional mechanics, new weapons, approximately 20 more tasks to complete, and a day/night cycle, among countless other features. It’s a big one!</p>



<h2 id="h-gray-zone-warfare-night-ops-patch-notes-in-full">Gray Zone Warfare Night Ops Patch Notes in Full</h2>



<p>As said, this is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-next-gray-zone-warfare-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive update</a> for the tactical shooter. Along with the mechanics mentioned above, like the long-requested day/night cycle and night vision elements, we’re also enjoying improved loot mechanics, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-night-ops-update-devlog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-value items spawning out in the world</a> to ensure operators can make a bit of money. Personally, while I’m excited to loot a gold chain to sell, I want to get my hands on the new AK series, the 1911, and the MP5. I imagine the latter will serve many of us well in the starter town and YBL, but we’ll see firsthand today!</p>
