<p>SEGA’s trademarks for “Ecco the Dolphin” and “Ecco” went public today, and players believe this could be the surprise game at the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i0onuf/sega_has_filled_a_new_trademark_for_ecco_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, a post on X by <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1878873951344185652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> revealed that on December 27, 2024, SEGA filed trademarks for “Ecco the Dolphin” and “Ecco” in Japan, and this information was made public today. Players believe that this could be the secret game at Xbox Developer Direct as it matches the description of being an iconic Japanese IP with a lot of history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days ago, Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that a Developer Direct is scheduled for January 23, 2025, during which they will reveal more details about South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, DOOM: The Dark Ages, and a secret game. Right after the announcement, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-to-get-a-new-game-from-legendary-japanese-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> claimed that the secret title would be “a new entry in a legendary Japanese IP which has decades of history. ” Players speculate that this IP is none other than Ecco the Dolphin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecco the Dolphin is a video game series created by Ed Annunziata for the Sega Genesis console. In this game, you play the role of a bottlenose dolphin called Ecco, who is searching the vast ocean for his missing pod. The series received several instalments until 2000, including Ecco: The Tides of Time, Ecco Jr., and more. However, the franchise has been dormant since then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see if SEGA’s new trademark is indeed Xbox’s secret title. However, we will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a recent report stated that Sega could be working <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-subscription-service-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a new game subscription service</a>. Also, two Xbox exclusives <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a>. What are your thoughts on SEGA’s new trademark? Is it Xbox’s secret title?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals players are using Invisible Woman to spot bots in their matches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-players-using-invisible-woman-confuse-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, RivalsAssembled (via barky1616) recently shared an interesting video on <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAssembled/status/1878843645740380395" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> of a player uniquely using Susan Storm’s abilities. As the Invisible Woman, one of her abilities allows the character to turn invisible. Marvel Rivals players are using this ability to confuse the bots and bring them to a standstill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the video, this Marvel Rivals player uses Invisible Woman’s ability to prop themselves near a staircase, which confuses the bots. The bots are programmed to follow a set trajectory to reach the location, and Invisible Woman’s ability acts like an invisible barrier in their way. A typical player could tell that there’s something off, but as they are bots, they do nothing but stand still until Susan’s ability wears off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The opponent team consisted of the Hulk, Adam Warlock, Iron Man, Winter Soldier, Peni Parker, and Mantis. Four of the six came to a standstill when Invisible Woman blocked them. Peni Parker and Iron Man were the only heroes who progressed. Once the ability wore off, all four characters started attacking Invisible Woman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not new to fill lobbies with bots to shorten the wait times for quick matches, and it seems Marvel Rivals has been implementing them, too. However, if players are able to block their paths completely, it won’t take long for them to obliterate these lobbies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-professor-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 more heroes, including Professor X</a>, are reportedly coming to Marvel Rivals. Also, the game just hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-new-peak-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new peak player count</a> and has topped the Steam charts.

<p>I yearn for a 161 of Clubs in Balatro, and not a day goes by where I don’t dream of it. It’s a dream no longer though as it turns out it exists! The 161 of Clubs is a real card in Balatro, well, kind of.</p>



<p>Jokers are the lifeblood of Balatro. Even the most mediocre of runs can be bolstered by a game-changing Joker. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-astronomer-joker-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astronomer Joker</a> makes runs cheaper, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-hit-the-road-joker-balatro/">Hit The Ro</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-hit-the-road-joker-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-hit-the-road-joker-balatro/">d</a> exchanges certain Cards for huge xMult increases, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-brainstorm-joker-in-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brainstorm</a> can give you twice as much Joker power. Traditional Cards are left unchanged though. Yes, you can add various bonuses, and duplicate and destroy Cards, but never-before-seen Cards don’t exist in Balatro.</p>



<p>This was until the 12 of Hearts and bizarre 161 of Clubs caught my attention.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-balatro-s-161-of-clubs">What is Balatro’s 161 of Clubs?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ridiculous. Image via “I hope I’m doing this correctly” Balatro Reddit post</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The 161 of Clubs is a meme in Balatro started by a Reddit Post.</strong></p>



<p>I did some digging, and after seeing the term “161 of Clubs” continually crop up, I was beginning to wonder if some newfangled Card existed. Or maybe there’s a secret Joker to unlock. The 161 of Clubs is nothing but a popular meme that has spread like a knife with hot butter.</p>



<p>The first known existence of the 161 Clubs came to light with the “I hope I’m doing this correctly,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1ht9pde/i_hope_im_doing_this_correctly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on the Balatro subreddit</a>. It features an eye-catching screenshot of the user’s hand midgame. It has usual Cards such as an Ace of Diamonds, two 4 of Clubs, and a 10 of Diamonds.</p>



<p>We quickly go from the ridiculous to the sublime as the hand escalates: An <strong>11 of Clubs</strong> (should be a Jack), <strong>12 of Hearts</strong> (should be a Queen), <strong>23 of Spades</strong> (I give up), and the now-legendary <strong>161 of Clubs</strong> are present.</p>



<p>It appears the post was shared to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/comedyheaven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Comedy Heaven su</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/comedyheaven/">breddit</a>—which has 2 million members—and quickly gained traction.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-get-161-of-clubs-in-balatro">Can You Get 161 of Clubs in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>Officially, you can’t get the 161 of Clubs in Balatro as it’s from a mod.</strong> If you get your hands on the mod, <strong>you too can wield the historic 161 of Clubs to score many Chips.</strong></p>



<p>The original Reddit post is marked with the “<strong>modded</strong>” tag. It’s not “leaked DLC” as some satirical comments suggest, and despite one hundred comments and several thousand likes, <strong>the mod has yet to be identified</strong>.</p>



<p>This is a shame as I feel the world is clamoring out for a ridiculous deck with a 161 of Clubs. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-balatro-seeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Balatro Seeds</a> break the game, so you can only imagine this Card’s potential.</p>

<p>If anyone knows the mod to get the 161 of Clubs, please drop it below for others to use. Balatro is entertaining enough, but I think we all agree this is a needed necessity. What other outlandish Cards would you like to see and use in Balatro?</p>

<p>In a post on social media, FuturLab’s CEO, Kirsty Rigden, revealed that the team is unable to support PowerWash Simulator VR going forward. This decision was made to support the job security of staff across the company, and instead of making layoffs, the team working on the VR version of the game has been ‘redeployed’ on other projects and roles.</p>



<p>This means that while the game remains available on storefronts, it will no longer receive any further updates, support, or DLC.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1878840388578169168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the post on Twitter</a> (X), Rigden wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am so sorry to let you know that we won’t be continuing support of PowerWash Simulator VR. We absolutely love and believe in VR, so this doesn’t mean that we won’t support it in the future but we aren’t able to continue with support right now.</p>



<p>We have been faced with a cross roads: we have a truly excellent and kind VR team who were working on a platform which costs us more than it makes, while also having a list of job opening that were looking to be filled on other projects.</p>



<p>We took the decision to redeploy our VR team into those other projects/roles. Whilst I would love to live in a world where we could support PowerWash Simulator on every platform going, I will always choose job security for my team.</p>



<p>While I know that you must be so disappointed, I also know that if you were in my position, you would have made the same decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’ve played a little PowerWash Simulator VR on the Meta Quest 3, and it’s a fantastic experience that’s possibly one of the most therapeutic things I’ve ever had the pleasure of enjoying. The base game was good enough, but VR enabled me to get up close with what I was cleaning – and it helped when it came to detecting those last spots of grime on unseen surfaces.</p>

<p>Sledgehammer Games, one of the key contributing studios at the heart of the Call of Duty franchise, has had a rocky time with the series over the last decade or so. The studio is best known for titles like Advanced Warfare, WWII, and Vanguard, which represents a real mixed bag of Call of Duty games.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, Sledgehammer’s Greg Reisdorf, who was with the firm for 15 years and rose to the role of Multiplayer Creative Director, revealed he has stepped down from the company.</p>

<p>In the post on Twitter (X), Greg Reisdorf wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Friday was my last day at Sledgehammer Games after 15 years. I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunities and amazing developers I worked with.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then dove deep into the history of Sledgehammer Games, giving up various tidbits and treasures from his time at the company. He revealed he created the iconic sequence where Soap succumbs to his wounds in Modern Warfare 3 (2011). He also mentioned that Advanced Warfare ‘was a challenge – but we made it happen’.</p>



<p>Looking back, Reisdorf suggested that the ‘Pick 13’ loadout model ‘should not have happened’. That’s one of the most divisive topics in the Call of Duty community year on year.</p>



<p>Reisdorf also revealed that he was instrumental in revisiting the MW2 maps in Modern Warfare III (2023). It’s widely considered the worst Call of Duty game to emerge in recent years, but the fan service was nothing short of a treat, and Reisdorf was responsible for many of the easter eggs and smaller details or ‘nods’ for true COD fans.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/gregreisdorf/status/1878849641715753391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full thread of posts by Reisdorf</a> is a veritable treasure trove of memory lane snippets, perfect reading material for the average Call of Duty fan.</p>
