<p>The first new VALORANT agent of 2025 is <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1876282811667112298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">veteran ballistics expert Tejo</a>, who becomes the 26th agent to join the Riot shooter’s roster. Tejo is also the seventh agent under the initiator role, equipped with an explosive kit that overwhelms the opponent with ordinance. </p>



<p>Billed as a “veteran intelligence consultant from Colombia,” Riot says that the newest VALORANT agent Tejo is designed to “[pressure] the enemy to relinquish their ground – or their lives.”</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-tejo-s-abilities">What are Tejo’s abilities?</h2>



<p>The themes of Tejo’s ability kit are suppression and explosiveness. Like Fade and Sova, he doesn’t have a flash ability. But while those two are geared toward maximum information gathering, Tejo is a disruptive force who can wreak havoc on enemy setups.</p>

<p>Here’s how each of his abilities work:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Guided Salvo: </strong>Equip a tactical map, and like you’re placing Brimstone smokes, select two spots on the map. Activating the ability will send a self-guided missile to each of the two spots, detonating on arrival with a three-pulse explosion. Great for flushing enemies out of corners and hiding spots, and great for post-plants.</li>



<li><strong>Stealth Drone</strong>: Deploy a drone that you control for a limited time. The Drone controls like one of Skye’s Trailblazer tigers, and you can manually detonate it near an enemy to both suppress and reveal them.</li>



<li><strong>Special Delivery</strong>: Equip a sticky grenade that sticks to the surface and explodes, concussing enemies caught in the vicinity. You can normal fire the grenade to stick to the first surface it hits, or you can alt-fire with right-click to make it bounce once first.</li>



<li><strong>Armageddon</strong>: Tejo’s ultimate ability effectively calls in a super destructive airstrike that travels along a long corridor. Players bring up a tactical map, select a starting area, then use the mouse to choose the direction that Armageddon travels.</li>
</ul>



<p>Tejo will officially arrive in VALORANT on Tuesday, Jan. 7. Riot is also debuting a new cosmetic type called FLEX, which are unique handheld objects that players can interact with. There will be two available starting Jan. 7: one for free, and one in the paid track of the next battle pass. The next VALORANT act will start on Jan. 8.</p>

<p>Images of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons have allegedly leaked online, providing new details about the successor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/523194/article/rumor-leaked-joy-con-2-pics-confirmed-via-serial-number-and-it-fits-nexthandhelds-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hu3rte/new_joycon_photos_from_chinese_sns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NintendoSwitch2</a> subreddit features a post that has leaked images of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons from the Chinese online forum, Baidu Teiba. At first glance, players can spot several obvious changes, such as the larger SL and SR bumpers and new connectors. It seems the successor to the Switch will be ditching the rails for a new connector that will allow players to pop their Joy-Cons in instead of sliding them in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if you look closer, you will find a new addition to the Switch 2 Joy-Cons. The latest addition looks like some kind of sensor next to the new connector. Many players on the r/NintendoSwitch2 subreddit have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1huvbt9/the_mouse_theory_doesnt_seem_so_unreasonable_to_me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">theorised</a> that this might be a sensor that will allow players to turn their Joy-Con into a mouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, the overall Joy-Con is much bigger, with larger joysticks and triggers. Regarding the colour, the Joy-Con is covered with a matte-black casing and has a patch of blue near the connectors. The new images of the Joy-Con also match the Christmas Leak by <a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NextHandhled</a>, where the alleged Switch 2 console also had connectors instead of rails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Nintendo Switch has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-passes-ps2-in-total-us-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed PlayStation 2 in total US sales</a>. Also, check out the Switch 2 design <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-dbrand-give-players-another-look-at-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that was leaked earlier by Dbrand</a>.

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone players are screaming out for the return of their first love—Verdansk. The iconic battle royale map birthed friendships, laughs, and intense victories during a difficult time in the world. Verdansk is coming back to Warzone, and its release period is interesting.</p>



<p>“Verdansk” is a stimulus word for many, with CoD smartly priming this feeling many years ago in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beginners-tips-and-tricks-for-winning-big-in-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone</a>. Activision had no right to drop a free-to-play battle royale so compelling. Its smart tactical gameplay was outshined by frantic firefights as you desperately sought cover under the shelter of Stadium’s sunlight-blocking presence. </p>



<p>Verdansk was the source of comfort for frustrated players emotionally bettered by the plight of the world in 2020 and beyond. With Warzone not quite what it once was, it’s time for the fictional city to return to Call of Duty.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone">Is Verdansk Coming Back to Warzone?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s good to be back. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Yes, to be clear, <strong>Verdansk is returning</strong>, and there are no debates or rumors here. Warzone is officially bringing back Verdansk to console CoD, and I’m not talking about Warzone Mobile.</p>



<p>The handheld spin-off marked the first appearance of Verdansk since it was removed. However, Verdansk deserves a bigger stage, and it’s getting one.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-warzone-s-verdansk-release-date">Do we Know Warzone’s Verdansk Release Date?</h2>



<p>There isn’t a precise date, but <strong>Verdansk returns to Warzone sometime in 2025</strong>—we know this is the case as it was confirmed at 2024’s COD NEXT event.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1828873802551271432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1828873802551271432%7Ctwgr%5E78cbc24b0e3ac71fc9db6351227985dd8fa46544%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fverdansk-return-warzone-2025%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD’s official X account</a> echoed the news with a message sure to get the blood pumping, “Run it back. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-warzone-2025/">Verdansk will return to Call of Duty Warzone in 2025</a>.”</p>



<p>Before you ask, there aren’t any leaks or general indicators as to when in 2025. It could be midway through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> lifecycle, or Activision can choose to wait until the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty 2025</a> for a joint integration.</p>



<p>We’ll update this when we have an exact release date for Verdansk’s reintroduction.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-was-verdansk-removed-from-warzone">When Was Verdansk Removed From Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>Verdansk was removed in December 2021</strong> when it was replaced with the tropical Caldera map for the launch of Call of Duty: Vanguard and Warzone Caldera.</p>



<p>The original Verdansk changed from its debut, from opening up Bunkers to The Destruction of Vedansk—eventually leading to things starting anew with Verdansk ’84. I’m sure we all have our first and last experiences of the legendary map (mine being a win!) and 2025 is ready to hit you in the nostalgia and create new memories and matches.</p>



<hr>



<p>On a scale of 1-10, how excited are you to see Verdansk return? Are you excited to drop into Dam, Train Station, and Superstore? Or will the novelty wear off quicker than a 1v1 in the OG Gulag?
