<p>In a new video uploaded by Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez, the President at OpTic Texas (amongst other things), the current ‘curse’ plaguing the Call of Duty League team was discussed at length. The 18-minute video offered a walkthrough of the offices that OpTic Texas plays out of, with HECZ talking to his team about the issues that have led to a 0-15 map record in recent weeks.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that <strong>something </strong>is wrong at OpTic Texas, as just a few months back, the team won the Call of Duty League Championship, the first COD world title for OpTic since 2017.</p>



<p>OpTic is trying anything at this point.</p>

<h2 id="h-i-think-it-s-this-room">‘I Think It’s This Room’</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas’ Dashy and Kenny both suggested in the video that the room they compete out of ‘might be cursed’, with HECZ revealing that he ‘saged’ the room, revealing at the end of the video exactly what that meant. He’d even taken the time to stencil the ‘Green Wall’ mantra on a whiteboard in the room to inspire his players.</p>



<p>Shotzzy took a similar path, suggesting that they need to relocate to the old office that used to house the squad in Dallas, Texas:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I know what it is, bro – I know what it is. We need to go back to the Dallas office.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pred, who recently returned to the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/huke-replacing-pred-in-optic-texas-starting-roster/">after a hiatus</a> lasting a couple of months, agreed with Shotzzy.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video from HECZ:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>HECZ stuck tightly to the theory that this is a curse, suggesting that the organisation has to try ‘supernatural’ solutions to kick out the bad luck that surrounds the team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Let’s talk about this curse. Let’s talk about this curse, because it can’t be anything else. It can’t be skill, they’ve proven to be world champions, they’ve proven to push through adversity – what made this happen?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also revisited comments he made previously, wherein he stated that the current roster is the worst Call of Duty team OpTic has ever had:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I know that I jokingly and not jokingly said that this is the worst team we’ve ever had, but it is becoming more and more clear that, as talented as these guys are, there’s something else.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>HECZ then walked around the office, demanding to know who had brought the curse upon the organisation. He then went off on a tanget about the talked-about ‘ring ceremony’ from COD Champs 2024, which is yet to take place. He stressed that ‘no matter how bad they’re doing’, the Green Wall and OpTic Texas <strong>deserve </strong>to see the ring ceremony.</p>



<p>What do you think is wrong at OpTic Texas? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Seeking Investors For “New Entity”, Report Claims]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-seeking-investors-for-new-entity/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-seeking-investors-for-%E2%80%9Cnew-entity%E2%80%9D-report-claims.1134612/</guid>

<p>Ubisoft is actively looking to bring more investors into the fold for what is described as a “new entity”. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published</a> on Friday, Bloomberg says that the company is “considering selling a minority stake in the venture and has contacted potential bidders.” These bidders include Tencent along with various funds located both in France and around the globe.</p>



<p>“Ubisoft has asked for preliminary bids to be made as soon as this month, the people added, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter,” Bloomberg says.</p>



<p>This new venture would include “some of its core” gaming franchises such as Assassin’s Creed. Tencent refused to comment on the claims while Ubisoft pointed to recent earnings reports where it stated that it was exploring all possible options for the company.</p>



<p>The idea of a “new entity” isn’t completely new. Back in January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was reported</a> that Ubisoft and Tencent had talks of a “new venture” that would allow the Guillemot family to retain control of the company while giving Tencent more control over various assets. At the time, Insider Gaming sources said that there was no firm decision or direction reached with the company continuing to look at every option.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft has continued to come under fire both outside and within the company. A minority shareholder has even called for a protest outside the company’s Paris headquarters after its claim that the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to disclose IP acquisition talks</a> with EA and Microsoft.</p>

<p>The Soulslike genre is adding another meaty release to its catalog in 2025—The First Berserker Khazan. There’s a lot to love from intense boss fights to a strong protagonist. Let’s see if Xbox Game Pass has the chance to add The First Berserker Khazan to the subscription service.</p>



<p>I’m very excited for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a>—as are most Souls fans. It’s got a distinct and notable JRPG flair to its graphics, but FromSoftware—and contemporaries such as Stellar Blade and Black Myth Wukong—would be proud of its bullish combat. Each strike and movement is lit up perfectly by the dazzling and striking art style.</p>



<p>I think Khazan will go beyond being a “sleeper hit.” But if it can secure a partnership with Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, The First Berserker Khazan is on the way to a violent victory.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-the-first-berserker-khazan-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play The First Berserker Khazan on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>

<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan is sadly not coming to Xbox Game Pass anytime soon.</strong></p>



<p>It’s simple: Not every title arrives on Xbox Game Pass (or PS Plus) on its first day. Whether it’s because the developer and publisher aren’t interested, or Microsoft isn’t, we do know Khazan is destined to be a solo release available across multiple platforms on March 27.</p>



<p>Xbox Game Pass hasn’t been mentioned in a single The First Berserker Khazan trailer. Another very telling sign is if you go to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-first-berserker-khazan-standard-edition/9NH8P6S460LD/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan’s Xbox Store Page</a>, you’ll see there’s no Game Pass label. It’s a standalone release not partnering up with any of the big brands for exclusivity.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-first-berserker-khazan-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will The First Berserker Khazan Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>The success of The First Berserker Khazan likely determines a future Xbox Game Pass nod.</strong></p>



<p>This doesn’t mean unsuccessful games are omitted from Xbox Game Pass consideration. Struggling titles gain a bigger, much-needed audience thanks to Game Pass. However, Game Pass doesn’t have too many AAA Soulslikes currently, but it’s silly to think Microsoft doesn’t want some piece of a successful pie.</p>



<p>2023’s Lords of the Fallen is on there. Plus, the semi-Soulsy nature of Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order is available. So it is hit and miss if this ever happens. My advice is to <strong>take a shot on Khazan and see if it’s for you</strong>.</p>



<p>We’ll update this page if The First Berserker Khazan does come to Microsoft’s service.</p>



<hr>



<p>Am I overplaying the potential of The First Berserker Khazan? Or can it knock on the Game of the Year door come December?</p>
