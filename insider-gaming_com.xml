<p>The announcement of the next Sony PlayStation State of Play presentation caught the eye of a major actor from the Detroit: Become Human video game.</p>



<p>Early in the day on February 9, Sony confirmed that its next PlayStation State of Play would take place on February 12. Not only did many PlayStation players react to the news, but so did one actor from a major video game released during the PlayStation 4 generation.</p>



<p>Bryan Dechart, who provided the motion capture and voice for Connor in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/detroit-become-human/" id="2059">Detroit: Become Human</a>, responded to the news with the eyes emoji and an exclamation point.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-dechart-s-excitement-could-mean-many-things">Dechart’s Excitement Could Mean Many Things</h2>



<p>Dechart is closely associated with Detroit: Become Human, as he lent his likeness and voice to the role of Connor. However, Dechart is known for more than Detroit in the video game space.</p>



<p>He also appeared in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/red-dead-redemption-2/" id="541">Red Dead Redemption</a> and voiced Brennan, among others, in Cyberpunk 2077. He’s also attached to Lunafon: Tales of the Moon Oak, an <a href="https://rokitstudios.com/lunafon">upcoming hand-drawn 2D Adventure inspired</a> by Welsh culture. He also streams on Twitch. Therefore, his reaction isn’t necessarily a sign that a new game in the Detroit universe is on the way.</p>



<p>He streams on Twitch with his wife, Amelia Rose Blaire, who was also featured in Detroit. Together, they founded <a href="https://www.dechartgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dechart Games</a> and are currently working on their own release, The Grand Prismatic, a branching narrative game.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-likely-is-a-detroit-become-human-sequel">How Likely Is A Detroit: Become Human Sequel?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quantic-dream/" id="147">Quantic Dream</a>, the studio behind Detroit, Heavy Rain, and other hits, isn’t necessarily against making a sequel. </p>



<p>CEO <a href="https://wccftech.com/david-cage-on-quantic-dream-future-next-gen-gaming-and-not-ruling-out-sequels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">David Cage told WCCFTech </a>in 2020 that they’re open to making sequels for any of their projects, as long as there’s more to say about the world and its characters. Doing a sequel for profit is not the studio’s mindset.</p>



<p>“It may sound naïve from a CEO with 20 years in the industry, but I continue to think that any project should be heartfelt,” he said.</p>



<p>PlayStation has many projects in the works, including the upcoming Bungie release Marathon, Saros, the Wolverine game slated for this year, and more. Learn more about the forthcoming State of Play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstations-february-state-of-play-officially-confirmed/">here</a>. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming will provide full coverage of the event on February 12.</p>

<p>Amazon’s God of War live-action series has now secured actors for both protagonists, Kratos and Atreus. </p>



<p>It seems like the live-action adaptation of God of War is shaping up nicely, with new castings being announced frequently. We already know that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ryan-hurst-comments-on-playing-kratos-in-prime-videos-god-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Hurst</a> will be playing Kratos, and most recently, the actors for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-video-casts-thor-and-odin-in-god-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thor and Odin</a> were revealed. Now, we have been informed about who’s going to play the son of the God of War. </p>







<h2 id="h-callum-vinson-to-play-as-atreus-in-god-of-war-adaptation">Callum Vinson to Play as Atreus in God of War Adaptation</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-live-action-series-cast-callum-vinson-atreus-1236656985/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> reveals that Callum Vinson will play the young god Atreus, making him one of the two main characters of the series. Vinson is known for playing characters in series such as Dead Ringers, Long Bright River, and Poker Face. </p>

The dynamic between father and son is something that fans have cherished over the years, and it will be exciting to see how Hurst and Vinson portray this relationship on television.</p>



<p>The upcoming series will be written, executive-produced, and showrun by Ronald D. Moore. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shogun’s Frederick E.O.
