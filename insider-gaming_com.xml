<p>There won’t be a Battle Royale mode coming to Delta Force any time soon.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hb22q5/delta_force_game_director_here_ask_me_anything/?sort=new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ask Me Anything</a> on Reddit on Tuesday, Delta Force Game Director Shadow Guo was asked about the possibility. Immediately, however, he shot the idea down.</p>



<p>“We&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;have&nbsp;such&nbsp;plans&nbsp;for&nbsp;now&nbsp;as&nbsp;our&nbsp;primary&nbsp;focus&nbsp;is&nbsp;on&nbsp;Operations&nbsp;and&nbsp;Warfare,” Guo said..</p>



<p>Instead of a Battle Royale, Guo pointed to the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-release-single-player-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Black Hawk Down</a> campaign mode. In an answer to another question, Guo talked about the inspiration behind the setting and theme for the campaign and it being different than multiplayer’s setting, saying they wanted to honor past Delta Force Games.</p>



<p>“We are working hard to preserve and expand the Delta Force franchise,” Guo said. “The campaign, which is set in the 90s, is our love letter to classic Delta Force titles. We would also like to create something new for the Delta Force universe, hence the 2035 timeline set in the multiplayer part.”</p>



<p>He added that the development is “coming along nicely” and things are looking good for the Q1 2025 (January) release of the mode.</p>



<p>“Our team will be sharing more details when it’s closer to the campaign’s launch,” he said.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov%E2%80%99s-next-competitor-can-now-be-wishlisted-on-steam.1058082/</guid>

<p>The extraction shooter genre has exploded in recent years, and it’s arguably down to the ongoing success of Escape from Tarkov, from Battlestate Games. This spearhead of a game has popularised the extraction shooter gameplay loop, so much so that many developers have tried to get in on the action in the last two or three years.</p>



<p>One such attempt to mirror Tarkov’s success comes in the form of PIONER, a new post-apocalyptic MMO FPS from GFA Games, a Serbian studio.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-stalker-and-metro-oh-my">Tarkov, STALKER, and Metro – Oh, My!</h2>



<p>PIONER recently went live on Steam, which means users can now add the harrowing FPS title to their wishlist in anticipation of the game’s impending release, which is slated for 2025.</p>



<p>Here’s the game’s description from Steam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>PIONER</em>&nbsp;is an open-world MMO first-person shooter set in a haunting, alternative-reality world where Soviet-era structures lie abandoned on a desolate, post-apocalyptic island. In this immersive environment, the gameplay experience is defined by dynamic PvE and PvP elements, where realism takes priority over traditional health bars or character levels. </p>



<p>With a sprawling map of 50+ square kilometers, not counting hidden dungeons, players can explore a world rich with mystery and danger, encountering story quests and faction missions that influence relationships and loyalty rewards.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wrapped up within PIONER is ‘Shadowlands’, an extraction shooter mode that boasts the core mechanics typical for the genre. Players are invited to enter the supersized map, loot and fight to their heart’s desire, and then attempt to successfully extract from the map.</p>



<p>PIONER has been inspired by other, similar titles. Elements of STALKER, Metro, and Fallout can all be seen in the clips, shots, and trailers that have been released in the last year or so, which unfortunately means that the game’s make-up and overall aesthetic aren’t going to stand apart from the competition.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PIONER Awakening Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVx4-bi-OKw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Bold promises have been made regarding the ultimate delivery of PIONER. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s bio on Steam</a>, GFA Games has promised sci-fi-influenced lore, a ‘rich’ campaign, diverse activities including <strong>casino games and fishing</strong>, and extensive survival mechanics.</p>

<p>In a new breakdown published by StreamsCharts, it was revealed that Kick.com underwent monumental growth through 2024. It’s only the platform’s second year in the business, but it’s already making waves and proving that it could be a legitimate contender to both Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>As YouTube is seemingly moving away from supporting live streamers in favour of short-form content, could there be a hole for Kick to step into and truly rival Twitch?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers-in-2024">Big Numbers in 2024</h2>



<p>In 2024, Kick’s hours watched metric skyrocketed by 142% to <strong>2.1 billion</strong>. The platform’s peak viewer count also swelled, hitting lofty heights of <strong>1.75 million</strong>, a 79.7% improvement year-on-year.</p>



<p>These metrics were aggregated and revealed <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/kicks-second-year-recap-viewership-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by StreamsCharts recently</a>.</p>



<p>It has been a busy year for Kick.com, with the platform moving more into the esports space, expanding into fresh and key regions, and some more big names being signed to the site.</p>



<p>The year-end metrics published recently revealed that the site has 933,572 unique channels, which marks a 19% increase over 2023. The average online channel count at any one time is 3,035, up 52% from last year, which shows how many more users are jumping onto and actively using the site.</p>



<p>The average viewer count is the money-maker, though.</p>



<p>It was revealed that Kick’s average viewer count through 2024 sits at around 258,293. That’s a whopping 149% increase over last year’s figure, and it’s fully indicative of the platform’s ongoing success.</p>



<p>However, not <strong>everything </strong>is looking bright for Kick’s future. The site’s second-most popular streamer, Adin Ross, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-leaving-kick-ludwig-back-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently revealed he’s stepping away</a> from Kick indefinitely and trying to move back to Twitch. That’ll have a noticeable impact going into 2025, as this year, the controversial streamer was responsible for 60.5 million watch hours.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals and SVP go hand in hand like Spider-Man and Venom or Groot and Rocket Raccoon. It adds an extra dimension to Rivals’ gameplay—standing out from other hero shooters—but many in the community are unsure of what it means, or how it affects you.</p>



<p>I didn’t see how Marvel Rivals’ launch could fail, and it didn’t. It accumulated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million players in three days</a> and an early <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-first-post-launch-patch-is-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-launch patch</a> made significant improvements. The online shooter has a lot going for it—including a whopping <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-marvel-rivals-achievements-trophies-list-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy and Achievement list</a>—and one thing it adds is SVP.</p>



<p>SVP is something I’d never heard of in an online shooter, but it makes a lot of sense.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-svp-mean-in-marvel-rivals">What does SVP Mean in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>My Spidey senses are tingling on this one. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>SVP stands for Second Valuable Player in Marvel Rivals</strong> <strong>and gives recognition to the best player of the losing team.</strong></p>



<p>I presume you’ve heard the term MVP before, which most people know as “Most Valuable Player.” This applies to gaming, sports, and anything where the value of individuals is judged in a team-based environment. The top-performing participant, in terms of points or a graded display, is awarded the MVP—highlighting their contributions by awarding them for being the best player.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals also has an MVP award, and this is clearly marked at the end of a game where a victory screen indicates the MVP of the lobby by showing their name and most recently used character. Fairly standard stuff so far.</p>



<p>If you look at the final leaderboard at the end of a match though, as well as the winning team’s “MVP,” you should see “SVP” on the opposing side.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-you-get-svp-in-marvel-rivals">How do You Get SVP in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p><strong>To be SVP in Marvel Rivals, you need to be on the defeated team in a match and be the top-performing player of the losing side.</strong></p>



<p>There’s no clearly defined metric or quantitative data to suggest how SVP is measured. However, common sense suggests you need to contribute the most to your team’s effort: </p>



<ul>
<li>Assists</li>



<li>Earning objective points</li>



<li>Few (if any) deaths</li>



<li>Healing teammates</li>



<li>Kills</li>
</ul>



<p>If you consistently hit these five criteria, chances are, you’re in the running for SVP. Sitting at the back of the map and farming kills won’t get the job done. We all hate a teammate not contributing to the objective, so if you want to use Hawkeye with the only intention of padding your kill count and boosting your KD, don’t expect to be SVP.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-svp-do-in-marvel-rivals">What Does SVP do in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p><strong>If you are SVP, you don’t lose ranking points in Marvel Rivals—and this is a big boost to your rank and matchmaking.</strong></p>



<p>Ranked play is all about wins and points. The more wins you get, the more points you earn, and the higher up the leagues you climb. Losing a match is detrimental to ranked progress. On the other hand, if you earn SVP status on the defeated team, your ranking points stay the same. Again, this is a huge deterrent to negative play, and incentives players to get involved and be as useful as possible.</p>

<p>CSGO and CS2 skin gambling is still a prominent part of the wider Counter-Strike betting market. Instead of betting real money, players can wager the value of skins in their Steam inventory on professional match results and casino-like jackpot games.</p>



<p>The reputations and legitimacy of some of these sites have always been a major debate point within the Counter-Strike community. But is the act of skin gambling itself legal?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-you-gamble-using-cs-skins">Can You Gamble Using CS Skins?</h2>



<p>Gambling using CSGO and CS2 skins is legal, depending on the country or U.S. state you are in. You also have to be 18+ to gamble in any country or state where it is legal.</p>



<p>Up until 2018, it was illegal in the United States to gamble on sports using cash outside of the states of Oregon, Delaware, Montana, and Nevada, under the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992. </p>



<p>Because of this, several sites used skin gambling as a way to navigate around these laws, as virtual items were not prohibited. Even as gambling laws in the U.S. have changed, these laws don’t explicitly cover the gambling of virtual items like skins.</p>



<p>While skin gambling is not illegal, the skin gambling industry has been in the crosshairs of Valve since 2016. Valve was hit with a number of lawsuits in 2016 that were directly tied to various skin gambling sites. </p>



<p>Since then, Valve has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/30/12332802/counter-strike-gambling-crackdown-valve-cease-and-desist-csgo-shuffle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sent several cease and desist letters</a> to dozens of skin gambling sites and threatened them with legal action. The developer has also limited several features through Steam that contribute to skin gambling sites. As a result, many of these sites went dark or closed down completely.</p>



<p>Most sites now don’t let you wager skins directly. Instead, you can sell or trade in these skins for a site-specific currency. Then, you use that currency to either wager on matches or play casino-like games. If you win, you can use your currency to buy new skins or open cases on the site.</p>
