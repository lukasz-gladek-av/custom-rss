<p>Free Counter-Strike 2 cases are hard to come by, and even if you do get your hands on one, it won’t open for free. Counter-Strike cases, the keys that open them, and the items inside have formed the foundation of a trading market now worth millions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how to get CS2 cases for free.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-free-counter-strike-2-cases">How to get free Counter-Strike 2 cases</h2>



<p>Players can get one free Counter-Strike 2 case from the in-game weekly care package. Every week, once a player reaches their next XP rank, they can select two of four available rewards. A case is always included in this group of rewards.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The weekly care package resets every Tuesday at 8pm CT. The weekly care package window can be found in the store, but it will pop up automatically after a player levels up their XP rank. Players can level up their XP rank by playing games using official matchmaking. More XP is earned by playing full-length matches in competitive or Premier mode.</p>



<p>Aside from this method, players can also sometimes get free cases from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS2 skin gambling</a> websites. In almost all cases, players have to sign up and use the site in order to get the free cases. Cases on these sites are typically site-specific, and don’t have the same odds and items as the official cases bought and sold through Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-cheap-counter-strike-2-cases">How to get cheap Counter-Strike 2 cases</h2>



<p>Getting only one case per week for free is a very slow method for acquiring cases. Thankfully, players with money in their Steam account can purchase cases for just a few cents.</p>



<p>On the Steam community market, players can go to the CS2 section and filter by the “Container” item type. There they can sort by price and find cases that sell for less than $0.50 like the Recoil Case, the Snakebite Case, and the Fracture Case. Players can even put in a “request to buy” at a specific price that will automatically purchase a case when it reaches a low enough price point.</p>



<p>Which case did you get in your last weekly care package? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike players in 2025 will have the opportunity to capitalize on an entirely new landscape. Following post-Major roster changes and new rules implemented by Valve, the competitive CS2 scene will feel drastically different compared to years past.</p>



<p>Many of the same players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who dominated the 2024 season</a> will almost certainly do so again in 2025. Obviously you should be watching established greats like donk, m0NESY, ZywOo, and others next year. But rather than highlight the best players of 2024 who will repeat success again next year, we’re going to look at players ready to break into the top echelon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-to-watch-in-2025">Best CS2 Players to Watch in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-mario-malbsmd-samayoa">Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa</h3>



<p>With long-time rifler Nikola “NiKo” Kovač set to depart for Falcons, G2 is looking to Argentinian rising star malbsMd to step up another level. malbsMd was brought in from North American roster M80 this past summer and made an immediate impact on G2. He showcased his star capabilities at some of the biggest events of the year, including the recent Shanghai Major. NiKo has big shoes to fill, but with G2 also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-will-reportedly-keep-cs2-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly holding on to superstar AWPer Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov</a>, malbsMd is in a great position to take a huge leap forward.</p>



<h3 id="h-roland-ultimate-tomkowiak">Roland “ultimate” Tomkowiak</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>There’s no shortage of incredible AWPers in CS2, and Team Liquid’s ultimate looks primed and ready to reach that top tier. Liquid grabbed ultimate from the Polish roster of Illuminar Gaming this past year, and outside of IEM Rio and the final BLAST events, he’s been splendid. At his first ever Major, he was a bright spot during Liquid’s playoff run, providing incredible value as both an AWPer and a secondary entry player.</p>



<h3 id="h-dorian-xertion-berman">Dorian “xertioN” Berman</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The current MOUZ lineup is absolutely stacked with young talent, but xertioN gets the nod here. The Israeli 20-year-old player is a prolific main entry player, with an ability to properly utilize utility in a way that’s invaluable to MOUZ. MOUZ made a number of deep playoff runs this year, and won ESL Pro League Season 19, thanks to spectacular play from xertioN. Since his return from a VAC ban, Jimi “Jimpphat” Salo has also been spectacular for MOUZ.</p>



<p>Who else is worth watching when the CS2 2025 season begins?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Year 2 Content is Planned for Ubisoft’s Skull and Bones]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-year-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-year-2-content-is-planned-for-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-skull-and-bones.1064793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-year-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft plans to release year 2 content for its quadruple A game Skull and Bones.</p>



<p>That’s according to sources who have knowledge of the plans for the pirate action-adventure game.</p>



<p>Year 2 Season 1 is set to kick off sometime early next year with brand-new PvP gamemodes, places of interest (POIs), new world tiers, and more.</p>



<p>It’s also understood that Ubisoft is exploring more premium crossover events, with one source saying that one idea includes a Black Flag crossover event around the time of the release of Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake (codenamed Obsidian). But whether or not that comes to fruition remains to be seen.</p>



<p>The news that Skull and Bones will be having Year 2 of content might surprise some, as the publisher <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently canceled XDefiant</a>, its free-to-play offering that saw nearly 300 people lose their jobs.</p>



<div><p>However, sources tell me that Ubisoft is fully committed to continuing the game’s support and that the player numbers “might surprise people.” Still, Insider Gaming could not verify the game’s current player count statistics.  At the time of writing, though, Skull and Bones get just shy of a peak of 200 concurrent players in 24 hours on Steam, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2853730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.</p><p>The game is currently slashed from its £49.99 price tag to just £20.00&nbsp;on the <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/skull-and-bones/6295077a27efc536e38350a0.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft store page</a>, with the publisher also offering a 6-hour free demo for those on PC should you wish to try.</p></div>



<p>Earlier this year, Insider Gaming reported that one week after the games release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-players-total/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skull and Bones saw an estimated 850,000 players</a>, which also included those who had played via Ubisoft’s free 8-hour game trial.</p>



<p>What do you think of Skull and Bones nearly a year on? Will you be giving Year 2 content a go? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
