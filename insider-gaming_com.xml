<p>The Apex Legends Global Series Championship 2026 has <strong>just wrapped</strong>, and it was OBLIVION sitting at the top of the table after a hard-fought grand final. The final series was dragged out by so many teams racking up enough points to land themselves on <strong>match point</strong>, waiting on one final win to claim the trophy and the $600,000 prize.</p>



<p>Team Falcons was the first squad to reach match point after a dominant run throughout the tournament. It seems that nothing, not even a banned controller, could stop ImperialHal – <strong>except OBLIVION</strong></p>







<p>It has been a pretty mixed year for the Apex Legends Global Series. We saw Team Falcons storm to the top spot time and again, running through much of the season as <strong>the team to beat</strong>. The year came to a close in Sapporo (again), a site fast becoming the <strong>home </strong>of Apex esports, with a hugely polished event backed by some stunning sponsorships.</p>



<p>It was easily one of the biggest years for Apex esports.</p>



<p>This year introduced an all-new LAN structure, a <strong>monumental </strong>ALGS Open featuring 160 teams, a revamped points system, <strong>and </strong>an expanded map pool, just to make things more varied.</p>



<p>It all came to a head at the ALGS Championship 2026, live in Sapporo. By the time the grand final of the tournament was set to end, six teams sat on match point, making for an exhilarating showdown in front of a <strong>huge </strong>and energetic crowd in the Daiwa House Dome in Japan.</p>



<p>As Team Falcons sat with toes touching the finish line, Fnatic stepped up and threw themselves into the running with a huge upset, especially buffed as the team was playing on <strong>home turf</strong>.</p>



<p>The next map went wild, and the final fight came down to a razor-sharp line, with the last three teams fighting in the most minuscule circle, trading shots and playing as patient a game as possible, everyone conscious of the fact that E36 sat on match point while nobody else did. That became the focal point, E36 was wiped, and another round was lined up against all odds.</p>



<p>Eight teams now sat in the match point realm.</p>



<p>The <strong>very final map </strong>saw Oblivion surge out of nowhere, with the LCQ champions breaking into the final three and storming to success in Sapporo. The mostly North American squad put up a masterclass in the Apex space, securing the biggest underdog win in the history of the space.</p>



<p>Until now, the organization had won just $10,000 in the Apex tournament world; the team has claimed a $600,000 prize, while not even having team jerseys on the stage. Huge congratulations to Monsoon, Blinkzr, and FunFPS.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-terminally-ill-fan-wish-play-gta-6-early/</link>
            <guid>1409356</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In December, a Ubisoft Toronto developer posted on LinkedIn with a heartfelt, emotional message. The developer, Anthony Armstrong, revealed that a member of their family had been battling cancer ‘for years’ and had been given the news that nobody <strong>ever </strong>wants to hear: they had months left to live.</p>



<p>Armstrong explained that they were <strong>a huge </strong>GTA fan, but the final timeline meant that they wouldn’t get to play Grand Theft Auto 6 after <strong>years </strong>of waiting. It was recently confirmed by Armstrong that they’d finally managed to talk with Rockstar Games and that they’d received ‘great news’ and issued thanks to the developer.</p>







<h2 id="h-gamer-with-months-to-live-may-get-to-play-gta-6-early">Gamer with Months to Live May Get to Play GTA 6 Early</h2>



<p>The post on Anthony Armstrong’s LinkedIn page was deleted after final adjustments were made, keeping followers updated about the situation. It has been theorized that this was due to some kind of legal requirement, given that the post almost <strong>confirmed </strong>that the family member would get hands-on with GTA 6 <strong>early</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anthony-armstrong-793453110_final-update-we-spoke-to-them-today-and-activity-7402775456988770313-aBME" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">original post</a> text:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To any of my connections at Rockstar Games and Rockstar Toronto, or anyone else that may be able to help. A member of my family woh has been battling cancer for years just recently got the worst possible news, he was given 6 – 12 months to live.</p>



<p>The reason I’m reaching out is that they are a huge GTA fan and, with this latest update, he may not be around long enough to actually get to see GTA 6 launch, best case scenario he will be leaving us the same month it does. He currently lives only a stones throw from the Oakville studio, so its my hope that one of you may be able to set up an exclusive playtest, so he can have a chance to experience the game, before passing.</p>



<p>I absolutely understand the need for secrecy at this point of development, so at the very least an NDA is probably needed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Weeks later, Armstrong updated the post with two more lines:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Update: The CEO of Take-Two reached out and we are just waiting to hear from the Rockstar team to discuss this further. Thank you to everyone who has shown support, reshared, and reached out to your contacts for us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Final Update: We spoke to them today and got great news. That’s all I can really say, but thank you all from the bottom of my heart.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When you run a quick search, you can see that Google still has the post cached, but it has since been deleted from LinkedIn:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Note: The ‘1 month ago’ refers to the original post date and not the subsequent updates</figcaption></figure>







<p>On social media, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/1qfznje/rockstar_games_gave_a_terminally_ill_fan_with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">some channels</a> were able to grab screencaptures of the post before it was deleted by Armstrong.</p>



<p>This is far from the first time a situation like this has surfaced in gaming, and it’s not the first time Rockstar Games has granted such a wish.</p>



<p>In 2018, a terminally ill gamer was allowed to <a href="https://gamerant.com/red-dead-redemption-2-terminally-ill-fan-play-early/">play Red Dead Redemption 2 early</a>, weeks before the game was set to launch. Bethesda Game Studios has honored the passing of fans by immortalizing them in games, such as Fallout 4 and Starfield.</p>







<p>Do you think this is a huge win for Rockstar Games, or is it a bout of positive PR at a time when the developer is facing bad press? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently confirmed that Amazon’s New World: Aeternum will be shut down next year, going offline forever and locking players out of the game they might have loved for a good while. The MMORPG was released in September 2021, soaring to epic player counts, but it quickly dwindled and the ever-marching progress of time saw the game fall out of favor <strong>fast</strong>.</p>



<p>Following the announcement that New World: Aeternum will be taken offline in 2027, an unlikely figure stood up and offered $25 million to keep the game alive, because ‘games should never die.’</p>



<h2 id="h-will-facepunch-keep-new-world-aeternum-alive">Will Facepunch Keep New World: Aeternum Alive?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011894052128768316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Alistair McFarlane, the director of Rust and COO at Facepunch Studios, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>25m, final offer Amazon Games</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Followed by a statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Games should never die.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The original post was made in response to a Facepunch employee joking that they’d asked ‘Ali’ to buy New World for them, but he told them to f*** off. This line is enough to make users doubt the validity of McFarlane’s messages, but who knows? We’ve seen stranger things.</p>



<p>As the comments unfolded, McFarlane explained when asked what Amazon should do for the players:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As with everything we do at Facepunch, empower the community. Give them control, make servers publicly hostable. A game will live forever in the hands of a dedicated community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In October 2025, Amazon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-development-cancelled-amazon-layoffs/">issued layoffs and ended</a> any more development on New World: Aeternum, and on January 15, it was revealed that the game would be taken <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-aeternum-to-be-taken-offline-next-year/">offline forever</a> in 2027.</p>



<p>This has been a major point of contention in the gaming space for the longest time. It surfaced most recently (and prolifically) with Ubisoft’s The Crew being pulled offline, a situation that spawned <strong>a court case</strong>, raised by disgruntled fans.</p>



<p>For the last few years, the concept of online-only games ending development has been a major debate, with many claiming that games should <strong>never, ever </strong>go offline.</p>



<p>It seems highly unlikely that Facepunch Studios will acquire New World: Aeternum, but what do you think? Do you think it’s up to <strong>other studios </strong>to keep games alive when they’re shut down by their creators?

            <title><![CDATA[Apex Legends Global Series Year 6 Roadmap Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/algs-year-6-roadmap-revealed-by-electronic-arts/</link>
            <guid>1409344</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Apex Legends Global Series is gearing up for another ambitious season, now that the ALGS Championship 2026 has wrapped. Electronic Arts has unveiled the full ALGS Year 6 roadmap, outlining a <strong>packed </strong>competitive calendar bursting with international events and structural changes.</p>



<p>At the heart of the announcement sits a renewed commitment to that perspective of global competition. This year, the three-event international LAN circuit returns, giving teams around the world more chances to make their name heard.</p>







<h2 id="h-algs-year-6-roadmap-is-bigger-than-ever">ALGS Year 6 Roadmap is Bigger Than Ever</h2>



<p>The season kicks off early with the Online Open, with qualifiers set to run from February 28 to March 23. Following that, the first Pro League Split will take place in April, running until June. The Challenger Circuit Split arrives in April and runs through to early June, spread across <strong>four </strong>circuits.</p>



<p>The first major LAN date to mark in your book is the Split 1 Playoffs at the 2026 Esports World Cup in Riyadh from July 7 to 11. </p>



<p>In the latter half of 2026, we’ll get the second round start, with the Pro League Qualifier taking place in late July, followed by the Pro League Split 2 in August to October. The second Challenger Circuit Split arrives in August and runs to October, and then the <strong>big events start unfolding</strong>.</p>



<p>Las Vegas plays host to the Split 2 Playoffs from October 29 to November 1, and the LCQ from November 20 to 22.</p>



<p>The ALGS Year 6 season comes to a close in Sapporo, Japan, from January 28 to 31, 2027. That’s when the Apex Legends Global Series Championship 2027 will take place, putting a cap on a bold season.</p>



<p>Electronic Arts has established a massive <strong>$7 million global prize pool </strong>for Year 6 of Apex Legends’ esports ecosystem, including $2 million reserved for each international event.</p>



<p>It was revealed that competitive integrity is becoming an increasing focus of the team this season. Legend bans will now be extended into the Challenger Circuit realm, ensuring the utmost consistency across all tiers of competition. Teams will face stricter roster rules, tighter transfer windows, and more control around Championship Points.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kouji Okada, co-founder of Atlas, is signed on to a game project for the first time in 18 years.</p>



<p>Kouji Okada has 40 years of experience in the video game industry. He’s best known for co-founding Atlus and his work on the Shin Megami Tensei and Persona titles. Now, he is slated to return to produce a new “school life RPG” being developed by Compile Heart.</p>







<p>Compile Heart announced on Thursday, January 15, that they were working on the new game and promised to deliver more information two weeks later, on January 29.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-other-jrpg-veterans-are-working-on-the-game-alongside-kouji-okada">Other JRPG Veterans Are Working on the Game Alongside Kouji Okada</h2>



<p>Not only is Okada signed on to produce the game, but Tadashi Satomi, one of the original writers in the Persona series, is linked to the project as well. Additionally, Tsukasa Masuko, one of the composers for the early Shin Megami Tensei titles, is on board.</p>



<p>A teaser trailer was uploaded to YouTube in Japanese. There were old-school anime sci-fi visuals, imagery of DNA, and a close-up of a character’s eye, before a visual of junk characters sitting at tables, making panicked motions, as shrieking sounds of despair briefly played in the background.</p>

<p>After leaving Atlus, Kouji Okada worked on a handful of games with Gaia studio, including Folklore on the Sony PlayStation 3. The Persona franchise remains the cornerstone of Atlus.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kurt Kuhlmann spent two decades working at Bethesda on several games in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, as well as Starfield. Now, he’s opening up about his vision for the 6th Elder Scrolls game and the potential role the delay in that game’s development played in his leaving the studio.</p>



<p>Kurt Kuhlmann is known as an Elder Scrolls loremaster specifically because of his longevity at the studio and the many games he’s working on. He hoped to be given the lead design role on Elder Scrolls 6. </p>







<p>However, the studio chose someone else, and that person has yet to be publicly named. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with PC Gamer, </a>Kuhlmann claimed that Todd Howard promised him the lead design role in the forthcoming game, but the project kept being pushed off to focus on other releases and ultimately never came to fruition.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“After Fallout 4, we didn’t go to TES6, we made Fallout 76, and then even then, we didn’t make TES6, we made Starfield, which became this extremely long project compared to other ones. So from my point of view, I’ve been waiting like 11 years to be the lead on TES6,” he says. “Bruce [Nesmith] and I had been the co-leads on Skyrim. I think most people would call it a successful project, so I thought that it wasn’t unreasonable for me to think that I could be a successful lead on TES6. It wasn’t just my expectation—I had been told that that was going to happen.</p>

<p>Speaking a little on his vision for the game’s storyline and direction, Kuhlmann notes that he drew inspiration from the second Star Wars film, The Empire Strikes Back.</p>



<p>He’d wanted The Thalmor to be the villains that would end up conquering the day by the end of the campaign, paving the way for the next entrant in the series. To him, this was a welcome diversion from the typical storytelling Bethesda relies on.</p>



<p>Bethesda is currently working on Fallout 5, and the team hopes you play the game for many hours, potentially 600. Still, there is no release window for that game at this time. Todd Howard recently said that most employees are engaged with work on Elder Scrolls 6, while also claiming that Fallout is the game they’re working on the most.

<p>GOG’s Managing Director, Maciej Gołębiewski, has opened up about the current state of the gaming industry and the rise of always-online games, noting that it’s essential to discuss preservation and what a proper end-of-life cycle looks like in the current industry.</p>



<p>As more multiplayer games adopt always-online models, players are increasingly facing the reality that servers do not remain online forever. When games fail to meet developer expectations, some are shut down abruptly, even while they still have active communities. EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anthem-servers-to-be-shut-down-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently took Anthem’s servers offline</a> seven years after launch, and the company stated in its FAQ that because the game was designed to require an online connection, it is no longer playable.</p>



<h2 id="h-gog-s-managing-director-expresses-concern">GOG’s Managing Director Expresses Concern</h2>



<p>Digital storefront GOG is very dedicated to game preservation and launched a program in 2024 to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gog-launches-game-preservation-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preserve classic titles.</a> Now, GOG’s Maciej Gołębiewski is weighing in on what preservation looks like in the modern age of always-online games, telling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-weighs-complicated-riddle-of-multiplayer-game-preservation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer </a>that he’s afraid there may be fewer games for gamers to play in the future because of the expectation of maintaining servers for decades.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“If we put too many barriers on game creators and what the end-of-life cycle looks like, we might get fewer games,” he said, “because people will be scared of ‘okay now I need to put up the funds to create it, promote it, and then upkeep it for 10 years, 20 years, because the regulator said so’. That might in turn cause there to be fewer cool games for gamers. I don’t have the perfect answer yet, but it’s good that the discussion is taking place.”</p>

<p>In one example of an attempt to address this problem, The Crew 2 recently received an update that introduced a hybrid mode and enabled offline play, hopefully ensuring long-term access to the game.
