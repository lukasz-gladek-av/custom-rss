<p>The Coalition has given a brief but promising update on Gears of War: E-Day, which it claims is its ‘most ambitious’ title. While no release date has been announced for the prequel, it seems fans will have much to look forward to in 2026.</p>



<p>The Gears of War series, also known as Gears, has been going strong since 2006, almost 20 years ago. Following a ragtag group of soldiers, you’ll shoot (and chainsaw) your way through the parasitic Locust. With five titles, including a few spin-offs, the third-person shooter has become a staple for Xbox. While no sequel to 2019’s Gears 5 has been revealed, a prequel starring Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago, called Gears of War: E-Day, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-official-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced in 2024</a>. A 2026 launch is still on the books and, now, the team has provided some new comments on the anticipated title.</p>







<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day-to-play-like-gears-but-play-like-new-says-developers">Gears of War: E-Day to “Play Like Gears, But Play Like New”, Says Developers</h2>

<iframe title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine) - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EC20gLfUHeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/18/xbox-bethesda-blizzard-activision-king-2025-games-thank-you/#gow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">year-end article from Xbox</a>, many of the teams of 2025’s biggest games, like The Outer Worlds 2 and South of Midnight, discussed them and what they are looking forward to in 2026. One of the interviewees was Mike Crump, Studio Head at The Coalition for Gears of War: Reloaded. Asked about what the studio is looking forward to the most in 2026, Crump said the following:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Next year marks the 20th anniversary of Gears of War, and we can’t think of a bigger way to celebrate than with the release of&nbsp;Gears of War: E-Day</strong>,” states Clump in the interview. “<strong>This is our most ambitious game yet, entirely built from scratch in Unreal Engine 5 to feel like Gears and play like new. This is a return to our roots as Marcus &amp; Dom face the Locust for the first time ever. It’s the best place to jump into the Gears universe and we can’t wait to share more next year.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As mentioned before, Gears of War: E-Day is planning to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-release-window-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime</a> in 2026. No gameplay or additional trailers have been released since 2024. Still, the team at The Coalition and People Can Fly seem adamant the game will live up to expectations. Seeing as Gears 5 was an ambitious title in the series, E-Day may be what fans have been waiting for.</p>

<h2>How To Play Wordle</h2>



<p>Wordle is a simple but addictive word puzzle. Each day, players have to <strong>guess a five-letter word answer</strong> in no more than six attempts. After each guess:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Green letters</strong> are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a popular online trend.</p>



<p>Wordle can only be played on the New York Times website. There is currently no app for you to download the official game.</p>

<li><strong>Hint 2:</strong> You’re far more likely to see it in <strong>religious or historical writing</strong> than in everyday speech.</li>



<li><strong>Hint 3:</strong> It’s often mentioned alongside <strong>other symbolic items</strong> like Gold and Frankincense, rather than standing alone.</li>



<li><strong>Hint 4:</strong> The word looks unusual because it relies more on <strong>consonant repetition</strong> than vowel variety.</li>
</ul>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <guid>1387480</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Former Larian employees have responded to the CEO’s recent comments about AI, with one saying, “Show your employees some respect.” </p>



<p>Larian has been a hot topic in the news lately and not always for the best reasons. Last week, we saw Larian reveal <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divinity</a>, which brought some hype into the fan base. However, a few days ago, the Larian boss’s comments on AI caught fire on social media, and now former employees are responding. </p>







<h2 id="h-former-employee-claims-larian-boss-is-lying-about-staff-being-okay-with-ai-use">Former Employee Claims Larian Boss is Lying About Staff Being Okay with AI Use</h2>



<p>For a few days, Larian has been taking flak for using AI. Swen Vincke, the founder, stated, “I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it.” Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/show-your-employees-some-respect-former-baldurs-gate-3-and-divinity-devs-claim-larian-heads-are-lying-about-people-being-okay-with-using-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, a former employee has responded to the comment, stating that Larian is lying about everyone in the company being okay with it. </p>



<p>Anne Méthot, a former QA tester at Larian on <a href="https://x.com/GangstHannah/status/2000958281917866440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), has stated that, after working at Larian, they aren’t surprised by the new AI stuff, alleging that Swen Vincke is “lying about people being okay with it”. Another former employee, Selena Tobin, has also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that they “loved working at Larian studios until AI”. Tobin asked the developers to show their employees some respect, as they are world-class and “do not need AI assistance to come up with amazing ideas.” </p>



<p>Swen Vincke has already posted on X to say they aren’t “pushing hard” to replace concept artists with AI. A new post on <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> also states that their “successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make. In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.” Larian will hold an Ask Me Anything after the holiday break to provide more insight. </p>

<p>Ubisoft has announced a new 60 FPS update for The Division on PS5, making the game better suited for current-gen consoles. </p>



<p>In 2025, all we have heard about the Tom Clancy’s Division franchise is details on the sequel. Last we heard about the game was in August, when we received the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-year-7-roadmap-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 7 Roadmap</a>, and it was also revealed that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘saved’ by a team of 5 developers</a>. Now, towards the end of the year, a new announcement has arrived for the 2016 The Division game. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-division-now-has-60-fps-on-ps5">The Division Now Has 60 FPS on PS5</h2>



<p>Revealed by a new post on <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Tom Clancy’s The Division is the latest 2016 title to receive a current-gen update in 2025. However, the new update only increases the framerate to 60 FPS; there are no details about the resolution. The blog post states that players can expect smoother gameplay in the snow-covered streets of New York thanks to the enhanced performance. </p>

This update brings smoother gameplay to the snow-covered streets of New York where it all began. <a href="https://t.co/NGWkp0brvn">pic.twitter.com/NGWkp0brvn</a></p>— Tom Clancy's The Division (@TheDivisionGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Tom Clancy’s The Division centers on a deadly pandemic that has struck New York City. You are part of a unit of tactical agents that are trained to operate independently to save society. The title features a massive co-op campaign, where you can join other agents to fight the outbreak in Manhattan, across a wide range of story missions and open-world activities. The map features dynamic events, loot, and crafting of new weapons and gear. Players also have tons of different modes to play through, including ncursions, Underground, Survival, the Dark Zone, and more. </p>
