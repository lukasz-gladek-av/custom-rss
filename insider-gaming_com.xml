            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In an interview with CNBC, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick had some comments regarding the console/PC debate. In fact, it seems he’s taken a side in the whole debacle.</p>







<p>The divide between PC and console gaming has been a rather long one. Exclusives on one, better quality on the other, it all seems to go back and forth. Take-Two, known for publishing the Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K, has been on both fronts. Every month, it seems the company finds itself on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling list for consoles</a> for its catalog of sports games. While it’ll take a while for the company to see a bigger pay day with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6 delayed</a>, it seems the CEO has some thoughts on the console/PC divide.</p>



<h2 id="h-zelnick-says-business-is-moving-towards-open-to-pc-in-recent-interview">Zelnick Says “Business is Moving Towards Open” to PC in Recent Interview</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick sat down with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC’s Squawk Box</a> for an interview on gaming. While on the topic of console gaming, Zelnick stated,</p>



<p>“<strong>I think it’s moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed</strong>,” says Zelnick. “<strong>But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen — that’s never going away.</strong>”</p>



<p>His comments do come at a convenient time, as Valve announced the upcoming console, the Steam Machine, which can play Steam games on your TV. Similarly, Xbox and Microsoft have veered a bit towards PC gamers, as recent statements from figures in the company indicate a change in tone from consoles. Weirdly, Take-Two’s biggest upcoming release, Grand Theft Auto 6, has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-will-gta-6-release-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not been announced for PC</a>. Its last entry, Grand Theft Auto 5, didn’t see a PC release until two years after launching in 2013. In any case, it seems the company may be gearing to open up with PC gaming more than ever.</p>







<p>What do you think of Zelnick’s comments? Do you think PC is the way to go? Or is console better? Do you think GTA 6 is going to PC?

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill Townfall Release Date Possibly Leaked]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a storefront leak, Silent Hill Townfall is coming in early 2025. Furthermore, even before we’ve seen gameplay, we know when it’s releasing.</p>







<p>Announced all the way back in 2022, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-transmission-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill Townfall</a> is a collaboration between Konami and Annapurna Interactive. Not much is known about the project outside of a cryptic announcement video from the Silent Hill Transmission presentation. Many had a bad feeling the project wouldn’t see the light of day, as the series hadn’t been doing well, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/entire-annapurna-interactive-team-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Annapurna layoffs</a>. However, right at the prime of the franchise, with Silent Hill 2 Remake and Silent Hill f being massive successes, it seems it’s not too far off. </p>



<h2 id="h-silent-hill-townfall-possibly-releasing-march-26-2026-according-to-storefront-leak">Silent Hill Townfall Possibly Releasing March 26, 2026, According to Storefront Leak</h2>

<iframe title="SILENT HILL: TOWNFALL | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ccYsjz_EtQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from e-shop Liverpool Mexico, which showed Silent Hill Townfall and a release date of March 26, 2026. Unfortunately, the listing in question has since been deleted, though <a href="https://cdaction.pl/newsy/silent-hill-townfall-z-nieodlegla-premiera-meksykanski-sklep-potwierdza-plotki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polish outlet CD Action</a> managed to screenshot it beforehand. Prominent Silent Hill figure <a href="https://x.com/Rashmunchel/status/1990457427565715645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rachel Ashmun</a> also credited the listing on Twitter/X, lending a bit more leverage to it.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that Konami and Annapurna have not released anything official yet regarding Silent Hill Townfall, so take the leak with a grain of salt. Still, the timing does come at a mighty convenient time. On November 20th, Xbox is holding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-partner-preview-confirmed-for-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partner Preview</a> at 10 am PT/1 pm EST. One of the games heavily rumored, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and even leaked</a>, for the presentation is Silent Hill 2 Remake. The title, helmed by Bloober Team, is a timed PlayStation exclusive that, if true, will come to Xbox Series X|S on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 21st</a>. Perhaps we may get a double feature for Silent Hill then? We’ll have to wait and see!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sandfall Interactive’s Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has broken a very impressive record following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025 nominations</a>. The game, nominated for Game of the Year, leads a stellar list of other contenders, including Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and Hollow Knight Silksong.</p>







<p>Releasing earlier this year, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 blew many out of the water. Not only did it look gorgeous for an indie game, but the turn-based RPG combat felt reminiscent of classic Final Fantasy and Persona. It quickly became <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-now-2025s-highest-rated-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025’s best-reviewed title</a> for a time before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> overtook it a month ago. Still, it was pretty clear the game would make an appearance at The Game Awards in big categories. However, its nominations prove it’s showing up in a huge way, more than any other year.</p>



<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-record-12-nominations-at-the-game-awards-2025">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Gets Record 12 Nominations at The Game Awards 2025</h2>

Perhaps the biggest of all was Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The indie title managed to snag a record-breaking 12 nominations, including three in one category. Previously, the record holders were 2020’s The Last of Us Part 2 and 2023’s God of War: Ragnarok, which each had 11 nominations.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 joins Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Hollow Knight Silksong, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Hades 2 for Game of the Year. Either way, we’ll find out who takes home the title on December 11th when The Game Awards 2025 goes live.</p>

<p>The Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.2.0 patch notes have released ahead of its November 18th release. The notes include a new map and mode, aim assist features, and plenty of bug fixes.</p>







<p>The update plans to add a ton of stuff and fixes to Battlefield 6. In terms of new content, a Southern California-inspired map, called Eastwood, will be available. Included with the map is a new limited-time mode focused on destruction aptly called Sabotage, as well as two new weapons: the M357 Sidearm and DB-12 Shotgun. </p>



<p>As for fixes, the biggest change addressed in the Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.2.0 patch notes is to the Aim Assist. According to the developers, it has reverted the tuning back to how it was during the Open Beta. Other fixes include weapon accuracy, gadget improvements, and smoother responses for controllers. </p>
