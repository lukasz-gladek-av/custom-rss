<p>Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter, is getting a major update tomorrow (1.0.2) that will introduce the long-awaited Escape from Duckov collaboration content. We still don’t know what that looks like, but it marks the first cross-game collaboration in a hot minute for Escape from Tarkov and Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Battlestate announced an impending outage that will take Tarkov offline for up to six hours tomorrow, February 10.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-s-first-major-collaboration-is-coming">Tarkov’s First Major Collaboration is Coming</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, the teams at both Team Soda (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-duckov/" id="2714">Escape from Duckov</a>) and Battlestate Games (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a>) have been teasing a cross-platform collaboration. It promises to introduce crossover content in <strong>both games</strong>, despite the former title being a <strong>parody </strong>of the latter.</p>



<p>It looks like Escape from Tarkov’s maps will be replicated in Escape from Duckov, and the duck-themed characters from Duckov will surface <strong>in some way </strong>in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tomorrow, February 10 at 7:00 AM GMT / 2:00 AM EST we are planning to install patch 1.0.2.0 for Escape from Tarkov. The installation will take between 4 and 6 hours, but may be extended if required. The game will be unavailable during this time.</p><p>The official websites… <a href="https://t.co/lkoojEGgyk">pic.twitter.com/lkoojEGgyk</a></p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/2020890440648573414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>We have no idea how long this collaboration is set to run for, but it’s likely to be a limited-time event that will expire after a few days. As with past Escape from Tarkov LTMs, it’s likely players will have achievements, items, and other rewards to unlock that, if they don’t get them now, they’ll never see them again.</p>



<p>You can expect Escape from Tarkov to be offline tomorrow from 7 AM GMT to at least 11 AM GMT, and <strong>most likely </strong>until 1 PM GMT. In true Tarkov style, you should also anticipate an extension to the maintenance window. To play it safe, perhaps wait until around 2 PM GMT for Escape from Tarkov to come back up.</p>
