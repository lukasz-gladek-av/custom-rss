<p>Schedule 1 attracted several hundred thousand players in its first week alone. The developer has outlined a consistent line of plans and future content updates for Schedule 1 through a detailed roadmap.</p>



<p>If you took one look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> as an outsider, you’d think it was a South Park-inspired game about drugs. The art style could sway this argument, but Schedule 1 is big and beastly enough to cement its own identity and status as one of 2025’s biggest indie titles. </p>



<p>Developer TVGS is releasing a lot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-i-continues-soar-patch-notes-fifth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patches</a> to keep the experience smooth and steady. But Schedule 1’s future is looking very bright, and we’ve looked at what we’ve all got to look forward to.</p>

<p>Here’s a look at the developer’s ideas for Schedule 1 and which category they fall under. We love the transparency, and it means if you’re enjoying Schedule 1, you have tangible reasons to keep coming back.</p>

<h2 id="h-schedule-1-roadmap-explained">Schedule 1 Roadmap Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The official Schedule 1 Trello board has an extensive list of “Monthly Update Ideas and “Smaller Additions/Improvements.” These are listed under the “Schedule 1 Roadmap,” and each list features an assortment of new activities, gameplay ideas, mechanics, and quality-of-life ideas.</strong></p>



<p>An “In Progress” column also exists. As of writing, this is empty, so we presume TVGS is focusing on either taking some downtime to recover from the overwhelming start, hasn’t updated the <a href="https://trello.com/b/VQQpru3F/schedule-i-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schedule 1 Trello</a> yet, or is getting ready to work on a new update.</p>



<p>We’ll keep checking in to see what new ideas are floating around for Schedule 1.</p>

<p>Can Schedule 1 keep up its phenomenal early momentum? Or will it succumb to fatigue and the novelty wearing off?

<p>Steam has been flooded by players desperate to play Schedule 1—a sleeper breakthrough. It’s shot to popularity on PC, but we’re here to see if you can play it on PlayStation or Xbox consoles.</p>



<p>It’s amazing what the power of the grapevine and word of mouth can do. 2025’s indie sensation was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> for the longest time, but in the blink of an eye, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-i-continues-soar-patch-notes-fifth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> kindly asked it to move over. Your meteoric ascendancy to head of Hyland Point is fueled by drugs, and the unique gameplay has turned more than a few heads.</p>



<p>Its player count has dominated the top of Steam Charts for a while, so let’s see if PlayStation and Xbox users can get in on the deal.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-schedule-1-on-ps5">Can You Play Schedule 1 on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This isn’t sus. Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As per the Schedule 1 Discord, you can’t play the crime simulator on PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 as it stands.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1256767987873091664/1267444919295803544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schedule 1 Discord</a> is home to all answers and questions about the game. But one that pops up frequently is if the title is lining up a PS4 or PS5 experience anytime soon.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the answer is a definite no for now. This might change in the future, though, depending on the success of the indie title—although if it carries on this way it won’t be “indie” for much longer!</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-schedule-1-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Schedule 1 on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s also bad news for Microsoft fans as Schedule 1 isn’t available on Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>Let’s head back to the Schedule 1 Discord for a second. An official question is posed asking: “Will it (Schedule I) be available on Xbox/Playstation?” The developer has answered this: “<strong>Unfortunately not on release, but potentially in the future, depending on how gracious Sony/Microsoft are.</strong>“</p>



<p>I’m not entirely sure what they mean by “how gracious Sony/Microsoft are.” This might relate to the nature of the content and not allowing it on the PS or Xbox Store, but I feel this is unlikely, as we’ve seen worse. Regardless, like any indie hit on Steam, the initial buzz for Schedule 1 is outrageous, and it’s a huge success.</p>



<p>If the game can buck the trend of seeing its initial popularity disappear and become a long-standing hit in the vein of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/among-us-animated-series-trailer-revealed-during-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Us</a>, it would be <em>dope </em>to see it on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later on.</p>

<p>Inzoi has barely been out, and it’s already got the famous WickedWhims mod seen in The Sims. The user-created content is designed to let you experience Inzoi in a more unrestricted and uncensored fashion, and it was only a matter of time.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-sims-25th-birthday-bundle-all-included-dlc-for-the-sims-1-and-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sims</a> has always taken a lighthearted approach to intimate human activity. The action is usually pixelated and presented in a comedic yet casual fashion. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> is 2025’s realistic take on everyday life and features the usual hustle and bustle of existence: Jobs, Taxes, Death, and the creation of life.</p>



<p>It also keeps any intimate moments well hidden. But if you install the WickedWhims mod, you might want to play privately. </p>



<h2 id="h-controversial-the-sims-wickedwhims-mod-arrives-in-inzoi">Controversial The Sims WickedWhims Mod Arrives in Inzoi</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The mod gives you action more intense than this. Credit to Inzoi Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>X user <a href="https://x.com/WickedWhims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TURBODRIVER</a> is back at it again with mods. They are the creator of the WickedWhims mods—as seen in The Sims. In Inzoi, it allows you to “Undress anything you want at any moment without censorship getting in the way.”</p>



<p>Furthermore, you can: “Get on a bed, or on a sofa, or the floor, or anywhere you want to get freaky with anybody you want.” The mod promises fully interactive animations and realistic interactions between Zois. This is only possible because the game doesn’t support <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-inzoi-have-denuvo-denuvo-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deunvo</a>.</p>



<p>The official mod’s site has four simple instructions required to install the mod. Once you’ve done this, your copy of Inzoi becomes steamier and hotter in a matter of seconds! Don’t say we didn’t warn you.</p>



<p>Inzoi has already been in the headlines of late as it was discovered you could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-lets-you-run-over-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run over children</a>. This was later addressed by the developer who claimed the action to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-developers-say-ability-to-run-over-children-was-a-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bug, and it was patched</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remake-release-tomorrow-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remake-could-be-released-tomorrow-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1151745/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remake-release-tomorrow-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed by an insider that the Oblivion remake that has been the talk of the town for a while could suddenly be released <strong>tomorrow</strong>. Recently, it was suggested by <strong>another </strong>rumour that the Oblivion remake would be released ‘sooner than expected’, and April was touted as being the month when the reveal would take place.</p>



<p>However, this all-new claim suggests that the game will just be dropped without warning. It’s time to take out the salt bowl and grab a pinch, folks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-our-dreams">In Our Dreams</h2>



<p>The slew of rumours that have emerged regarding the Oblivion remake haven’t been all that wild, but we’re yet to see <strong>anything </strong>about the project. Per the claims, it’s in development at Virtuous Games and will be a full-blown rebuild of the 2006 title in Unreal Engine 5. It has been suggested that considerable upgrades have also been made to the game’s mechanics and combat systems.</p>



<p>It sounds great, but we don’t know a thing about it, including which platforms it’ll be released on, how much it’ll cost, and <strong>what it will look like</strong>.</p>



<p>On March 13, Nate The Hate posted on social media that he was expecting ‘news’ on the Oblivion remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-coming-sooner-than-expected-its-claimed/">to surface in April</a> and that the release date for the game could be earlier than ‘the original June target’.</p>



<p>April is earlier than June, right?</p>



<p>Now, Detective Seeds has posted on Twitter with an all-new claim:</p>



<div><article><p><span>I believe the Oblivion remake is going to release end of next week, likely Thursday April 3rd.  Then 13 days later Indiana jones on the 16th on PS5, and then 13 days later forza horizon 5 on 29th on PS5.</span></p></article></div>







<p>He expanded in the comments, covering his tracks slightly by placing the responsibility of the rumour on an undisclosed source, explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is a little iffy if it is going to be this week or next. They were confident in it coming though.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that being said, we’re not <strong>really </strong>any closer to getting the truth. It could be tomorrow, it could be next week, or it could be June. Strangely, nothing has been revealed just yet, but a UE5 Elder Scrolls game, even a remake, would be a <strong>very welcome arrival </strong>right now.</p>



<p>Do you think the Oblivion remake rumours are real? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-international-2025-schedule-format-and-structure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The International is one of the most prestigious esports events in history. It has boasted some of the largest prize pools in competitive gaming, and it draws in millions of viewers every year. It’s considered the pinnacle of the industry by many, and it’s set to surface again in 2025.</p>



<p>Valve has outlined the schedule and format for The International 2025, but more granular details are yet to be revealed. This page will be updated as the information is released by Valve, but for now, you can read on to learn about The International 2025 schedule and format.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-road-to-the-international-2025">The Road to The International 2025</h2>



<p>Valve has highlighted that The Road to The International will start on Thursday, September 4 and will run until September 7. It’ll include two Swiss rounds and their successive elimination roads, and it’ll lead to eight teams out of the sixteen invited being eliminated.</p>



<p>The remaining eight teams will advance to the arena environment for The International proper.</p>



<p>Here’s how The Road to The International <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/536597286667419796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will work in 2025</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This year, The Road to The International starts with a five-round Swiss bracket: Over the first three days, sixteen teams will play best-of-three matches against other teams with the same series record (a 2:0 team will face another 2:0 team, a 1:3 team will face another 1:3 team, etc.). A fourth series win will cause that team to automatically advance to The International; a fourth loss will cause that team to be eliminated.</p>



<p>After five rounds of Swiss, the three teams with four wins will have secured their spot in The International and the three teams with four losses will have been eliminated. The ten remaining teams will face-off in a special elimination round (strongest against weakest) with the five winners advancing to the International and the five losers being eliminated.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-the-international-2025-schedule">The International 2025 Schedule</h2>



<p>This year’s The International will start on Thursday, September 11. It’ll unravel in the arena over a four-day window, with the Grand Finasl taking place on Sunday, September 14.</p>



<p>The eight teams that make it to The International will compete in front of a grand crowd in Barclays Arena, with the winner claiming an undisclosed prize pool and lifting the Aegis.</p>



<h2 id="h-faqs">FAQs</h2>



<h3 id="h-where-is-the-international-2025">Where is The International 2025?</h3>



<p>The International 2025 will take place in the Barclays Arena in Hamburg, Germany. It’s a top venue with a capacity of 15,000, and it’ll likely sell out very fast as The International 2025 approaches.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-international-2025-prize-pool">What is The International 2025 Prize Pool?</h3>



<p>The prize pool is yet to be determined for The International 2025. Last year’s tournament had a pool of $2.7 million, but in 2021, the record was set when the prize pool reached $40 million. Since then, the pool has decreased rapidly, but the expectation is that it’ll be <strong>at least </strong>$2.5 million this year.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-many-teams-are-at-the-international-2025">How Many Teams Are at The International 2025?</h3>



<p>The Road to The International starts with sixteen invited teams, but the elimination brackets will remove eight of them. There will be eight teams that make it to The International 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-which-team-is-the-favourite-to-win-the-international-2025">Which Team is the Favourite to Win The International 2025?</h3>



<p>It’s tough to gauge the competition this early on. The most recent winner of The Invitational was Team Liquid, but for the last two tournaments, Gaimin Gladiators have claimed a second-place spot. Could this be the year for the European organisation to finally win?</p>
