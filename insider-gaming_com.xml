<p>If you’ve been waiting to play Cities: Skylines 2 until it finally releases on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, you may just have to move on to something else. In a  new update posted on Wednesday, it doesn’t appear that Cities: Skylines 2 is anywhere close to releasing on console.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/542225339665875067?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new update</a> ahead of the franchise’s 10th birthday, developer Paradox Interactive said that the team at Colossal Order is making “steady progress” on the console version. They added that a “core focus” has been on performance and stability improvements for the game. That said, there is “more things” that need to be worked on in order to get the game to “the level of quality and the experience we want for you as our players.”</p>



<p>“We know many of you are eagerly awaiting the console release, but to set expectations clearly: we will not have a release before summer,” Paradox said. “We want to avoid any premature estimates and instead commit to providing you with reliable information when we’re closer to a launch-ready state.”</p>



<p>They closed the console-specific update saying that the goal remains the same, and that’s bringing Cities: Skylines 2 to console in the “best possible shape”.</p>



<p>Originally planned for a release in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-release-date-set-for-october-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2023</a> alongside the PC version, the console edition of the city builder was delayed to 2024 at the last minute. Since then, it has continued to see delays as the developers work around what has been said to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-console-delay-is-due-to-hardware-limitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware limitations</a>.</p>



<p>When do you think Cities: Skylines 2 will release on console? Let us know in the comments below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with Variety, Neil Druckmann suggested that The Last of Us might be over and done with. He said, ‘Don’t bet on there being more Last of Us.’ It’s a rather ambiguous statement, as it’s not immediately clear if he’s saying there are no more Last of Us games coming <strong>now</strong> or if The Last of Us Part III will be the final game in the series.</p>



<p>In April, the second season of the award-winning HBO series will drop, more than two years after the first season arrived.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-could-be-it">‘This Could Be It’</h2>



<p>The Last of Us was released in 2013 and has since been remastered and re-released no fewer than 743 times across multiple platforms and generations. In 2020, the follow-up title – aptly named The Last of Us Part II – was released. It was a controversial title in many ways, but it was still a masterpiece of a game that turned heads worldwide.</p>



<p>On April 3, Part II’s newest iteration, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, will be released on PC.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent segment with Variety</a>, Neil Druckmann talked about the second season of the Emmy Award-winning show. He sat down with Craig Mazin, with whom he has pioneered the creation of one of the best live-action adaptations in gaming history.</p>



<p>In one section, Druckmann answers the question about the existence of The Last of Us Part III, which has been rumoured on and off but never confirmed. When asked about the possibility of the game surfacing, he said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was waiting for this question.</p>



<p>I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us’. This could be it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s ever so slightly ambiguous. It could mean that there’s nothing more planned after a third game, or it could mean that we’re stuck with a two-game series that’ll never again see the light of day.</p>



<p>In December 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-officially-cancelled/">an online multiplayer game</a> set in The Last of Us’ universe was cancelled, but in 2024, the studio ‘teased’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-teases-new-chapter-for-the-last-of-us/">a new chapter</a> in the franchise. That was before Naughty Dog appeared at The Game Awards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/">to reveal Intergalactic</a>, an all-new IP that came completely out of left field.</p>



<p>Do you think The Last of Us should end on Part II? It’s no big secret that the team plans to drag out the television series and cover the second game across <strong>two </strong>seasons, so we’ve got Last of Us content in the pipeline for a while, but would you rather play it than watch it?</p>
