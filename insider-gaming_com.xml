<p>Take-Two Interactive has laid off around 30% of staff at Cloud Chamber, the studio behind the next BioShock game, reports state.</p>



<p>Already a decade into development, the next BioShock game was due to be released in late 2026 or early 2027, but it will be delayed further, with the decision made to give the game more time in development.</p>



<p>More than 80 jobs were cut in the changes, with the studio said to have around 250 employees before the layoffs, representing a huge portion of the workforce.</p>

<p>The details are shared by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTcxNDU0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzE5MzQ1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUIxVEZHUFFRN1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.zVepbosqQPRpkHaMvUcaBAlKk73_0IkMGOvNKaKU6mE&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, which includes an email sent to staff by 2K President David Ismailer that states a decision was made to “rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game.”</p>



<p>This resulted in “reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,” although BioShock is already one of the longest-running productions in gaming history.</p>



<p>Plans for the next BioShock instalment began in 2014, the year after the release of BioShock Infinite, though there were significant changes as Irrational Games, originally at the helm, was shattered by 2K after director Ken Levine left to start a smaller studio within Take-Two.</p>



<p>The report from Bloomberg says the trouble didn’t end there, with Certain Affinity taking the reins and working on the game for roughly two years, and a deal to acquire the studio fell through. Take-Two then decided to start an in-house studio to lead development, hiring in 2017 for what would become Cloud Chamber.</p>



<p>It’s not clear what the plan is now for the next BioShock game, though it’s clear that there won’t be a release window anytime soon, as the long wait will rumble on.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to get plenty of attention, and with the launch of a new limited-time game mode, several balance changes have also been made.</p>



<p>Now deep into Season 3.5, players will be forgiven for starting to look ahead to Season 4 and wondering what’s in store, but the launch of Klyntar’s Resource Rumble mode should keep you busy for the time being.</p>



<p>It’s worth keeping on top of all the balance changes, however, so you’re familiar with all the buffs and nerfs. We’ve got all the details for you here.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-marvel-rivals-august-20-buffs-amp-nerfs">All Marvel Rivals August 20 Buffs &amp; Nerfs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Buffed. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Marvel Rivals balance changes on August 20 impact three heroes, with Blade, recently added at the start of Season 3.5, given a buff, while Human Torch and Loki receive a nerf.</strong></p>



<p>Blade has boosted Lifesteal gained during Bloodline Awakening, boosted from 60% to 65%, while the self-healing reduction has been lowered from 40% to 35%.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Human Torch’s Flame Field damage over time has been reduced to 20/s from 25/s, with Pyro-Prison damage also reduced from 50/s to 40/s.</p>



<p>In the Strategist department, Loki’s Mythical Missile damage dealt by the God of Mischief and his illusions has been reduced from 30 to 25, although healing for teammates remains unchanged.</p>



<p>All other characters in the game remain untouched, though don’t expect it to remain that way for long as the big end of season balance patch is now just a few weeks out.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-marvel-rivals-version-20250821-patch-notes">Full Marvel Rivals Version 20250821 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>The full patch notes are below, as shared on the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250820/41667_1254957.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-duelist">Duelist</h3>



<p><strong>Blade</strong></p>



<p>The Daywalker’s resilience just slightly leveled up. Blade’s got more staying power for those midnight brawls!</p>



<p>– Increase Lifesteal gained during Bloodline Awakening from 60% to 65%. Reduce self-healing reduction from 40% to 35%.</p>



<p><strong>Human Torch</strong></p>



<p>Johnny Storm’s heat is still on, but his flame’s been dialed back just enough for ground heroes to catch their breath!</p>



<p>– Reduce Flame Field (right-click on terrain) Damage Over Time from 25/s to 20/s.</p>



<p>– Reduce Pyro-Prison Damage Over Time from 50/s to 40/s.</p>



<h3 id="h-strategist">Strategist</h3>



<p><strong>Loki</strong></p>



<p>The God of Mischief and his illusions are a tad less punishing!</p>



<p>– Reduce Mystical Missile damage dealt by Loki and his illusions to enemies from 30 to 25. (Healing for teammates remains unchanged.)</p>

<p>Skate made an appearance during the Future Games Show at Gamescom, with the big announcement being a tease for a major update next week as Early Access looms.</p>



<p>The EA title, relaunching the franchise after a 15-year hiatus, has been in Closed Alpha stage for months, but with the end of the summer looming large, big news is seemingly on the horizon.</p>



<p>In a developer interview shown at Future Games Show, details were shared about development, including the in-depth parkour features, with a sign-off to keep eyes peeled for a big announcement next week.</p>



<h2 id="h-skate-poised-for-big-update-ahead-of-early-access">Skate Poised For Big Update Ahead of Early Access</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Early Access is coming. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The comments at Future Games Show align with a recent <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1957843556678136288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) directed to Skate Insiders, informing them that maintenance will take place from today, August 20, until August 26, leaving the game inaccessible.</p>



<p>With Summer 2025 stated as the release for Early Access, and just a few weeks left until we tick into September and leave the Summer behind, next week’s big update could well be the launch into Early Access.</p>



<p>Skate will be released on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC, though it’s not clear yet whether the title will eventually make its way onto Nintendo Switch 2, nor do we know when a full launch will be.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on Skate’s social media channels for the big announcement next week, which we’ll also cover here at Insider Gaming.</p>
