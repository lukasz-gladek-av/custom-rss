<p>The voice actor for James Bond in 007 First Light has been revealed after a long bout of speculation and fan casting.</p>



<p>With IO Interactive taking over and making a story for a James Bond just getting started in the spy business, many have been wondering who would be taking on the role with this young Bond, now set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Not only have we <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-reveal-how-hitman-has-influenced-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gotten a good look at gameplay</a>, but the voice behind the spy himself has been announced. Here is who the voice actor is for James Bond in 007 First Light.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-james-bond-in-007-first-light">Who Voices James Bond in 007 First Light?</h2>

<p><strong>The voice actor for James Bond in 007 First Light is Patrick Gibson.</strong></p>



<p>He is a 30-year-old Irish actor who was born in London. While not the most recognizable name you will hear, Gibson is probably best known for playing a younger Dexter Morgan in <em>Dexter: Original Sin</em>, which is a prequel series. Having him as a just-starting-out James Bond kind of fits in perfectly.</p>



<p>For more background on Patrick Gibson, you can check out <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2617600/?ref_=mv_close" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his IMDb page</a> to see if there are any other shows or movies you can recognize him in, but we are unaware of the other projects he’s been in. With all of that being said, 007 First Light is the first video game acting role that Gibson has had. So far, his voice acting seems to be done pretty well, and we think he sounds like he fits the part perfectly.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-007-first-light-s-james-bond-canon">Is 007 First Light’s James Bond Canon?</h2>



<p><strong>No, the James Bond in 007 First Light is not canon to the overall James Bond story.</strong></p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/technology/gaming/007-first-light-isnt-canon-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">speaking with Radio Times</a>, Jonathan Lacaille, the franchise director at IO Interactive, said that while a lot of what is included in the game, including the scar on James’ cheek, is from the novels, the things that happen here are not connected to what is currently in production with Amazon MGM, instead, it will “live alongside” those movies.</p>



<p>While Patrick Gibson’s James Bond isn’t considered canon, it’s still a really big name for him to be attached to. When you think of 007, you are usually linking some very big-time Hollywood actors to the role. Gibson can now say he stands alongside names like Daniel Craig, Pierce Brosnan, and Sean Connery, while delivering a very unique take on the character we have not seen before.</p>

<p>Do you think Patrick Gibson is a good choice to portray a younger James Bond? Is 007 First Light doing enough to stand out in your mind as a must-play game? Let us know in the comments or on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-insomniac-games%E2%80%99-wolverine-is-likely-to-be-at-playstation%E2%80%99s-next-state-of-play.1288170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming sources have revealed that Insomniac Games’ Wolverine is ready to be shown off for the first time officially since the 2021 PlayStation Showcase.</p>



<div><p>According to sources, who wished to remain anonymous as they couldn’t talk about company plans, PlayStation is currently planning its next State of Play event towards the end of September. </p><p>Other sources revealed that Insomniac Games’ Wolverine is “almost certainly” going to be at the event, as the production of its next trailer has now been completed. If the game doesn’t appear at State of Play, then the trailer will undoubtedly be released in the next few months, with The Game Awards being the next likely candidate.</p></div>



<p>Insomniac Games’ Wolverine faced <span>some issues in development following a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-games-alleged-ransomware-attack/" target="_blank">ransomware attack</a>&nbsp;in December 2023, during </span>which employee information and a substantial amount of game footage&nbsp;leaked online. The hack resulted in some changes to the game’s plans, but the extent of these changes is currently unknown.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, neither PlayStation nor Insomniac Games has revealed when Wolverine is set to be released, but fingers crossed, an answer awaits us in the coming weeks. The game is currently slated to release exclusively on the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As for what else the next State of Play event could feature remains to be seen, but it’s likely to feature Bungie’s upcoming ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-bungie-befre-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>‘, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroidvania God of War</a> (Insider Gaming has it on good authority a mainline title is also in the works), Phantom Blade 0, and possibly even Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. If the State of Play is at the end of September as intended, then we’ll likely see a deeper dive into Ghost of Yotei, too, which releases on October 2, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhaven-lay-off-staff-2025/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dreamhaven is now the latest studio to lay off employees from staff, letting go of many staff members.</p>



<p>Today, the developer/publisher, who created Wildgate and Sunderfolk, announced layoffs made to the studio. As of writing, no specific number is out, but it’s likely a good chunk. Dreamhaven, led by ex-Blizzard cofounder Michael Morhaime, is a newer studio. The team only has a few titles under it, with the latest being the multiplayer shooter Wildgate. With that said, the layoffs are rather surprising and very unfortunate to those affected.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369069584328421376/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a LinkedIn post</a> by CEO Michael Morhaime, he announced the layoffs and some reassurance. He states in the post,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We made the hard decision to reduce the size of our company, with the primary impact on our Publishing group,” says Michael in the post. “These choices are never easy — they affect talented colleagues who have played a key role in building Dreamhaven’s foundation and supporting what has been an eventful year for us.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As mentioned before, the exact number of laid-off staff has not been disclosed. Regardless, it seems like support will be available, as severance packages and connections to future jobs have been given. As for its roster of games, the studio plans to continue to be supported, like Wildgate and Sunderfolk.</p>



<p>Already, this year has been full of layoffs and closures. Just last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-holds-layoffs/">Crystal Dynamics</a> let go of staff following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reportedly-could-have-been-saved-after-cancellation/">cancellation of Perfect Dark</a>. Hopefully, with new studios on the rise, those who lost their jobs can land back on their feet soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[007 First Light Deluxe Edition Details—Pre-Order Rewards Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-deluxe-edition-details-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-deluxe-edition-details%E2%80%94pre-order-rewards-explained.1288047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light has been revealed in full by IO Interactive, including the game’s release date and the editions that will be available when it drops. It’s coming next March, bringing a refreshing origin story to 007 fans worldwide. Following the release of a lengthy gameplay walkthrough, the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition was uncovered, benefits and all.</p>



<p>If you pre-order the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition, here’s everything you’ll get for your money…</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-007-first-light-deluxe-edition">What’s in the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition?</h2>



<p>Those who want a little more bling for their buck with 007 First Light will want to secure the Deluxe Edition, available to pre-order on PS5, Xbox Series, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>It’s an all-digital special edition, which means the bonuses and benefits are cosmetic-based.</p>



<p>Here’s what you get:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s four exclusive outfits, a new weapon skin for Bond’s trademark handgun, and a ‘Gleaming Skin Pack’ that equips 007’s earbuds, lighter, pen, and mobile phone with a gold skin.</p>



<p>I’m particularly interested in the exclusive outfits. I want to stalk my targets while trying to maintain my cover dressed as a skeleton in a top hat. I hope there’s some kind of lore to explain why that’s a thing. Perhaps I’ve missed a trick, but I’m hardly a James Bond fan!</p>



<h3 id="h-when-is-007-first-light-coming-out">When is 007 First Light Coming Out?</h3>



<p>During the gameplay reveal, IO Interactive also dropped the 007 First Light release date. The game is set to be released worldwide on March 27, 2026. That means there’s still quite a while to wait until it launches.</p>



<p>Are you going to pre-order the 007 First Light Deluxe Edition upgrade? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what your plans are.</p>
