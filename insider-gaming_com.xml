<p>The creator of the God of War series has shared his views on the recently released Sons of Sparta title, and it is evident he is not pleased with the game. </p>



<p>Fans of the God of War franchise had an exciting State of Play event last week. Santa Monica Studio not only confirmed that a God of War <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trilogy Remake is in development</a> but also revealed that <span>it&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank">shadow-dropped</a>&nbsp;a</span> game exploring Kratos’ childhood. However, the newly released title is facing harsh criticism from the series creator.</p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-trashed-by-original-series-creator">God of War: Sons of Sparta Trashed by Original Series Creator </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/god-of-war-creator-david-jaffe-sons-of-sparta-reaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, God of War series creator, David Jaffe, has gone off on Sons of Sparta on two separate occasions. The first time was after playing the game for just an hour, where he ended up saying things like “this is not God of War”, “who the f**k greenlit this”, and “who thought this is what the audience wants”. Jaffe also went on to say that the “production quality is not very good,” comparing it to games like Ninja Gaiden, Ragebound, and Neon Inferno.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The series creator released a 32-minute video echoing the sentiments expressed in the previous video. In this new video, he critiques the gameplay using clips from the title. It’s evident that the creator is dissatisfied with this installment, particularly because he feels that the character of Kratos, beloved by fans, is not accurately represented. Instead, players are presented with a different character. </p>

<p>The ongoing shortage of memory chips has reportedly led Sony to consider delaying the PS6’s release to 2028 or 2029.</p>



<p>The shortage of memory chips is impacting the gaming industry significantly. We have already seen GPU manufacturers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raise prices</a> or even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-reportedly-no-longer-in-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinue</a> certain products. <span>It seems <span>the impact will reach next-gen consoles as well, as first reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ram-prices-next-gen/" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a>&nbsp;and now corroborated by Bloomberg: RAM price increases will delay the next-gen console of PlayStation</span>.</span></p>







<h2 id="h-ps6-could-be-pushed-to-2029-and-switch-2-price-increase-being-contemplated">PS6 Could be Pushed to 2029 and Switch 2 Price Increase Being Contemplated</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> states that “people familiar with the company’s thinking” have revealed that Sony Group has thought of “pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029.” That’s not all; people familiar with Nintendo’s plans have also stated that the company “is also contemplating raising the price” of the Switch 2 in 2026. However, neither Sony nor Nintendo has officially commented on these plans. </p>



<p>When <span>discussing the impact of memory prices on current-gen consoles, Nintendo has already stated that it will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-will-carefully-evaluate-switch-2-price-increase-as-memory-costs-rise/" target="_blank">carefully” evaluate</a>&nbsp;Switch 2’s price amid&nbsp;</span>rising memory costs. Sony, on the other hand, has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5s-holiday-stock-wont-be-impacted-by-ram-shortages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 stocks won’t be affected</a> by memory shortages until the end of the holiday 2026 season. At the same time, PS6 and PlayStation handheld are claimed to have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-specs-playstation-handheld-impressive-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impressive memory specs</a>, so Sony seems to be in a pickle for their next-gen console. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Become is a Ballsy Indie Game That Has You Play as Sperm]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/become-game-ballsy-indie-sperm/</link>
            <guid>1437082</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>That’s right, the game you always wanted but never knew it is about to be made by two people. It’s called Become, and it tells the tale of a single sperm (called a spermatazoon) seeking to make his mark and fertilize an egg, accomplishing what he was put on this Earth (or in a pair of balls) to do.</p>



<p>It’s a third-person adventure-survival game that has been created by two developers, and it’s set to launch on Steam later this year. Needless to say, it’s <strong>ballsy</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-become-one-of-millions">Become One of Millions</h2>



<p>Become is a unique game that takes players and throws them into the role of a spermatazoon, hellbent on beating hundreds of millions of competitors to achieve the ultimate goal, kick-starting a new life. It has a few customization elements, a two-to-three-hour story, and impressive visuals, considering the whole game takes place inside… Well, you know.</p>



<p>Per the game’s blurb on Steam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Experience life’s fantastical journey as one of millions of sperm. Survive the microcosm dangers, wiggle, dash and compete through the human reproductive system and create new life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Become, players must navigate treacherous terrain, swimming through currents and upgrading themselves through the collection of sugars and proteins, all with the goal of being the hardiest and most efficient little swimmer.</p>



<p>It’s educational, too. The duo of developers has stressed that Become allows players to ‘learn about the reproductive microcosm’. However, it’s done in a way that isn’t as crude as you might think, as the disclaimer mentions nothing more than ‘humorous references to sperm and conception.’</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for Become:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Become - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hb4Pjyfs6IQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In a world of gargantuan AAA (and AAAA) games, Become might just be about to prove that size doesn’t matter, and you can still get a nice amount of bang for your buck by shooting out and giving this game a go. Who knows? The price for Become hasn’t been revealed just yet, but it shouldn’t be too much, all things considered.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Someone Just Completed Tarkov With the Worst Weapon Possible]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/someone-completed-tarkov-worst-weapon/</link>
            <guid>1437034</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Since November came around and Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0, hundreds of people have shared their accomplishments on social media regarding the game’s completion. With the introduction of 1.0, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlestate-games/" id="1450">Battlestate Games</a> added a campaign to Escape from Tarkov, which means the game can literally roll credits and give players one of four endings.</p>



<p>Recently, one user shared an intense revelation. They’ve managed to get <strong>the best ending </strong>in Escape from Tarkov while using what might be the game’s <strong>worst weapon</strong>, as long as you don’t count the Blicky as a true contender.</p>







<h2 id="h-terminal-toz-style">Terminal, TOZ-Style</h2>



<p>Hours ago, a YouTuber by the name of ‘Freakatoid’ shared the news that they’d completed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a> with the ‘Humanity’ ending <strong>while using a TOZ bolt-action shotgun</strong>. That’s right, the memeable weapon that’s typically wielded exclusively by the most bargain-basement, bottom-of-the-barrel scavs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It took Freaktoid more than five weeks of consecutive attempts (51 in total) to punch through Terminal while using the TOZ-106. Midway through the attempt spree, Freakatoid shared screenshots of their progress, including an insane image of a <strong>PvE run </strong>on Woods with the TOZ-106 that included the taking down of at least two PMCs, Partizan, Shturman, and his guards.</p>



<p>Okay, so it was in PvE, but it was with a gun that’s widely considered the worst weapon in Escape from Tarkov, which makes it commendable.</p>



<p>For reference, here’s the gun:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>However, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/" id="161469">completion of Escape from Tarkov</a> <strong>with </strong>the TOZ, a 20-gauge shotgun that at the most can be fitted with five-shot magazines and a range of 20/70 shells, was done on PvP. As you might know, Terminal is <strong>exclusively </strong>PvE right now, so it might render that concept moot, but nobody else is out here completing the game like this.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape From Tarkov: Toz Terminal Completion (Unedited)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q3ZgGQyl764?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>To get it done, Freakatoid used a dual-TOZ loadout, one loaded with a Vortex Razor scope and slugs for picking off enemies at range, while the other was stock with five-shot magazines and heavy buck shells for close-range encounters. He went in loaded for bear with a Ronin respirator mask and a 6B45 vest with tier-five plates, and a rig filled to the brim with heals and magazines.</p>



<p>In the comments under their post, Freakatoid was challenged to complete the game with a PM pistol, a small Marakov handgun that might work a little better as it can be fitted with an 84-round magazine.</p>



<p>Maybe that’s his next challenge; he certainly seems open to it.</p>







<p>Is this the most impressive Escape from Tarkov completion you’ve seen? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
