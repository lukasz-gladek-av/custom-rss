<p>There’s another leak surrounding the upcoming Intel Arc Battlemage graphics cards. According to a new report making the waves, at least one price for the Intel Battlemage has appeared online.</p>



<p>According to known leaker <a href="https://x.com/momomo_us/status/1861755473718108511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Momomo_us</a>, there will be an Intel Arc B580 Limited Edition GPU available when the new graphics cards launch. Based on the information found, the B580 Limited Edition will cost roughly $250. They’ve found it online for as low as $246 in some places, as well.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Should the leaked pricing be accurate, the Intel Arc B580 will cost more than what A580 did when it launched in 2023 at $179. It will still be less than the $289 of the Intel Arc A750 when that launched in 2022.</p>



<p>The Intel Arc B580 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-reveal-imminent-more-intel-arc-battlemage-details-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to feature 20 Xe2 cores</a>, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, a clock speed of 2.8GHz, and more. Latest reports suggest a reveal will happen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime in December</a> before Nvidia and AMD announce their new graphics cards in January.</p>



<p>It’s currently unknown how many Intel Battlemage GPU SKUs will be released. Intel has not commented on any of the rumored details of its new graphics cards.</p>



<p>What do you think of the rumored price for Intel Arc Battlemage? Join the discussion below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1269/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Following the immense success of Diablo IV and the upcoming Path of Exile 2, both of which heavily feature microtransactions, primarily in the form of cosmetic skins, the ARPG genre, while flourishing, is bogged down by loot boxes, pay-to-win mechanics and in-game stores. It’s left many fans of the genre worrying about upcoming titles, such as Titan Quest 2. According to developer Grimlore Games, we have nothing to worry about. Titan Quest 2 isn’t pay-to-win and features no loot boxes!</p>



<p>On the topic of loot boxes and pay-to-win mechanics in the mythology-focused ARPG, developer Grimlore Games said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With Titan Quest 2, we intend to take a bit of a different approach than with most projects before. We want to involve the community in a typical Steam Early Access manner. Our reasoning: we want Titan Quest 2 to stand its own ground within the ARPG genre and we are convinced that there is only one way to pull it off: swarm intelligence.</p>



<p>When the first Titan Quest originally released in 2006, it was the alternative to Diablo 2 and not many others in the ARPG genre. In 2024, the situation looks a little different. Apart from the still ongoing Diablo franchise, there are numerous other contestants out there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But with such stiff competition and a desire to earn back its investment, Grimlore Games certainly has its work cut out for it in developing, releasing, and improving upon Titan Quest 2 over time. As such, the team made the community four promises:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We do despise this with a passion. There will never ever be any monetization mechanic in the game, urging you to spend money on any gameplay-related item to give anybody an advantage.</p>



<p>You can play the way you want to play the game. When we launch into early access in the winter of 2025, we will however not yet have online multiplayer (four-player co-op) implemented. This will be among the first two updates once we launch into Steam Early Access.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’re a long-time fan of the ARPG genre, chances are you probably played the original game back in the day. Well, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlist its sequel on Steam right now</a>!</p>



<p>While it won’t be available at launch, Titan Quest 2 will feature co-op sometime after its Early Access release. You have plenty of time to find a co-op partner or two to grind levels with. You could even check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a> for like-minded players!</p>



<hr>



<p>It took a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/titan-quest-2-17-years-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staggering 17 years for Titan Quest 2 to be announced</a>, but the iconic ARPG is finally within our grasp. You just have to wait until late 2025, sadly!</p>

<p>Worlds Untold, a NetEase-backed studio founded by former Mass Effect producer Mac Walters, is “pausing operations” just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-adds-new-studio-led-by-mass-effect-veteran/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a year after being founded</a>.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>, Walters said the studio is looking for a new partner and that halting operations was a “very difficult decision”.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we’ve made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life,” Walters said. “This was not a decision we made lightly—it’s been a deeply personal journey, and we’re all so proud of everything this team has built together.”</p>



<p>Worlds Untold had been working on a “AAA action-adventure game” since it was founded. However, NetEase recently decided to pull funding due to “current market conditions”.</p>

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, a NetEase spokesperson said discontinuing funding was an “incredibly difficult decision”.</p>



<p>“This choice was not made lightly, as we have been consistently inspired by the team, their unwavering dedication and the bold vision behind their project,” the spokesperson said. “Although current market conditions have required us to reassess and prioritise our opportunities, we are actively collaborating with the studio to explore potential next steps and provide support during this transition.</p>



<p>“While this chapter comes to a close, our commitment to a strong global presence remains unwavering, and we are excited about the promising projects underway at our other studios. We thank Worlds Untold for their remarkable contributions and wish them every success in the future.”</p>



<p>Walters added that all of the studio’s staff are able and looking for work elsewhere. He said that while the studio is “pausing for now”, it’s not the end of the line for Worlds Untold and their plans.</p>



<p>“[There’s] more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right,” he said.</p>
