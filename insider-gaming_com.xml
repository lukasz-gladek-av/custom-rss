<p>On Tuesday, Sony launched its 30th Anniversary website for PlayStation. The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/playstation-history/2000-ps2-psp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website goes through</a> the console’s history from the original PlayStation through the current PlayStation 5 (PS5). It also gave confirmation of an updated number on the best-selling video game console of all time, the PlayStation 2 (PS2).</p>



<p>According to Sony, the PS2 has sold over 160 million units  since its launch in 2000. Prior to this update, the last known sales total for the console was 158.3 million units.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>The sales include original versions of the console as well us various models, including the PS2 Slim that launched in 2004.</p>



<p>At 160 million units, the PS2 widens its gap as the best-selling console ever. Behind it in the home console space is the Nintendo Switch, which as sold 146 million units. If we were to add handheld systems to the total, the PS2 sits just just six million ahead of the 154.02 million units the Nintendo DS sold in its life cycle.</p>



<p>What made the system so popular were not only the games, but the console’s ability to play DVDs as well. An all-in-one system during a time when DVDs became the norm for movie and TV show purchases made for an enticing buy for players. Obviously, the move paid off. </p>



<p>As far as the current Sony console, the PS5, Sony says that it has sold over 65 million units in its four years on the market.</p>



<p>Do you think a video game console will ever sell as much as the PlayStation 2 ever again? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Despite its initially rocky launch, developer Creative Assembly stuck with Total War: Warhammer 3 since day one, unleashing bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, and brand-new content in the form of expansions and faction packs to expand upon the game’s core armies significantly. Well, the game’s about to grow larger. CA has announced the Omens of Destruction for Total War: Warhammer 3, featuring three new playable Legendary Lords, one each for Khorne, Ogre Kingdoms, and the Orcs.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER III - Omens of Destruction Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83chO9NuWAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The three new Legendary Lords include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gorbad </strong>– Orcs</li>



<li><strong>Golgfag </strong>– Ogre Kingdoms</li>



<li><strong>Skulltaker </strong>– Khorne</li>
</ul>



<p>The three new pieces of DLC will launch simultaneously on December 12. While the price tag is currently unknown, going by past Legendary Lord DLC, we suspect each pack will cost $8.99 apiece. A bundle containing all three will be available for approximately $23, with a slight discount for packaging them together.</p>



<p>Alongside the new DLC, we’ll receive update 6.0 for Total War: Warhammer 3, and the 100th Legendary Lord, Arbaal the Undefeated, a champion of Khorne, utterly free as part of the update. </p>

<p>Despite recent downfalls, like that of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a>, the free-to-play hero shooter genre continues performing relatively well for a select few titles. It’s hard for a newcomer to make a dent, but it appears Theorycraft Games’ Supervive, launched on November 20, outperforms much of its competition. But it leaves many questions open for fans on the sidelines. For instance, who are the Supervive hunters?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-supervive">What is Supervive?</h2>



<p>Supervive is a free-to-play hero shooter with battle royale and MOBA elements from developer Theorycraft Games. It’s a fast-paced, PvP-oriented experience that favors frantic gameplay in which players will dash and glide while unleashing attack combos to deal damage and complete objectives. Every hero in the game, known as a Hunter, is flexible and allows various abilities and equipment to alter playstyles and change up the match.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-hunters-in-supervive">What Are Hunters in Supervive?</h2>



<p>Hunters in Supervive are this game’s version of heroes. They’re playable characters, each of which fall into five categories:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Fighter</strong></li>



<li><strong>Initiator</strong></li>



<li><strong>Frontliner</strong></li>



<li><strong>Protector</strong></li>



<li><strong>Controller</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Unlike your typical hero shooter, Supervive heavily leans into its MOBA roots to combine elements of the compelling lane-based gameplay in its PvP-focused free-to-play hero shooter.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-are-all-of-the-supervive-hunters-available">Who Are All of the Supervive Hunters Available?</h2>



<p>There are a total of sixteen playable characters in Supervive currently, including:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Brall</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bishop</strong></li>



<li><strong>Celeste</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elluna</strong></li>



<li><strong>Felix</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ghost</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hudson</strong></li>



<li><strong>Jin</strong></li>



<li><strong>Joule</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kingpin</strong></li>



<li><strong>Myth</strong></li>



<li><strong>Oath</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shiv</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shrike</strong></li>



<li><strong>Void</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zeph</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that Cyberpunk 2077 is getting another new show adaptation on Netflix.</p>



<p>“I’m also very happy to announce that we’re working on another animation project set in the Cyberpunk universe, which will be released on Netflix,” CD Projekt Red Chief Financial Officer Piotr Nielubowicz said during the <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s earnings call</a> on Tuesday.</p>







<p>There was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-releases-trailers-for-cyberpunk-devil-may-cry-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teaser for a new project</a> from Netflix released in September. However, nothing had been officially announced by CD Projekt Red before the call on November 26. </p>



<p>No other details for the upcoming project were announced by the studio. That information is expected to come in the coming weeks and months. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, a spin-off of the series, is currently available to watch on Netflix. That series was produced by Studio Trigger.</p>



<p>In addition to the outside projects of the series, CD Projekt Red is continuing work on the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. Known as Project Orion, the game currently has 64 people —  just under 10% of the company — working on it. The game is expected to come after the release of the next game in The Witcher series, Project Polaris.</p>

The Zone is a dangerous place full of wonder and money-making opportunities, and the artifacts you’ll encounter prove to be some of the most lucrative. But they’re also liable to end your run. Here’s a look at the eight legendary artifacts worth the risk!</p>



<h2 id="h-there-are-eight-legendary-artifacts-in-stalker-2">There Are Eight Legendary Artifacts in STALKER 2</h2>

We have the descriptions and effects of all these artifacts, so you have the luxury of picking and choosing what you’ll look for!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compass</strong>: A legendary artifact that can be found in gravitational anomalies. It is believed that whoever discovers and holds the Compass will gain the ability to navigate the Zone safely. Maximum Radiation, Maximum Physical Protection.</li>



<li><strong>Hypercube</strong>: A legendary artifact that can be found in thermal anomalies. The full potential of this artifact has not yet been discovered, but it emits ultra-long radio waves and could be used in space navigation. Maximum Thermal Protection, Maximum Radiation, and Maximum Bleeding Protection.</li>



<li><strong>Weird Ball</strong>: A child’s oddly heavy ball, this legendary “altered item” is often mentioned in hushed tones. If you equip it, it is said to reduce bullet damage in combat while standing still. Unique Effect—Reduces bullet damage when standing still.</li>



<li><strong>Weird Flower</strong>: A unique-looking flower, this legendary “altered item” is often not directly mentioned. If you sleep with this flower on your belt, its fragrance can mask your scent for a limited time.

<li><strong>Weird Nut</strong>: A nut that is eerily cold to the touch, this legendary “altered item” is rumored to promote rapid blood coagulation when on your person, though the wounds take longer to heal. Unique Effect—Promotes rapid blood coagulation when attached to your belt, but the wounds will take longer to heal.</li>



<li><strong>Heart of Chornobyl</strong>: A mythical artifact that functions as a psi-radiation amplifier. The degree of amplification depends on the source’s capabilities and characteristics. Its properties are not fully understood, but it is thought to encapsulate the original structure of the Zone’s matter. Unique Effect—Used in Kalmanov ending.</li>



<li><strong>Thunderberry</strong>: A legendary artifact found in electro anomalies. When heated gradually to 78 degrees Celsius, it produces vibrant collective hallucinations that present a utopia. Maximum Radiation, Maximum Endurance.</li>
