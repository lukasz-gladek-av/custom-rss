<h2 id="h-how-many-playthroughs-of-the-outer-worlds-2-are-needed-for-the-platinum-trophy">How Many Playthroughs of The Outer Worlds 2 are Needed for the Platinum Trophy?</h2>



<p><strong>As of this writing, we do not know for sure how many playthroughs are absolutely required to get all achievements and trophies in The Outer Worlds 2, but it appears that it will require at least two. If certain factions are locked off depending on your choices, it could be more.</strong></p>



<p>The achievement list in this game shows that <a href="https://outerworlds2.obsidian.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Outer Worlds 2</a> follows a lot of the same methods that the original game used when it comes to achievements and trophies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, difficulty achievements tied to multiple achievements are not really common for RPGs, but both games do them here. Hopefully, players who play through first on Very Hard will automatically receive the Hard trophy as well, but if it doesn’t, you will be stuck with an additional playthrough.</p>



<p>It appears that the max level in the game is 30, much like it was in the original, and there are a lot of collectibles to find, including 100 Pitch/Tossball cards, grounding stations, audio logs, and mural pieces. Hopefully, none of those are locked off in areas if you miss them the first time through.</p>



<p>Outside of that, there seem to be a lot of miscellaneous achievements and trophies in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-the-outer-worlds-2-have-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a>. Things like never buying anything in the game or getting kills in various ways. If you want the platinum in this game, you are going to have to cover a lot of ground.</p>

<p>A massive Pokémon data leak has occurred, revealing details about past and upcoming games, including a roadmap for future titles and DLC. </p>



<p>The Pokémon Company has fallen victim to a huge datamine, which recently provided a whole bunch of details on their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gen 10 title</a>, Pokémon Wind and Waves. Now, new information about other Pokémon games has surfaced online, including details on Gen 11, Legends 3, a remake, and more titles. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-projects-currently-in-development-at-game-freak">All Pokémon Projects Currently in Development at Game Freak&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Thanks to CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977791170093687087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), we have a roadmap for future Pokémon games and DLC. Firstly, the Gen 10 title, Wind and Waves, is set to release in 2026, with a DLC arriving in 2027. Pokémon Legends 3, which is called Galar, is “releasing in 2027 or beyond. A Pokémon multi-region remake is in the works, which is planned for 2028 or beyond. Moreover, Pokopia will also receive a DLC, and Pokémon Champions was originally scheduled for a 2025 release. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>THIS IS CRAZY. All the projects Game Freak currently has in development:</p><p>– Wind/Waves is releasing in 2026, with DLC in 2027.<br>– Pokémon Legends: Galar is releasing 2027 or beyond.<br>– Pokémon Multi-Region Remake in 2028 or beyond.<br>– Pokopia will get DLC.<br>– Pokémon Champions was… <a href="https://t.co/OcuIChALaj">pic.twitter.com/OcuIChALaj</a></p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977791170093687087?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-gen-11-release-window-multi-region-remake-and-legends-3-galar-details-surface-online">Pokémon Gen 11 Release Window, Multi-Region Remake, and Legends 3: Galar Details Surface Online</h2>



<p>Players must’ve seen mentions of the multi-region remake, Legends 3: Galar, and more, and must be wondering what all that’s about. Here’s what CentroLeaks has shared about them on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>: </p>



<ul>
<li>Starting with Pokémon Gen 11, has seemingly set a 2030 release window, according to leaks. </li>



<li>Secondly, Game Freak is reportedly developing a multi-region Pokémon remake that lets players “walk from Sinnoh to Hoenn” and includes Kitakami. It is called Project Seed internally and is “a prototyping project for a next-generation online game playable by multiple people, set in a region that connects Hoenn and Sinnoh.”</li>



<li>Lastly, Pokémon Legends: Arceus is set in Galar, 1,000 years in the past, where players must create the first Gigamax Pokéball. The upcoming game is inspired by Xenoblade Chronicles X. </li>
</ul>



<p>As always, players should take this information with a grain of salt and note that all information is subject to change by the final release. </p>



<p>In other news, the full Pokémon Legends Z-A Pokédex, including Shinies and Megas, has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokedex-leaked-in-full/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked online</a>.
