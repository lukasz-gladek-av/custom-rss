            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been revealed, and details have been shared for the upcoming Open Beta, where players will get the first opportunity to get their hands on the title. Here’s everything we know.</p>



<p>The Black Ops 7 Open Beta is split into two parts, with the first few days available only to those with Early Access before the doors open for everyone, and it’s the perfect time to try out the title before the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a> release.</p>



<p>In the guide below, we’ve outlined all of the crucial information for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-access-black-ops-7-beta-pre-order-bonuses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Beta</a>, including the dates, how to sign-up, and what you can expect.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-open-beta-start-date">Black Ops 7 Open Beta Start Date</h2>

<p><strong>The Black Ops 7 Open Beta begins on October 5, though three days of Early Access are available from October 2.</strong></p>



<p>These dates have been confirmed by <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/9PLBM5790L94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">store listings</a> for Black Ops 7 pre-orders, though it’s worth noting that the dates are subject to change.</p>



<p>No end date has been revealed yet for the Black Ops 6 Open Beta, though expect things to wrap up before the release of Battlefield 6 on October 10, as Activision understandably won’t want the timings to clash.</p>



<p>If any further details are announced regarding the beta, we’ll add to this article.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-sign-up-for-black-ops-7-open-beta">How to Sign Up For Black Ops 7 Open Beta</h2>



<p><strong>Pre-ordering Black Ops 7 or having an active Game Pass subscription qualifies you for Early Access to the Beta from October 2.</strong></p>



<p>From October 5, however, the doors open for all players and there are no entry restrictions, so you won’t need to pre-order. As we don’t know exactly how long the Open Beta will be live for, though, it could leave you with very limited time to try it out before the doors close.</p>



<p>No further Betas are expected after the Open Beta before launch on November 14, with the title once again included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-black-ops-7-open-beta">What to Expect From Black Ops 7 Open Beta</h2>



<p><strong>The Black Ops 7 Open Beta will be Multiplayer only, so you won’t be able to try out Zombies, the Campaign, or Warzone.</strong></p>



<p>Full details of what’s included are not yet revealed, though there could be a limited amount of guns available and only a select few maps and game modes in rotation.</p>



<p>Any progress earned in the Beta will not transfer over to Black Ops 7 at launch, though there may be some exclusive bonuses to unlock for participating.</p>



<p>Are you planning to pre-order Black Ops 7 to secure Early Access to the Beta? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s Camo grind is set to be the biggest in the franchise’s history, with more Mastery Camos than ever before to secure.</p>



<p>Gathering the exclusive Camos across all modes has become a popular pastime for players, with exclusive Camos available in Multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone.</p>



<p>In Black Ops 7, releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, Campaign joins the mix with its own set of Mastery Camos, giving players another avenue to run down in the hunt to secure them all.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-will-feature-16-mastery-camos">Black Ops 7 Will Feature 16 Mastery Camos</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get your grind on. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>As revealed in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies-launching-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog</a>, Black Ops 7 will feature Global Progression in the campaign for the first time, with Player and Weapon XP, challenges, and Weapon Camos earned through the campaign transfering over to Multiplayer and Zombies, along with Warzone when Season 1 launches.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 will feature 30 weapons at launch, each with its own set of camos available across the various modes, and four Mastery Camos will be available for Campaign, along with their usual appearances in other modes.</p>



<p>Mastery Camos in Call of Duty are the most illustrious of them all, requiring you to complete all other challenges to unlock. For the rarest, this includes completing all challenges across all weapons in the same class, so it’s the ultimate flex on other players.</p>



<p>The campaign grind will become much more manageable with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return of co-op</a>, which supports up to four players, and the End Game mode in Avalon will likely be the area where the majority of the Camo grind takes place.</p>



<p>Are you excited by the addition of even more Mastery Camos in Black Ops 7? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3349/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will feature a new feature to weapon builds that makes it easier than ever to share loadouts with friends and other players.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7, releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, continues the trend of having highly customizable weapons, with adjustments impacting everything from fire rate to range.</p>



<p>Finding the perfect build has always been tricky, requiring players to copy a loadout piece by piece in the past, but that is changing with Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-loadout-sharing-codes">Black Ops 7 Loadout Sharing Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lock and load. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>In Black Ops 7, created loadouts will now feature a code that can be shared with other players, which they can then input in their game to copy the design instantly—meaning no more awkwardly fiddling through the options to find the right attachment.</p>



<p>The feature was revealed in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies-launching-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, announcing that players can share or import Weapon Build Codes to try out loadouts with ease—and while the post says to try friends’ designs, it’s more than likely going to be used to copy creator designs or loadouts that appear on websites like ours or TikTok.</p>



<p>However, it’s unknown what will happen if you input a code that includes attachments you haven’t unlocked yet and whether the loadout will be blocked, or if it can be saved for later.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 has also confirmed the return of Weapon Prestige, said to be the “deepest and most rewarding” system yet, awarding Prestige Attachments and Weapon Camos.</p>



<p>More details will be shared in the coming months, with a full multiplayer reveal scheduled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 30’s COD Next showcase</a>, while a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombies-reveal-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive into Zombies is due in early September</a>.</p>



<p>How much easier is this feature going to make building weapon loadouts in Black Ops 7? Let us know your thoughts in the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3348/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-two-trailer-change-retcon-new-vegas/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-fans-notice-change-in-season-two-trailer-that-retcons-a-piece-of-new-vegas.1275240/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The award-winning, live-action adaptation of Fallout has a new season debuting in December. Last night, during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase, a brand-new trailer was revealed by the cast, revealing a couple of minutes of the next season. It was a wild ride that unveiled the New Vegas wasteland, uncovering key tales for the road ahead.</p>



<p>Eagle-eyed Fallout fans (including myself) noticed a very obvious change that some feel might be an error, while others believe it’s merely the team taking some creative license with the show.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-to-dinky">What Happened to Dinky?</h2>



<p>In Fallout: New Vegas (2010), players will inevitably head to Novac, a settlement built around an old motel. Flanking that motel is a towering Tyrannosaurus Rex statue affectionately named ‘Dinky’. Players will eventually link up with Boone, a marksman who sits in the mouth of the dinosaur, using his head as a sniper’s nest.</p>



<p>In the Fallout season two trailer, we see Novac and Dinky more than once, but something <strong>is different</strong>.</p>



<p>As one shot reveals, Dinky has been <strong>flipped </strong>and is now facing the ‘wrong way’. In the 2010 game, Dinky is looking out over the wasteland with his back to Novac, but in the trailer for season two, he’s facing inwards and looming over the motel. This means that the sniper’s nest has a clear line of sight into the motel, rather than away from it.</p>



<p>This isn’t an enormous change, but it invalidates a portion of Fallout: New Vegas.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout Season 2 - Official Teaser Trailer | gamescom 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZY5WiqeyQQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>For those not aware, the player links up with Boone in New Vegas and follows a path that sees Boone get revenge against those who sold his wife into slavery. Boone asks the player to lead the key suspect away from Novac and into the line of sight of Dinky and the sniper’s nest, with Boone exacting a portion of his revenge from afar.</p>



<p>Again, it’s not a massive change, but it’s enough that fans are questioning it.</p>



<p>What did you notice from Fallout’s season two trailer that has you interested in the show? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s Zombies mode will be getting its big reveal soon enough. After showcasing the game’s co-op campaign and a hint of Multiplayer, Zombies got a small section of the trailer. Still, for those who want to know more, you won’t have to wait long to find out.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is returning to the cybernetic world of Black Ops 2. While the campaign picks up David Mason’s story, fans are no doubt excited for Multiplayer and Zombies. We previously reported that Multiplayer will be at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/">COD Next</a>, as well as Zombies. However, it looks like it may be sooner than that, thanks to confirmation from PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-zombies-return-in-a-big-way-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Zombies Return (in a Big Way) in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r9Z15Z-f2Ys?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>At around <a href="https://youtu.be/r9Z15Z-f2Ys?feature=shared&amp;t=132">the 2:12 mark</a> of the latest trailer of Black Ops 7, a peek at Zombies is shown. We get a few seconds of gameplay, as well as an interesting arcade mode called Dead Ops Arcade 4. It’s not much, though it was confirmed that, alongside Multiplayer, it will be present at COD Next. The event, which takes place on September 30th, 2025, plans to show off both modes in detail. However, it looks like we may see Zombies earlier than that, as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies-launching-november-14/">PlayStation Blog</a> mentions an early September reveal for the mode.</p>



<p>From the Call of Duty blog, Black Ops 7’s Zombies picks off where Black Ops 6 left off, with the crew now meeting the original Black Ops Zombies members. The mode will apparently be its biggest yet, with the launch map being quite vast. For fans of Black Ops 2, Survival Maps return, so players can enjoy multiple maps to play on and last against the hordes of zombies. </p>



<p>While there isn’t a firm date as to when Black Ops 7 Zombies will be shown, it’ll be before COD Next. Given the game launches on Game Pass, you’ll be able to dive into Zombies day one if you own the subscription.</p>
