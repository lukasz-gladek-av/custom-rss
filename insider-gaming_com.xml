<p>With the absolute smash month that is February 2025, in which we see the release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Civilization VII, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, and Avowed, March may appear like a lightweight initially. The month does feature a few big releases, like Two Point Museum and Atomfall, but they’re more niche. No matter, the biggest video game releases in March 2025 still look enticing!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-hottest-game-releases-of-march-2025">The Hottest Game Releases of March 2025</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for a slew of AAA releases in the month of March, then you’re going to be sorely disappointed. But if you want a few indie and AA titles to round out your library and provide a little break from the big studio releases before summer, then March definitely has you covered!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Two Point Museum</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 4, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Split Fiction</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 6, 2025</li>



<li><strong>FragPunk </strong>(PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 6, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 18, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</strong> (Nintendo Switch) – March 20, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – March 21, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls </strong>(PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 21, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Tales of the Shire</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – March 25, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Atomfall </strong>(PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S) – March 27, 2025</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, a handful of titles are expected in March 2025 but with no official release date, including <strong>Commandos: Origins</strong>, <strong>Football Manager 25</strong>, and <strong>Killing Floor 3</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-looking-forward-to-april-2025">Looking Forward to April 2025</h2>



<p>Before anyone gets too excited, April looks like a light month—at least for now. The most significant releases aren’t that major and include:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Last of Us Part II Remastered (PC)</li>



<li>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</li>



<li>Tempest Rising</li>
</ul>



<p>This is the lull before summer pops off; just wait and see!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-most-anticipated-game-of-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-6-is-the-insider-gaming-community%E2%80%99s-most-anticipated-game-of-2025.1069413/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-most-anticipated-game-of-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As we gear up for 2025, the hype around upcoming games is reaching a fever pitch. There are games coming in the early part of the year like Avowed and Civilization 7 that look like potential Game of the Year candidates. Then you have titles like Borderlands 4, Fable, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A that are fanbases eager for the next adventure. Still, no game seems to have a stranglehold on the community more than Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6. And that’s why GTA 6 is Insider Gaming’s Most Anticipated Game of 2025.</p>



<p>In a member vote on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>, it wasn’t even close. The most anticipated game category was the most lopsided of all the questions with GTA 6 receiving 87% of the vote. Death Stranding 2 came in a very distant second with 7% of the vote.</p>



<p>As far as why GTA 6 won by as much as it did, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone.</p>



<p>A decade in the making and cloaked in mystery, Rockstar Games’ next blockbuster isn’t just the most anticipated release of the year, it’s poised to become a cultural phenomenon that sets the standard for open-world gaming for years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of writing, all fans have had to quench their thirst for the upcoming game is the reveal trailer from 2023. Since then it’s been silent at Rockstar with various rumors taking up the bulk of the talk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-about-grand-theft-auto-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game will feature</a> two characters, including the franchise’s first female protagonist named Lucia. We also know that it’s set in a fictionalized version of modern-day Florida called Leonida and features parodies of some real-life characters. Lastly, the game will launch only on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Those hoping for a PC release will have to wait, similar to the launch of GTA 5.</p>



<div><p>Other than those few things, there’s really nothing else we know. What will the game’s story be about? How will Rockstar expand the gameplay? What will happen to those who have spent years in GTA Online?</p><p>All of these questions lead to GTA 6 being at the top of everyone’s minds going into 2025 when we’ll (hopefully) get confirmation of a release date sooner rather than later. That is, of course, the game does get delayed until 2026. For right now, however, it’s still scheduled for fall 2025.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-3-leak/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Design documents for several Grand Theft Auto titles, including GTA 3, have leaked online, showing ambitious plans for the franchise.</p>



<p>According to multiple reports, the design documents date back to 2001, but were uploaded on December 17, 2024 by a GTAForums user named <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/300544-collectors-general-chat/page/123/#findComment-1072480714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FrankieLiberty</a>. According to the user, he uploaded the files because other users were selling the documents for profit.</p>



<p>The documents reveal that GTA 3 and GTA 3 Online had ambitious plans for the time, which would have included a faction system, a skill system, the ability to own properties, and more. The documents also show that Barking Dog Studios, who would be acquired by Take-Two Interactive in August 2002 and morphed into Rockstar Vancouver, were intended to be the game’s original developers. </p>



<p>As always, design documents are always overly ambitious, but the design documents are a unique glimpse into how ambitious Rockstar Games were even in the early 2000s. You can view and download the documents (at your own risk), <a href="https://archive.org/details/jane-doe-gift" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. </p>



<p>As for Rockstar Games, which is the Grand Theft Auto franchise at the time of writing, fans are eagerly awaiting the next GTA 6 trailer, which should hopefully give us a more accurate release date. At the time of writing, GTA 6 is currently scheduled to release in 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of the design documents? Are you looking forward to GTA 6? Let us know in the comments below! Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-0-16-0-0-patch-notes-full-guide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s wipe is here and it’s coming hand-in-hand with the 0.16.0.0 update. Amongst other things, this patch introduces a Custom rework, winter weather, new quests, and several new weapons. It’s also ushering in the global reset that typically brings hundreds of thousands of players back to the game every six months or so.</p>



<p>Read below to check out the most important aspects of the 0.16.0.0 patch notes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-0-16-0-0-notes-key-changes">Tarkov 0.16.0.0 Notes – Key Changes</h2>



<p>The winter season is in full force in the 0.16.0.0 patch, with winter weather being brought back into the game. It’s a little more granular than last year’s snowy update, though, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Khorovod, a new winter-themed event</li>



<li>‘Frostbite’, a new status effect that reduces players’ visibility and stamina. The effect goes away in shelters, near burning barrels, or when drinking alcohol</li>



<li>Updated the winter environment visual effects;</li>



<li>Added snowdrifts in various areas for more variety;</li>



<li>Added a winter theme Factory, including snow and matching elements;</li>



<li>Added a unique winter sound design for all locations</li>
</ul>



<p>At the heart of the update sits an overhaul for Customs, one of the most popular maps in Escape from Tarkov. In the 0.16.0.0 patch notes, it was confirmed that Battlestate Games has:</p>



<ul>
<li>Updated the old textures and materials on the location, and replaced the old objects with more up-to-date ones;</li>



<li>Fully updated some of the buildings on the location;</li>



<li>Replaced all opaque glass blocks on the location with transparent ones;</li>



<li>Opened three buildings on the industrial territory;</li>



<li>Added new objects to the location, including exploding propane cylinders;</li>



<li>Added new points of interest;</li>



<li>Added a transit to Shoreline;</li>



<li>Added new exfils</li>
</ul>



<p>When players reach level 55 in Escape from Tarkov’s PvP mode (and complete many other prerequisites), they’ll now be able to enter ‘Prestige’ mode. This is present in Tarkov Arena, also. For the full details on Tarkov’s Prestige mode, check out <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/323?lang=null" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the breakdown provided by Battlestate Games</a>.</p>



<p>Here are all the new weapons coming to Tarkov in 0.16.0.0:</p>



<ul>
<li>RShG-2 72.5mm rocket launcher;</li>



<li>Sako TRG M10 .338 LM bolt-action sniper rifle;</li>



<li>Aklys Defense Velociraptor .300 Blackout assault rifle;</li>



<li>Saiga-12K 12ga automatic shotgun;</li>



<li>FN SCAR-H X-17 7.62×51 assault rifle;</li>



<li>Akula push dagger;</li>



<li>V40 Mini-Grenade</li>
</ul>



<p>On the topic of weapons, Battlestate Games has also overhauled how visual recoil works in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li>Added random weapon sway and horizontal rotation;</li>



<li>Implemented the visual effect of the bolt hitting the receiver;</li>



<li>Added a camera shake effect, reflecting the buttstock hitting the shoulder;</li>



<li>Added slight barrel sway effect for pistols;</li>



<li>Shotguns now have the inertia and calibre power effect;</li>



<li>Updated the 3rd person aiming animations</li>
</ul>



<p>On top of all that, BSG has added further customisation options for the Hideout, balanced countless weapons and items, and tweaked how AI enemies work. For instance, Partisan, Raiders, Rogues, and other bots can now use UBGLs, and they’ll start flanking, suppressing, and becoming more aggressive in fights.</p>



<p>And of course, hundreds of bug fixes and quality-of-life changes have been applied, such as increasing the ruble stack limit from 500,000 to one million.</p>

<p>Every six months or so, Escape from Tarkov undergoes a ‘wipe’, a global reset that level the playing field for everyone on the platform. It’s also the time when Tarkov becomes more popular than ever, with hundreds of thousands of players flooding the game to get their early wipe tasks completed all over again.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m walking you through the best Escape from Tarkov starter tips that you can use to get ahead of the competition at the start of the wipe. If you’re a new Tarkov player looking for the best tricks and tips possible, look no further than this guide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-tarkov-starter-tips-for-a-new-wipe">Best Tarkov Starter Tips for a New Wipe</h2>



<p>Whether you’re a first-time Tarkov player or a veteran in need of a refresh, here are the best Tarkov tips you can use to get a foothold in the wipe as early as possible.</p>



<h3 id="h-run-your-gear">Run Your Gear</h3>



<p>When the wipe hits, don’t be afraid to run those T4 rigs and vests – everyone else will be relying on their PACA vests (if they’re USEC) because they don’t want to risk losing the good stuff, so you’ll be going in with an advantage. If you do lose your T4 vest, you’ll just have to work harder to make it back, soldier.</p>



<p>Similarly, if you open a cache or a box and find a T5 – or by some miracle, a T6 – then don’t be afraid to run that, either. It’ll make you hugely more resilient than the rest of the players running around.</p>



<h3 id="h-understand-the-mechanics">Understand the Mechanics</h3>



<p>In recent years, Escape from Tarkov has undergone several major changes that have brought about new mechanics. For instance, in 0.12.12.0, ‘inertia’ was added, giving players more weight and making them slower. These days, players are utilising movement mechanics like mantling and vaulting, and in the latest update, 0.16.0.0, new recoil-based changes have been implemented.</p>



<p>From new ways to use hotkeys to bipods that can drastically improve your accuracy at long range, Tarkov has had several new mechanics hit the platform in the last few updates. If you’re coming in from a hiatus, you might be left confused by some of them, so take the time to understand what has changed.</p>



<p>If you’re a new player, make sure you devote time to understanding how some core elements of Tarkov work:</p>



<ul>
<li>Healing</li>



<li>Inventory management</li>



<li>Insurance</li>



<li>Weapons and ammunition</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-shopping-list">Shopping List</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t let the quiet streets fool you; danger is everywhere in Escape from Tarkov</figcaption></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov is a looter-shooter for some, with many players darting around the map eager to secure the most high-value items. There are many things that you’ll want to start collecting early on to help bolster those early-game tasks, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Salewa medkits</li>



<li>Morphine injectors</li>



<li>Gas analysers</li>



<li>Flash drives</li>



<li>Module 3M body armor</li>



<li>TOZ-106 shotgun</li>



<li>Small ‘Tushonka’</li>



<li>Toolsets</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, there are several items you’ll want to keep an eye open for as you traverse the many maps of Tarkov. They’ll be hugely helpful in getting the earliest parts of your Hideout constructed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Leatherman Multitool</li>



<li>M-Tape</li>



<li>Car battery</li>



<li>Awl</li>



<li>Lightbulbs</li>



<li>Corrugated hose</li>



<li>Screws</li>



<li>Nails</li>



<li>Medical tools</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s worth using a resource <a href="https://tarkov.dev/maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">like Tarkov Dev</a> to learn the maps and to pinpoint where these items spawn.</p>



<h3 id="h-prioritise">Prioritise</h3>



<p>Prioritisation is key in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Should you run towards the gunfire and potentially scoop some kills, or live to fight another day by running in the opposite direction? Should you take that loot and risk being heavy as hell, or leave it and hope to find some lighter goodies?</p>



<p>At the start of the wipe, you don’t want to loot <strong>everything</strong>. Use a resource <a href="https://tarkov-market.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">like Tarkov Market</a> to identify what’s selling and what’s worth the most to help with inventory management. If you have the opportunity, you should always be extracting with every slot filled, but you won’t always have the luxury of leaving with a full backpack.</p>



<p>This new Tarkov wipe guide is centred around prioritisation when you think about it:</p>



<ul>
<li>Prioritise high-value, necessary loot such as quest items and Hideout components</li>



<li>Prioritise quest completion over gunfights</li>



<li>Prioritise your route before loading onto a map</li>



<li>Prioritise one-time quests over daily or weekly tasks</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-get-busy-tasking">Get Busy Tasking</h3>



<p>One of the best Escape from Tarkov starter tips is to start grinding tasks as early as possible. By doing this, you’ll get a leg up on your opponents and start earning massive chunks of XP. Within a few raids, you’ll have the Flea Market unlocked – which is massively important and a key part of this early wipe start guide.</p>



<p>To that end, you’ll be heading to Ground Zero, the newest Tarkov map, to complete five tasks:</p>



<ul>
<li>Burning Rubber</li>



<li>First in Line</li>



<li>Shooting Cans</li>



<li>Saving the Mole</li>



<li>Luxurious Life (unlocks after some pre-requisites)</li>
</ul>



<p>Ground Zero is effectively a starter map, and it offers a small-form, rapid introduction to Escape from Tarkov. If you’re a new Tarkov player, it’s where you’ll get your first taste of combat and exploration.</p>



<p>If you’re sneaky or talented, you can get these tasks completed in one raid. It’ll mean you’ll leave your first Tarkov raid with thousands of XP points, and you’ll go on to unlock some great early-wipe gains. It’ll be a nice confidence booster for the road ahead, too.</p>



<h3 id="h-build-up">Build Up</h3>



<p>The Hideout is hugely important in Escape from Tarkov. It offers many benefits, such as item crafting, skill growth, and boosts that you’ll come to rely on later in the game. It’s a good idea and one of the best Tarkov tips to get started building your Hideout as soon as possible.</p>



<p>The shopping list I’ve detailed above gives you some idea of where to start, but you’ll need <strong>a lot </strong>of resources to make the most of your Hideout. Keep an eye open for the things you need to get the biggest boosts and benefits from your Hideout as you play.</p>



<p>Some of the key constructs you’ll want to focus on in the Tarkov Hideout are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Workbench (weapon customisation)</li>



<li>Medstation (health regen and med crafting)</li>



<li>Intelligence Center (money gain boost)</li>



<li>Library (experience gain boost)</li>
</ul>



<p>Before you get to some of these, you’ll need to work on everything from power to security, and from lighting to home comforts like a rest area and food production systems. By the end of a Tarkov wipe, you’ll have a Hideout that’s worthy of the most accomplished PMC.</p>



<h3 id="h-stash-management">Stash Management</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Will a nice weapon stay in your stash or be taken out on raids?</figcaption></figure>







<p>In Escape from Tarkov, successful stash management is key to your financial success, especially if you’re a standard user with the default stash size. This is where you’ll keep the spoils of your raids, along with weapons, ammunition, healing items, food, and everything else you find or craft in Tarkov.</p>



<p>Here’s a solid new wipe Tarkov tip: Buy the Lucky Scav Junkbox as soon as possible. Once you’ve got the 1.1 million rubles needed, acquire the box to stash a stunning amount of quest, Hideout, and miscellaneous items that you’ll bring back from your raids. It’ll stop your stash from getting overwhelmed in the first days after the wipe.</p>



<p>Remember to also:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Backpack stack’, putting backpacks inside of each other to increase storage space</li>



<li>Strip guns, removing their magazines and grips to make them only one line deep. If it’s a cheap weapon, you can scrap or sell the magazines, putting on new ones later for just a few rubles</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-make-gains">Make Gains</h3>



<p>When you start playing after a wipe, one of the best Tarkov tips is to sell everything you don’t need very early on. This will reward you with plenty of easy cash right off the bat.</p>



<p>For instance, the Edge of Darkness and The Unheard Edition pre-order bonuses include a lot that you might not want or need, such as baseball caps, one-use healing items, alcohol, certain weapons, cheap attachments, and some crafting components. If you don’t think you’ll need them, you’re probably right, and once you start getting better stuff in the wild, there’s no point hanging on.</p>



<p>For instance, if you find one ‘CALOK’ hemostatic dressing, you’ll use that over a CAT or an Esmarch tourniquet as it has three uses before it’s gone. That’s the same for an AI-2 medkit, which will quickly be replaced by IFAK, AFAK, Salewa, and Grizzly medkits.</p>



<p>If you find a Grizzly, you’ll be soaring – that can heal heavy bleeds, light bleeds, injured limbs, concussions, and broken bones.</p>



<h3 id="h-running-guns">Running Guns</h3>



<p>The best early-game guns in Escape from Tarkov can be the difference between winning and losing a fight. Early on, the starting weapons after a wipe will be everywhere, and you’ll typically see people using:</p>



<ul>
<li>SKS</li>



<li>AKS-74U</li>



<li>M4A1</li>



<li>Mosin</li>
</ul>



<p>They’re cheap, easy to maintain, and the ammunition for them will be everywhere at the start of wipe, on account of many other people using them. As I mentioned above, you shouldn’t be afraid to run better equipment than everyone else – it’ll give you an edge in the early days.</p>



<p>Also, make sure you’re using the right weapons for each Tarkov map. If you’re going onto Woods, you’ll want a rifle, a marksman rifle, or a sniper rifle. If you’re running through Customs or Factory, you’ll be better off with a high-ergo assault rifle or an SMG. </p>



<p>When it comes to loading into a raid, make sure you’re insuring your gear with <strong>Prapor </strong>rather than <strong>Therapist</strong>, but don’t feel the need to waste money insuring very low-level equipment.</p>



<h3 id="h-preparation-is-everything">Preparation is Everything</h3>



<p>If you’re new to Tarkov and you’re looking for the best tips for your first wipe, you’ll ideally want to have a second monitor – or a tablet, or something similar. Having a second screen is huge in Escape from Tarkov, as it lets you have maps, market screens, and quest guides to help you out.</p>



<p>Tarkov is <strong>not </strong>an easy game, and it’s designed to be unwelcoming and a little awkward at times. That’s why it’s a good idea to use a second screen when you play.</p>



<p>Here are the best sites to use when playing Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://tarkov.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tarkov.dev</a> (maps, item guides, profit trackers, loot tiers)</li>



<li><a href="https://tarkov-market.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tarkov Market</a> (Flea Market tracker)</li>



<li><a href="https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Ballistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wiki Ballistics</a> (Ammo stats)</li>



<li><a href="https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Quests" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wiki Quests</a> (quest guides)</li>



<li><a href="https://mapgenie.io/tarkov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Map Genie</a> (interactive maps)</li>



<li><a href="https://tarkov-changes.com/changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tarkov Changes</a> (patch notes)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re <strong>brand new </strong>in Tarkov, it’s a good idea to either invest in PvE access or play ‘offline’ games against bots. This will allow you to learn the maps. Don’t make a habit of playing against bots, though. You’ll gain nothing but a little game knowledge – combat experience is everything and you’ll only get that against real players.</p>



<h3 id="h-buddy-up">Buddy Up</h3>



<p>It’s a good idea to play Escape from Tarkov with other people. Having that extra set of eyes and ears – and an extra gun – can be pivotal to your success in the game. Plus, there will be people to cover you when you complete certain tasks, and they’ll be able to ‘hide your gear’ when you die and they stay alive.</p>



<p>With that in mind, plenty of Tarkov groups exist on social media platforms, and there are many Discord servers live that offer buddy-up opportunities. Most of the biggest Tarkov streamers have Discord servers that you can lean on to find Tarkov players to play with.</p>



<p>If you want to find Tarkov players to run with, try some of these servers:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/2gCdVEJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Landmark</a></li>



<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Pestily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pestily</a></li>



<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/glorious-e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Glorious_e</a></li>



<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/redSVXhFMm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gingy</a></li>



<li><a href="https://discord.com/invite/5HZP9Mv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WillerZ</a></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-run-your-scavs">Run Your Scavs</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Scavs have bad weapons and almost no equipment, but they’re still valuable</figcaption></figure>







<p>This is a divisive Tarkov starter tip as not many people agree with it, but it’s a solid recommendation to run your Scav character. In Escape from Tarkov, you can play as a temporary ‘Scav’ or your persistent PMC character. Playing as a Scav will see you assigned a one-shot build that you can take on any map – except Labs.</p>



<p>When you play as a Scav, you can’t complete tasks and your PMC character won’t grow, but it’s a fantastic opportunity to seek out task items and equipment without worrying about losing your equipment or incurring a loss on your PMC character.</p>



<p>If you’re on a PMC losing streak, consider running a Scav to change the pacing a bit. Scavs spawn later in the raid, so the bulk of the action should have passed and only a few PMCs will be running around, giving you the opportunity to scoop up leftover loot and the remnants of fights.</p>



<h3 id="h-quick-settings">Quick Settings</h3>



<p>Here are some quick settings changes you should make when you start playing Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Autohide’ Quick Slots to increase visibility</li>



<li>‘Always Shown’ Stamina and Stance icons</li>



<li>‘Always Shown’ Health Condition</li>



<li>‘Polychrome’ Health Color Scheme, making it easier to see what’s injured</li>



<li>‘Head Bobbing’ set to 0.2, as low as possible</li>



<li>‘FOV’ should be between 66 – 70</li>



<li>‘Malfunction Notifications’ On</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s the full breakdown of the best Escape from Tarkov starter tips. I hope this helps you get started in your first wipe – or your first wipe <strong>back</strong>. Have fun out there!</p>
