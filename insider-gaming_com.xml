<p>A Pokémon&nbsp;and LEGO pairing was inevitable. The two media mammoths have finally come together to deliver a range of stunning LEGO sets, bringing out the best of brick-building and beloved ‘Mon. This guide has details on every Pokémon set, how much each one costs, and how to order them.</p>



<p>March 18 was a historic day as it was the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO x Pokémon partnership.</a> The era of Pokémon x Mega Bloks is sadly over, but as one legacy ends, a new one begins. LEGO has long been at the forefront of the premium, brick-building pastime.</p>



<p>The first-ever LEGO Pokémon Sets took a while to emerge from Viridian Forest, but they’re in the wild.</p>

<p>Eevee is set #72151 and requires you to battle with 587 pierces to complete. This is likely only the beginning of the Eevee line, with the Eeveelutions surely to follow. For now, enjoy one of the cutest and most adorable Pokémon ever created.</p>







<h3 id="h-pikachu-and-poke-ball">Pikachu and Poké Ball</h3>

<p>Could you really have the first-ever LEGO Pokémon sets and not include at least one Pikachu model? This set is number #72152, has 2,050 pieces, and ensures the face of the franchise is featured in this fresh chapter.</p>

<p>Now for the fun part: Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise. It was back in 2025 that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-pokemon-prices-have-possibly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Pokémon prices leaked and included a $649.99</a> item. The rumors were true, and the monstrous starter evolution set (#72153) has 6,838 pieces! </p>



<h3 id="h-kanto-region-badge-collection">Kanto Region Badge Collection</h3>

<p>#40892 is the Kanto Region Badge Collection, and is one of two items that can’t be purchased. Its 312 pieces are reserved for customers who purchase the LEGO Pokémon Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set—a heavy price for greatness.</p>



<h3 id="h-mini-pokemon-center">Mini-Pokémon&nbsp;Center</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to LEGO</figcaption></figure>



<p>The fifth and final set in the first LEGO Pokémon collection is the Mini-Pokémon&nbsp;Center—otherwise known as #40911. Again, just like the Kanto Region Badge Collection set, you can’t buy this beauty outright. More on this below.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-pre-order-lego-pokemon-sets">How To Pre-Order LEGO Pokémon Sets</h2>



<p><strong>To pre-order LEGO Pokémon Sets, you need to either go directly to the official LEGO online store in your region or find an applicable outlet that stocks LEGO Pokémon Sets.</strong></p>



<p>The official LEGO website is the handy hub for all LEGO Pokémon sets. A dedicated <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LEGO Pokémon</a> section has all the sets you can buy, and information on the special mini-sets. Do note that everything will usually be full price here, but you can score LEGO Insiders Points with every purchase—used to get discounts on future sets, gain access to unique sets, and earn rewards.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can pop into nearby physical stores to see if you can pre-order any of the LEGO Pokémon Sets to pick up in person, and there’s the option to pre-order using a different online outlet.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-do-lego-pokemon-sets-cost-price-amp-how-to-get-explained">How Much Do LEGO Pokémon Sets Cost? Price &amp; How To Get, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The first LEGO Pokémon sets range from $59.99 to a whopping $649.99 for the most expensive</strong> <strong>set.</strong></p>



<p>A major and obvious downside was always going to happen with official LEGO Pokémon sets: High costs that get much bigger the more advanced the set gets.</p>



<p>To make this easy, here’s a handy table showing the Pokémon sets with all necessary details.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">LEGO Pokémon Set Name</th><th data-align="center">How To Get</th><th data-align="center">Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Eevee</td><td data-align="center">Buy normally.</td><td data-align="center">$59.99 / £54.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu and Poké Ball</td><td data-align="center">Buy normally.</td><td data-align="center">$199.99 / £179.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise</td><td data-align="center">Buy normally.</td><td data-align="center">$579.99 / £9.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kanto Region Badge Collection</td><td data-align="center">Special gift with purchases of the Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set.</td><td data-align="center">Not available to purchase.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mini-Pokémon&nbsp;Center</td><td data-align="center">Can be bought for 2,500 LEGO Insiders Points.</td><td data-align="center">Not available to purchase.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
