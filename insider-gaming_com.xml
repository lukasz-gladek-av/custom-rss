<p>It seems Rainbow Six Siege players are being banned again; what’s more, the ban is for 67 days, inspired by the viral ’67’ meme. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Rainbow Six Siege servers shut down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-hack-servers-shut-down-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after a massive hack</a> late last month, which led to multiple developer-only skins, billions of credits, and bans. Siege and the Marketplace were intentionally shut down while the team resolved the issue; however, it appears Ubisoft hasn’t yet reached a solution. </p>







<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-siege-hands-out-67-day-bans-inspired-by-viral-67-meme">Rainbow Six Siege Hands Out 67-Day Bans, Inspired by Viral “67” Meme</h2>



<p>If you haven’t heard about the viral ‘6-7’ trend, then you are better off not knowing about it; however, it has somehow made its way into Rainbow Six Siege in the most surprising way possible, with several players reportedly receiving 67-day bans. The cause for these bans is unclear; however, a screenshot posted by vxunderground on <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/2007891913425531290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/rainbow-six/rainbow-six-siege-hacked-again-as-breach-triggers-67-day-bans-3300391/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> reveals that these 67-day bans are being handed out “due to harassment”. Additionally, if players head to the Rainbow Six Siege <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">status</a> page, they will see “4 unplanned issues” across every platform the game is available on. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege has been compromised (again). Social media is filled with players complaining about being banned for "67 days", a reference to the "Six Seven" meme. <a href="https://t.co/1gYvvoU3WT">pic.twitter.com/1gYvvoU3WT</a></p>— vx-underground (@vxunderground) <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/2007891913425531290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Due to the appearance of the viral meme number 67, players believe Rainbow Six Siege has been hacked again. However, Ubisoft has yet to confirm that it has been hacked again. To fix the earlier issue, Ubisoft had begun a “rollback of all transactions” that occurred after the hack, followed by extensive quality control tests “to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.”</p>







<p>In other news, Rainbow Six Mobile will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-mobile-releasing-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release globally in February 2026</a>. Players in Canada, France, Poland, and LATAM can download and play the test version of the game now. What are your thoughts on Rainbow Six Siege players receiving viral ’67’ meme-inspired bans?

<p>CES 2026 is here and that means another keynote speech from Nvidia. While, usually, CEO Jensen Huant takes the stag and reveals a brand new graphics card for players, that won’t be the case this year.</p>



<p>Shortly before the company’s scheduled keynote on Monday, Nvidia confirmed that no new GPUs will be announced during the event. There also won’t be any sort of GPU announcement during Nvidia’s <a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGeForce/status/2008176911747371438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2008176911747371438%7Ctwgr%5E4123a5ccd62e9a05d4cd884725a5b1bd7c63d3e5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvideocardz.com%2Fnewz%2Fnvidia-confirms-no-rtx-50-super-gpus-at-ces-2026-but-promises-updates-for-gamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GeForce On community update</a> broadcast on Monday night.</p>







<p>That means that the rumored RTX 50 Super graphics card isn’t coming just yet. As far as what is coming, Nvidia is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-to-reveal-dlss-4-5-at-ces-2026/">expected to unveil DLSS 4.5</a> during the annual event. The major update to the technology will include newer Super Resolution paths as well as the ability for RTX 50 series cards to generate up to six times the number of frames. </p>



<p>While no new graphics cards might be disappointing to some, it doesn’t feel like much of a surprise. The consumer electronics industry, specifically PCs, is going through a tumultuous time. The continued rise of AI and Data Centers have made components like storage, memory, and others in scarce supply. That’s led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extreme price increases</a>, leaving regular enthusiasts out in the cold. </p>

<p>A new datamine has revealed Monster Hunters Wilds Switch 2 port details, and it seems the game could run at 30FPS with DLSS enabled on Nintendo’s latest console. </p>



<p>Rumours about a Monster Hunter Wilds Switch 2 port have been circulating for a while now, with dataminers constantly providing new details through the latest update. One of the recent posts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pyv6pp/more_info_on_mh_wilds_for_switch_2_including/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> discusses Monster Hunter: Wilds Switch 2 data on local multiplayer, DLSS, NPC Culling, and more. Now, details on the graphics preset have also surfaced online. </p>

<p>Spotted by Necrolipe on <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/2007523103845253447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/evidence-grows-for-a-nintendo-switch-2-port-of-monster-hunter-wilds-including-a-glimpse-at-how-it-could-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the Chinese group responsible for the recent Monster Hunter Wilds datamines has revealed graphics details for the Switch 2 port. The details revealed that the game will run at 30 FPS with DLSS enabled and at 1080p when docked. It is said to have “better fidelity” than the ‘very low’ graphics preset for the PC version of the game. Necrolipe’s post also provides a video based on the datamining preset; however, it doesn’t represent the final version of the port. </p>

<p>It doesn’t seem too far-fetched for Capcom to create a Switch 2 port for Monster Hunter Wilds, considering they have already planned Day One releases for their next flagship title, Resident Evil Requiem, as well as Pragmata, Monster Hunter Stories 3, and Mega Man. Additionally, the developers have also revealed that Resident Evil Village and Resident Evil 7 Biohazard will also be released on the platform alongside Requiem. </p>







<p>In other news, Monster Hunter Wilds received its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-4-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Title Update 4</a> last month, along with a roadmap for the following updates. Additionally, Monster Hunter Wilds was the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-showcase-announced-for-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game of 2025&nbsp;</a>earlier in the year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>CES 2026 is here, and Nvidia is set to reveal its latest major update to its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology with DLSS 4.5.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-dlss-4-5-to-feature-2nd-gen-transformer-model-and-dynamic-6x-frame-generation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videocardz</a>, DLSS 4.5 will feature “changes centered on Super Resolution and a new ‘Dynamic Multi Frame Generation’ path”.</p>







<p>With Super Resolution, Nvidia is moving to a “2nd generation transformer” model that will cover more failure cases while using larger datasets. The goal of the updated technology is to offer “better temporal stability, less ghosting, and cleaner anti-aliasing”. Regarding Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, users will see three-to-six times more frames, depending on their settings. </p>



<p>DLSS 4.5 will be available through the Nvidia app, and will have day-one launch support for a number of games. The Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, however, is coming later on. </p>



<p><strong>“Nvidia also says that users will be able to set a target FPS in the app up to the display’s maximum refresh rate, with the feature dynamically adjusting how many frames are generated to meet that goal,”</strong> the report says.</p>







<p>DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution will be available for all GeForce RTX GPUs from the 20 series through 50 and beyond. That said, the new frame generation features are available exclusively for RTX 50 graphics cards, and will be available in Spring 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Sales Estimate Hits 12 MILLION As New Peak Player Record Looms]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/</link>
            <guid>1397356</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is proving to be the gift that keeps on giving. In the last 24 hours, at the time of writing, the game soared to a peak player count of 466,372 users on Steam. That’s ever-so-slightly behind the all-time peak of 481,000 secured just after launch in November 2025.</p>



<p>In a recent data-driven estimation, it was claimed that ARC Raiders might have surpassed <strong>12 million sales</strong> in just over two months, a whopping 53.5% of which have landed on <strong>Steam</strong>. It was also claimed that the game is enjoying a daily active user count of a staggering 3.2 million gamers.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-continues-to-shatter-expectations">ARC Raiders Continues To Shatter Expectations</h2>



<p>When ARC Raiders was released on October 30, no one thought it would reach such lofty heights. It has become known as one of the (if not <strong>the</strong>) best extraction games ever made. The accessibility of the game has introduced millions of extraction novices to a genre previously populated almost exclusively by crushing and challenging titles.</p>



<p>Things have changed, and ARC Raiders is here not just to stay, but to evolve.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a recent post on social media, Alinea Analytics’ Rhys Elliot <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3mbocqp3vzc2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published a graphic</a> showcasing some pretty stellar figures.</p>



<p>First, it was estimated that ARC Raiders now sits at a total sales count of 12 million units across Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox. It has made Embark Studios around $350 million, and it enjoys a daily active user count of 3.2 million players.</p>



<p>It was theorized that a sizeable discount over the festive period, a 20% price reduction, drove additional sales through December. The arrival of Cold Snap, the Flickering Flames event, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-second-expedition-window-confirmed/">first Expedition Project</a>, and a new Raider Deck all combined forces to welcome back stacks of players to the game that <strong>some </strong>thought was starting to slow down.</p>



<p>Far from it, though. Embark Studios has a stunning amount of content in the pipeline and is only just getting started with ARC Raiders. This post-apocalyptic extraction adventure title has legs that stretch on ad infinitum, and it’s easy to see why the developer originally pledged to support the game for ‘years to come’.</p>
