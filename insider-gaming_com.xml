<p>Several builds of unreleased games have been uploaded to an undisclosed datamining discord server, including Riot Games’ 2XKO.</p>



<p>So far, Insider Gaming has been able to verify that early builds of the following games have been uploaded to the server:</p>



<ul>
<li>Killing Floor 3 </li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/riot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games</a>‘ 2XKO</li>



<li>PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback</li>



<li>Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders </li>



<li>An early build of Delta Force Hawk Ops</li>
</ul>



<p>According to one source that’s in the server, uploads of the games builds are primarily used for datamining purposes, but some games with less protection will likely get leaked online. Either way, it looks like all of these games will have new bits of information leaked about them in the near future.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on where all of the builds originated, but according to other sources, 2XKO, PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback, and ARC Raiders have all recently been in a wider pool of playtesting.</p>



<p>Should any of the games leak, we will keep you updated.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has pushed out a limited-time event in Escape from Tarkov, setting bosses to a 100% spawn rate for a single day. One of the biggest talking points coming out of this spontaneous change is that PvE players have once again missed out on the event, for reasons unknown.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov stressed that as a wipe progresses in Tarkov, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/">around 50% of players</a> are locked in on the PvE platform. It comes as a surprise to learn that all those players are missing out on this latest Tarkov event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pushed-aside">Pushed Aside</h2>



<p>The newest <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1903734472383590723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Escape from Tarkov event</a> is a simple thing that allows boss characters to spawn on their respective maps with a rate of 100%. Every raid you enter is guaranteed to have a boss in it – unless you’re too late to reach them, of course.</p>



<p>However, fans are up in arms on social platforms because once again, Battlestate Games has neglected to loop in the PvE-based players for this event. This is far from being the first time this has happened, but this time around, it makes <strong>no sense</strong>.</p>



<p>Typically, PvE players miss out on pre-wipe events <strong>because their games won’t automatically reset</strong>, but this is a limited-time, one-off event that’s disconnected from any major update.</p>



<p>Fans are yet to determine <strong>why </strong>this Escape from Tarkov event has been pushed live, as it’s out of the blue and serves no purpose other than giving players a tighter challenge and helping them out with some ‘boss kill’ tasks.</p>



<p>Are you one of the many people playing PvE in Escape from Tarkov? Are you annoyed at missing this event? Let me know in the comments how you feel about it all.</p>

<p>Mojang has revealed the ghastling, a new creature coming to Minecraft in a future update. It’s an adorable take on the creepy mob that floats around the Nether, and you can bring it back into the Overworld and ride it around as much as you like. There are a few steps to accomplish first, though – but when is the Minecraft ghast update happening to introduce the new mob?</p>



<p>Mojang was quick to point out the benefits of having a happy ghast on your side in Minecraft, as it unlocks a few benefits, such as being able to build from its back in survival mode.</p>



<p>Read on to learn when and how you’ll be able to get a dried ghast and turn it into a ghastling.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-a-dried-ghast-in-minecraft">How to Get a Dried Ghast in Minecraft</h2>



<p><strong>The best expectation we have of when the Minecraft update for the dried ghast is coming is ‘later in 2025’.</strong> Mojang said the update is coming later this year, and mentioned that it’ll be available for testing soon. I could imagine it’ll arrive in a summer update.</p>



<p>Mojang has given us the <strong>what </strong>but not the <strong>when </strong>or <strong>how.</strong> We know that the dried ghast (and by association, ghastling and happy ghast) will be added in a future update, but the release date for the ghastling mob hasn’t been confirmed.</p>



<p>Otherwise known as a baby ghast in Minecraft, the happy ghast starts life as a dried ghast, a shrivelled, sad thing living in the Nether. It’s a block, so you’ll need to grab it and bring it back into the Overworld through a Nether Portal, before cheering it up by rehydrating it.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>To rehydrate the dried ghast, you’ll need to submerge it in water and leave it there for a few days. It’ll become happier and then eventually, it’ll burst out of the water as a new creature.</p>



<p>At that point, it’ll become a ghastling, which is your ‘baby ghast’. From there, it’ll evolve further into a happy ghast, and you’ll be free to put a harness on it and mount up, flying around the Overworld as you see fit. To get the happy ghast, you have to keep the ghastling happy by cooling it with snowballs and water.</p>



<p>All this information was revealed in the latest <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-live-2025-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Minecraft Live recap</a>. </p>



<p>But <strong>when is the happy ghast Minecraft update coming?</strong> I’m not sure, but you’ll be able to find out soon if you bookmark this page.</p>
