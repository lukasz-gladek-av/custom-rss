            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last week, Embark Studios released the North Line update for ARC Raiders, the electrifying new extraction shooter. This update introduced the Stella Montis map, an intense facility carved into a mountainside high above all the other maps.</p>



<p>Despite being a PvP haven and a massive threat that features the new deadly ARC enemy, the Shredder, Stella Montis has been visited ‘over 25 million’ times.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-players-love-stella-montis">ARC Raiders Players Love Stella Montis</h2>



<p>Stella Montis is a stark contrast to the other maps in ARC Raiders, simply because it’s all internal and highly scientific. It’s not representative of the ruined world that sits in the Rust Belt, reflected in the likes of Blue Gate and Buried City. Instead, Stella Montis is a harsh, industrial, clinical environment with tight corridors, multiple levels, and plenty of PvP opportunities.</p>



<p>In a recent graphic published by Embark Studios, it was revealed that the new map has been visited more than 25 million times. It’s a fan favorite where PvP is concerned, so that’s most likely what the majority of those visits were for. There are also some new quests on Stella Montis that need to be completed, as well as stacks of loot <strong>unique </strong>to that map.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Elsewhere in the numbers, we learned that a whopping 26,923 Matriarch enemies have been eliminated, and a whopping 2.2 million Raiders (including myself) have been knocked down by the Shredder, the <strong>newest </strong>minor ARC enemy.</p>



<p>It’s small but extremely mighty.</p>



<p>Additionally, 37,218 Raiders managed to down themselves with the Deadline, the new hyper-powerful mine added with the North Line update, and a further 117 downed themselves with… rocks.</p>







<p>That’s right – <strong>rocks</strong>. Embark has no idea how they did that either.</p>



<p>What’s your fondest moment from Stella Montis? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> how you’re enjoying the map.</p>

<p>The journey in Pokémon Legends: Z-A is not yet over, with additional content coming in the Mega Dimension DLC, and we’ve got all the release date details you need.</p>



<p>The Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon Legends: Z-A is bringing a bunch of returning Pokémon to the game, alongside a new story to uncover and new legends to hunt down, expanding on the hours of content the game already has to offer.</p>



<p>If you can’t wait for the release date of Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s Mega Dimension DLC and want to know what time it will be available, we have all the details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Jump in. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A will be released on December 10, bringing a host of new content to the game.</strong></p>



<p>The paid-for DLC, which was initially announced before the game’s launch, and the full release date were announced earlier this month alongside a new trailer.</p>



<p>In the Mega Dimension DLC, a new adventure across a weird zone known as Hyperspace Lumiose beckons, with new Mega Evolution Pokémon to discover, including two Mega Raichu forms, and battles against powerful Pokémon that exceed the level 100 cap for the first time in the franchise’s history.</p>







<p><strong>The official start time for the Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC has not been announced. However, based on past DLCs on Nintendo Switch platforms, we’ve got a fairly solid estimate.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike the main releases of Legends: Z-A, which had a staggered release globally, the Mega Dimension DLC will be released simultaneously worldwide, meaning you won’t be able to take advantage of a New Zealand or Australian Nintendo account to jump in early.</p>



<p>Based on previous DLC releases on Switch consoles, including Scarlet and Violet’s The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk, we expect the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC to be available from 8 PM PT on December 9. </p>



<p>These times are not confirmed, however, and we’ll update this article accordingly if Pokémon provides an official release time.</p>



<p>The table below shows the expected start time for the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Mega Dimension DLC Expected Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">8 PM – Dec. 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">10 PM – Dec. 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Dec. 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3 AM – Dec. 10</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – Dec. 10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steams-highest-peak-player-count-game-of-2025-might-surprise-you/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam%E2%80%99s-highest-peak-player-count-game-of-2025-might-surprise-you.1357756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We can picture it now: You’ve come into this news story all guns blazing, thinking you’ve cracked it. Steam is one of the biggest and most consistent metrics for measuring player numbers, but the platform’s biggest peak game of 2025 shocked us a bit.</p>



<p>What another incredible year for gaming releases. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> proves once again that it’s the king (Queen, in this case) of roguelikes, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a game for the ages, and the list honestly goes on. But everyone is always amped up by a game’s first week of release and what its peak player count is—using it as a barometer for success.</p>



<p>Pretty much every major release of 2025 has happened now, and Steam’s highest-peak game might raise an eyebrow or two.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-has-the-highest-steam-peak-of-any-new-2025-game">Monster Hunter Wilds Has The Highest Steam Peak Of Any New 2025 Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption> Wild(s). Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Capcom takes the crown for a new game with the highest Steam peak in 2025! Monster Hunter Wilds continued its mainstream success spectacularly in 2025. The action game reached an all-time peak of 1,384,608, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>To put this into context, this is the fifth-highest peak in Steam history!</p>



<p>Another incredible fact is that one of the games you’d think might have been the peak game barely managed half of Wilds’ total—Battlefield 6. The return of EA’s shooter has blown everyone away, and we’d argue it’s taken the crown as the shooter of 2025: We can hear angry ARC Raiders fans sharpening tools in the background.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s highest Steam peak is <strong>747,440</strong>, and other big games in 2025 haven’t fared too badly either: Hollow Knight: Silksong hit <strong>587,150</strong>, ARC Raiders stole <strong>481,966</strong> of you at once, and even indie hit Schedule 1 cooked up an impressive <strong>459,075</strong> players.</p>



<p>Nothing even got close to 1 million, but Monster Hunter Wilds shrugged off the challenge in style. It is also still <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-still-2025s-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025’s best-selling game</a>, which probably helps.</p>



<p>What did you think the answer was going to be? Have any of these figures caught you off guard? Let us know what you think of this fact.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale was the once-canceled dream that is now fully back in development. A new, lengthy gameplay trailer has been released, not only showing more of the game, but also saying that early access is on the horizon.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games shut down Hypixel Studios</a> in June 2025, effectively ceasing Hytale’s development. It was showing a lot of promise, but the game—based on the Minecraft&nbsp;multiplayer server&nbsp;Hypixel—suddenly went up in smoke. The dream was revived in November 2025, and to show that the game is back, a new gameplay trailer is out.</p>



<h2 id="h-hytale-is-back-in-development-with-early-access-promised">Hytale Is Back In Development With Early Access Promised</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hytale was heavily inspired by Minecraft. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>We reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was back after being reacquired by Hypixel Studios</a>—rebought by founder Simon “Hypixel” Collins-Laflamme. The new ‘Breaking the Curse’ gameplay trailer shows off 16 minutes of pixel-perfect gameplay.</p>



<p>It has sword and shield action, combat rolling, exploration, tree chopping, dark and spooky forests, and everything you’re likely looking for.</p>



<p>Check out the full 16 minutes of Hytale gameplay right here.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Breaking the Curse | New Hytale Gameplay (16+ Minutes)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhaqjb_S2X8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>We checked the video’s description to look for any extra action or developments. Our pixelated jaws dropped when we read: “This is the original legacy engine from the 2018 trailer, running on a four-year-old build as we push Hytale forward again. There’s a long road ahead, <strong>but early access is coming soon.</strong>“</p>



<p>It’s vague, which is understandable considering how fast this is all happening, but it offers assurances that Hytale is moving in the right direction.</p>



<p>Founder Simon also added this to the Hytale gameplay video:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I promised players videos, screenshots and blog posts. One day after the acquisition, I’m keeping that promise. Now that you’ve seen the first gameplay footage in a long time, I’m heading back to work on the early access launch. The team will share more clips and screenshots as we go. It mattered to me to release raw footage today so we break the curse once and for all.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re yet to complete The Simpsons Battle Pass in Fortnite this season, Epic Games has a treat for you as 80,000 worth of XP is available for free—but only for a limited time.</p>



<p>Fortnite is currently in the midst of The Simpsons mini-season, with Springfield taking over the Island, but the end is in sight with a huge end-of-chapter event poised to take place on November 29, opening the gate for the launch of Chapter 7.</p>



<p>Ahead of that huge event, Epic Games is seeking players to test the experience, and is offering a hefty 80,000 XP as an incentive.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1990865563652968596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite Status page on X</a> (formerly Twitter) announced the incentive as part of a stress test for servers ahead of the end-of-chapter event, which is expected to attract thousands of players across the world.</p>



<p>Available on November 19th and 20th at 1:40 PM ET, the ‘Epic Event Test’ playlist will appear in Fortnite for players to join and help Epic Games “prepare for an awesome live event.”</p>



<p>Joining the event won’t provide spoilers for the live event, as it won’t actually be shown, and is instead to “help slam server configurations to make sure everything runs smoothly.”</p>



<p>The final major patch of The Simpsons mini-season, and the final patch before the end-of-chapter event, is taking place today, and it’s expected several spoilers will emerge as a result across social media—so keep away if you don’t want anything ruined.</p>



<p>Plenty has already emerged ahead of the launch of Chapter 7, which will reportedly include a revamp to the revive system, along with collaborations with the likes of Harry Potter and SpongeBob SquarePants.</p>
