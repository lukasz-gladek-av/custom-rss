<p>CD Projekt Red’s recent statements indicate that The Witcher 4 could target next-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as its release window has been pushed past 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-sometime-in-2027-at-the-soonest-cd-projekt-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>, CD Projekt Red discussed The Witcher 4’s release window during their latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DY-Q-Wd3Hz4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a>. During their presentation, the developers explicitly stated that the game would not arrive in 2026 twice, leading players to believe that the developers are targeting a 2027 release window and possibly next-gen consoles, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the segment about CD Projekt Group’s incentive program B, it was stated, “Even though we do not plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026, we are still driven by this financial goal.” Then, during the Q&amp;A section, CD Projekt Red’s chief financial officer, Piotr Nielubowicz, stated, “We are not going to announce the precise launch date for the game yet.”</p>



<p>Nielubowicz added that right now, all they can share for “more visibility to investors” is that The Witcher 4 will not be released “within the time frame of the first target for the incentive program, which ends December 31, 2026.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, CD Projekt Red has four different The Witcher projects in the works. The Witcher 4 is in the production stage, Project Sirius is in pre-production, and The Witcher Remake is in the concept phase. Cyberpunk’s Project Orion is also in the concept phase, and their new IP, Project Hadar, is in the IP concept phase.&nbsp;</p>
