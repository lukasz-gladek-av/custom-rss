<p>Shovel Knight developers have revealed that Mina the Hollower is going to be their ‘make or break’ moment. </p>



<p>A new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment?srnd=homepage-asia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reveals that Shovel Knight dev, Yacht Club Games, might be in trouble if their next title, Mina the Holler, doesn’t perform well. For those unaware, Mina the Hollower was delayed indefinitely last month, just weeks before its previous release date. </p>

<p>The new report first describes how the developers invited Schreier over to showcase their title, only for the conference room to fill with smoke. The game was still demoed after, to show where the developers stand at the moment and why they have to delay the game further. </p>



<p>The report reveals that only in the past weeks has the game reached a point where the Shovel Knight developers were able to play all the content from start to end. During this process, they have identified several areas that need improvement. However, they have only identified all the problems and will need some more time to fix them. </p>



<p>Shovel Knight developers can only remain independent if Mina the Hollower is a success. The dev studio has already undergone downsizing and now has only 15 employees left, with finances at a low point as well. The co-founder, Sean Velasco, has stated, “It’s make-or-break for sure,” adding that if the game sells 500,000 copies, they are golden; if it sells 200,000, they are still happy; however, if they sell only 100,000, that could be a problem. </p>
