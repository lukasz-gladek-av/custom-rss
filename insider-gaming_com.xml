<p>New Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma gives her stance on AI. She also firmly believes that human beings are the ones responsible for great stories in gaming.</p>



<p>On February 20, 2026, Xbox underwent a great restructuring that led to Phil Spencer’s retirement. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sarah-bond-shares-memo-to-her-team-following-departure-at-xbox/" id="178381">Sarah Bond, former Xbox president</a>, also stepped down. In their place, Asha Sharma has been named new EVP and CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p>







<h2 id="h-asha-sharma-s-vision-for-xbox-and-the-future-of-microsoft-gaming">Asha Sharma’s Vision for Xbox and the Future of Microsoft Gaming</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-xbox-games-ai-1236668829/">Variety</a>, Sharma, who was previously the head of CoreAI at Microsoft, commented on her stance on AI in gaming. She admits the industry is in a tumultuous place but remains optimistic and open-minded about the future.</p>



<p>Speaking of the future, while she does have a background in AI, she also has no tolerance for “bad AI.” Furthermore, she also believes in protecting what she believes in. As that pertains to AI, she is cognisant that AI is part of gaming’s future, as it has played a role in its past. Still, she believes humans tell good stories.</p>



<p>“AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be,” Sharma said, noting that gaming needs new “growth engines,” but that “great stories are created by humans.”</p>

<p>Sarah Bond resigned from Xbox amid a restructuring that led to Phil Spencer’s retirement. Bond shared her full memo to her Xbox team on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarahrbond_sharing-with-gratitude-the-note-i-sent-to-activity-7430753683912531968-YEXj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAGBVXOMBvz_qCqVv-uRJAvpCCT5UFNbGSog">LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>“Hi team,</p>



<p>I know there’s a lot of news to take in today.</p>



<p>I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together over the past eight-plus years. PC and cloud gaming are growing faster than ever, our next console is well underway, and together we’ve helped lay the foundation for a more open gaming platform that spans devices and reaches players around the world.</p>



<p>When we announced our intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in 2022, I committed to helping lead Xbox through what would be a critical period of change. Over the past four years, we’ve navigated that moment together and positioned the business for what comes next. We took on some of the biggest challenges this organization has ever faced and did it as one team.</p>



<p>With that, I’ve decided this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally. We’re living through a transformative technological era that will shape the next generation of our industry, and I’m energized by what’s ahead. This moment also presents a unique opportunity for fresh eyes and new leadership to guide the team into its next chapter. I’ve had the privilege of spending time with Asha over the last few weeks as we’ve planned for this transition, and I’ve seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand. She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this. I’m excited to see her lead this next chapter for our team. I’ll remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition and set the organization up for continued success.</p>



<p>I want to thank Phil for his mentorship and friendship over the years. He’s been a consistent champion of this business and the people who make it what it is, and I’ve learned a great deal from the way he leads through both opportunity and challenge. I’m grateful for his trust and support throughout my time on the team. I also want to thank Satya for his sponsorship and support throughout my time at Microsoft.</p>



<p>As I prepare to sign off, I’ve been reflecting on three simple questions I’ve tried to use to guide my days:</p>



<p>Did I bring my best?<br>Did I help someone else succeed?<br>Did I do my best work?</p>



<p>I hope the answer has been yes for many of you. It’s been a privilege to work alongside this team.</p>



<p>Always,<br>Sarah”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embark-confirms-arc-raiders-no-aggression-matchmaking/</link>
            <guid>1442419</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought you were tricking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a> into sorting you into PvE-focused lobbies, you’re mistaken. It has been confirmed directly from the source at Embark Studios that the popular extraction adventure game <strong>does not do that</strong>. It’s just a coincidence that you’re being filed in with players who want a more peaceful time of things.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">Embark Studios’</a> design director, Virgil Watkins, confirmed that Aggression-Based Matchmaking (or ABMM, to keep it simple) is <strong>not a thing </strong>in ARC Raiders. It’s not binary, and you don’t get <strong>either </strong>friendly or violent lobbies when you explore the world outside Speranza.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-doesn-t-have-friendly-lobbies">ARC Raiders Doesn’t Have Friendly Lobbies</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-full-interview-nobody-whatsoever-thought-wed-have-this-many-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer interview</a> with Embark Studios, it was <strong>confirmed </strong>in clear terms that ARC Raiders <strong>does not </strong>use Aggression-Based Matchmaking to funnel players into their matches.</p>



<p>This was confirmed by Virgil Watkins, the outspoken Embark developer who has been a fountain of knowledge of late:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We didn’t coin the term aggression-based matchmaking.</p>



<p>It’s not nearly as binary as people think. There’s no such thing as a friendly lobby or an aggressive lobby; the system is still mixing everybody, and everything’s down to human motivation. Just because you’re tending toward the more peaceful end doesn’t remove the autonomy from other people making a choice about wanting your stuff.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Watkins’ terms, it might <em>feel </em>binary, but it’s not. You can’t shoot raiders and magically be put into a more PvP-focused lobby in the next round. He stressed it’s more <strong>nuanced</strong> than that, and what’s more, it’s constantly being evolved as the game matures. The team <strong>has </strong>noticed that players ‘have more fun’ in safer lobbies, but they’re not forcing it either way.</p>



<p>Later, Watkins stressed that it’s always up to the player how violent their lobbies are. It was pointed out that nobody is forcing you to shoot other players; that’s entirely up to you. He explained how certain groups of players will always feel more motivated to engage other players, but that’s their prerogative.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think we just have to primarily make sure that the PvP side of the game is as fair as we can make it.</p>



<p>We still have the mantra—and this is even regardless of the formation of this PvE-heavy audience—that the game never asks you to fight other players. That’s entirely your own decision. So you’re always going to have people who have the motivation to fight, because there are people who just like PvP. </p>



<p>I think we need to keep making sure we’re providing them with the tools and means to do that in an engaging way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was also made very clear that the end-of-round surveys that players are prompted to resolve do <strong>not </strong>have a bearing on matchmaking. If you were killed in a brutal bout of PvP and say that you hated the combat in that round, you won’t then be placed in a quieter, safer lobby the next go-around.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Those are just to help us gauge how players felt about the round. They have no mechanical change on what happens to you. It is solely based on your actions in the round. Those just go to our data team and help us pair up like things that occurred in the server.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Do you feel like Embark Studios is being as up front as possible about ABMM in ARC Raiders, or do you still suspect it plays a major role in matchmaking? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Following Phil Spencer’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-sarah-bond-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retirement announcement</a>, Matt Booty has been named EVP and Chief Content Officer of Microsoft Gaming. Below is his full <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">internal memo.</a></p>



<p>“I read Phil’s note with much gratitude. He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I’ve learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support. I’m also grateful to Satya for his ongoing commitment to gaming and holding a vision of how it can connect back to the larger company.</p>



<p>Looking forward, I’m excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success. She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.</p>



<p>We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.</p>



<p>My focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.</p>



<p>Thanks for everything you do for players and for each other.</p>



<p>Matt”</p>

<p>Following Phil Spencer’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-sarah-bond-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retirement announcement</a>, Asha Sharma has been named EVP and CEO of Microsoft Gaming. Below is her full <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">internal memo.</a></p>



<p>“Dear team,</p>



<p>Today I begin my role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p>



<p>I feel two things at once: humility and urgency.</p>



<p>Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.</p>



<p>I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connects people and pushes the industry forward.</p>



<p>Thank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.</p>



<p>My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it.</p>



<p>That starts with three commitments.</p>



<p>First, great games.</p>



<p>Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.</p>



<p>I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</p>



<p>Second, the return of Xbox.</p>



<p>We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world.</p>



<p>We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.</p>



<p>Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.</p>



<p>Third, future of play.</p>



<p>We are witnessing the reinvention of play.</p>



<p>To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p>



<p>As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.</p>



<p>The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through. We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not.</p>



<p>Thank you for welcoming me into this journey.</p>
