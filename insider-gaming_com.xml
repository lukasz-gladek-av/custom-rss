<p>After a lengthy wait and a last-minute delay last month, Echoes of Elysium is finally poised to release in early access, with the release date and exact start times now confirmed.</p>



<p>The action-adventure RPG hands players their very own airship to customize and expand with crafting, weapons, and more, as you explore the world of Elysium, an environment full of mysteries to uncover.</p>



<p>If you’ve been anxiously waiting for the Echoes of Elysium release date, Insider Gaming has all the details on the exact start time, so you can work out exactly how many hours there are to wait.</p>

<p><strong>Echoes of Elysium is set for release on Tuesday, January 27, bringing an end to the long wait fans have had to endure.</strong></p>



<p>An initial early access release date was slated for December 4, before a last-minute announcement pushed the release date back to the above date.</p>



<p>The delay allowed the team to be “deeply focused on improving stability and overall game feel,” and was about “addressing real issues” so that when players jump in, the “experience is solid, reliable, and ready to grow.”</p>



<p>Tweaks include crash resolving and smoothing out rough systems, as well as porting the game entirely to a new version of Unity. The result is a build that is “significantly more stable” and “in a far better position,” so the delay has been worth the wait.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-echoes-of-elysium-release">What Time Does Echoes of Elysium Release?</h2>



<p><strong>Echoes of Elysium will be available worldwide from 10 AM PT on January 27, with a simultaneous release for players across the world.</strong></p>



<p>Details of the start time come from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2644050/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> and show that the time of day will vary depending on where you are in the world, with players in some regions only seeing the doors open for them to play in the early hours of January 28.</p>



<p>The table below shows the exact start time and release date for major time zones across the world.</p>

            <guid>1411702</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new gacha-RPG title is spinning onto the scene with the release of Arknights: Endfield, and a customary question to ask with every release is whether the title will be available with an Xbox Game Pass subscription.</p>



<p>Arknights: Endfield releases on January 22, expanding the Arknights universe on the back of the original game, which was released in China in May 2019 and in other countries in January 2020.</p>



<p>If you were a fan of that title and are keen to jump into Arknights: Endfield, Insider Gaming has all the details on whether the title is available with a Game Pass subscription.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-arknights-endfield-on-xbox-game-pass">Is Arknights: Endfield on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New journey. Image via GRYPHLINE</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Arknights: Endfield is not available on Xbox Game Pass, and it isn’t available on Xbox Series X|S at all.</strong></p>



<p>However, that doesn’t close the door entirely to Game Pass fans as, while it isn’t available on the service, Arknights: Endfield is available on PC, and it’s a free-to-play game, so you don’t need to splash out any additional funds to enjoy it.</p>



<p>While it won’t be available through Game Pass specifically, PC players can still enjoy it. Unfortunately, there’s no similar news for Xbox Series X|S players, as there is no indication the game will arrive on the console.</p>



<p>That might be frustrating for Xbox Series X|S players, particularly as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-platforms-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield is available on PlayStation 5</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-arknights-endfield-be-added-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Arknights: Endfield be Added to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It is unlikely that Arknights: Endfield will be added to the Xbox Game Pass service, as the free-to-play approach means it’s not necessary.</strong></p>



<p>Recent updates to the Xbox app on PC make it easy to launch games across different launchers, so putting the title on Game Pass wouldn’t make much difference, and, due to the free-to-play nature, there’s no need to add Arknights: Endfield to the service if a console release on Xbox Series X|S occurs later down the line.</p>



<p>Free games have been added to Game Pass in the past, however, often providing additional in-game bonuses, so this is a route that could appear in the future. For now, though, there is no indication that Arknights: Endfield will be available on Game Pass anytime soon.</p>

<p>A new leak has revealed how the Fortnite x Fall Guys collaboration will play out, and it will introduce a new game mode called Crown Jam. </p>



<p>Fall Guys had announced that they would be returning to Fortnite with a new collaboration, with something to do with a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fall-guys-and-fortnite-tease-new-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ball</a>” this time around. It was later leaked that ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pimlico-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pimlico</a>‘ was a working title for Crown Jam, the Fall Guys-themed game mode. Now, a leaked video has confirmed these details, with the new mode arriving on January 23, 2026. </p>







<p>The Fortnite x Fall Guys Crown Jam mode leak comes from Loolo_WRLD on <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/2013913593419378859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), who has seemingly got their hands on an IGN video describing the new game mode. The video explains that this is a 3v3 limited-time mode that blends basketball, football, and obstacle-course chaos, where the goal is to dunk the ball into the opposing team’s hoop. </p>



<p>The game mode will also introduce new physics for the Fall Guys game mode, allowing players to feel “every jump, tackle, and slam dunk”. There’s also a new mechanic called ‘Hype’, which can be increased by playing to unlock new abilities. The abilities include Big Bean, where the character becomes bigger, Bounce Pad, which allows them to jump higher, and Confetti Crash, which you can use to attack enemies. Players will be randomly assigned to one of 6 teams. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Fortnite x Fall Guys Crown Jam mode will release on January 23 and will only be available until February 9. </p>

<p>Arknights: Endfield has plenty for players to sink their teeth into, and a bunch of codes are available to redeem for handy bonuses to help your progression.</p>



<p>With so much to explore, it always helps to get everything you possibly can in your possession, and Insider Gaming has all the active codes to redeem in Arknights: Endfield.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-active-arknights-enfield-codes">All Active Arknights: Enfield Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Goodies. Image via Hyppergryph</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are several codes available to redeem in Arknights: Enfield, providing a boost of rewards, including various forms of currency.</strong></p>



<p>The majority are available for players across all platforms, though there is one additional PC-exclusive code. While some of the codes appear to be available permanently, others are limited-time and must be redeemed before the expiration date.</p>



<p>Once redeemed, all rewards must be claimed from the in-game mailbox within 30 days, or they will disappear, so it’s a good habit to claim the rewards immediately after redemption.</p>



<p>The table below shows all the active codes in Arknights: Enfield and the rewards earned for redemption.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-arknights-endfield-codes">How to Redeem Arknights: Endfield Codes</h2>



<p><strong>Code redemption in Arknights: Endfield is completed through a specific menu in the game, though it won’t be unlocked immediately.</strong></p>



<p>Early progression must be ticked off before the feature to redeem codes is made available, and more playtime is required to unlock the Mail feature, where bonuses can be claimed.</p>



<p>Here’s the step-by-step process to redeem codes in Arknights: Endfield.</p>



<ol>
<li>Play through the main story in Arknights Endfield until you complete the Valley Reboot mission.</li>



<li>In the menu, select the settings cog in the top-left of the screen.</li>



<li>Select the ‘Platform &amp; Account’ section.</li>



<li>Choose the ‘Exchange Code’ option.</li>



<li>Input the desired code.</li>



<li>Claim the rewards from your mailbox.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you’re yet to unlock the Mail feature, don’t worry, as any redeemed rewards will be waiting for you when you reach that stage in progression.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Life is Strange Fans Dismayed at Ashly Burch’s Absence from Reunion]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-fans-dismay-reunion-ashly-burch/</link>
            <guid>1411642</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Yesterday, Life is Strange: Reunion was unveiled in full, with Deck Nine and Square Enix revealing the next game in the decade-old franchise. It follows directly on from 2024’s Life is Strange: Double Exposure, and for the first time since 2017, it brings back Chloe Price, the other half of the ‘Pricefield’ ship.</p>



<p>She’ll join Max Caulfield in a race against time to once again save the world (or at least their little bit of it) from certain cataclysmic catastrophes. However, following the reveal, much of the Life is Strange community has shared a wave of disappointment about Ashly Burch, the original voice actor for Chloe Price, <strong>not </strong>reprising her role.</p>







<h2 id="h-chloe-price-will-not-be-played-by-ashly-burch">Chloe Price Will Not Be Played by Ashly Burch</h2>



<p>Ashly Burch brought Chloe Price to life in the original Life is Strange title, released in 2015. However, she was unable to reprise that role in 2017’s Life is Strange: Before the Storm, a prequel, because of an embroilment in a voice actor’s strike at the time. This meant that Rhianna DeVries stepped in and fulfilled the role, doing a fairly decent job overall.</p>



<p>Yesterday, when Deck Nine unveiled Life is Strange: Reunion, it went with the announcement that DeVries would be returning alongside Hannah Telle (Max Caulfield) to play Chloe Price.</p>



<p>Fans took to social media to stress their concerns about this decision, with many suggesting that it’s not a ‘true reunion’ if the original voice actor isn’t involved.</p>







<p>One distressed user wrote, ‘My expectations could not be lower for Life is Strange: Reunion. It’s hard to be excited after the last game, and now we know it’s not even Ashly Burch as Chloe… Like what the f*** are you guys doing?’</p>



<p>Another offered a lengthy explanation to cover the community’s dismay:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Life is strange bringing back Chloe due to fan backlash but still not giving enough of a s*** to fork up enough cash to hire her original voice actor whenever <strong>Ashly</strong> <strong>Burch</strong>’s performance was half the reason anyone even liked that character in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an attempt to dig deeper, one user raised a fair point:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Something definitely off with this game when Deck Nine brought back Rhianna DeVries for Chloe instead of <strong>Ashly</strong> <strong>Burch</strong> while there’s no SAG-AFTRA strike currently happening like during Before the Storm’s development.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For the diehard fans of Life is Strange, Reunion will be more or less a guaranteed purchase, even if it’s a reluctant one. The wrapping of Max and Chloe’s story is too much of a dramatic pull to be ignored, and it’s a sequence that’s almost a decade in the making (and wanting).</p>







<p>Will you still be buying Life is Strange: Reunion this March, even though Ashly Burch isn’t in it? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Bungie recently uncovered Marathon’s release date, and shortly after, the ability to pre-order the game went live on platforms like Steam. However, a strange backend bug caused <strong>Destiny 2 </strong>(also developed by Bungie to <strong>install </strong>on Steam when you pre-ordered Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter.</p>



<p>The strange bug was lauded on social media by fans and critics alike, with one user writing that preordering Marathon triggers a ‘virus called Destiny 2’ to install on your machine.</p>







<h2 id="h-bungie-fixes-marathon-bug">Bungie Fixes Marathon Bug</h2>



<p>Hours after the Steam bug went live, <strong>Bungie resolved the issue</strong>, also taking the time to address a concern where Collector’s Edition owners <strong>could not </strong>redeem their game code on Steam.</p>



<p>The team wrote on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector’s Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If there was one entertaining thing to come from the debacle, it was the slew of comments poking fun at the situation.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘Marathon’s development was so cursed it created a malevolent spirit in the code. If it catches you, it will force you to install Destiny 2.’</p>



<p>Another said, ‘Bungie trying to revive Destiny 2 by any means possible.’</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a pretty bizarre bug, especially given that, aside from the developer link, Destiny 2 and Marathon are totally separate from one another.</p>



<p>Recently, Bungie shared a new trailer for Marathon, also uncovering the game’s impending release date as March 5. To celebrate the game’s launch, PlayStation has created an exclusive line of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/limited-edition-marathon-dualsense-and-headset-revealed/">limited-edition peripherals</a>, which will be available to pre-order from January 29.</p>



<p>Let’s just hope that pre-ordering the limited edition controller won’t trigger the automatic purchase of a PlayStation Portal, or something.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marathon’s Recommended PC Specs Are Surprisingly Forgiving]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, Bungie unveiled the release date for Marathon, the studio’s stab at an extraction shooter, along with a brand-new trailer. Shortly after, the game’s Steam page was updated with a full spread of system requirements for PC players, and they’re remarkably forgiving.</p>



<p>One of the leading elements that’s driving prospective fans to Marathon is the game’s art style and visual palette, which apparently needs very little in the way of tech specs to run.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-pc-specs-confirmed-as-low-entry">Marathon PC Specs Confirmed as Low Entry</h2>



<p>On Steam, you can check out the full recommended PC specs for Marathon, noting that they’re extremely accessible. This continues a trend where new games are coming out with more forgiving minimum and recommended specification requirements, a fact that pleases gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>



<p><strong>Minimum Spec:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li>



<li>8 GB RAM</li>



<li>GTX 1050 Ti (4 GB) / RX 5500 XT (4 GB)</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>Recommended Spec:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Intel Core i5-10400 / Ryzen 5 3500</li>



<li>16 GB RAM</li>



<li>GTX 2060 (6 GB) / RX 5700 XT (8 GB)</li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/">recommended specs for Marathon</a> are centered around a CPU range that was released almost six years ago, and a GPU spread that dropped as far back as January 2019. That lowers the barrier massively for PC players wanting to get into Marathon, one of the most (tentatively) anticipated first-person extraction shooters coming out this year.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders, the extraction adventure title released by Embark Studios in October 2025, followed a similar pattern. For the recommended PC specs, ARC Raiders requests almost the same components.</p>



<p>By comparison, Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter that launched as a 1.0 game in November, has <strong>sky-high recommended specs</strong>. To run Escape from Tarkov at the optimum level, you need a 2024 CPU, an RTX 4070 ‘or better’, and a whopping 64 GB of RAM.</p>
