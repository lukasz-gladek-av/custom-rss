<p>The recent announcement of the full Esports World Cup 2026 lineup has rattled RTS fans worldwide. The team at the Esports World Cup Foundation recently unveiled the <strong>last game </strong>in the roster, <strong>Trackmania</strong>, which is set to appear at the event in Riyadh for the first time.</p>



<p>However, this reveal means that StarCraft II, the beloved RTS game, <strong>will not </strong>surface at this year’s Esports World Cup, despite being present for the first two. It gets worse, as with the full lineup having been published, we know that <strong>no other RTS game </strong>will be there to replace it.</p>











<p>For the first time since the inaugural Esports World Cup in 2023, no RTS title will take to any stage at the event this year. The EWCF uncovered Trackmania as an unexpected final addition to the star-studded spread of titles gracing the Esports World Cup, and in that moment, RTS fans worldwide fell to their knees (metaphorically, of course).</p>



<p>Across social media, fans have voiced their displeasure at the snub. Kaelaris, a popular commentator and host with a penchant for StarCraft II, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was already having a rough day but no StarCraft at EWC hurts.</p>



<p>I suspect that also means I won’t be doing any SC2 in 2026 since that was the only place nowadays that fancies taking a desk host for the game.</p>



<p>Despite getting to do it at EWC last year, effectively to me it feels like a part of my life perished and I feel like I’m almost in mourning for that aspect of my world. It’s not been easy for my brain to get over it. That’s as best I can describe it at least.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another post, creator and commentator Simon ‘Lowko’ Heijnen wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Very sad to not have StarCraft 2 or any other RTS game at the EWC this year. Especially considering views and interest has been up noticeably compared to a few years ago.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many were quick to point out that the Esports World Cup helped keep the competitive system afloat after waning interest and some tournament shutdowns. This is another major, international stage to be stripped from the RTS audience, and it’s a huge blow.</p>



<p>The Esports World Cup 2026 is shaping up to be the largest esports event ever held. But for many, it might be remembered as the year that the oldest competitive genre in esports was forgotten, pushed aside for an arcade racing game.</p>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was undoubtedly the hottest game of 2025, and now, thanks to the tracking of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/2025-video-game-awards-season-tracking-and-discussion-thread.1348411/">Rese</a><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/2025-video-game-awards-season-tracking-and-discussion-thread.1348411/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">t</a><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/2025-video-game-awards-season-tracking-and-discussion-thread.1348411/">Era, </a>it has been uncovered that the Sandfall Interactive-developed title has surpassed Elden Ring as the top game in history to win the most Game of the Year Awards. 436 outlets have awarded the title game of the year. Elden Ring previously had the record at 429 Game of the Year award wins.</p>



<p>Game of the Year Awards have been awarded to Expedition 33 by outlets such as Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards, Famitsu, GameSpot, IGN, Game Rant, GamesRadar+, and Esquire. Additionally, they were awarded Reader’s Choice Game of the Year awards by the readers here <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-insider-gaming-community-2025-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">at Insider Gaming</a>, Destructoid, Game Informer, and more.</p>

<p>As the awards keep rolling in for the game, the creative director behind the game, Guillaume Broche, said in a recent interview with Edge Magazine that the success of the game was a surprise to everyone on their team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“What really surprised us the most is how much the narrative and cinematics and story resonated with people. This is the thing that’s hardest to quantify, because it’s always something very personal. So the fact that this worked so well, pretty much instantly, this was the thing where we were like ‘Ok, this is one hundred times what we were expecting’,” he said <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-says-the-french-rpgs-success-was-completely-unexpected-from-pretty-much-everybody-at-the-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">(via GamesRadar+)</a></p>

<p>It hasn’t been all smooth sailing for RPG, however. The Indie Game Awards recently had to disqualify the game after discovering its use of generative AI.

<p>If you were hoping to play the new remakes of either Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas, don’t expect to play them anytime soon, according to a new report.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-bethesda-isnt-shadow-dropping-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-any-time-soon-heres-what-we-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden of Windows Central </a>recently stated that while the sought-after remakes are on the way, they are not slated for an imminent release and should not be expected in the near future.

<h2 id="h-how-bethesda-feels-about-the-future-of-the-fallout-franchise">How Bethesda Feels About the Future of the Fallout Franchise</h2>



<p>It is known that Bethesda is working on Fallout 5 and would ideally like players to spend many hours, potentially 600, playing that future title. It’s also been confirmed by Todd Howard that the next game will be tied into the ongoing Fallout television show.</p>



<p>As for other Fallout games,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Fallout 4 recently received a major patch from Bethesda</a>. There are also impressive mods for the game, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-no-interest-fallout-4-mod-london/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fallout: London</a>, even though Todd Howard has said he personally has no interest in that. </p>



<p>Also, Fallout 76 is slated to get a current-gen upgrade this year, and there is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-release-notes-pts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fallout 76: Burning Springs that was recently released. </a>Howard recently claimed that Fallout 76 was the game Bethesda was currently putting the most work into.</p>
