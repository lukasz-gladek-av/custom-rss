<p>During its CES 2025 keynote, Nvidia introduced DLSS 4, its next generation of deep learning super sampling. With features like the brand new multi frame generation, enhanced DLSS frame generation, and enhanced ray reconstruction and super resolution, many are obviously going to wonder what games and apps will support DLSS 4 right out of the box.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ray-tracing-rtx-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">part of its reveal</a>, Nvidia announced that 75 games and apps will get DLSS 4 at launch.

The series will also feature new names such as Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse, Ariela Barer as Mel, Tati Gabrielle as Nora, Spencer Lord as Owen and Danny Ramirez as Manny.

<p>Nvidia has officially unveiled its next-gen GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards at CES 2025. The reveal came during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k82RwXqZHY8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s CES keynote</a> from CEO Jensen Huang, and marks the first new GPU launch in over two years for the company</p>



<p>In total, the Nvidia announced four new graphics cards: RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070.</p>



<p>Available starting in January, the new Blackwell lineup of graphics cards range from $549 to $1,999. The flagship Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 will run $1,999. Following that is the RTX 5080 at $999; the RTX 5070 Ti at $749; and the RTX 5070 at $549. According to Huang, the RTX 5070 will give consumers performance equal to that of the last-gen RTX 4090 “thanks to AI”.</p>



<p>One thing to note is that when it comes to size, the RTX 5090 Founders Edition card is coming in much smaller than the last-gen 4090. This new card is just a two-slot card, allowing it to fit in smaller form-factor systems.</p>

<p>Sony is turning two popular game franchises into major motion pictures. During its CES 2025 keynote on Monday night, Sony announced that Helldivers and Horizon Zero Dawn are being turned into movies.</p>



<p>The Horizon film is being produced by Columbia Pictures and PlayStation Productions. Columbia Pictures is the studio that produced 2022’s Uncharted movie. PlayStation Productions is also handling the development of the Helldivers movie.</p>



<p>No other details about the movies were revealed at the time of the announcement.</p>



<p>Horizon Zero Dawn first launched in 2017 for PlayStation 4. The game was scheduled to get a series on Netflix before it was ultimately canceled. Now it moves to a live-action movie. </p>



<p>Helldivers, on the other hand, rose to unexpected prominence with the release of Helldivers 2 in February 2024. The game became the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, selling over 12 million copies in just 12 weeks. </p>

<p>If you’ve always wondered how much it costs to make a game in the Call of Duty franchise, now we have the answer. At least, a partial answer.</p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameFile</a>, the development costs and sales figures for some games in the Call of Duty franchise have been revealed. The figures were released by Patrick Kelly, the franchise’s current Creative Director, in a court case.</p>



<p>Let’s get to the data:</p>



<h2 id="h-the-cost-and-sales-of-the-call-of-duty-franchise">The cost and sales of the Call of Duty franchise</h2>



<p>Black Ops 3, released in 2015, cost an absurd $430 million dollars. The game sold 43 million copies. Modern Warfare 2019, the game that revitalized the franchise and brought back Warzone, cost $640 million and sold 41 million copies. Finally, Black Ops Cold War, released in 2020, cost 700 million dollars and sold “only” 30 million copies.</p>



<p>Despite the astronomical figures, the games manage not only to pay for themselves but also to generate a huge profit for Activision’s coffers. In addition to the direct sale of the game, which costs the full price of U$70, the publisher earns millions from the sale of skins and CoD Points.</p>



<p>For some time now, the Season Pass has been enhanced with Blackcell, serving as an incentive for players to spend more money. With the figures uncovered, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War takes over as the most expensive game ever made.</p>



<p>This is, of course, according to current public data. More recent CoDs, such as the recently released Black Ops 6, probably was more expensive to be made. Besides that, there’s no doubt that GTA 6’s costs must be just as enormous.</p>
