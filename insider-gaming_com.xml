<p>If you’ve been anywhere on the internet in the last few months, the chances are you’ll have seen a guy dressed as Miles Morales pretending to be an NPC on stream. He’s one of the few still holding up the gimmick – or at least he was, until now.</p>



<p>The ‘NPC trend’ went wild on sites like TikTok a while back, and ‘NPC Miles Morales’ was by far the most prolific creator to do it. He’d go on stream for hours on end, performing Miles Morales’s (Spider-Man) voice lines and ‘animations’ in exchange for gifts and donations.</p>



<p>He’s announced that he’s giving it up after all these months and pursuing a traditional streaming career.</p>

<h2 id="h-with-great-power">With Great Power…</h2>



<p>NPC Miles Morales – whose real name is Malik Ambersley – has performed his role since midway through 2023, and over time, he has become increasingly popular and controversial. While streaming, he has been robbed, accosted by police, and gotten into fights, all the while performing a character that he rarely breaks from.</p>



<p>The bit has earned him a substantial amount of money, but to be honest, he has put in the work. What he does is physically demanding and requires a great deal of confidence – and his escapades eventually earned him an iconic spot in Kai Cenat’s recent Mafia 2 subathon.</p>



<p>Now that Ambersley has paired up with Cenat, he has become bigger than ever, and in a recent stream, he revealed that he’s hanging up the Miles Morales costume to pursue traditional activities, such as the ‘IRL streams’ that Kai Cenat is famous for.</p>



<p>He said he’d ‘rather be known for being himself’.</p>
