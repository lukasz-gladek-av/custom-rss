<p>The Streamer Awards have wrapped for another year, and the trophies have all been dished out to the most deserving content creators of 2025. It was a mixed bag, and while most awards were fairly predictable, there were a few hidden gems in the line-up. The least surprising of all was the award for Best VTuber, which went to TheBurntPeanut.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut has had a stellar year, putting up some remarkable numbers and growing at an alarming pace on account of his entertaining, high-energy content, hilarious animations, and genuinely enjoyable gameplay. This year, he pushed Ironmouse out of the spot that the former champion had held for three years straight.</p>



<h2 id="h-theburntpeanut-is-your-vtuber-of-the-year">TheBurntPeanut is Your VTuber of The Year</h2>



<p>If you’re unfamiliar with TheBurntPeanut, all you need to do is check out a compilation of his most entertaining clips on YouTube to get a taste of his brand. He’s an animated peanut that uses a mix of skins and ‘costumes’, combined with an energetic commentary and some hilarious gameplay, to keep tens of thousands of viewers entertained at any given time.</p>



<p>This year has been transformative for TheBurntPeanut, who has used games like Escape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders to propel himself into the major spotlight.</p>



<p>At The Streamer Awards this year, the nominations were pretty close to call:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chibidoki</li>



<li>Ironmouse</li>



<li>Kenji</li>



<li>Mori Calliope</li>



<li>TheBurntPeanut</li>
</ul>



<p>Ironmouse had previously won the VTuber of the Year award at The Streamer Awards for three consecutive years, but TheBurntPeanut’s stellar year managed to push him into the top spot.</p>



<p>In his acceptance speech, TheBurntPeanut said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am honored to accept this Best VTuber of the Year award.</p>



<p>It is a great honor to accept this Best VTuber of the Year award, big shout-out to QTCinderella for putting on this immaculate award ceremony as well as a shout-out to the Peanut team, making sure the streams are always the best they can be.</p>



<p>Obviously, the largest shout-out to the Bungulators, you guys are the best, thank you for all the support, gentlemen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TheBurntPeanut also scooped the award for Best FPS Streamer, making him one of only a few streamers to walk away with more than one award at the event.</p>

<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major has already proven to be an energetic event loaded with drama and breakout performances, and the third stage is adding spice to that mix now that high-tier eliminations are taking place. In a decisive clash, FaZe Clan pushed 3DMAX off the board with a 2-0 sweep, fighting to keep their playoff dream alive.</p>



<p>FaZe walked into the series under some intense pressure, given their performance thus far, which has resulted in losses against both Team Spirit and The MongolZ.</p>



<p>What will happen next for FaZe Clan? Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025. Visit <a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a> to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<h2 id="h-faze-clan-remains-firm-for-now">FaZe Clan Remains Firm For Now</h2>



<p>The earlier losses for FaZe Clan at the Budapest Major raised questions about the roster’s cohesion and ability to adapt, but coming out against the underdog squad 3DMAX, the team looked somewhat revitalized. Going forward, FaZe Clan will need to hammer home the point against Passion UA to break a 2-2 lock for both squads.</p>



<p>For 3DMAX, the StarLadder Budapest Major marks the end of their 2025 sprint. The squad did well to reach this far, but they scraped through the second stage and failed to make waves in the third. It was a tough ask, though. The team was pitted against the likes of FaZe, Vitality, and paiN during the awkward run, which is a huge hill to overcome for any squad.</p>



<p>During the short-lived series, FaZe Clan barely gave 3DMAX a chance for respite. The first map, played out on Dust2, was a wash, and FaZe Clan’s Jakub ‘jcobbb’ Pietruszewski wasted no time showing why he was a valuable new signing with a stunning quad kill. The end scoreline was 13-6, setting the tone perfectly.</p>



<p>The second round was even more dominant, with jcobbb showing up again and the FaZe squad managing to secure a 15-5 finish to push 3DMAX from the tournament.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan’s final match in this stage will be against Passion UA, while six other teams will also look to break the 2-2 deadlock:</p>



<ul>
<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>
</ul>

<p>Are you a fan of the ultra-popular Japanese anime series Pokémon? If so, you need to stop what you’re doing and check out Catch A Monster on Roblox immediately. Catch A Monster can be considered the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-crash-bots-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> version of the various Pokémon games that have been released over the years. Players have to catch a variety of creatures and train them by fighting both trainers as well as other creatures. Each player will have a limited party of monsters they can have at any time, so picking the right ones is of crucial importance.&nbsp;</p>







<p>By training these creatures, players can increase their level and make them stronger, thereby allowing them to defeat harder and more powerful enemies. Players start the game on a basic island and have to work their way up the ladder, while also hatching eggs to gain pets. Bosses spawn at predetermined locations every 15 minutes in Catch A Monster, offering guaranteed drops and rewards. With plenty of things to do and a large open world to explore, fans of the popular Japanese series will surely enjoy their time in Catch A Monster.</p>

<p>Catch A Monster codes are usually released either through the game’s official channels or on the developers’ socials. Keeping track of all of these though, can be a hassle, especially because players are not notified when any of the existing codes expire. This is why we encourage all players to keep this page bookmarked, as we update it with new codes as soon as they release, while expired codes are also moved to their corresponding section.&nbsp;</p>
