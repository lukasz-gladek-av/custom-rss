<p>A new claim reveals that another title is in the works at Santa Monica Studios, alongside the God of War Trilogy Remake, which could be Cory Barlog’s game. </p>



<p>There were many God of War titles rumoured to be in development, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer title</a> and one set in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egyptian mythology</a>. Out of all the rumoured ones, the Trilogy Remake and Sons of Sparta got confirmed yesterday. However, there is one more title players have been curious about: Cory Barlog’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/santa-monica-studios-next-game-is-progressing-well-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next game</a>, for which we seem to have new details. </p>







<h2 id="h-cory-barlog-s-game-could-be-revealed-soon">Cory Barlog’s Game Could Be Revealed Soon</h2>



<p>During a new discussion on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot49-hunters-gathering-on-tau-ceti.1433161/page-22#post-151278571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>, shinobi602 replied ‘naw’ when asked “Please&nbsp;shinobi602&nbsp;tell us that the GoW remake is not the Cory Barlog project? The insider then added that the game is “Not that far (barring any delays of course).” He also added that the reveal of this project is expected to be this year, and “given the quarter they’re targeting,” it is likely the reveal could be at the May State of Play or Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but Shinobi doesn’t know that for sure yet. </p>



<p>Shinobi added that if the reveal doesn’t come by then Santa Monica may have either pushed the game’s release, or kept a “shorter reveal to release” window. That’s all we know about the other Santa Monica game at the moment; however, readers should take this information with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>Santa Monica had some huge reveals planned for yesterday’s State of Play event, giving it a picture-perfect finale. They not only confirmed that a God of War Trilogy Remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was in development</a>, but also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow-dropped</a> the 2D God of War title for players to try out now. </p>

Additionally, the live-action God of War series for Amazon Prime Video has cast&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ryan-hurst-comments-on-playing-kratos-in-prime-videos-god-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kratos</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-live-action-series-secures-atreus-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atreus</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-video-casts-thor-and-odin-in-god-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thor, Odin</a>,&nbsp;and more.

            <title><![CDATA[Pokopia Hands-On Preview: Pokémon Has Another Mega Hit On Its Hands]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>1435045</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokopia is less than a month away from a big release, and after a hands-on experience at Pokémon EUIC, it’s fair to say my excitement levels are reaching unprecedented levels.</p>



<p>First revealed in September’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Presents, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> is the latest spin-off game in the franchise’s 30-year history, and, while not every game under the Pokémon banner has been a hit over the years, Pokopia is showing every sign of being a huge phenomenon in the same fashion that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a> was.</p>

<p>During a short demo at Pokémon EUIC, one major standout from the experience was that Pokopia is going to appeal to the masses, thrilling long-term Pokémon fans who want a new way to play with their favourite characters, as well as opening doors to those who don’t have much experience with the franchise.</p>



<p>Even from the short session, it was clear there are various levels of depth with Pokopia. Those who want a simple experience hanging out with their favourite Pokémon will get exactly that, while those seeking deeper content and a more extensive list of tasks are also suited. Flicking through the menus, I was delighted to find a huge page of collectables, including fossils and relics from the human world.</p>



<p>The process of attracting new Pokémon to join you is simple. Like the classic Viva Piñata games, each Pokémon has environmental requirements, ranging from shaded grass beneath a tree to a bench next to a punching bag. Some Pokémon are harder to attract than others, with more complex requirements or a specific time of day needed, and, once they’re a part of your new home, you’ll need to make further adjustments by crafting items or making more environmental changes to increase a Pokémon’s comfort levels.</p>



<p>Again, this appeals to all players. Those who just want to hang out with Pokémon can do that and not worry too much about comfort levels, while completionists will be constantly pushing to ensure everyone is happy.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-come-to-life-in-a-new-way">Pokémon Come to Life in a New Way</h2>



<p>Another standout from the demo was how the Pokémon come to life in entirely new ways, each having its own personality, likes, and dislikes. You can give Pokémon gifts to raise their friendship level, and speaking to the Pokémon I found across the area instantly sparked memories of discovering my favourite, and least-favourite, residents in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/animal-crossing/" id="3053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing</a>.</p>



<p>The Pokémon will also interact with each other, and I couldn’t help but laugh when Bulbasaur told me that Geodude smells nice. These types of interactions with Pokémon were one of the reasons why the Mystery Dungeon games were so good, and bringing them to life on Switch 2 in this way opens the door to countless more memories being created.</p>



<p>All in all, I can’t wait to get my hands on Pokopia again, and I can already tell I’m going to sink countless hours unlocking everything and perfecting my Pokémon home.</p>
