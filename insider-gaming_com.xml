<p>Use these Roblox Dungeon Hunters monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Gems and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlocking new worlds and clearing every chapter in Dungeon Hunters takes a lot of grinding. As you progress, newly unlocked Worlds become tougher, forcing you to level up, deal more damage, equip better armor, and unlock stronger gear. To speed things up, you can redeem the active Dungeon Hunters codes to earn free Gems. Gems are instrumental since they’re used to summon weapon cases, giving you access to stronger weapons early on. With the right weapons from free Gems, you can clear even the toughest dungeons without spending hours in this thrilling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-spear-fishing-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience.</p>

<p>Epic Games may have wrapped up for Christmas, but there is still one more treat in store for players with the release of an IShowSpeed Icon Series skin tomorrow, leaks state.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s huge string of collabs has continued for the festive season, with the likes of Hatsune Miku, Sabrina Carpenter, Harry Potter, and SpongeBob SquarePants joining the game, and there’s set to be another Icon Series skin on Christmas Eve.</p>







<h2 id="h-ishowspeed-coming-to-fortnite">IShowSpeed Coming to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Flipping onto the scene. Image via YouTube</figcaption></figure>



<p>Reports of a new Icon Series coming to Fortnite first came from <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/2003471578747797877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, who speculated that it would be IShowSpeed receiving the special treatment, and other established leaks, including <a href="https://x.com/FireMonkey/status/2003467431260385310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FireMonkey</a>, stated that it would indeed be the popular streamer who joins the Icon Series gang.</p>



<p>Rumors of an IShowSpeed skin in Fortnite started to emerge after the streamer responded to a question asking what his stream scheduled for December 24th would be about, which he stated would see him “go back to my first stream ever.”</p>



<p>IShowSpeed’s first stream was playing Fortnite, and his comments now align with the leaks of a new treat that will be added to the Item Shop just in time for Christmas.</p>



<p>However, while the collab will include the usual Outfits, Back Blings, Pickaxes, Gliders, and even a Jam Track, there won’t be any emotes in the bundle, a decision that will raise eyebrows considering the huge amount of popular memes IShowSpeed has become famous for, including his barking, backflip, and imitation of Cristiano Ronaldo’s Siu celebration.</p>



<p>Official confirmation of the Icon Series addition and pricing of the individual items and the bundle have yet to be revealed, with it likely that it will be Speed himself that unveils the skin, following the trend showcased with previous reveals in the past.</p>
