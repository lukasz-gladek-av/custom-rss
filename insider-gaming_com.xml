            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pioner/" id="2245">PIONER</a>, the post-apocalyptic MMORPG with a vibe similar to STALKER and Fallout 76, has today introduced a new <strong>PIONER Extra </strong>subscription service. This service is entirely optional but allows the game’s most dedicated players to enhance their experience with a few key bonuses.</p>



<p>For instance, it unlocks unlimited stash storage, allowing players to store as much as they want, without any restrictions. In a game where loot is plentiful, this is admittedly quite handy.</p>











<p>In a post on Steam, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gfa-games/" id="3175">GFA Games</a> revealed that PIONER, the post-apocalyptic, PvPvE MMO, has a new subscription service, running for now at a ‘standard tier’ that will be upgraded in time.</p>



<p>Per the post, the PIONER Extra service includes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Premium Currency Bonus: </strong>Every subscription period comes with an in-game currency reward, so you’re getting value back right away.</li>



<li><strong>Mobile Stash</strong>: Deploy a portable storage unit anywhere on the map. Other players on your server can use it too. It operates on a cooldown, and you’ll get a HUD notification the moment it’s ready again.</li>



<li><strong>Mobile Repair Station: </strong>Drop a repair bench out in the field to fix your gear on the go. Same cooldown system, same shared access for nearby players, same notification when it recharges.</li>



<li><strong>Unlimited Stash Storage</strong>: No more worrying about running out of space. While your subscription is active, your stash has infinite slots.</li>



<li><strong>Exclusive Cosmetic Item</strong>: Subscribers receive a unique role-play item to stand out in the world.</li>
</ul>



<p>The team at GFA advised that you subscribe and play, and when your purchased time expires, you can simply renew for as long as you’d like. There’s a new tier coming soon, with ‘even more features’, but we don’t know yet what that will look like.</p>



<p>There are some stark similarities here between PIONER Extra and Fallout 1st, the premium subscription service that runs in Fallout 76 and gives users many of the same benefits.</p>



<p>PIONER Extra costs as little as $4.92 a month when you commit to a 360-day subscription, or as much as $6.99 a month for a rolling, once-monthly subscription.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re midway through another week and grinding hard for that weekend. Today? We start as we always do, with an NYT Connections puzzle. If you’ve just woken up or are halfway through your day and hitting today’s challenge, be sure to scroll down and check out today’s NYT Connections hints and answers.</p>



<p>I’ve got the best NYT Connections solutions you’re looking for today.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

<p>The Highguard website is experiencing issues and is currently unavailable. </p>



<p>Wildlight Entertainment’s latest shooter, Highguard, has not been experiencing the smoothest launch, with player counts dwindling as the days go by. The developers recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass layoffs</a>, with “most of the team” affected. Now the website has been affected as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-website-unavailable">Highguard Website Unavailable </h2>



<p>At the time of writing, if you head over to the Highguard <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/2023814755904090520" rel="nofollow">Wario64</a> on Twitter), you will see that the site is down and has been for some time. The error pop-up states “SITE UNAVAILABLE. This site is currently unavailable. Please contact <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="87f4f2f7f7e8f5f3c7e4e8e3e2f3efeef5f3fef3f0e8a9e4e8ea">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> for assistance.” No other information was revealed, and the developers have not provided any clarity yet. </p>



<p>Highguard developers recently released a big update for the title, in the hopes of bringing more players to the game. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-episode-2-adds-ranked-mode-new-heroes-and-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Episode 2 </a>features new heroes, a ranked 3v3 competitive playlist where players can climb through 7 ranks, a new map, and additional quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes. However, this addition has not helped bring up the concurrent numbers.</p>



<p>Several factors could have led to Highguard’s failure, including the Game Awards 2025 finale moment, the social media blackout, and more. Interested readers can check out a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-failed-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full guide</a> on it here. </p>

Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-5v5-raid-mode-added-permanently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5v5 Raid Mode</a> has been made permanent.
