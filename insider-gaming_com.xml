<p>Xbox has brought back its 14-day PC Game Pass for $1, which gives access to games including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>The deal was removed prior to the release of Black Ops 6 on October 27, 2024, however, the publisher has just brought back the deal for those wanting to try the service.</p>



<p>As pointed out on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass/pc-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">xbox.com</a>, the subscription will automatically renew at $9.99 a month unless the user opts to cancel it manually via their Microsoft account.</p>



<p>Despite arguably being one of the best deals in gaming, some users online have criticised the deal as it means that cheaters will now be able to get access to Black Ops 6 for a much cheaper price. </p>



<p>In recent weeks, Call of Duty’s Richochet anti-cheat has been heavily criticized for not keeping cheaters at bay. Yesterday, one <a href="https://x.com/ItsGamerDoc/status/1860094492956606555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Riot Games’ anti-cheat developer even took to X</a> (formerly Twitter) to point out its serious flaws.</p>



<p>As for if the PC Game Pass deal will cause an increase in cheaters in Call of Duty remains to be seen, but for those uninterested in Call of Duty, the PC Game Pass deal is still exceptional value for money to try out the service and the games that it has to offer.</p>



<p>What do you think of the PC Game Pass deal? Do you think Microsoft should have addressed the Call of Duty Richochet problem before rolling out its PC Game Pass deal again? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The interconnectivity of video games is greater than it ever has been. Marvel Rivals is the definition of a AAA blockbuster in gaming, and having some kind of crossplay, cross-progression, or cross-platform integration would be ideal.</p>



<p>Growing up, I hated the fact I couldn’t play with or against my friends who had different consoles. It also sucked that if I owned a game on two consoles, I couldn’t carry my progress across. In 2024, this ideology is practically redundant as most online multiplayer titles have some form of cross-platform capabilities.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> isn’t just an online multiplayer hero shooter, it is shaping up to be one of the most prominent and significant in recent times. Having cross-platform functionality can only improve the overall experience, and I have some interesting news for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-crossplay">Is Marvel Rivals Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PlayStation, Xbox, and PC come together? Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is set to feature fully integrated crossplay at launch, allowing players on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC to play with each other.</strong></p>



<p>The news was confirmed by Rivals’ executive producer Danny Koo in an interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-qa-netease-talks-about-the-heroes-hybrid-roles-opposed-to-hard-tank-dps-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wccftech</a>. Discussing crossplay, Koo reiterated Marvel Rivals is coming to “PC, Xbox, and PlayStation,” and when queried on “cross-platform play between them,” Koo replied, “<strong>Yes, and we’ll be cross-play in beta as well.</strong>“</p>



<p>The beta—in the aftermath of this interview—did indeed feature crossplay, meaning it’s <strong>all but confirmed we’re getting Marvel Rivals crossplay when the hero shooter goes live on Dec. 6.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-does-marvel-rivals-have-cross-progression">Does Marvel Rivals have cross-progression?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, Marvel Rivals likely won’t support cross-progression—at least in its launch phase.</strong></p>



<p>In an Oct. 17 interview, this time with game director Guangyun Chen, for <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-devs-still-dont-know-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, he said “<strong>For now, we have no cross-progression.</strong> As we only have around two months to go global launch, we are doing the final tech check to see what we can do and how we can process it. The workload is a lot more than we thought at the beginning.”</p>



<p>Chen later confirmed cross-progression is one of the most sought-after features by the community, and the team “are still having internal discussions.” For now, we’ll go on the assumption Marvel Rivals has no cross-progression at launch. Do keep checking back for the latest developments on the topic though, as it could be added as a last-minute surprise—or as a post-launch update.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s good news on the crossplay front at least. Are you disappointed there’s probably no cross-progression in Marvel Rivals? Will it put you off buying the shooter?

<p>Following a hectic period before Citizencon, during which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staff were mandated to work 7-day work weeks</a>, Cloud Imperium Games have just reportedly laid off some of its staff.</p>



<p>The information comes from an <a href="https://x.com/Gillyburd1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ex-CIG employee</a>, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to say that their former employer “is letting a lot of staff go over the last two days with zero compensation right after working them to the bone without even much as a thanks,” and that a “formal announcement” should be “soon.”</p>



<p>Speaking with our own sources, we can confirm that Cloud Imperium Games has been letting some of its staff go these past couple of days, but we’re currently unable to verify the extent of the layoffs. At the time of writing, several sources said the layoffs have mainly affected the studio’s QA department and that the number of those laid off isn’t as large as initially made out to be, with one source estimating around a dozen currently affected (around 1% of its total workforce). </p>



<p>That being said, it’s still early days fairly early days yet, and Cloud Imperium Games has a history of laying off its staff over an extended period. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CIG quietly laid off an estimated 100 or so staff members</a> at its Austin and LA offices which took weeks and  even making affected employees sign NDAs to prevent them from talking about being laid off.</p>



<p>Cloud Imperium Games has yet to make an internal or public announcement to its staff on the layoffs and any possible restructuring. </p>



<p>We will update this article as we hear more.</p>

<p>Victor von Doom is just as menacing as his name suggests, and the villain—sometimes anti-hero—is a natural fit for Marvel Rivals. We already know the imperious presence of the doctor is confirmed, so let’s check out the latest on his arrival and see if he needs an appointment.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has a blockbuster, star-studded cast of characters befitting of a Marvel shooter. Meaning, that it makes sense to have (arguably) one of the most influential and memorable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-characters-are-in-marvel-rivals-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters</a> in the biggest attempt to date to bring the epic universe to games.</p>



<p>It’s no secret Doctor Doom is coming to Marvel Rivals, that much is certain. However, a lot of confusion is directed toward his potential debut—let’s take a look.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-doctor-doom-coming-to-marvel-rivals">When is Doctor Doom coming to Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The faces of evil. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Neither NetEase nor Marvel has given an official launch date for Doctor Doom in Marvel Rivals—and there aren’t even any leaks to give us a glimmer of hope.</p>



<p>The lack of a Doctor Doom announcement is bizarre given the character’s eponymous trailer back on July 26: “Marvel Rivals | Cinematic Trailer | No One Rivals Doom.” While the majority of the trailer features an array of the Rivals stars fighting each other, the main focus is on Doctor Doom.</p>



<p>Curiously, he doesn’t feature on the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes/index.html?heroId=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals hero page</a>—despite his trailer—and if he doesn’t appear at launch, I’d expect him to be the focal point of at least one of the first two seasons.</p>



<p>If anything spells bad news, it’s two Doctor Dooms, and yet we’re here unable to verify the launch date of one—keep checking back as we wait for official confirmation from either developer or publisher on the character’s Marvel Rivals launch.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-who-is-doctor-doom-in-marvel-rivals">Who is Doctor Doom in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>Doctor Doom’s origin story is as sinister and foreboding as any: His mother was taken by Mephisto, and his father succumbed to death as an indirect effect of someone else’s actions. Cue the warpath of the vicious Victor von Doom. His brilliant use of magic and a mind for inventing and creation makes Doctor Doom one of the most-feared villains in Marvel—and history, to be honest.</p>



<p>He’s a genius, and Fantastic Four lovers will be intimately acquainted with Victor as they regularly clash. Hardened fans will debate for weeks on end who the greatest supervillain in the Marvel universe is; however, you only need to check different ranking lists to see Doom’s name appear at the top—in many cases <em>the </em>top spot.</p>



<hr>



<p>Do you think Doctor Doom is the greatest Marvel villain ever? Or does someone else breed evil that tiny bit better? While you deliberate on this, be sure to read up on the hero shooter’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-maps-game-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps and modes</a>, as well as the live-service title’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-marvel-rivals-money-laundering-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">money laundering controversy</a>.</p>
