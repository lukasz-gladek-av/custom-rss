<p>Digital Foundry has published an in-depth technical review for The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC, which was released earlier today. While it has been regarded as an improvement over the woeful release of The Last of Us Part I on PC, it’s still <strong>not as good as it could be</strong>.</p>



<p>In some aspects, The Last of Us Part II on PC performs worse – or not as well as you’d expect comparatively – than the base PlayStation 4, which was released in 2013. For instance, Digital Foundry found that a GPU with more than three times the compute power of the base PS4 wasn’t able to consistently double the performance of The Last of Us Part II on PlayStation 4.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-the-weeds">In The Weeds</h2>



<p>Digital Foundry’s comprehensive technical review of The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC is pretty insane. It’s fifteen minutes long, and it takes the time to dive into absolutely every aspect of the game, from frame rates and load speeds, and from texture clarity to settings optimisation.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Last of Us Part 2 PC Review - We're Disappointed - Analysis + Optimised Settings" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z0IoZxiv1i0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The team mentioned that the game’s usage of GPU resources is ‘a bit inordinate’, comparing the figures between a base PS4 and an RTX 3060 GPU. The PC GPU should be able to walk rings around the PlayStation 4’s tech, but that’s not what’s happening with this game, as DF explains:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We should be looking at a GPU that is around 3.5 times <strong>more </strong>performant in compute, even at a non-boosted clock. Yet the RTX 3060 cannot fully double the PS4’s performance in this game at the closest equivalent settings.</p>



<p>This is a very large outlier in our history of examining PC ports.</p>



<p>Whether or not that’s justified is up to the jury, but that means you as a user will have to adjust your expectations accordingly. You really don’t want to drop below those PS4 settings, as I see it, as you’re getting a visual experience worse than a 12-year-old console at that point.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>DF also revealed that stuttering and framerate drops were fairly common, and at one point, they reveal that the game would lock up without any prior warning before leaping back into life a few seconds later. They also detected issues with shadows popping in at odd times – even on maxed-out settings. </p>



<p>These issues weren’t present on the PS4 Pro backwards-compatible version of the game on PS5.</p>

<p>More details and news about Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter Marathon could be coming sooner rather than later. </p>



<p>On Thursday afternoon, the official Marathon Twitter <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907840558544072722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account posted</a> a “glitching” teaser video while updating its header image. Not long after that, the official PlayStation account also updated its header image to something Marathon related. </p>



<p>Other aspects of the game’s online presence such as its Steam page, Facebook, and YouTube were also updated. Lastly, a MIDA profile had been created on Twitter as well.</p>







<p>That has led to plenty of speculation that fans are only days away from getting more information of the relatively unknown reboot of the classic Bungie franchise.</p>



<p>To add fuel to the fire, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Grubb reported</a> back in February that Marathon wasn’t a part of that month’s PlayStation State of Play because PlayStation was planning a standalone event for the game. At the time, he said that April was the target for such a showing.</p>







<p>“I think April [is] when we probably hear from them about Marathon,” he said. “And it would be its own thing separate from a State of Play.”</p>



<p>As of publishing, neither PlayStation nor Bungie have officially confirmed anything regarding when more Marathon news will be announced. Based on the teases, however, it should be only a matter of time.</p>



<p>When do you think Bungie will give the next look at Marathon? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>Call of Duty Warzone is back at the top of the streaming charts as Verdansk comes storming into the game once again. In 2021, Verdansk was removed rather unceremoniously from Warzone, being replaced with Caldera – a decision that many fans were disappointed with.</p>



<p>Even if it’s a flash in the pan, the return of Verdansk has proven the power of nostalgia – at the time of writing, more than 336,000 people were watching Call of Duty Warzone on Twitch. The last time the game had numbers that high was in <strong>November 2022</strong> when Warzone 2.0 was released.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-up-the-charts">Up the Charts</h2>



<p>Warzone is currently the most popular game on Twitch, which is a position it hasn’t occupied for many years. It was in 2022 that the previous peak was set, as 615,000 people tuned in to see what was new in Warzone 2.0, the release that came with Modern Warfare II.</p>



<p>Presently, more than 336,000 <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/512710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">are watching Warzone on Twitch</a> – and the number is growing. Before this, Warzone had struggled to push beyond the 280,000 mark, even during groundbreaking events and new map releases.</p>



<p>As I write this, 11,000 channels are streaming Warzone gameplay, which is <strong>almost </strong>hitting that November 2022 peak. It seems everyone wants a piece of the Verdansk pie on streaming platforms – and this is before we even start talking about YouTube. On <strong>that </strong>platform, streamers like TimTheTatman are currently broadcasting to as many as 40,000 viewers.</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that, all in all, across the suite of streaming platforms, a good 500,000 – 750,000 people are watching Warzone gameplay in some way, shape, or form.</p>



<p>Many doubted that Verdansk would herald a return to form for Warzone, but if streaming figures are anything to go by, it’s looking <strong>very </strong>good for the battle royale title.</p>



<p>Are you playing in Verdansk? Let me know what you think of the map’s return on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that people are just a little bit excited for the start of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 and the return of Verdansk in Warzone. After just the first few hours since the start of the season, player count for Call of Duty on Steam has risen over 200%.</p>



<p>As of writing, Call of Duty currently sits with 111,377 players <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/#3m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Steam</a>. That represents a 207.8% increase from its numbers prior to the start of the season. It also marks the first time Call of Duty has been over 100,000 concurrent players on Steam since early February when 102,000 players were on at once on February 2.</p>







<p>While not the be all, end all for numbers, Steam’s player counts are often a solid indication of the performance for a game. With numbers rising as high as they have on the platform, it could be safe to assumed that early numbers on console are just as strong, if not stronger.</p>



<p>The question then becomes whether these numbers will continue, or if players will tune out again after seeing what the return of Verdansk has to offer. Either way, the game has a ways to go to match the 160,000+ average player count it saw in its first month after release. Since then, the average count has dropped by double digits each month as of the end of March.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is a more powerful console than the Nintendo Switch, but, according to Nvidia, it’ll feature ten times the graphics power of the original.</p>



<p>In a post on its website going over Nintendo’s latest console, Nvidia discussed DLSS and 4K gaming coming to a Nintendo platform for the first time. The post goes over how Tensor Cores will help improve “AI-powered graphics” while adding that RT Cores will “enhance in-game realism with dynamic lighting and natural reflections.” Nvidia also says that variable refresh rate and G-Sync for the console’s screen result in “ultra-smooth, tear-free gameplay.”</p>



<p>These features, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nintendo-switch-2-leveled-up-with-nvidia-ai-powered-dlss-and-4k-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the company says</a>, will give the new system “10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch”, providing “smoother gameplay and sharper visuals.”</p>







<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-features-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features a 1080 LCD screen</a> that supports up to 120 frames per second (FPS) and HDR in handheld mode. When docked, the system supports 4K output at 60 FPS. One game that doesn’t seem to have 60 FPS on the system, however, is CyberPunk 2077 as CD Projekt Red’s RPG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-on-nintendo-switch-2-runs-at-40-fps-costs-70/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">runs at 40 FPS</a> when docked.</p>
