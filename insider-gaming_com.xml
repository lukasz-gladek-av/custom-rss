<p>In Civilization 7, you must develop life, and also collect Trophies and Achievements if you’re dedicated enough. 2K’s long-running world-building sim franchise is back for more human being advancement and era-defining decisions, and along the way you can earn a lot of tough Civilization 7 Achievements and Trophies.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-civilization-7-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization 7</a> is back to bring you more of what you love. World-bending crisis’, new ways to keep everyone alive, and a refined gameplay structure. You need to spend minutes agonizing over decisions that affect the thousands of years ahead. While you do this, you also need to bear in mind Civ 7’s extensive list of extra accomplishments.</p>



<p>Whether this is your first attempt at Civilization completionism or not, fear not, it’s going to be tough for everyone.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-civilization-7-trophies-amp-achievements-are-there">How Many Civilization 7 Trophies &amp; Achievements Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Every choice matters. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 33 PlayStation Trophies and 32 Xbox Achievements to unlock for Civilization 7.</strong></p>



<p>As with every Trophy and Achievement list, the <strong>Platinum Trophy</strong> is the difference here. A fun, extra Trophy given to players for going above and beyond and getting every extra objective done on PlayStation. You still get a ton of Gamerscore on Xbox, so it’s not all too bad! </p>



<p>What is bad is the list itself.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-civilization-7-achievement-amp-trophy">Every Civilization 7 Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<p><a href="https://civilization.2k.com/en-GB/civ-vii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Civilization 7</a> looks to be an extremely <strong>time-sapping list</strong>. You need to win with a variety of leaders, complete milestones, and <strong>win on Deity difficulty</strong>. This is fitting as I wonder if any fabled Gods would have a chance at ticking off every Trophy and Achievement on the list.</p>



<p>This is not for me to debate. However, this list is for you to read, so check it out.</p>

<p>Take-Two Interactive has plans to “support” Nintendo Switch 2 after the new system releases. During the company’s latest earnings call on February 6, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that Nintendo is in a different spot than it was years prior. </p>



<p>Zelnick says that while they supported Nintendo in the past when it “made sense”, things have seemingly changed a bit.</p>



<p>“Look, we’ve had obviously a long-standing relationship with Nintendo,” he said <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/quarterly-earnings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">during the call</a>. “And we’ve supported the platform when it made sense for the individual release. There was a time when Nintendo platforms are really geared at younger audiences, and that was reflected in our release schedule.</p>



<p>“And that — now today with Switch and potentially with Switch 2, the Switch device can support any audience. And as you note — as you may have noted, Civ VII is available now on Switch. So, while we have nothing specific to report, we actually would fully expect to support Switch.”</p>







<p>Of course, the biggest question regarding Switch 2 support is what games will they bring to the console. While games like Grand Theft Auto 6 and Borderlands 4 were announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, there could be hope from players that, down the line, both will become available on the hybrid system.</p>



<p>Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 6, Zelnick also reaffirmed that the game is still <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned for a release</a> this fall.</p>



<p>What do you think Zelnick meant when he said the expectation is to support the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>Riot Games’ preview of the 2025 seasonal model for League of Legends was completely overshadowed by the unpopular decision to remove free Hextech Chests. In today’s update, the team defended the decision, but promised a number of changes to improve battle passes in the future.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-riot-says-the-removal-of-free-hextech-chests-is-necessary">Riot Says the Removal of Free Hextech Chests is Necessary</h2>



<p>As part of the 2025 season one check-in, the League of Legends team acknowledged the choice to limit Hextech Chests to just the store. For years, players were able to earn and open these chests for free, providing a way for free-to-play players to play and earn cosmetics. But earlier this year, Riot said they were doing away with free Hextech Chests, moving them to the store and forcing players to purchase them.</p>



<p>These changes, coupled with other <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/skins-101/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unpopular changes</a> to progression, nearly caused a revolt in the player base. Many League of Legends players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1i531vg/my_last_77_hextech_chests_i_dont_wanna_say_goodbye/?embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgamerant.com%2Fleague-of-legends-players-call-for-boycott%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatened to boycott the game altogether</a>. In their update today, the devs admitted that free Hextech Chests became the “primary way” for players to unlock skins, leading to a decline in purchasing skins. As a free-to-play game, League of Legends is reliant on players buying skins, and the devs insist that it’s not about increasing profits, but rather long-term sustainability.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The League of Legends team knows that these changes are unpopular, and want to remedy the removal of free Hextech Chests with improved battle pass rewards. Future battle pass skins will have more “distinct visual effects,” and unlocking a battle pass skin will also unlock the champion it’s for if the player doesn’t already own it. Battle pass missions that require players to play with purchased skins are also being removed entirely. Some of the harder battle pass missions are also being removed or reworked. Battle pass XP from Teamfight Tactics is also being doubled.</p>



<p>Is the removal free of Hextech Chests going to get you to buy more skins in League of Legends? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>
