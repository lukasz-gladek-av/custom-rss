<p>In September 2024, Nicholas Prosper gunned down his mother and sister and stabbed his younger brother to death at their home in Luton in the United Kingdom. Today, the 19-year-old appeared in Luton Crown Court for sentencing, admitting in front of the room that he had planned the killings for several months and desired to extend his heinous goal by slaughtering schoolchildren.</p>



<p>In details obtained by the BBC, Prosper revealed a disturbing obsession with Clementine, a young female character from The Walking Dead games pieced together by Telltale. He insisted that his goal was to ‘join her in death’ and that he had been ‘chosen’ by her for this ‘mission’.</p>

<h2 id="h-friday-the-13th">Friday the 13th</h2>



<p>Nicholas Prosper brutally murdered his family at their home in the United Kingdom, and if he weren’t apprehended by police two hours later, a reprehensible scene could have played out.</p>



<p>Prosper’s full plan was to venture into his old primary (elementary) school on Friday the 13th while dressed in a ‘distinctive outfit’ and wielding a shotgun he’d obtained illegally. Reportedly, he wanted to ‘execute’ as many as 30 children and had researched past massacres online.</p>



<p>In his defence, his barrister had stressed that Prosper was perhaps tainted by an internet ‘wormhole’ that caused something ‘very wrong’ to happen with the teenager’s psyche.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cn8ld834398t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The BBC</a> published exclusive details about the case, explaining how Prosper revealed to a prison nurse that he intended to kill himself after the shooting and that his ultimate desire was to ‘go to Clementine and join her’.</p>



<p>He was referring to a major character in Telltale’s The Walking Dead games, who appeared in the first title in 2012 as a young child before evolving into a hardened survivor.</p>



<p>Prosper posted a video online after murdering his family, in which he explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am the chosen one; chosen by Clementine. I am guided as Christians are guided by Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also uploaded videos ahead of the crime, revealing his ‘distinctive’ outfit and wielding a plank of wood in place of the shotgun he’d eventually use.</p>



<p>The judge presiding over the case will pass sentencing on Wednesday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-assassins-creed-shadows-character-naoe-yasuke/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows offers a dual-protagonist system that presents the player with freedom of choice. Do you want to be the heavy-set warrior, Yasuke, or do you want to be the lithe and agile shinboi, Naoe? Both characters have unique abilities and loadouts, but which of them can be considered <strong>the best character </strong>in Assassin’s Creed Shadows to play as?</p>



<p>Read on to understand these characters and learn which of them is the best protagonist in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-vs-naoe-which-character-is-best">Yasuke vs Naoe – Which Character is Best?</h2>



<p>It’s mostly a subjective debate when it comes to determining which of the two Assassin’s Creed Shadows protagonists is the best.</p>



<p>If you prefer decimating your enemies with heavy attacks, you’ll probably pick Yasuke. If you’re more of a stealthy player who relies on shadows and subterfuge to achieve your goals, you’ll prefer Naoe.</p>



<p>Here are the advantages and disadvantages of both characters in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p><strong>Yasuke</strong></p>



<p>Advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>High health pool</li>



<li>Incredibly powerful attacks</li>



<li>Can use a bow and teppo (gun)</li>



<li>Can easily dispatch even the toughest enemies</li>
</ul>



<p>Disadvantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Very slow, cumbersome parkour abilities</li>



<li>Tougher to remain hidden, almost impossible in some circumstances</li>



<li>No eagle vision or hidden blade</li>



<li>Attacks are typically slower and require more planning</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Naoe</strong></p>



<p>Advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Very fast and a fantastic parkour artist</li>



<li>Uses shinobi tools like smoke grenades, grapple hooks, and distraction mechanics to go unseen</li>



<li>Uses a wide range of melee weapons, most of which are designed around speed</li>



<li>Can assassinate enemies and use eagle vision to spot and mark enemies</li>
</ul>



<p>Disadvantages:</p>



<ul>
<li>Low health pool that is a challenge against tough enemies</li>



<li>Limited ranged weapons; can only use Kunai and Shuriken</li>



<li>Less physically dominating and won’t scare enemies as easily</li>
</ul>



<p>In general, I think that Assassin’s Creed fans will gravitate much more readily to Naoe, who represents the creed and what the series stands for. In truth, you’ll be splitting your time between both. However, after around 30 hours in the game at the time of writing, I can honestly and openly say that I’ve preferred my time spent with Naoe.</p>



<p>She’s much faster and more agile, and her parkour abilities are the best the franchise has ever seen. Her skillset makes her incredibly fluid, and the stealth factor with Naoe is off the charts. The only time I actively switch to Yasuke is if I’ve tried to win a fight with Naoe and have lost – if that’s the case, I bring in the hulking samurai to tackle the tougher enemies.</p>



<p>From a cosmetic perspective, I also enjoy Naoe’s outfits more. They’re better suited to the assassin lifestyle, but that’s not to take away from Yasuke’s incredible armour sets.</p>



<p>That’s which character I think is best in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but feel free to let me know what you think in the comments.</p>
