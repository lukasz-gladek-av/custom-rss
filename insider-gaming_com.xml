            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-middle-of-journey/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-is-%E2%80%98only-in-the-middle-of-the-journey%E2%80%99-says-sony.1349755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao has said that Sony believes the PlayStation 5 is only at the midpoint of its journey.</p>



<div><p>The quote came from Sony’s latest quarterly earnings call, where Sony CFO Line Tao revealed that the PlayStation 5 is currently only in the middle of its lifecycle. Tao said,</p><p>“Our view is that compared to conventional console lifecycles. Looking at the PS4 lifecycle, it seems to be getting longer and longer. Especially the PS4, which was launched in 2013, and it’s been over a decade since then, but there are many active users enjoying the console… So from that perspective, we believe that the PS5 is only in the middle of the journey, and we are really planning to expand it even further.”</p></div>







<h2 id="h-so-when-will-the-ps6-release">So, When Will The PS6 Release?</h2>



<p>Well, Tao’s comments are not actually suggesting that the PlayStation 6 is another five years away, instead, she’s suggesting that the console generation of the PlayStation 5 will bleed through during the PS5. Just like with the current generation with the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, we’re now only just seeing developers move away from the PS4 with its games.</p>



<p>So, in theory at least, the PlayStation 6 is scheduled to release likely in 2027 – 2028, with the PlayStation 5 continuing to be supported to around 2031 – 2032.</p>



<p>The support for the ‘past generation’ is simply because of economics, allowing developers to release on a much bigger market than they would if they just developed games for the latest generation. For instance, on PlayStation 6’s launch, which could sell 10-15 million units in its first year, it’s not an ideal market to solely release a game on. Instead, it’s much better to release on the PlayStation 6 (10-15 million units), plus the PlayStation 5 (likely 100 million units+ by 2027).</p>



<p>It’s why popular games such as Call of Duty still remain on past-generation consoles, simply because the platform still has a large number of players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is bringing a host of new adventures into the fray, but the mysterious Worlds Collide mode has raised questions among the community.</p>



<p>First emerging as a query following the start of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preloads for Black Ops 7 becoming</a> available, a download option for Worlds Collide was confusing, as it wasn’t abundantly clear what the download was for—unlike the options for Zombies and multiplayer, which are self-explanatory.</p>



<p>Fear not, though, as the answer is out there, and we’ve got all the details you need for Worlds Collide in Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-worlds-collide-in-black-ops-7">What is Worlds Collide in Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New adventure. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Worlds Collide is the name for the Campaign in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and specifically refers to the endgame mode available once the campaign is completed.</strong></p>



<p>Black Ops 7 features co-op with up to four players throughout the campaign, with a huge focus on replayability in the post-game when the main story is completed.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-endgame-multiplayer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed by Activision</a>, the endgame mode is a new and shared experience “where the narrative continues to unfold.” It takes place on the Avalon map, with POIs from across Black Ops history, featuring discoverable intel, expansive skill tracks, and more.</p>



<p>Detailed in the Call of Duty blog, the endgame mode takes place after the conclusion of the 11 co-op campaign missions that make up the game’s story, and tasks players with exploring Avalon to find The Guild’s remaining Command Centers, while battling with exposure zones that are leaking a mysterious toxin into the city.</p>



<p>The area is expected to be the best place to grind for the exclusive campaign camos that are available for weapons in Black Ops 7, for the first time, which adds to the camos available in multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-worlds-collide-pvp-or-pve">Is Worlds Collide PvP or PvE?</h2>



<p><strong>Unlike Warzone, the Worlds Collide endgame mode is an entirely PvE operation, and there is no combat against other players.</strong></p>



<p>The mode is designed for one-to-32 players in squads of up to four, where players can choose to tackle smaller objectives individually in their squad, or combine with other squads to take down more difficult objectives.</p>



<p>Different areas of Avalon have different recommended Combat Ratings, providing varying degrees of challenge for players, but there are no PvP offerings available.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Confirms Bungie’s Marathon Will Launch by March 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-march-2026-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-confirms-bungie%E2%80%99s-marathon-will-launch-by-march-2026.1349656/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony has once again reconfirmed that Bungie’s extraction-based shooter, Marathon, will launch by March 2026.</p>



<p>The confirmation came during the company’s quarterly earnings call, where Sony’s CFO, Lin Tao, said that Bungie’s Marathon was still in active development and that the company was “fully dedicated” to launching the game in the current fiscal year. Sony’s fiscal year ends March 2026, suggesting that Marathon will likely launch sometime in February to March, if we were to guess.</p>







<p>Marathon has had an uphill battle since it was first announced earlier this year, with the game struggling to captivate players and the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-respond-art-theft-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing a slew of plagiarism allegations</a>, of which Bungie later admitted. The issues facing the gam<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> led to a delay of an undisclosed length</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-is-marathon-good-now">But is Marathon Good Now?</h2>



<p>However, as recently as the game’s latest playtests at the end of October, which were apparently under NDA, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-leaks-closed-test-reveal-positivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie has apparently been able to turn things around</a> with its game. </p>



<p>According to those who played the latest version of the game, it’s apparently in a much better state now, with players looking forward to its release in the coming months.</p>



<p>The game was said to be a ‘significant improvement’ since the playtests in the summer, yet the game still had some minor issueswhich were said to be easily fixed.</p>



<p>Whether Marathon will be a success on launch remains to be seen, but with GTA 6 now slipping into November 2026 and the start of the year seemingly being relatively quiet now, it could launch to some interest. </p>







<p>ARC Raiders is clearly the game’s most immediate competition, but if Marathon launches in March 2026, ARC Raiders’ playerbase and hype will likely have whittled down considerably. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to giving Bungie’s Marathon another go when it releases? Let me know what you’re thinking on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Fortnite is set to make a controversial addition in a future update, it’s claimed, with gambling mechanics set to be directly added to the title.</p>



<p>Huge updates are on the cards for Fortnite with Chapter 7 due to kick off later this month, and the annual switch in chapters usually results in the biggest gameplay changes of the year.</p>



<p>While we’ve already seen leaks suggesting huge collabs with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob Squarepants</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a> are on the cards, the apparent addition of gambling will ruffle some feathers.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1988203466146410851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reliable leaker ShiinaBR</a>, gambling mechanics are “coming soon” in Fortnite and will be available to games created using the Unreal Editor in Fortnite.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear whether official Fortnite experiences will support gambling, or whether content link loot boxes will be added to the Item Shop, but it appears that it will be available in community-created experiences.</p>



<p>According to leaks, random items will be purchasable with V-Bucks, but creators will be required to disclose gambling odds—something commonplace in gaming to align with international laws. Additionally, due to laws in some nations, experiences with gambling involved will be blocked in some nations.</p>



<p>While gambling aspects are already available in some user-created experiences within Fortnite, including pet eggs with a rare chance to hatch specific creatures in games like Pet Heroes Adventure, the major difference is that these are paid for with in-game soft currency that is not purchasable.</p>



<p>With this update, V-Bucks will be directly available to spend on items that provide random rewards, though it’s unclear at this stage what exactly that will entail, and it will likely depend on the experience being played.</p>
