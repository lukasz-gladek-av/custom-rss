            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nacon, a major French publisher and holdings company, has this morning revealed a dire situation. In a new press release, the company has revealed it has filed for insolvency after its parent company, Bigben, entered a period of financial difficulty.</p>



<p>In the release, it was stressed that Nacon will need to undergo a ‘rapid implementation of a financial restructuring’ to survive and has requested a judicial reorganisation review to facilitate this. Nacon’s ‘available assets’ are now substantial enough to meet its due liabilities, and it will now assess critical pathways out of this situation.</p>







<h2 id="h-nacon-could-shut-down-if-the-worst-happens">Nacon Could Shut Down If The Worst Happens</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the new press release</a>, published this morning at 8 AM CET, Nacon’s representatives wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To date, the Company reports that its available assets do not allow it to meet its due liabilities. In this ucontext, the Company will, as of today, file for insolvency (“déclaration de cessation des paiements”) with the Court and request the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”). </p>



<p>The aim of this procedure is to assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Company’s activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The company’s shares have ceased trading on the Paris market, and a court hearing has organised for early March to review the next steps for the firm.</p>



<p>Nacon was founded in 1981, dabbling in publishing, software, and peripherals over the years. It famously had a stint of distributing Sega’s Dreamcast consoles at the turn of the millennium. The company was originally known as Bigben Interactive, but it restructured in 2019, consolidating resources under the new ‘Nacon’ banner to bring together a dedicated gaming brand.</p>



<p>Bigben Group became the majority shareholder in Nacon, assuming control of more than 76% of shares.</p>



<p>This insolvency threatens a whopping 11 studios, including Spiders, Daedalic, Big Ant, Cyanide, and Kylotonn, all of which sit under the Nacon banner.</p>



<p>Cyanide is best known for the recent release of Styx: Blades of Greed. Big Ant is a studio focused almost exclusively on sports titles, Kylotonn most recently released Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, Spiders is the developer behind GreedFall, and Daedalic infamously developed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lotr-gollum-daedalic/" id="9681">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a> most recently.</p>



<p>The company is yet to deliver on the publishing and release of multiple games:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gear.Club Unlimited 3</li>



<li>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</li>



<li>Cthulu: The Cosmic Abyss</li>



<li>Endurance Motorsport</li>



<li>Edge of Memories</li>



<li>Dragonkin: The Banished</li>



<li>Hunting Simulator 3</li>
</ul>



<p>Nacon’s employees were notified of this news yesterday, February 24, and Nacon has promised to ‘keep the market informed as the situation and the proceedings develop.’</p>

<p>Pokémon Go offers a slew of content in the build-up to Go Tour Kalos, including some exclusive Timed Research that players must claim through code redemption.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a> Tour: Kalos takes place this weekend, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-tour-kalos-time-dates/" id="177591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 28 to March 1</a>, and comes off the back of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-presents-2026-date-time-length/" id="178159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Day on Friday</a>, where a slew of exciting news from the franchise is set to be shared.</p>



<p>If you want to make sure you don’t miss out on the Timed Research Codes in Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos, Insider Gaming has the crucial details you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-go-tour-kalos-timed-research-codes">All Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos Timed Research Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Debuts. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are several Timed Research Codes available to claim around Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos, with Unown the featured Pokémon</strong> <strong>in each.</strong></p>



<p>Various Unown forms are the focus of the Timed Research during the Kalos Tour, including X &amp; Y, the games where Kalos first featured, and Z &amp; A, referencing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a-2/" id="3627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, where players returned to Lumiose City.</p>



<p>Timed Research codes, as the name suggests, are only available to complete and earn rewards for a limited time. The tasks are easy to complete, however, and you should be able to tick through them quickly while you focus your attention on all the other offerings during Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos. </p>



<p>All the Timed Research codes for Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos are shown in the table below, alongside the Pokémon they feature.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Code</th><th data-align="center">Featured Pokémon</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>6K343X373BDQM</strong></td><td data-align="center">Unown Y</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>2PKXPAT2RJXKL</strong></td><td data-align="center">Unown Z &amp; A</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-timed-research-codes-in-pokemon-go">How to Redeem Timed Research Codes in Pokémon Go</h2>



<p><strong>All Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Timed Research Codes must be redeemed on the Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go webstore, and cannot be redeemed directly within the app.</strong></p>



<p>While this isn’t ideal if you’re out and about, the redemption process is quick and easy, with rewards available in the app immediately once redeemed.</p>



<p>The precise steps to redeeming the Timed Research Codes in Pokémon Go are shown below.</p>



<ol>
<li>Head to the Pokémon Go webstore.</li>



<li>Sign in to your account.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Code Redemption’ option at the top of the page.</li>



<li>Enter the code and click ‘Apply.’</li>



<li>When successfully redeemed, a notification will appear from Pokémon Go on your device.</li>



<li>Open Pokémon Go and complete the tasks!</li>
</ol>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 25, 2026, Quordle is the #1493 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games because it requires you to guess four words at once correctly, and you can do so on the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You are shown four equal lines reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-quordle-daily-game">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 26.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
