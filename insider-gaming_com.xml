As of <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/market-stock/0NVL/ubisoft-entertainment-sa/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">closing in the UK</a>, Ubisoft was trading for €11.19 compared to the €12.15 it opened at.

<p>The fall fully erases the 11% gain the company saw in stock prices on Friday, less than a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">day after it was announced</a>.</p>

<p>ASUS is teasing something big for its Republic of Gamers (ROG) lineup on social media. In a short video teaser posted on Monday afternoon, ASUS teased what’s next for the ROG Ally. And what’s next is expected to be the rumored ASUS Xbox handheld currently known as Project Kennan.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-launching-partner-gaming-handheld-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors</a> and reports, this device isn’t going to be the standalone Xbox handheld that Microsoft is actively working on. Instead, it’s going to be a third-party device that will include Xbox branding.</p>







<p>Specifics on what the device will be remain scarce, including exact details on how it will fit as an Xbox device. A recent report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-is-partnering-with-asus-for-upcoming-gaming-handheld-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Central</a> seemed to make it clear that the system won’t play Xbox games as it will be a “tried-and-true Windows PC in essence”. Instead, it will be act like the current ROG Ally while featuring an Xbox Guide button and “more prominent grips”.</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s also unknown if it will feature any other spec updates over the original ROG Ally or will be similar to the anticipated ROG Ally 2.</p>



<p>What do you think the ASUS-Xbox Handheld known as Project Kennan will include? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>Fighting mobs is fun, but we’re after The First Berserker Khazan’s bosses for the tense, multi-hour fights that leave you wanting to pummel your controller. We’ve rounded up every main boss fight in the game and can tell you how many there are.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-trophy-list-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is one of the hardest Soulslikes I’ve ever played. I’m not sure how Neople managed it, but they’ve put together a collection of unique, challenging, and rewarding boss fights. Very rarely are they unfair, either—a rarity, as when I die in a Souls game, I blame anyone but myself.</p>



<p>The boss fights in Khazan are fantastic. If you’re just starting or wondering how many are left, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-bosses-are-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">How Many Bosses Are in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This guy… Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 16 main bosses and a further 10 optional side bosses in The First Berserker Khazan.</strong></p>



<p>If you want to beat <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The First Berserker Khazan</a>, you need to overcome 16 boss fights. Encounters can have several phases, and enemies have a large moveset of attacks they inevitably cycle through.</p>



<p>I had the pain of fighting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-nerfs-hardest-bosses-in-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-patch Viper before it was nerfed</a>, and I can tell you I spent <em>over 2 hours</em> on this fight alone! Your mileage will vary depending on your ability, your patience, and how adept you are at studying and memorizing attacks.</p>



<p>Also, there are ways to make particular boss fights easier. <strong>The Aratra fight—for example—requires you to target the enemy’s weak points</strong> to inflict massive damage. If you coordinate your attack well enough, you can lop off its limbs simultaneously and bring yourself very close to the finishing line.</p>

<p>Eidos-Montreal, a development studio known for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy and support on games like Marvel’s Avengers and Tomb Raider, has announced a wave of large-scale layoffs.</p>



<p>The Embracer-owned studio posted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eidosmontreal_nous-avons-inform%C3%A9-aujourdhui-les-membres-activity-7312494582850543616-TzUD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> on Monday afternoon that it was letting go 75 employees.</p>



<p>“Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end,” the article reads. “It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.</p>



<p>“These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition.”</p>



<p>The studio closed its statement saying that it was “committed to deliver” the projects it has currently in development.</p>



<p>Currently, Eidos-Montreal is supporting Playground Games on the Fable reboot that is scheduled to launch in 2026. The game’s delay into 2026 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recently announced</a> by Playground Games.</p>
