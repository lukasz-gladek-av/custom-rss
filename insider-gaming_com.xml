            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/devonta-smith-cheating-claims-warzone-super-bowl/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On February 9, DeVonta Smith won the Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles in front of 127 million viewers. One week later, the superstar wide receiver was staring down accusations that labelled him a malicious cheater in Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>While streaming Warzone in the last few days, Smith came under fire from a slew of allegations across social media, being lambasted by folks hellbent on branding the athlete a lousy cheater. In clips that surfaced online, some suspicious sequences unravelled, but what‚Äôs the truth of it?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-does-devonta-smith-cheat-on-call-of-duty">Does DeVonta Smith Cheat on Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>The most talked-about clip of DeVonta Smith‚Äôs gameplay appeared on MLFootball on X. It was only a minute-long segment, and it was uploaded to showcase Smith‚Äôs humourous comms while streaming Warzone, but it was enough for Call of Duty sleuths to identify some strange goings-on.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs the post with the full clip:</p>



<div><article><p><span>TRENDING: </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eagles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Eagles</a><span> star receiver  DeVonta Smith live streaming playing Call of Duty has gone viral for how funny he is.

üò≠üò≠üò≠

Smitty üíÄ
</span><span></span></p></article></div>







<p>In the video, you can see Smith ‚Äì who streams under the guise <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/smityyytv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‚ÄòsmityyyTV‚Äô</a> ‚Äì gunning down the opposition on Rebirth Island. It‚Äôs plain as day that his accuracy and locks are scarily good, and even targets flying through the air or those appearing suddenly at long range are no challenge for the Eagles star.</p>



<p>The community is torn. If you take a look at the wider picture and check out his VOD content, it becomes less suspicious, and he starts to look like more of a well-rounded player than someone using a little extracurricular software to dominate lobbies.</p>



<p>Smith took advantage of the publicity to promote his content, inviting users to check him out in future streams:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Since yall think im cheating on COD just join the stream tonight ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£</span></p></article></div>







<p>In an effort to vouch for the Super Bowl-winning athlete, Paradox Customs, a PC company, declared on social media that ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs not cheating‚Äô. The vouch went hand-in-hand with a revelation that Paradox had built DeVonta‚Äôs last two PCs, but gamers were quick to jump on the post and explain how ridiculous a retort that is.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, allegations like this rarely go away. Take Nadia, for example. She became a prolific Warzone streamer off the back of ‚Äòhackusations‚Äô that surfaced a good few years ago <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nadia-delta-force-event-cheater-investigation/">that have followed her around</a> like a bad stink ever since.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-rainbow-six-siege-top-esports-game-years-later/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2015, and today, it‚Äôs still going strong. Ubisoft has made this flagship shooter the poster boy for its esports ecosystem, and the millions of fans worldwide can attest to how popular it is. From multi-million-dollar tournaments to a game that never stops evolving, Rainbow Six Siege is <strong>still </strong>in a very good place in the wider esports industry.</p>



<p>That topic was broached by Gaming World Media at the recent Six Invitational tournament in Boston. The team caught up with Fran√ßois-Xavier Deniele, Ubisoft‚Äôs VP of Global Esports, to talk about how Rainbow Six esports got started and why it‚Äôs still such a popular game today.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-power-of-rainbow">The Power of Rainbow</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six is a legendary enough brand, but the strength of Siege is another talking point entirely. This game has stood firm for a decade, and it can be argued that in the last year or so, it has gotten <strong>increasingly popular</strong>.</p>



<p>Ubisoft refuses to relent when it comes to content updates and innovation, and most recently, the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/">uncovered Siege X</a>, a full-blown overhaul that‚Äôs poised to take Rainbow Six Siege to the next level.</p>



<p>Looking back to where it all started, Deniele explained to Gaming World Media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If I want to just look back ten years ago, Ubisoft was not known at all as an esports company.</p>



<p>I remember having my first meeting with orgs and clubs, being a Ubisoft guy, when you have Blizzard, Riot, Valve‚Ä¶ And ten years after, yeah, we‚Äôre at the table and we‚Äôre proven.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But what does it take to keep Rainbow Six Siege so stable after all these years?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For me, it‚Äôs to stay open. Listen to the community all the time, make sure that we are serving the game. We are not here to <strong>change </strong>the game. The game is here for a large community. Esports needs to be delivering the best of the game and not trying to change the game.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs very important for me that we have a lot of discussions about the evolution of the game and also we make sure that we are sticking with the reality of the game, where the game is important, and not trying to think that we can become big on esports where the game is not here.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Talking about the wider ecosystem, Deniele mentioned that a constant flow of fresh talent is pivotal to the ongoing success of an esports game. There‚Äôs also a lot to be said about the structure of that competitive scene, and having breaks and supporting grassroots endeavours are remarkably important elements.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs the nature of the Six Invitational, and it was portrayed perfectly by two ‚Äòorgless‚Äô teams making it so far into this year‚Äôs event. While some esports games might ‚Äògatekeep‚Äô who can compete in their events, Rainbow Six Siege is, for the most part, wide open and super accessible.</p>

<p>A new Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater remaster is on the way. This according to what pro skateboarder Tyshawn Jones said during a radio appearance on February 18.</p>



<p>Talking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxPaLb7i-ezl_iTk1bqEwOkJmHOXgFbMax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New York‚Äôs Power 105.1 FM</a>, Jones gave away that a new game is set to be revealed and/or released in the near future.</p>



<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a Tony Hawk coming out so that‚Äôs cool,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey got a new one they remastering so that‚Äôs about to come out. I was in the last one.‚Äù</p>



<p>Talks surrounding the future of Tony Hawk games has been circulating for months. Back in September, Hawk himself said he was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-is-talking-to-activision-about-tony-hawk-pro-skater-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking to Activision</a> about the future of the series.</p>



<p>‚ÄúI wish I could tell you more,‚Äù Hawk said at the time. ‚ÄúBut I can tell you that I‚Äôve been talking to Activision again which is insanely exciting. We‚Äôre working on something.‚Äù</p>



<p>He then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on social media</a> that he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsupposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future.‚Äù</p>

<p>The last Tony Hawk game to release was Tony Haw‚Äôs Pro Skate 1 + 2 in 2020. The game  was developed by Vicarious Visions, which has since been rebranded as Blizzard Albany after becoming fully merged into Blizzard Entertainment in 2022.</p>



<p>There had been rumors of a Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater 3 + 4 remaster being in development, but nothing came of those at the time. Should Jones‚Äô claims be accurate, it would seem to point to that being the game.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment on Jones‚Äô claims of a new Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater remaster coming soon. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly. </p>
