<p>As promised, S-Game has released a new gameplay trailer for Phantom Blade Zero. The studio had said it would release an trailer today to celebrate the Year of the Snake. In case you didn’t know, 2025 is the Year of the Snake in the Chinese and Japanese calendars.</p>



<p>Watch the video below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Made in Unreal Engine 5, the visual quality of the game is impressive. The lighting and combat animations have definitely been given a hefty boost since the last trailer for the game.</p>



<p>Players are increasingly looking forward to Phantom Blade Zero. The game ended up being sponsored by PlayStation, which certainly helps to raise expectations for it. Phantom Blade Zero is a spiritual successor to Rainblood: Town of Death, a game created in RPG Maker.</p>



<p>Over the years, Rainblood became an IP called Phantom Blade, which has sold more than 20 million units. Now, S-Game is seeking its place in the AAA gaming ecosystem with this new venture.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-story-of-phantom-blade-zero">The story of Phantom Blade Zero</h2>



<p>Phantom Blade Zero will have a semi-open world and the story has already been revealed. Check out the synopsis below:</p>



<p><em>In Phantom Blade Zero, you are Soul, an elite assassin who serves an elusive but powerful organization known simply as “The Order”. He was framed for the murder of The Order’s patriarch and seriously injured in the ensuing hunt. A mystical healer managed to save him from death, but the impromptu cure only lasts 66 days. He must discover the mastermind behind it all before his time runs out, facing powerful enemies and inhuman monstrosities.</em></p>



<p>Kenji Tanigaki, the action director of the Samurai X films, acts as action director for Phantom Blade Zero. This alone explains how the moves are so acrobatic and realistic.</p>

<p>There’s still a future for Mortal Kombat 1. In a <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1881825221369528644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">multi-post thread</a> on Twitter on Tuesday evening, Mortal Kombat created Ed Boon talked about the state of the game while quickly mentioning future DLC plans for Mortal Kombat 1.</p>



<p>First thing’s first, Boon announced that Mortal Kombat 1 has sold more than 5 million copies since its September 2023 launch. On top of that, the game continues to remain in the top 15 games on PlayStation 5 in terms of weekly active users.</p>



<p>Boon also mentioned the release of the game’s Conan the Barbarian DLC that launched on January 21 as the game’s 11th DLC fighter. A 12th fighter, the T-1000 Terminator, will be the next addition to the game’s roster.</p>



<p>As far as future fighters go, there has been a lot of rumors surrounding DLC wrapping up for the game after the lackluster sales of Kombat Pack 2 and the Khaos Reigns expansion. While Boon didn’t mention another Kombat Pack or story expansion specifically, he did say that there was more to come for players.</p>



<p>“With Conan getting into player’s hands, we are excited to keep trucking forward with future DLC,” he posted. </p>



<p>The end of Mortal Kombat 1 DLC began thanks to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known franchise leaker</a>. According to their claims, says that plans for Kombat Pack 3 and a second story was cancelled at NetherRealm studios. He did say, however, that it was possible for “a kameo or two” to be added to the game after Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 due to the work that had already been done. </p>



<p>NetherRealm hasn’t fully addressed those claims.</p>

<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages’ release date has been leaked and will launch on May 15, 2025.</p>



<p>That’s according to an article released by Gamekult (article since removed), who’s seemingly released embargoed information ahead of the Xbox developer Direct.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that select media will be seeing previews of DOOM: The Dark Ages ahead of the official presentation.</p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct is scheduled to place on January 23rd, making the 23rd a somewhat hectic day in the world of gaming as Assassin’s Creed Shadows previews will also drop on the game day.</p>



<p>As already revealed by Xbox, three games; DOOM: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, and Expedition 33 are set to have “in-depth” showcases, while Xbox has also teased a fourth game, which we released the scuttlebutt of what the game is in the latest Insider Gaming Newsletter (sign up below).</p>



<p>As well as the four game announcements, a few other surprises will be announced during the event or in the coming days, Insider Gaming understands.</p>



<p>“You are the DOOM Slayer, the legendary demon-killing warrior and the super weapon in this never-before-seen dark and sinister medieval war against Hell,” the official DOOM: The Dark Ages description reads.</p>



<p>What do you think of DOOM: The Dark Ages releasing in May? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
