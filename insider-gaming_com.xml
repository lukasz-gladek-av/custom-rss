<p>According to a new report, <strong>it seems like the mystery of the Game Awards statue may have been solved</strong>. Furthermore, if true, it comes from a studio fresh off huge wins at the event.</p>



<p>Since last month, a weird statue in the middle of New Mexico has appeared out of nowhere. Both The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley hinted at its true nature, but fans have been going berserk figuring out what it means. From God of War and Diablo to Saros and The Elder Scrolls, guesses <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been all over the place</a>. Some theories had some real weight to them, though many were shut down by industry figures like Jason Schreier and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-director-reveals-if-the-game-awards-2025-statue-has-anything-to-do-with-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cory Barlog</a>. However, <strong>a new trademark for a legendary RPG series has been spotted</strong>, with the designs matching the statue perfectly.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>The report comes from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, who previously did pieces on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-dead-rising-hollywood-possible-capcom-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Rising</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-screenshots-canceled-xbox-avalanche/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contraband</a>. In it, the outlet found <strong>trademarks for a new Divinity game</strong>, directed by Baldur’s Gate 3’s Larian Studios. From the looks of it, <strong>the logo and accompanying images look strikingly similar to those of the statue</strong>. The picture of the listings, as well as the statue for reference, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/0BhWOdo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can be found here</a>.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that <strong>the connection has not been confirmed by Larian or The Game Awards</strong>, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. In any case, a new Divinity is something many fans will be pumped about. The last release, Divinity: Original Sin 2, came out in 2017 for last-gen consoles. The acclaimed RPG series took players to a new medieval fantasy world with turn-based combat and an isometric perspective. While the logo and all do look new, it could be a remaster of sorts for newer consoles. Still, Larian Studios has been on a roll after the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-bafta-games-awards/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, so, needless to say, if true, it’s one to keep a giant glowing eye on.</p>
