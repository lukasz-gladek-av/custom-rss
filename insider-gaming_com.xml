<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is bringing back some fan-favorite Black Ops 2 maps for Season One of the game.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, Black Ops 7 continues the Black Ops series name, as well as its story. Players will finally reunite with the Mason family from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2</a> and witness another mind-bending narrative, now with friends. However, it seems the story isn‚Äôt the only thing coming back, as two remastered maps from Black Ops 2 are returning for the new entry, as said by Activision.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1981421047376465996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Dev Talk</a> with the team at Treyarch, the team revealed two Black Ops 2 maps returning for Black Ops 7 as part of Season One: Meltdown and Standoff. Each map will be remastered and available as part of the next batch of maps, though a release date was not given. Standoff did join Black Ops: Cold War‚Äôs roster of maps during Season Three, acting as both a Multiplayer map and Zombies map. However, Meltdown has not been in the series since Black Ops 2 back in 2012, so fans will be excited to return to the nuclear powerplant.</p>



<p>The Season One roadmap for Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was revealed today</a> as part of the Dev Talk. Seven maps, including Meltdown and Standoff, will will release during the season, with more to come later. Three other Zombies maps, two being Survival, are also coming in Season One. The team is calling the new season its biggest yet and based on what we can tell, it sure seems to be. Either way, both new and returning players are in for a treat when it releases on November 14th.</p>
