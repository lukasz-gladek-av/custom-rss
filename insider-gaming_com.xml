<p>The Supermaster V ranked bug is a literal marvel in Marvel Rivals. You’d think it has positive connotations and signifies progress in Rivals, but it’s a strange occurrence with drastic outcomes for ranked matches. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals ranked mode is where the elite go to fight. It’s where the dedicated want to prove themselves and ascend to higher levels of greatness, before eventually applying to join the Avengers. With Shroud looking at starting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-marvel-rivals-esports-organisation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivals Esports organization</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s director already discussing Esports plans</a>, ranked is the first step on the road to major competitive play. </p>



<p>However, Marvel Rivals ranked play is being impacted by a Supermaster V bug. Let’s take a look at everything we know about it and what it does.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-causes-supermaster-v-bug-in-marvel-rivals">What Causes Supermaster V Bug in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Has this happened to you? Credit to X user and streamer @whyAndr3w</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Supermaster V is a post-game bug happening <strong>when a ranked match is considered invalid—due to insufficient players, AFK action, or forfeiting.</strong></strong></p>



<p>These issues can be attributed to connection issues, users being idle, or rage-quitting. In short, if your ranked match goes off without a hitch, it’s sure to be a valid encounter where everything is presented and shown as normal. If any of the above happens, Supermaster V may land to spoil your day.</p>



<p>It only appears at the end of a Marvel Rivals ranked match, and I can confirm it’s not one of the official tiers in the Rivals ranked system.</p>



<p>NetEase has yet to formally address the Supermaster V error. We’re trying to piece together what we can from various players’ experiences. You can see X user <a href="https://x.com/whyAndr3w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@whyAndr3w</a>‘s game above where they encountered the bug and <a href="https://x.com/whyAndr3w/status/1878800368580391230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted about it</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-supermaster-v-bug-change-your-online-rank-in-marvel-rivals">Does Supermaster V Bug Change Your Online Rank in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p><strong>Your online rank being affected by Supermaster V is inconclusive, but based on what we’ve seen, it doesn’t appear you are penalized too heavily if it happens.</strong></p>



<p>Anyone in an invalid lobby who is hit by the Supermaster V bug is susceptible to an <strong>AFK ban</strong>. It’s not confirmed to be a guarantee, but I’ve seen several examples of players complaining about this.</p>



<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2767030/discussions/0/578249962076305125/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam user EXtremist said</a>, “The game shows me a Supermaster [V] message, after winning, and then I get a <strong>15-minute penalty for being disconnected</strong>, which never happened. This is [the] 3rd time.” Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2767030/discussions/0/591758265559292113/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam player shared their story</a>, “I was in a ranked game and everyone had poor connection midway through. I hit 1000 ping at one point, [and] at the end I got the ranked progress, it says 20/30, and the rank was Supermaster V.”</p>



<p>Not every case seems to be the same though. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hnqkmi/saying_my_rank_is_supermaster_v_after_competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JDlyndon on the Marvel Rivals subreddit</a> shared a picture of the Supermaster V screen. They said they “Played and won a game of competitive and instead of getting a normal ranked points gain screen I got this.” They add “<strong>There was no AFK in the match” and it went down like a normal ranked match</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, the findings aren’t absolute right now. Keep checking back as we find out the latest on Supermaster V, and if NetEase comments.</p>



<hr>



<p>Have you had Supermaster V happen to you after playing a Marvel Rivals ranked match? Did you get an AFK ban? Have you lost any ranking points as a result?</p>

<p>Origins once again asks you to command an army and dominate the battlefield. You need to do this over many hours of gameplay, and Dynasty Warriors Origins has a few chapters to overcome—along with thousands of enemies.</p>



<p>Dynasty Warriors Origins is another exercise in hacking and slashing until it can be done no more. Moving from one arena to another, mercilessly chopping down hundreds of opposing forces. Developer Omega Force has done a good job with Origins as it’s currently the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-dynasty-warriors-origins-metacritic-score/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-rated Dynasty Warriors game</a> in history!</p>



<p>A refreshing overhaul of gameplay mechanics, a deeper story, lots of fun <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-dynasty-warriors-origins-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achievements</a>, and some of the most spectacular combat to date make Origins a strong entry. If you’re wondering how much action there is, let’s check out every chapter in Dynasty Warriors Origins and how long the game is.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-dynasty-warriors-origins-chapters-are-there">How Many Dynasty Warriors Origins Chapters Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lead and conquer. Credit to Omega Force</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five Chapters for each of Dynasty Warriors Origins’ campaigns. </strong></p>



<p>The chapters themselves aren’t named, the dev choosing to stick to generic numbers instead. <a href="https://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw_origins/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Origins</a>‘ longevity comes from multiple playthroughs required to see and complete every mission. This is because you eventually come to a crossroads in the main campaign.</p>



<p><strong>Two of the five chapters are shared across the three campaigns</strong>, and you’re forced to <strong>choose your side in Chapter 3</strong>—leaving certain stones untouched until another journey through the conquest.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-missions-in-dynasty-warriors-origins">How Many Missions in Dynasty Warriors Origins?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 70 main story missions and 48 side missions in total if you replay Dynasty Warriors Origins multiple times and take sides with different factions at the point of no return.</strong></p>



<p>This is where we get to see a true test of your mettle. It’s a lot of content and requires many hours, but doing so is your best way of seeing all Origins has to offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-dynasty-warriors-origins">How Long is Dynasty Warriors Origins?</h2>



<p><strong>Your initial Dynasty Warriors Origins playthrough should take around 20-40 hours.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll likely wander off the beaten path because of how much side content there is. But based on Omega Force’s comments, and the consensus around Origins, this is a solid figure for your first playthrough. However, as I’ve said, there are well over 100 missions to complete, a ton of special weapons and items to find, and powerful abilities to unlock.</p>



<p>Completionists are looking at well over <strong>100 hours of epic Dynasty Warriors Origins content to see and do!</strong></p>



<hr>



<p>We are not done with our Origins guides yet: Check out if the action title has any <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-multiplayer-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer or co-op content</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-dramatic-success-in-dynasty-warriors-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to get Dramatic Success</a>.<br></p>



<p>How likely are you to go to the ends of the Earth to see every piece of Dynasty Warriors Origins content? Is there anything missing you hope is either added in an update?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-big-is-the-map-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-answered.1088523/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is enormous. It boasts an open-world environment that players can explore at their desired pace, and it’s packed with secrets waiting to be discovered. From a massive medieval city to crumbling ruins, and from picturesque hamlets to bandit camps, you’ll never run out of things to uncover in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>Fans of the series <strong>know </strong>it’s a sizeable game, but how big is the map in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</p>



<p>Read on to find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-map-s">Map(s)</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 starts with players exploring a region called ‘Trosky’. Like in 2018’s Kingdom Come Deliverance, this is a faithful recreation of a real-world territory, and the towns scattered around the starter map all exist.</p>



<p>Trosky is fairly big, and it incorporates forest regions, a large central castle, winding rivers and hills, and a scattering of smaller villages, mills, and towns. The largest town on the map is Troskowitz, which is where you’ll find most of your traders.</p>



<p>To give you an impression of how big Trosky is in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, I had logged 35 hours in the game before I felt ‘ready’ to move on, satisfied that I’d done everything possible…</p>



<p>… And then I came back to the region later to find more objectives and locations to trawl through.</p>



<p>To learn more about that journey, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/">my full preview of the game</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map-size-huge">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Map Size = Huge</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 <strong>really </strong>opens up when players get to the Kuttenberg region. Again, this real-world location is perfectly represented in KCD2, and every town that you visit <strong>exists </strong>in Czechia.</p>



<p>The Kuttenberg region is staggering in size and is made up of more than a dozen towns and villages. The heart of this region is Kuttenberg, a sprawling city that plays host to some of the game’s most major sequences and missions. At first blush, you’ll be blown away by Kuttenberg – it’s an imposing medieval city with branching alleys, dozens of stores and taverns, and many people to meet.</p>



<p>The Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 map is ‘fogged’ by default, requiring players to travel to actively uncover the map. This means that you’re constantly finding new locations and villages, up until the point where you’ve found everything – and even then, it doesn’t end.</p>



<p>I feel as though you’ll always bump into another NPC with a tip on a hidden location or a point of interest.</p>



<p>If you’re an explorer, you’re in luck – the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 map (or maps, if you’d prefer) is enormous.</p>



<p>Before you leave, check out my guide that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-a-sequel-answered/">explains more about the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 story</a>.</p>
