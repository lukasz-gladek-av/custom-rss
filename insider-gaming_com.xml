<p>Call of Duty Warzone brought back Verdansk in 2025. It reminds us of a simpler time, but we must put nostalgia aside and concentrate on eliminating players and taking home dubs. The best Meta Warzone guns are the key, so let’s find out the best guns to use right now.</p>



<p>Verdansk, it’s good to see you again. The reintroduction of (probably) battle royale’s most popular map has seen a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-hits-highest-peak-viewer-count-since-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge uptick in CoD players</a>. The community is scrambling to unlock the devilishly difficult to obtain <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-trail-blazer-skin-unlock-fast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trail Blazer skin</a>, and they’re trying out new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone features such as Casual Mode</a>. </p>



<p>We’ve already covered what we think is the definitive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Meta Warzone Loadout</a>. But if you want a greater pool of guns to choose from, we’ve got what you need.</p>

<p><strong>The best Meta Assault Rifles to use in Warzone right now are easily the CR-56 AMAX, Kilo 141, and AK-74.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not naming 10 guns for each category as it’s a waste of time. These are the <em>best </em>of the best when it comes top fast-firing and hard-hitting ARs. You also have to bear in mind that buffs and nerfs will change the Meta, so be ready to pivot when the time comes.</p>



<p>But there’s a distinct old-school feeling with the Warzone AR Meta in 2025. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-amax-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMAX</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-kilo-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kilo 141</a>, and AK-74 have been staples in Verdansk at one point or another.</p>



<p>We think the AMAX is the best of the bunch—which is why it made it into our best Warzone Verdansk Meta Loadout—but you won’t go wrong with any of the three.</p>



<p>Also, while a couple of the Attachments may vary, all three guns benefit massively from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-monolithic-suppressor-attachment-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monolithic Suppressor</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-smg-guns-to-use-in-warzone-verdansk-right-now">Best SMG Guns to Use in Warzone Verdansk Right Now</h2>



<p><strong>The KSV, C9 (AKA MP5), and Saug are the main players in Warzone’s SMG department.</strong></p>



<p>Honestly, I would still prefer the best ARs over SMGs—that’s a personal preference. According to <a href="https://wzstats.gg/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone Meta</a>, these are the top three most popular SMGs as it stands. They benefit players who like to get in close and decimate enemies at close range.</p>



<p>SMGs should serve you better if you don’t care for Sniping or engaging at a distance. Furthermore, throwing a quick <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-thermite-lethal-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thermite</a> before storming a player’s location isn’t the worst idea in the world!</p>



<h2 id="h-best-sniper-rifle-gun-to-use-in-warzone-verdansk-right-now">Best Sniper Rifle Gun to Use in Warzone Verdansk Right Now</h2>



<p><strong>Warzone’s HDR is undoubtedly the best Sniper Rifle in CoD’s battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> one-shots anyone at <strong>any distance</strong>. I’m not saying you need to start dropping shots from 800m away, but you can equip the HDR knowing if you land a headshot, you’ll instantly delete whoever is the unfortunate soul on the other end of the shot.</p>



<p>Other Snipers will likely be buffed to provide competition (Kar98K, please), but the HDR is king right now.</p>

<p>Mario Kart and Rainbow Road go together like salt and pepper, or Bowser and foiled plans for world domination. Mario Kart World is the next cross-country chapter in the kart-racing genre, but a lack of Rainbow Road may be disturbing for some.</p>



<p>We all love the beast that is Bowser’s Castle, and there’s an element of discomfort about Ghost Valley that still gives us chills to this day. But when you think of a Mario Kart map sitting atop the mountain, it’s hard to look past Rainbow Road. Its look is iconic, most variations of the theme are hard, and it’s the Mario equivalent of a 1v1 on Rust.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> racing onto the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, all eyes are forward. We haven’t seen Rainbow Road in any pre-release material yet, so let’s see if it’s a chance for the track to have a breather.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-rainbow-road-in-mario-kart-world">Can You Play Rainbow Road in Mario Kart World?</h2>

<p><strong>Rainbow Road is included in Mario Kart World, and it seems like Nintendo is trying to keep its inclusion a secret for now.</strong></p>



<p>I’ll get onto the “secret” aspect of the track later, but you can breathe for now. Rainbow Road is in the new sequel, meaning we’re getting a brand-new RR-themed track, an amalgamation of previous RR tracks, older RR stages, or something else entirely.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world-rainbow-road-leak-explained">Mario Kart World Rainbow Road Leak Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The Nintendo Korea website posted a picture of the wider Mario Kart World map, showing a track design with Rainbow Road’s classic multicolored loops and bends.</strong></p>



<p>It’s been a tough time for the Nintendo Korea website since the Switch 2 properly came to the fore. Not only did it accidentally leak a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-bananza-spoiler-accidentally-revealed-by-nintendo-korea-before-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza spoiler</a> ahead of time, but it also had to take down the Rainbow Road image.</p>



<p>You can’t find the Rainbow Road image on the Nintendo Korea website anymore. Fortunately, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1jqrwq8/rainbow_road_has_finally_been_found_it_seems_it/?embed_host_url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/icymi-mario-karts-iconic-track-looks-set-for-a-return-in-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mario Kart Reddit post</a> was on the ball. The OP’s two images show the Rainbow Road outline, and a zoomed-in version, giving us the official confirmation we’re all craving.</p>



<p>With The Nintendo Switch 2’s new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-120fps-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">120 FPS, 4K, and HDR</a> possibilities, we’re very excited to see the best-looking Rainbow Road map ever!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-we-know-about-marathon-%E2%80%93-release-date-player-count-and-more.1156935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-marathon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon is an upcoming extraction shooter from Bungie, and given the company’s track record, it might seem like a bizarre bid for a new game. In the 1990s, Bungie developed and released a game of the same name, but this is light-years away from what surfaced thirty years ago.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m breaking down everything we know so far about Marathon, including the game’s release date, expected player count, and operating model.</p>



<p>If you’ve been eager to learn about Bungie’s Marathon, read on.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-kind-of-game-is-marathon">What Kind of Game is Marathon?</h2>



<p>Marathon will be a sci-fi extraction shooter, which is a popular genre of game that has exploded over the last few years. In an extraction shooter, players are charged with entering a map with a pre-determined loadout, fighting other players and resolving quests, and successfully leaving the map again.</p>



<p>With an extraction shooter, staying alive is critical, as dying in a game will mean that you lose all the equipment you’ve both taken into the map and found while exploring.</p>



<p>That means that Marathon will likely be a more challenging game than the average shooter, and it’ll have a more punishing gameplay loop that skilled players will come to appreciate. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-marathon-coming-out">When is Marathon Coming Out?</h2>



<p>At the time of publishing, the Marathon release date remains unconfirmed. Bungie hasn’t even given a release <strong>window</strong>, so we can’t say for sure in which year the game will be released.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more information.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-marathon-be-free-to-play">Will Marathon be Free to Play?</h2>



<p>The pricing structure for Marathon – and the operating model – is yet to be confirmed. It will most likely be a premium, paid-for product, as free-to-play extraction shooters aren’t typically a thing.</p>



<p>From what we know, it’ll be a live-service game of sorts, with there being more maps released after launch, but for now, that’s being kept under wraps.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-marathon">How Many People Can Play Marathon?</h2>



<p>Marathon is poised to be a multiplayer-based extraction shooter, but it hasn’t yet been confirmed how many players can occupy a single map at one time.</p>



<p>If it’s to be like competing titles such as Escape from Tarkov, it’s likely the player count in a single raid will be around 10 – 20. It will also likely accommodate solo, duo, and trio play, which is a relatively traditional operating model.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-marathon-be-on-xbox-and-playstation">Will Marathon Be on Xbox and PlayStation?</h2>



<p>We know that Marathon will be released on PC, but it’ll also be released on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 consoles. This will make it one of the only extraction shooter games on console, with the genre typically being locked to the PC community.</p>



<p>Make sure you stay tuned to learn all you need to know about Marathon as the information becomes available.</p>
