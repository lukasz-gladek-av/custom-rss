The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>Chances are, you’ve come across the Organless Corpse in the Examination Room in Resident Evil Requiem. You need a set of Artificial Lungs and an Artificial Heart to complete this puzzle, and this walkthrough will guide you every step of the way.</p>



<p>The Care Center isn’t the most friendly and hospitable of places in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, at least not in its current state. There are locked doors, mean zombies, and an open corpse of all things. This particular body has something you desperately need, and the Organless Corpse puzzle is a fun one.</p>

<li>If you’ve found the corpse, it means you’re far enough into the game to be able to start this quest.</li>
