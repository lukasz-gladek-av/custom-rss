<p>WWE 2K26 is introducing a new Ringside Pass, similar to battle pass systems in other games. Now, the gameplay designer, Cornell Gunter, explains the benefits fans can expect from this new addition.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> is set to release worldwide on March 13. This year’s game features the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273">several match types</a> to WWE video games. However, there are also many changes coming to this year’s game, including the introduction of a<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-will-the-wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-work/" id="174147"> new Ringside Pass</a>, which changes how unlockables work in the series.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-dev-says-ringside-pass-is-about-content-first-and-foremost">WWE 2K26 Dev Says Ringside Pass Is About Content First and Foremost</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/m935QSZHAfI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JustBryan,</a> WWE 2K26 gameplay designer Cornell Gunter praised the changes that the new Ringside Pass will offer. He notes that Ringside Pass Premium will offer day-one DLC. He also notes that the new system is strictly about content rather than time-sensitive releases. </p>



<p>While it is divided into seasons, none of the benefits are time-limited. If a player returns to the game after several months away, they will still have access to all premium content. Overall, there will be 120 reward items per season.</p>



<p>“I’m very excited to see what the reactions are by the end of the lifecycle. Because I think people are going to be very, very happy with what we are able to achieve and what we brought to the table with the Ringside Pass,” Gunter said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Team Vitality has lifted the trophy at IEM Krakow, extending a phenomenal record over the last year or so and sending FURIA packing at the final post. The victory came after a hard-fought battle in the Tauron Arena in front of thousands of fans, but Vitality’s final streak through FURIA was a masterclass to behold.</p>



<p>Only the opening round on Mirage was of any use to the Brazilian side, stumping up a tough 11-13 finish that quickly went squandered in the subsequent maps. By the third map, Team Vitality was dominating 13-2, showing why it was worthy of that all-important trophy and the $400,000 prize.</p>







<h2 id="h-team-vitality-matches-iem-krakow-predictions">Team Vitality Matches IEM Krakow Predictions</h2>



<p>In our earlier coverage, our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/iem-krakow/" id="3570">IEM Krakow</a> predictions had Team Vitality sitting pretty in first place, and it’s always nice to be validated by the result.</p>



<p>Team Vitality has pushed onwards and upwards with a monumental, award-winning streak that has left the team being regarded as one of the all-time greatest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/counter-strike/" id="482">Counter-Strike</a> rosters ever created. In the last year, the organization has edged into double-digit territory in terms of trophies raised, and this latest one, secured at the first IEM Krakow event, is more ammunition for the cabinet.</p>



<p>Before IEM Krakow, the team’s last win came at the StarLadder Budapest Major in December, which yielded a 3-1 win over FaZe Clan and a $500,000 prize.</p>



<p>Krakow seemed in the bag for Vitality throughout much of the tournament. For die-hard fans of the brand, this was only ever going to go one way.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>More changes could be coming to Xbox Game Pass, per a new report.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" id="1075">Xbox Game Pass</a> is currently a cornerstone of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/xbox-series-x/" id="28">Xbox </a>business. This past October, the cost of the Game Pass Ultimate tier increased to $29.99 per month after the company added nearly 50 games and committed to over 75 day-one releases per year.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tom Warren of The Verge </a>reports that more changes could be coming to the subscription service. One potential change is Microsoft experimenting with bundling additional third-party services with Game Pass subscriptions. Game Pass Ultimate currently includes access to Fortnite Crew, Ubisoft+ Classics, and EA Play.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft/" id="189">Microsoft </a>is considering merging <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131">Xbox </a>Game Pass Premium, the second-tier offering, with PC Game Pass. PC Game Pass is currently $16.49 per month and only allows players to access games on PC, rather than through the cloud or on consoles.</p>







<h2 id="h-still-don-t-expect-changes-to-game-pass-in-2026">Still, Don’t Expect Changes to Game Pass in 2026</h2>



<p>Tom Warren also states that he doesn’t expect any changes to the service this calendar year. Not only did Xbox make significant changes in October, but Microsoft is still seeing growth in PC Game Pass subscriptions.</p>



<p>Regarding the future of Xbox,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-says-next-xbox-console-may-launch-next-year/" id="173908"> AMD recently stated that the next Xbox console could launch in 2027.</a> It’s been said that the next Xbox in-home unit would be a PC-console hybrid. </p>







<p>In 2025, the brand entered the handheld market with the ROG Ally Xbox devices. Learn more about those <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rog-xbox-ally-vs-rog-xbox-ally-x-differences-price-specs/" id="148540">here</a>.</p>

<p>Kyedae and TenZ, the esports and content sweethearts who got engaged almost four years ago, have announced an amicable split on social media. The pair, who made their name competing in and streaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/valorant/" id="215">VALORANT</a>, became an iconic duo and one of the most recognisable romantic powerhouses in the modern gaming space.</p>



<p>In a lengthy post on social media, Kyedae revealed that they’ve been separated for ‘quite some time’ and that the break-up hasn’t come from a place of resentment or failure.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-did-kyedae-and-tenz-split-up">Why Did Kyedae and TenZ Split Up?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/kyedae/status/2020324209852031174" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full post</a> from Kyedae on social media outlines the situation:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey everybody,</p>



<p>Tyson (TenZ) and I feel ready to share some personal news.</p>



<p>We’ve actually been broken up for quite some time now. Toward the end of our relationship, we came to a realization that wasn’t easy to accept: we had stopped growing as individuals.</p>



<p>For most of our relationship, we did everything together.<br>Work — together.<br>Hobbies and interests — together.<br>Pretty much everything — together.</p>



<p>We’ve even joked in the past that although we were together for six years,&nbsp;<strong>it felt like at least thirty</strong>.</p>



<p>We moved in together just weeks after meeting, and from ages 17 to 24, that was all we knew. Over time, it became clear that we needed space to grow into our own people.</p>



<p>We know the internet often looks for “the tea” but the truth is sirnple —&nbsp;<strong>we grew apart</strong>.<br>There was no wrongdoing, no resentment, and no single event that caused this.</p>



<p>We still care deeply about each other and genuinely want the best for one another,<br>We’re also incredibly grateful for the time and life we shared together!</p>



<p>Thank you for respecting our privacy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rumors concerning the split had been circulating in streaming and social circles for some time, and this post effectively puts a nail in the coffin for them.</p>



<p>The pair were quick to get ahead of comments claiming that their engagement post from August 2022 ‘did not age well’, poking fun at themselves in a self-deprecating manner to beat the trolls.</p>



<p>It has admittedly been a rocky few years for the duo. TenZ announced his retirement from competing last year, and in 2023, Kyedae revealed <a href="https://x.com/kyedae/status/1631452687077363713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a cancer diagnosis</a> that eventually took her out of the streaming space indefinitely.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam’s Newest Feature is Huge for Early Access Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-new-early-access-feature-huge-for-games/</link>
            <guid>1429279</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Have you ever invested time, money, and effort into an early access game on Steam and wondered exactly when it’ll <span><strong>leave&nbsp;</strong>early access and graduate to</span> a full release? You’re not alone, and Valve has recognized that. In a recent update, the team behind Steam revealed that a new feature will give early access games greater transparency into their schedules.</p>



<p>When developers list early access products on Steam, they now have a visible field to indicate when the game will leave early access, whether that’s the <strong>year </strong>or the <strong>exact day</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-early-access-games-are-some-of-the-best">Early Access Games Are Some of the Best</h2>



<p>In the last few years, we’ve seen countless early access titles surface on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/steam/" id="173">Steam</a> and flourish, using the time granted by an earlier push to generate funds for the full development of a new title. In some cases, early access games flounder and fall, especially if they take a long time to <strong>leave </strong>that state.</p>



<p>But sometimes, an early access gem will appear, stick to a roadmap, and hit a full launch deadline without any issues.</p>



<p>The most recent example that rings true to that is Endnight’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/sons-of-the-forest/" id="320">Sons of the Forest</a>, which was released in early access and then launched as a full game exactly one year later, storming to success on Steam.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/500597484211404992?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new blog post</a>, Valve revealed that the early access date field is being added to promote better transparency for early adopters.</p>



<p>The team explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Occasionally, developers with a game in Early Access would ask us proactively if there was any official place to display a planned 1.0 date. They wanted existing and potential players to know about their plans. Many studios were already sharing their 1.0 dates in other places– within the text description on the store page, via Steam Event news posts, on social media, in their forums, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, they advised against using it <strong>just to use it</strong>, stressing that developers should only add a date if they’re relatively confident they’ll hit it. Otherwise, they risk running into trouble with their prospective fans.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout 76 Crossplay is Closer Than Ever and Fans Remain Hopeful]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-crossplay-closer-than-ever/</link>
            <guid>1429276</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Anyone who is anyone in the <em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fallout-76/" id="438">Fallout 76</a></em> space knows about the game’s glaring lack of crossplay mechanics. It has been one of the biggest sticking points for players over the years, exacerbated by the fact that <strong>so many similar games </strong>have crossplay features.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios is well aware of the yearning players have to blow open the Fallout 76 ecosystem. Last year, we sat down with the team in Los Angeles and learned how difficult it would be to <strong>add </strong>crossplay to Fallout 76, and in a new interview, that was reiterated.</p>



<p>But the way it was framed suggests <strong>it’s now a plan</strong>… <strong>Almost</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-fallout-76-ever-get-crossplay">Will Fallout 76 Ever Get Crossplay?</h2>



<p>In June 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-still-thinking-about-fallout-76-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we sat down with Bethesda’s</a> Jon Rush and Bill LaCoste to talk about Gone Fission, the most recent Fallout 76 update at the time. One of the key questions we asked concerned crossplay and cross-progression mechanics, to which Bill said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>People ask us that all the time. And the thing for us, it has been more of a technical challenge for us to be able to do that. It’s not that we don’t think about it,&nbsp;<strong>we think about it often</strong>.</p>



<p>But, overall, <strong>no real plans</strong> right now to introduce crossplay, but certainly, we get asked to consider it very often, so we do.</p>



<p>Maybe in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In October, another interview surfaced between Bethesda Game Studios and the Iron Lords, and <strong>again</strong>, it was stressed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/its-never-a-no-fallout-76-crossplay-addressed-by-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they’re asked about Fallout 76 crossplay</a> all the time, but there were ‘no real plans’ to introduce the feature, much to the chagrin of players:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s never a no, right?</p>



<p>But what I will say, is that those are decisions usually made at the very beginning of development, and right now it’s a huge technical lift for us to have crossplay or cross-progression on it (Fallout 76).</p>



<p>It’s something we get asked about constantly from players. I understand why, I feel the same way. I’d love to go play on Steam and then go play on Xbox or PlayStation and just have my character, but right now, <strong>it’s a little bit too difficult for us to pull off</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>But then </strong>the pair appeared in yet another interview, this time with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout-76-crossplay-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, and it seems things have changed. Rush and LaCoste altered their direction on the Fallout 76 crossplay topic, going from ‘too difficult’ and ‘no real plans’ to something much more tangible.</p>



<p>Jon Rush said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are looking into it, and we have plans to try to scope out what that work is going to entail for us.</p>



<p>It’s just not in the immediate plans for us. We know players want it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And he was backed up by LaCoste:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What we can promise players is that we will continue to investigate, we will continue to try to establish plans to make that a thing in the future, just not in the short term.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a little weak, but Jon’s comment about ‘we have plans’ and ‘we are looking into it’ is perhaps the closest we’ve ever gotten to the Fallout 76 crossplay debate being resolved. If they’re sizing up the technical delivery of crossplay mechanics, we’re one step nearer to playing with our friends across those gaming borders.</p>
