<p>Jerk Gustafsson is the studio director at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/machinegames/" id="87686">MachineGames</a>. MachineGames has been developing Wolfenstein games since 2014, and Gustafsson says he still plans to finish the trilogy.</p>



<p>During a recent discussion with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/machinegames-on-being-part-of-microsoft-going-back-to-the-office-and-wolfenstein-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry</a>, Gustafsson admitted that, because of the time it takes to make video games in 2026, he may only have a few more projects in his career, about two or three to be more specific.</p>



<p>When asked if one of those games would be a third <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wolfenstein/" id="2953">Wolfenstein</a>, he remained coy, but expressed the intent to always return to the series, saying, “We wanted to finish the trilogy. And when we do that, that is something that I don’t want to comment on. It can be now, it can be later, but we’re not done with it. That’s what I can say.”</p>







<h2 id="h-machinegames-also-worked-on-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">MachineGames Also Worked on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>While there hasn’t been a Wolfenstein game since 2019, Machine Games was hard at work for the release of 2024’s Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Released first on Xbox platforms, the game made its way to PlayStation 5 in 2025 and will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-avoids-game-key-card-on-nintendo-switch-2/" id="174746">arrive on the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.</a></p>



<p>Gustafson discussed the game’s development and its departure from Wolfenstein’s first-person action. He admitted that it’s the first game the team has ever made that’s rated T for teen rather than M for mature.</p>



<p>When discussing some of the challenges of working on the game, he admitted it was hard for him to convey the overall goal, noting that it took until the final year of production for things to click. </p>



<p>He noted that he is proud of the games they make, enjoys expanding his horizons, and even wants to test himself and his team by making a mobile game, saying, “It just requires a different skillset that we don’t have at MachineGames. Maybe sometime in the future, but who knows?”</p>







<p>For now, there’s no confirmation of a third Wolfenstein game from MachineGames, but the team’s goal is to make one more game.</p>

            <guid>1427653</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" id="54815">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is the only forthcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda-2/" id="3469">Bethesda </a>game for the Nintendo Switch 2 that will not be launched on a game key card.</p>



<p>As physical releases for video games become increasingly rare, developers and console manufacturers are working to bridge the gap between efficient ways to bring games to more players and the wants of players who prefer physical media. Nintendo, with the launch of its latest console, has introduced game key cards.</p>



<p>Game key cards enable physical releases; players must be connected to the internet to download the game. They must also keep the cartridge in the console to play the game, even though it is a glorified digital download. While developers have explained that this option makes physical releases more attainable, many players dislike game key cards because they require an internet connection and raise broader concerns about game preservation.</p>







<h2 id="h-bethesda-has-chosen-top-games-on-game-key-cards">Bethesda Has Chosen Top Games on Game Key Cards</h2>



<p>During the Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase on February 5, 2026, Bethesda announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/" id="2569">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would all be making their way to the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908"> Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2026.</p>



<p>As it turns out, they would later reveal in a <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/17ZQE6BiOoEfIFRJJTtfz2/bethesda-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that Fallout 4 and Oblivion would be released on game key cards. Additionally, the forthcoming Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Anniversary Edition will have a physical code-in-box launch in April.</p>



<p>This means Indiana Jones is the only game available in full on a physical cartridge.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/baldurs-gate-3/" id="1058">Baldur’s Gate</a> TV series is coming from the mind behind HBO’s The Last of Us series.</p>



<p>The world of video game-to-TV adaptations continues to expand, with news coming out of <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline </a>that Craig Mazin, co-creator of the aforementioned Last of Us series, is creating a series based on Baldur’s Gate 3 for HBO. Mazin will create, write, showrun, and executive produce the forthcoming series.</p>



<p>Jacqueline Lesko, Cecil O’Connor, and Gabriel Marano will also be attached as executive producers. Marano is representing Hasbro Entertainment, which owns the Baldur’s Gate franchise as an extension of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise. Speaking of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Chris Perkins, the longtime Head of Story at Wizards of the Coast, will serve as a consultant on the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-details-on-the-forthcoming-series">More Details on the Forthcoming Series</h2>



<p>The show is reportedly drawing from the source material of Baldur’s Gate 3, beginning how the game ends, but with no ties to the current game and development, Mazin has free rein over the direction of the story, which will reportedly be more of a traditional TV series than The Last of Us was. The series is expected to feature existing characters from the popular game, as well as new ones.</p>



<p>There’s also the expectation that the forthcoming TV series will keep the Dungeons &amp; Dragons tradition of leveling characters up through the journey. The series is being designed to coexist alongside another live-action D&amp;D series, Netflix’s The Forgotten Realms.</p>



<h2 id="h-hbo-s-baldur-s-gate-is-far-from-the-only-video-game-to-tv-adaptation-in-the-works">HBO’s Baldur’s Gate Is Far From the Only Video Game-To-TV Adaptation in the Works</h2>



<p>In addition to this series and the aforementioned Last of Us series, which is currently producing its final season, Prime Video is developing a series based on the God of War franchise. Ryan Hurst is slated to play Kratos, and many other casting decisions have been announced in recent weeks. Learn more about that series <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-video-casts-thor-and-odin-in-god-of-war/" id="172954">here</a>.</p>



<p>There are also series in development based on Tomb Raider, Life is Strange, and more.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394">Highguard </a>is adding new heroes, a ranked mode, and more on February 6, with the launch of Episode 2.</p>



<p>Highguard has added a ranked mode via <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2019456108734324869" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new patch</a>. Ranked Mode is a 3v3 competitive playlist where all players start in Bronze 3 and climb through seven ranks (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, and Grandmaster), each with three divisions. Players will earn points based on match outcomes, kill bonuses, streaks, and more.</p>



<p>Each episode contains two “Ranked Splits.” Splits change maps and bases. They can also apply balance tweaks. At the episode’s end, players receive rewards based on their final rank, including new cosmetic Banner Frames that increase in prestige at higher tiers.</p>



<p>The first Split will have the following maps: Kingdom, Summit, and Rivermark. The bases included will be Hellmouth, Smuggler’s Den, King’s Lair, Soul Well, Frosthold, and Wellspring.</p>



<p>A new map has also been added to Highguard. In addition to the new ranked mode, they have also added a new location, Skydrift. Described as “uncharted lands of Highguard where maps go blank,” and “hollowed out caverns once home to great winged-beasts,” the new base has been added to the rotation in 3v3 and 5v5.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-assassins-creed-multiplayer-game/</link>
            <guid>1427569</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A previous report from Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed/" id="24">Assassin’s Creed</a> game codenamed “League” was canceled has now been confirmed.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.origami.ng/ubisoft-vantage-cancel-league-assassins-creed-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Origami</a>, Assassin’s Creed League was originally planned as multiplayer DLC for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" id="1478">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</a>. The game was designed around four assassins joining forces, set in feudal Japan to align with Shadows. League was reportedly intended to close out the season pass with a collection of scripted, four-player cooperative missions.</p>







<h2 id="h-more-on-the-future-of-the-assassin-s-creed-league-project">More on the Future of the Assassin’s Creed League Project</h2>



<p>It’s claimed that Ubisoft Annecy reevaluated the plan to make League an Assassin’s Creed Shadows expansion over the past year. Ultimately, it was deemed too time-consuming to meet quality standards. </p>



<p>They considered options like incorporating the multiplayer setup into another Assassin’s Creed project or scaling the project down into a smaller, standalone co-op game using parts of Shadows’ open world. Annecy chose the latter, planning to launch invitation-only alpha tests by May 2026.</p>



<p>The report notes that sources claim Ubisoft Vantage plans to continue the project’s legacy through a small team of around ten developers. The group is first focused on transferring the project’s technical advancements to the Anvil engine before pitching cooperative modes that could be used in future Assassin’s Creed titles.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> in October 2024 that a multiplayer co-op mode for Shadows is in development and planned for a post-launch release. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-datamine-reveals-a-multiplayer-mode/">A datamine in 2025</a> showed instances of a multiplayer mode being mentioned in the game’s files.</p>



<p>This news comes as Ubisoft continues to undergo a massive restructuring, including the cancellation or pausing of multiple projects. League is now the latest scrapped project.

<p>As a Soulslike, Nioh 3 assumes a reputation of being a hard game. We can say with complete certainty that it lives up to this mantle and more. This guide has the absolute top tips and tricks you have to use and absorb if you are to survive and complete Nioh 3.</p>



<p>Playing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-upcoming-soulslike-games-2026/" id="172993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Souls</a> games is as daunting as ever. While the genre has largely moved away from the sneaky traps and enemy placement of yesteryear—and don’t forget the backtracking—bosses are tougher than ever, and the emphasis on meta tricks and knowledge is as imperative as ever in Nioh 3.</p>







<h2 id="h-nioh-3-tips-amp-tricks-you-need-to-stay-alive">Nioh 3 Tips &amp; Tricks You Need To Stay Alive</h2>



<h3 id="h-become-adept-with-both-playstyles">Become Adept With Both PlayStyles</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A master of all. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Nioh 3 switches up the formula by having both Samurai and Ninja be changeable-on-the-fly options. A swift click of the trigger, and you go from being a strong Samurai to a master of speed and stealth as a Ninja. Don’t make the mistake of sticking to one: Use both as each is VERY useful for certain bosses and combat situations.</p>



<p>A boss fight with another Samurai will favor the style of the same name, whereas being a Ninja and darting about an arena could be better suited to a fast-moving Yokai. Keep chopping and changing your gear, and ensure both styles are used in equal measure.</p>







<h3 id="h-burst-break-mastery">Burst Break Mastery</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Burst their bubble. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>This will be difficult if you struggle with timing, but hear this tip out: You can <strong>dominate bosses with Burst Breaks</strong>. Some bosses are more liberal with their Burst Break usage, and many of those attacks are incredibly telegraphed. Landing a Burst Break does incredible HP and Ki damage and momentarily staggers the opponent, giving you time to get a few quick licks in.</p>

</ul>



<p>If you’re really struggling to deal damage, there’s even a world where you mainly rely on Burst Breaks. Heed our advice: Don’t be afraid of Burst Breaks; the counter window is very generous.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-rely-on-consumable-items">Don’t Rely On Consumable Items</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Git gud. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>As a lover of Soulslike, I make it a mission not to use any consumable items in these games. Why? Because resources are finite. You could quite easily become accustomed to popping a few stat-boosting items and chucking a few status-inflicting Conumables at a boss as you repeat it over and over, but what happens when the well runs dry? (Interestingly, more on wells below).</p>



<p>It’s much better to focus on core combat gameplay mechanics because you can improve your own skill level, and you’ll never face a situation where you have to waste time grinding for items or coming unstuck because you relied too heavily on something other than the fundamentals of attacking, evading, and deflecting—we believe in you.</p>



<h3 id="h-equip-equipment-sets">Equip Equipment Sets</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A very nice bonus. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>Certain pieces of Armor will have specific green writing in the item description, which is the game’s way of telling you it’s part of a set. There are countless sets in Nioh 3, and because of the game’s tendency to give you loot, you’ll more than likely have multiple items in the same set.</p>



<p>If you keep equipping more and more gear with the same set name, <strong>you gain new and more powerful bonuses</strong>. This includes giving you more health, increasing Attack damage, and much more. Try to prioritize completing sets instead of slapping on slightly superior individual gear.</p>



<h3 id="h-explore-amp-unlock-more">Explore &amp; Unlock More</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Have a wander. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has already gone ahead and done you a big favor by offering the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-warring-states-map-all-collectibles-in-nioh-3-every-shrine-kodama-more/" id="174129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete Warring States map</a>, showing you where every collectible is in the first region. These aren’t just run-of-the-mill collectibles. Increasing your Exploration Level upgrades your Attack, finding Kodamas and Six Jizo statues gives you Merit points, which can earn you more Elixirs, and Hot Springs are a good source of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yokai-teardrops-nioh-3/" id="174464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yokai Teardrops</a>.</p>



<p>Focusing on the main story mission is the last thing you should focus on; moreover, you’ll be underleveled and easy chow for the next big bad boss.</p>



<h3 id="h-ki-is-key">Ki Is Key</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Ki to victory. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>This is primarily a tip for newbies, but Nioh’s Ki system must be respected. Other Souls titles employ a basic Stamina meter that recovers, whereas the Nioh series follows in Bloodborne’s footsteps by having an active-time mechanic that encourages player aggression.</p>



<p>In Bloodborne, if you lose health, attacking quickly stops you from losing health; in Nioh, timing your Ki Pulse regains consumed Stamina, with a perfect Ki Pulse giving you everything back. For your first few hours, focus on your timing so that it gets to the point where you don’t need to look at the Ki meter anymore. The more Ki you have, the more attacks you can do, and the slower it takes for an enemy to stagger you.</p>



<h3 id="h-soul-core-placement">Soul Core Placement</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Choose the right ones. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>Pay close attention to your Souls Cores and what they do. The basics are easy enough: Place a Soul Core in the Yang position to summon a Yokai to fight for you, put it in the Yin position to generate a Talisman or another ability. Don’t just focus on what a core does in terms of Special Effects (although they can be dreamy) or default Attack and Defence stats.</p>

</ul>



<p>A Summoning Seal with fewer conjure amounts is a surefire sign that it’s a powerful summon—see how Mezuki above is only allowed to be called upon twice in one life? These can provide huge buffs during the course of battle, so take Soul Core management seriously.</p>



<h3 id="h-use-the-best-gear-amp-methods">Use The Best Gear &amp; Methods</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Shameless, thank you. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>A bit of self-promotion here, but Insider Gaming has put together a few handy guides breaking down things you definitely need to utilize and know in Nioh 3:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-weapons-nioh-3/" id="174316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Weapons For Samurai &amp; Ninja</a></li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ninjutsu-nioh-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Ninjutsu You Need To Use</a></li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-more-elixirs-in-nioh-3-best-elixir-farming-methods-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How To Get More Elixirs &amp; Best Elixir Farming Methods</a></li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-open-locked-door-tenryu-river-nioh-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How To Open Locked Door In Tenryu River</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Having the best weapons and Ninjutsu is self-explanatory; knowing the ins and outs of Elixirs is paramount to consumable conservation, and you should definitely open that door!</p>



<h3 id="h-vantage-points-for-long-weapons">Vantage Points For Long Weapons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I spy. Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>Mobs are more inevitable than Thanos. You can run past them like Forrest Gump galloping around the world, but sometimes it’s better to eliminate them. You also need a steady stream of Amrita coming in. All creatures, no matter how great or small, are oblivious to your position at first, and it’s beneficial to try to find a high spot to scout the area and use your Bow or guns.</p>



<p>This can lessen the load on your blades and resources, making life much easier. As all good Zombie movies have taught us, aim for the head—you do more damage.</p>



<h3 id="h-well-well-well">Well, Well, Well</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Well…Image by Insider Gaming </figcaption></figure>



<p>A final little bonus tip for you. If you see a well, they always have a rock tied to them. Hit the rock, and more often than not, you’ll get a special surprise! Other times…brace yourself for a WELL-drawn out skirmish.</p>
