            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony has announced its brand new Inzone lineup of gaming products. Joining the new product lineup are Inzone H9 II headset, the E9 in-ear headphones, KBD-H75 keyboard, a gaming mouse, and two new mouse pads.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-wide-range-of-peripherals">A Wide Range Of Peripherals</h2>



<p>Starting with the headset, the <strong>H9 II</strong> is the follow up to the original H9. <strong>Retailing for $349.99</strong>, the new headset features up to 30 hours of battery life with quick charging that gives you up to three hours of use on a five minute charge. Other features include a detachable unidirectional 14000kHz super wide band microphone, Bluetooth connectivity, active noise cancelling, and 360 spatial sound.</p>



<p>Moving on to the<strong> $149.99 E9 in-hear headphones</strong>, there are a pair of wired earbuds that also come with a 3.5MM to USB adapter for more adaptability. Like the H9 II, the E9 also features 360 spatial sound while allowing audio setting customization through Sony’s proprietary <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/software/00279252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inzone Hub app</a>. The E9 has a pressure-free and ear hanger design that allows for more comfortable wear during long sessions.</p>



<p>On the keyboard front, <strong>the KBD-H75</strong> is a 75% form factor board that retails for <strong>$299.99.</strong> The KDB-H75 features magnetic hall effect switches that allow for customization of its actuation points ranging from 0.1-3.4mm. The gasket-mounted keys absorb the impact on press, making them feel quicker and smoother, and it features an 8000Hz polling rate.</p>



<p>The <strong>$149.99 Inzone Mouse-A</strong> gaming mouse can be both wired or wireless, depending on your preference. At 48 grams, it comes in as a lightweight option for those who like the control. Features of the Mouse-A include a 90-hour battery life, 8000Hz polling rate, 30,000 DPI, and the same quick charge feature as the headset. For the mouse, however, the quick charge is 10 hours of use after a five minute charge and only 1.5 hours for a full charge. </p>



<p>Lastly, there are two new mouse pads—Mat D and Mat F—each designed for different types of players. <strong>The $34.99 Mat D</strong> features a 4mm high-density rubber cushion that Sony says is geared more for battle royale and first-person shooters. <strong>The $59.99 Mat F</strong> is more geared for tactical control with 6mm cushion. Both have a cloth surface.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have full impressions of the newest lineup of Sony Inzone products in the coming days, letting you know if they’re worth the investment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rod Fergusson, who recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-gm-rod-fergusson-leaves-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced his departure</a> from Blizzard after five years, has revealed that he is heading to 2K to become the new head of the BioShock franchise.</p>



<p>In his post on <a href="https://x.com/RodFergusson/status/1957824815018213692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Fergusson said that he’ll be <strong>“heading up Cloud Chamber and overseeing development of the next BioShock game, along with franchise extensions like the in-development Netflix movie.”</strong></p>



<p>With Fergusson taking over, it was also revealed that the studio will be letting go an unknown number of employees as part of the changes.</p>



<p><strong>“While I’m excited to get started in the coming weeks, I recognize the studio restructuring is a difficult time for the team,”</strong> he said. <strong>“I’m deeply grateful for the work done so far, and I’m committed to building a BioShock game we’ll be proud of and that our players will love. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“For now, the firehose of onboarding awaits, and I look forward to sharing more when I can.”</strong></p>



<p>Fergusson joins 2K and BioShock after if it was recently reported that the next BioShock game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-bioshock-game-suffers-development-hell-failing-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in development hell</a> after failing an executive review. The original report said that 2K was “overhauling parts of the next&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>&nbsp;game and shaking up management after senior executives expressed they were unhappy with its development.” </p>



<p>That shake up now includes Fergusson as the head of the studio. </p>



<p>At the time of the news, a 2K Spokesperson told Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier that they were <strong>“working hard to set&nbsp;BioShock&nbsp;up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the new BioShock entry, it was also reported that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioshock-remake-shelved-this-year-claimed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake of the original game</a> was recently shelved as part of the changes happening within the company.</p>



<p>What do you think of Fergusson, who most recently was the general manager on Diablo 4, taking over as head of BioShock? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-be-a-pro-features-announced/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nhl-26-be-a-pro-features-announced.1273875/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the first time in six years, the Be A Pro mode in the EA Sports NHL series is getting a facelift with NHL 26. On Tuesday morning, EA Sports held a deep dive giving a look at all of the new features coming to the popular single player mode.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NHL 26 – Be A Pro Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YXarJ9r31Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-no-more-pond-hockey">No More Pond Hockey</h2>



<p>For years, EA Sports NHL’s Be A Pro started out with an interview about your player playing pond hockey ahead of the NHL draft. Well, you can say goodbye to that repetitive cutscene. Now, you’re players will start out in the World Juniors where not only are you trying to win gold for your country, but you’re also trying to improve your draft stock.</p>



<p>Aside from the starting point, Be A Pro in NHL 26 <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/nhl/nhl-26/news/nhl-26-be-a-pro-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has been completely rebuilt</a>, delivering a new immersive and dynamic version of the mode. At its core, NHL 26 introduces a chapter-based career structure that mirrors the real ups and downs of professional hockey. </p>



<p>After the aforementioned play in the World Juniors, every stage of your career unfolds in its own chapter with tailored challenges and branching outcomes. Unlike past years, your path to stardom is no longer guaranteed. Poor performance can see you demoted to the AHL, while standout play can have you playing top-line minutes.</p>



<p>Presentation has also received a complete overhaul, making career milestones feel more like true events. New cutscenes and cinematic sequences highlight key moments such as walking into your first NHL locker room, tunnel walkouts before big games, World Juniors and AHL trophy celebrations, hoisting the Stanley Cup, and even a retirement ceremony that gives your final game proper weight. A new media scrum system brings added authenticity, putting you in front of reporters where your answers impact reputation, relationships, and career trajectory. These moments help ground the grind of the season with emotional payoffs that feel earned.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Off the ice, NHL 26 introduces a redesigned hub that keeps your career connected to the bigger picture. The hub tracks your active challenges, surfaces league headlines, and displays a new “form score” that reflects recent performance. This score directly affects ice time, trust from coaches, and your opportunities within the organization, creating constant accountability for how you play.</p>



<p>A major addition this year is the energy and development system, which ties performance, training, recovery, and playing style to long-term growth. Managing your energy is key to unlocking and upgrading X-Factors, rewarding players who balance intensity on the ice with smart choices off it. Your personality also develops along one of two paths, confident or influential, and are based on how you interact with teammates, media, and coaches. Salary perks, endorsements, and lifestyle upgrades further expand the role-playing aspect, giving you more control over your legacy and how you are remembered when your career comes to a close.</p>



<p>Put together, these changes look to make Be A Pro in NHL 26 the deepest and most dynamic version of the mode to date. That said, players will have to wait to see how it all comes together when the game releases for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>NHL 26 releases on September 5 for those who purchase the Deluxe Edition of the game. Those who buy the Standard Edition will get the game on September 12.</p>
