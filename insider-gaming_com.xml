<p>ARC Raider developers have confirmed that player behaviour is analysed while matchmaking. </p>



<p><span>Embark Studios’ latest&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-invented-a-whole-new-genre-and-nobody-noticed/" target="_blank">extraction adventure</a>, ARC Raiders, has been on a great run lately.</span> Not only is it one of the most popular titles of 2025, but it also won best multiplayer game of the year at The Game Awards 2025. What’s more, the title’s new update, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-flickering-flames-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cold Snap</a>, is live now. Ahead of the update, the developers gave players a hint about ARC Raiders matchmaking. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-devs-confirm-player-behaviour-is-analysed-for-matchmaking">ARC Raiders Devs Confirm Player Behaviour is Analysed for Matchmaking</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-interview-embark-talks-behavior-based-matchmaking-map-updates-and-playing-nice-with-strangers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, ARC Raiders art director Robert Sammelin confirmed that player behaviour is factored in while matchmaking in ARC Raiders. Sammelin stated, “Without going into excruciating detail, it is quite complex. We do analyze behavior and match accordingly.” When asked if he could elaborate on this, the art director said “no” jokingly, keeping players in the dark about how it is factored in during matchmaking. </p>



<p>There was a prevailing theory in the ARC Raiders community that players with nicer behaviour would be matched with others with similar gameplay styles, while more aggressive players would be forced to play together. The developers have now confirmed that this could indeed be the case; however, we do not know what else is factored into matchmaking. </p>







<p>In other news, an ARC Raiders backpack <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-backpack-crashed-nvidia-site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-handedly crashed the NVIDIA website</a>. Additionally, the developers recently asked the community for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-map-design-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical feedback on the game’s map pool</a>, asking them to drive the game forward.

<p>Crystal Dynamics has revealed that Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will receive a difficulty adjustment for modern players, and players might remember the original version as extremely difficult. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Game Awards 2025 was a great day for the original Tomb Raider fans, as Legacy of Atlantis was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced for 2026</a>. It is a complete remake of the original game, built from the ground up. Now, the developer has revealed that the remake might not be as brutal as the original title. </p>







<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-to-receive-a-difficulty-adjustment">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis to Receive a Difficulty Adjustment</h2>



<p>During a presentation attended by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-leads-say-its-essential-to-adjust-the-ps1-originals-difficulty-for-modern-player-tastes-but-things-that-you-expect-in-a-tomb-raider-game-are-going-to-be-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Crystal Dynamics developer Will Kerslake was asked how they would be targeting the difficulty of Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, given all the insta-death situations and other problems players faced in the original title. Kerslake replied, stating that “part of reimagining a game right is adjusting that game evolving for modern player tastes.”</p>



<p>However, that doesn’t mean the core Tomb Raider experience will change, as “there are puzzles in combat and traversal and death-defying action.” Also, players will also “see big rolling balls, and you know, the things that you expect in a Tomb Raider game are going to be there in spades,” added Kerslake. </p>



<p>The Anniversary edition of Tomb Raider also had a workaround for the original’s difficulty, adding quick-time events to get through the insta-kill situations. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In its new financial report, UK-based Dambuster Studios has reported that it is aiming to release Dead Island 3 by Q1/Q2 2028 (April – October 2028).</p>







<p><span>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09140280/filing-history/MzQ5NDAyNTM3OGFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&amp;download=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial report</a>&nbsp;(thanks,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/bogorad222" target="_blank">Timur222</a>), it says that the primary focus for Dambuster Studios is now Dead Island 3, a</span>nd all developers, who currently consist of 194 employees, will be assigned to the project once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete.</p>



<p>“Parts of the game [Dead Island 3] are now in early production with feature, character, world, and story design moving at pace,” says the report.</p>



<p>The release date suggests that the game will release for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC, and the next-generation of consoles, which are currently forecasted to release by the end fof 2028.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-island-3-new-location">Dead Island 3 New Location</h2>



<p>This isn’t the first time that we’ve heard of Dead Island 3 from Dambuster Studios, though.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the studio celebrated 14 years since the original game debuted, with the studio revealing that the second game has accumulated an impressive 20 million players.</p>



<p>The post teased that the “journey” was far from over, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-3-teased-dambuster-new-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accompanied by a photo showing a character leaving LA</a>, suggesting that there will be a new location for the third game.</p>







<p>In July,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-dead-island-2-dev-address-delay-sucked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a former Dead Island 2 developer</a>&nbsp;addressed the calamities caused by the game’s delay, which saw its development cycle pushed out to around&nbsp;a decade, including studio swaps and abandoned deadlines.</p>
