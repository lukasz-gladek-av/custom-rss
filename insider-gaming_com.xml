<p>Warhorse Studios has published patch 1.2 in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, the stellar open-world RPG that was released last month. This update is gargantuan, coming in at a whopping 62 GB on PC – and comparable sizes on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox. It adds a few nice touches to the game but, more importantly, addresses <strong>more than 1,000 bug fixes</strong>.</p>



<p>Check out the key inclusions of patch 1.2 in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 below.</p>

<h2 id="h-kcd2-1-2-patch-notes">KCD2 1.2 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>I’m not going to list the <strong>full patch notes </strong>for the 1.2 patch for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, or we’d be here all day.</p>



<p>Instead, I’ll invite you to hop over to Warhorse Studios’ site to <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">check the full breakdown</a> of the 1,000+ bug fixes, improvements, and quality-of-life adjustments.</p>



<p>At the top of the table with patch 1.2 sits the addition of the barber mode, which players can take advantage of in Zhelejov and Kuttenberg. With this new feature, you can adjust Henry’s hair and beard, further customising him as you see fit. It’s purely a cosmetic upgrade, though – it doesn’t have any bearing on the game itself.</p>



<p>Here are some of the key bug fixes addressed in the 1.2 patch for Kingdom Come 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Players no longer die randomly after exiting a cart (very important stuff)</li>



<li>Multi-hit combos will now do more damage</li>



<li>Difficulty has been balanced across pickpocketing, lockpicking, stealth, bartering, and more</li>



<li>NPC daily schedules have been improved across the entire game (including tweaking the <strong>sweeping </strong>animation!)</li>



<li>‘Generally improved’ environment across both maps, including improving the look of Trosky Castle from further away</li>



<li>Improved road magnetism when riding a horse</li>



<li>Improved frame rate and performance in battles and built-up areas like Kuttenberg’s marketplaces</li>



<li>Shops no longer sell cobwebs (damn)</li>



<li>DLSS 4 Super Resolution can be enabled</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, even the full patch notes stress that hundreds of other fixes aren’t mentioned in the report. This is one of the single biggest updates I’ve ever seen for the sheer number of issues it addresses. I can’t possibly think what might remain in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 that would need patching in the next update!</p>
