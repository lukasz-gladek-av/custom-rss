<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 has concluded with a series between two titans: Team Vitality, the tournament favorite, and FaZe Clan, an unexpected entrant to the grand final. In the end, Vitality proved unstoppable, defeating FaZe Clan with a memorable 3-1 finish and securing back-to-back Major trophies.</p>



<p>The Major might be over, but Counter-Strike 2 isn’t. Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<p>The grand final began with FaZe Clan picking Nuke, where they managed to edge out Team Vitality with a strong scoreline, presenting fans with promise in the earliest map of the final. However, Vitality quickly regained control, crushing FaZe 13-3 in the follow-up. From there, the French-led roster never looked back.</p>



<p>It was a decisive victory for Team Vitality, which has gone down in the history books after putting up one of the best single seasons in the world of esports this year. The team claimed the half-a-million-dollar prize and lifted <strong>another trophy </strong>in 2025.</p>



<p>This makes Vitality the first team since 2019 to secure consecutive Major titles, which is a perfect way to end the season. For FaZe, the loss is a bittersweet one. It was a rocky year for the team, and many had their doubts going into the tournament, let alone the grand final.</p>



<p>Fans of the organization were begging for a redemption shot at the final Major of 2025, but it just wasn’t to be.</p>



<p>Now, we start looking to the 2026 esports calendar and whatever comes next.</p>

<p>After a brief hiatus from new packs, it’s time to go on a heater again with Pokémon TCG Pocket’s red-hot Crimson Blaze B1a set. Its release date will make a nice, early Christmas present to start the Holidays off right, so stay tuned for full launch details.</p>



<p>You can’t say you haven’t had ample time to prepare for a new set. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-b1-release-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon TCG Pocket B1 Mega Rising</a> was the second, big-time main set to celebrate the game’s anniversary, and as such, the game’s developers rightly felt time was needed to catch ’em all.</p>



<p>It’s time for Crimson Blaze B1a to be the new craze.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket B1a Crimson Blaze has a December 17 release date for all users.</strong></p>



<p>Well, sort of, if you’re on Pacific Time, you get the set an hour earlier than most—you lucky Pokémon trainers, you! This guide will cover start times shortly, but the general launch period is Wednesday, December 17.</p>



<p>If you haven’t already, complete your challenges, win your Solo Battles, hoard as many Hourglasses as you can, and prepare to rip packs and get fat stacks…of duplicates.</p>



<p>It’s not likely to be the biggest set in the world, but it has some cool cards.</p>

<p><strong>The B1a Crimson Blaze set is first available from 11 PM PT on December 16, with applicable release times happening across the world on December 17.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4 Multiplayer Is Reportedly ‘A Complete Copy of Modern Warfare 2’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-4-multiplayer-is-reportedly-a-complete-copy-of-modern-warfare-2/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The rumored Modern Warfare 4 release—set for 2026—allegedly copies almost all of its multiplayer components from 2022’s Modern Warfare 2 reboot, and excessive ‘visual recoil’ is reportedly back as well.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 reboot wasn’t the most memorable CoD, but it was a huge success for Activision. Players aimed reservations at the multiplayer and other features, and if reports are true, those reservations might be repeated in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-campaign-reportedly-set-in-north-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026’s Modern Warfare 4</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-modern-warfare-4-leaks-indicate-a-ton-of-visual-recoil">Modern Warfare 4 Leaks Indicate ‘A Ton Of Visual Recoil’</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Oh boy, here we go. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Reputable leaker TheGhostOfHope delivered some bombshell news on December 14 about the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD 2026</a> game—rumored to be Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4.</p>







<p>The first reveal was huge:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Modern Warfare 4 Multiplayer in its current state is currently a complete copy of Modern Warfare II except for no perk charging system and less ADS/slide penalties…”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To what extent ‘a complete copy’ entails, we’re not sure, but it means we could have Platforms and Receivers back, leaving the community to scramble across all classes to unlock specific weapons and attachments. It was a convoluted and complex system that didn’t fit the usual casual unlock mechanics the franchise has become known for.</p>



<p>This might not be the smartest decision, and when prompted by a user, “Sooo… no Ninja and no red dots? FUNNNNN,” Hope simply replied: “Nope lol it’s literally MWII 2.0.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leaks and reports didn’t stop there. Hope went on to explain about one of the prominent fixtures in MW4’s multiplayer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There is A TON of visual recoil on weapons in Modern Warfare 4 just like Modern Warfare II. Like I said in my last tweet it’s pretty much a complete copy outside of a few little things.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After a lackluster Black Ops 7 in terms of revenue and player base, Activision really needs a win with Call of Duty 2026. The reception to Hope’s reports is already a bit frosty, to say the least, and the game is currently slated to release in and around GTA 6. It’ll be interesting to see if Hope’s leaks are true, and if so, how the CoD community would receive this.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is A TON of visual recoil on weapons in Modern Warfare 4 just like Modern Warfare II. Like I said in my last tweet it's pretty much a complete copy outside of a few little things.</p>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1999997428465090593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Do these reports sound promising? Or is Call of Duty and Activision doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past?
