<p>Rise of the Ronin is now among the few games that have received support for the PS5 Pro, thanks to update 1.08. Check out the features of the new patch below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rise of the Ronin’s update <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1850504304446304502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1.08</a> brings two new settings for PS5 Pro users, taking advantage of the mid-gen console refresh’s “enhanced visual fidelity.” The two new settings are “Prioritize FPS” and “Prioritize Graphics,” featuring “sharper and clearer visuals as well as higher and more stable framerates during combat”. Ver 1.08 also introduces some minor bug fixes for the title.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rise of the Ronin is an open-world action RPG developed by Team Ninja for the PS5. In the game, players embody the role of a Ronin, who gets to shape their destiny in 19th-century Japan. Players experience the “Bakumatsu” period and the end of the Shogunate era.</p>



<p>During this journey, you interact with several historical figures, creating allies and enemies while mastering the game’s intuitive combat. Most importantly, your choices allow the story to unfold in different ways. Players can choose whether to assassinate or protect influential figures of this period and change the course of their journey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s a lot of great <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons to unlock in Black Ops 6</a>, but the Kompakt 92 is one of the last weapons you’ll unlock on your way to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-system-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige</a>. It’s a very close-range SMG with a lot of potential, but you’ll need to use the best attachments, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perks, and Equipment</a> to get the most out of it.</p>



<p>With that said, here’s the best Kompakt 92 loadout to use in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/">Black Ops 6</a>.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-kompakt-92-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best Kompakt 92 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Integrated Suppressor Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li>
</ul>



<p>For our best <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> Kompakt 92 SMG loadout, you’ll want the <strong>Integrated Suppressor Barrel</strong> as it keeps you off the enemy’s radar while also improving bullet velocity and damage range.</p>



<p>Next, the <strong>Vertical Foregrip</strong> tames the weapon’s strong vertical recoil, allowing you to stay on target while <strong>Extended Mag I </strong>gives you enough ammo to take on multiple enemies.</p>



<p>The <strong>Commando Grip</strong> provides a boost to handling, improving aim down sight and sprint to fire speeds. Lastly, the <strong>Recoil Springs </strong>Fire Mod provides more control for the gun’s rapid fire rate.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-kompakt-92">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for Kompakt 92</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Overkill</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Molotov</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Sleeper Agent</li>
</ul>



<p>As the Kompakt 92 SMG is a very close-range weapon, I found it most effective when paired with Perks that improve mobility and handling. <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> improves your sprint speeds while reloading and using Equipment, <strong>Assassin</strong> reveals enemies on a kill streak, and <strong>Double Time</strong> greatly increases the duration of Tactical Sprint so that you can get behind enemy lines fast. </p>



<p>Using these 3 Perks also unlocks the <strong>Enforcer Combat Specialty</strong>, which is great for an aggressive SMG loadout such as this one, as it replenishes your health upon every kill and gives you a speed buff.</p>



<p>When it comes to Equipment, the <strong>Molotov</strong> is a Lethal that burns enemies on impact and leaves a deadly pool of fire behind for a short period, catching unsuspecting enemies who walk into it. For the Tactical, a Flashbang is perfect for breaching rooms and areas of the map when running and gunning.</p>



<p>Lastly, the <strong>Sleeper Agent</strong> Field Upgrade disguises you as an enemy teammate which is perfect for sneaking behind enemies and getting as close as possible before unloading the rapid-fire Kompakt 92 SMG.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-kompakt-92">Best Secondary for Kompakt 92</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a> is an excellent Secondary to use with the Kompakt 92, as it allows you to take on enemies at those medium-to-long range distances where the Kompakt 92 struggles. </p>



<p>This, of course, is only possible with the Overkill Wildcard equipped, if you opt for a different Wildcard, the <strong>9mm PM </strong>Pistol<strong> </strong>has the best damage range of all the handguns in the game, so it’s a wise choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-kompakt-92-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock Kompakt 92 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You will need to reach <strong>Level 49</strong> to unlock the Kompakt 92 SMG in Black Ops 6. This may take some time, but if you continue playing objective-based game modes that get you a lot of XP, you’ll eventually reach the rank.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to level up fast, check out our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide on how to get XP and climb the ranks quickly</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-kompakt-92-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the Kompakt 92 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Another fast-firing SMG that can dominate up close is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ksv-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KSV</a> making it a great alternative to the Kompakt. You could also use the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-c9-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C9</a>, which is also a top close-range weapon. If you want something with a bit more range, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-gpr-91-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">GPR 9</a> is an Assault Rifle with SMG-like handling and mobility.</p>
