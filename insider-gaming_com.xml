<p>Sony San Diego has announced that it is bringing its MLB The Show franchise to mobile devices. MLB The Show Mobile is a new free-to-play game that is “built from the ground up to deliver realistic baseball gameplay on mobile devices.”</p>



<p>Sony San Diego is calling the game a “new standalone experience” featuring team building, an “expanding list of quick new modes, and even the ability to replay classic MLB moments. </p>







<p>Currently the <a href="https://theshowmobile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game is available</a> for iOS and Android in a limited regional release in the Philippines. The plan is to slowly release it to other regions as part of a soft launch, though no timetable was announced. As far as devices are concerned, MLB The Show Mobile is being optimized for phones like the iPhone 16, Samsung Galaxy S25, Sony Xperia V, and other comparable devices. </p>



<p>“Higher-end devices can experience enhanced graphics, increased frame rates, and higher resolutions,” they said.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[BACKBONE ONE Review—Small But Mighty for Mobile Gamers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/backbone-one-review-mobile-gaming/</link>
            <guid>1371655</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I’ve never been a huge mobile gamer, but I can fully appreciate that it makes up a <strong>massive </strong>portion of our industry. In recent years, mobile games have become increasingly intelligent, and AAA titles are finding their way onto mobile devices both natively and via cloud streaming services.</p>



<p>It stands to reason that, if you want to enjoy mobile gaming as much as possible, you’ll want a solid controller with which to do so. That’s where the BACKBONE ONE comes in, an innovative, handy, and powerful little device that holds your phone and provides a solid base on which to build a strong mobile gaming experience.</p>



<p>I’ve been trialling the BACKBONE ONE for a couple of weeks and have been nothing but impressed. Here’s my full BACKBONE ONE review.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-backbone-one-worth-99-99">Is The BACKBONE ONE Worth $99.99?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing this BACKBONE ONE review, the device was selling for $99.99. I’d picked up the ultra-limited Death Stranding 2 edition, which came in a fabulous themed box and boasted a unique shell that’s to die for, but the standard is much more accessible and easier to find online.</p>



<p>As I write this, the <a href="https://backbone.com/pages/death-stranding-2-le">Death Stranding 2 edition</a> is fully sold out, but BACKBONE has teased that another wave might arrive soon. If you’re a fan, you’ll want to secure one of these, as it’s a gorgeous item to have in your collection, even if you don’t actively play mobile games.</p>



<figure><figcaption>My BACKBONE ONE Death Stranding 2 Edition is a beautiful thing.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Now, to the BACKBONE ONE review.</p>



<p>The BACKBONE ONE is a relatively simple thing that works right out of the box with almost no setup required. You simply pull it apart, insert your mobile device, and snap it closed again. It has a USB-C connection (or a Lightning connection) built into the device, which means it works with almost all modern devices.</p>



<p>If you’re in the market and looking to make known your allegiances, you’ll be happy to know you can purchase the BACKBONE ONE in both an Xbox or PlayStation-based theme.</p>



<p>It basically takes your phone and turns it into a cheap, portable gaming device, which, when paired with something like Game Pass, becomes a formidable thing. It’s small but mighty, and while the inputs and the overall form factor are pretty tiny compared to something like an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, it’s perfect for gaming on the go.</p>



<p>In recent years, BACKBONE has evolved this device, and now, there’s a handy app, more responsive inputs, magnetic adapters that ensure a better fit for a wider range of devices, and more tactile buttons. There’s even a nice 3.5mm headset jack on the side if you want to game on a train or while sitting in an Uber.</p>



<p>It really is that simple.</p>



<p>I’d say it’s worth $99.99, without a doubt. If you want to game while travelling and don’t want to splash out almost $1,000 on a top-tier handled gaming device, this is where you’ll want to get involved. It weighs almost nothing, shrinks down into the tiniest space in your backpack (or even a pocket), and it looks nice.</p>



<p>It’s also durable, which I’ve tested by aggressively pulling it open and shut again and dropping it a few times. There’s very little in the way of working parts inside the BACKBONE ONE, so you don’t have to worry about it being devastated by a slip of the hand. Just try to make sure your phone isn’t in it when you do drop it, because that’s not guaranteed to be protected.</p>



<p>If there’s one thing I can complain about, it’s that my ‘armoured’ phone protector couldn’t fit properly in the BACKBONE ONE as the charging port was a bit obscured, but that’s a ‘me’ problem.</p>



<p>I’d recommend the BACKBONE ONE if you want to game on the go on the cheap; it’s that simple.</p>







<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what your favorite mobile game is and if you’d buy the BACKBONE ONE.</p>

<p>No Man’s Sky creator has recently responded to Once Human, allegedly using their assets in a premium loot box, stating, “jokes on them.” </p>



<p>Hello Games No Man’s Sky was released all the way back in 2016, but has still been going strong almost a decade later. The developers recently released a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-breach-update-patch-notes-improved-ship-building-space-wrecks-salvaging-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brand-new update</a> for the title, introducing improved shipbuilding, space wrecks, salvaging, and more. Once Human, on the other hand, is a more recent title, releasing in 2024. However, Once Human was recently accused of ripping off assets from No Man’s Sky, and the founder has responded. </p>

The user has revealed that Once Human’s cosmetic item, Sky King, looks very similar to No Man’s Sky’s Teleport Module. The item from Once Human can only be obtained as the highest-tier reward from a premium lootbox, whereas in No Man’s Sky, you can acquire the item just by progressing through the game. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The post caught the attention of Hello Games founder Sean Murray, who responded on <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). Murray stated, “jokes on them – we forgot to LOD those rivets,” with an image of the asset in question. For those wondering, LOD stands for Level of Detail, a process in game development that optimises performance by displaying simpler versions of 3D models when they are far from the camera. </p>

<p>In other news, Once Human received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-coming-to-once-human-in-crossover-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld crossover</a> back in October.

<p>Microsoft has announced that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has set the record as the best third-party title to release on Xbox Game Pass in 2025, adding a further accolade to Sandfall Interactive’s debut title.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is widely regarded to be one of the best games to release this year, with the expectation that it will sweep up numerous victories in The Game Awards next week, and the Game Pass record shows just how impressive the release of the title was.</p>







<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-game-pass-best-third-party-title-of-2025">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is Game Pass’ Best Third-Party Title of 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another accolade. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>, Microsoft’s announcement of Clair Obscur’s impressive accolade detailed how it was based on the data of the number of unique players who played the title in the first 30 days of launch.</p>



<p>Sandfall’s creative director, Guillaume Broche, said the success was “so far beyond what any of us could have imagined,” detailing how nerve-wracking it was to release a title, but the “support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream.”</p>



<p>Broche also thanked Xbox and Game Pass for their support, noting that the game’s addition to the service allows people to “try our game when they might not have before,” particularly as the turn-based RPG genre can be off-putting for newcomers.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur is up for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-vote-game-awards-2025-all-categories-nominees-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several major honors at The Game Awards</a>, having been nominated for Game of the Year, Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, Best Art Direction, Best Score/Music, Best Audio Design, Best Independent Game, Besty Debut Indie Game, and Best Role-Playing Game, while Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, and Ben Starr make up half of the contenders for Best Performance.</p>

<p>To The Moon’s inaugural event took place last month in the United Kingdom, and it was, by all accounts, a complete shambles. The images and clips shared on social media painted a picture of a sorry affair in every respect, and many creators made videos exposing the event as an utter failure.</p>



<p>Weeks after the event, To The Moon’s founder, Monty Stewart, has surfaced on LinkedIn with a lengthy statement about what comes next for the expo. He stressed that <strong>it will </strong>be back, and suggested that this year’s expo wasn’t all that bad.</p>







<h2 id="h-to-the-moon-will-return-in-2026">To The Moon Will Return in 2026</h2>



<p>Early in November, To The Moon was on a little marketing kick, and the materials provided suggested that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/to-the-moon-expo-recover-uk-games-expo/">planned to revive</a> the UK’s failing gaming expo scene. Fast forward to a weekday in the middle of November, and To The Moon had arrived, halted temporarily by bad weather, poor planning, and an almost empty conference hall in Birmingham, England.</p>



<p>On social media, creators wasted no time sharing images of the event, with some claiming they’d spent hundreds to reach the venue and were left feeling extremely sour and disappointed:</p>

These feature the VR Arena, B2B Trade stage, the Indie ‘City’ and the LAN Zone</p><p>Honestly my favourite part is flat hall lighting considering we were meant to be in a (checks notes) Spaceship… <a href="https://t.co/yINWrmiGpW">pic.twitter.com/yINWrmiGpW</a></p></div>— 💽 CaptainAshtro🔜DreamHack (@CaptainAshtro) <a href="https://twitter.com/CaptainAshtro/status/1989293562169843739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>There was almost nothing good to take away from To The Moon, but that’s not how the expo’s founder, Monty Stewart, put it on LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7401872276251631616/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a recent post</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>On a personal level I wanted to say thank you to every single person that has supported and continues to support the vision of To The Moon Expo and attended. Every speaker, exhibitor, attendee and the like.</p><p>Seeing the vast majority of posts on LinkedIn being positive, hearing that some of our indies acquired investment meetings and received invaluable feedback on their games is a check box for me; alongside gamers being able to interact with actual games and their favourite IP’s, not just merch stalls. And let us not forget, we were the largest gathering of unique studios and games under one roof nationally within the UK for 2025.</p><p>If we can help people realise their dreams, acquire the funding they need to shoot for the stars and follow their creative passion; that is a win.</p><p>Were there some learning curves? For sure. Definitely some curveballs with the weather and a couple other aspects, but we continued onwards and adapted with the hand we were dealt.</p><p>Can we make it better? Damn right. How are we going to do that? We are looking to 2026 and moving forward with experience that only progress can teach!</p><p>I cannot wait to share with you what is coming for next year. I am also incredibly grateful to not have to handle the mantle by myself moving forward into 2026.</p><p>Innovation has always belonged those willing to challenge the status quo, not those who cling to it. So to the certain few people who have spent more energy on blocking new ideas than building their own; don’t worry, we aren’t here to replace you. Time will handle that for us.</p><p>We will continue to stand at the Vanguard for our creative industry and our movement to ensure that exhibiting at events is not fiscally gatekept and that creative passion within the UK and the globe can thrive.</p></div>

<p>Not only does Stewart think the event wasn’t all that bad, but he also intends to come back in 2026 with a new expo, seemingly expecting it to be better received just because he promises it will be.</p>



<p>Some reports came in ahead of the event that revealed how ill-planned it was, even before it landed:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I will not be speaking at To The Moon Expo next week</p><p>I was asked to be part of an Esports advisory group for the event some months ago; however, after the announcement, we were never consulted</p><p>The panel that I was put on last minute, had little to no structure &amp; a loose topic</p></div>— Jeff Simpkins (@HereLiesJeff) <a href="https://twitter.com/HereLiesJeff/status/1986463348821467570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Everyday gamers went to the expo at the NEC in Birmingham expecting a spectacle of an event because of bold marketing claims, but were met with almost nothing to do. One user wrote on X (formerly Twitter), <em>‘Went to see the To the Moon expo today as it was my first ever time heading to see one, it’s just disappointing how little there was to do there, legitimately one area just has consoles connected to monitors with Minecraft installed.’</em></p>



<p>This is a little first-person perspective, but I was invited to attend To The Moon and got cold feet in the morning before making the 2.5-hour drive to Birmingham, instructing my colleague to ‘stay in bed’ because I had some ill juju about the expo. Was that a lucky escape?</p>



<p>Sadly, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-death-uk-gaming-expo/">EGX has died a death</a>, Insomnia appears to be coming back under some distrustful banner, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/uk-gaming-expo-london-wasd/">WASD has also faded</a> into an abyss; there’s effectively nothing left in the United Kingdom for gamers.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord if you attended To The Moon</a> and what you thought about the event.</p>
