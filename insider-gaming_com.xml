<p>It’s a we, Mario!</p>



<p>March 10 has become Mario Day (Mar 10) for many gamers. This year, a New York City GameStop is to celebrate the day by attempting to break a record for the largest gathering of people dressed as Mario. The current record for the largest gathering of people dressed as Mario is 230 participants. This was set on August 18, 2010, in Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia, China.</p>



<p>It will be an entire Mario-themed event. There will be prizes and many photo ops. The best Mario cosplayer will receive a free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. All who participate will also receive $5 in bonus store credit to use on any item in the store. You’re free to come dressed as Luigi, but you won’t get the store credit.</p>



<p>Qualifications for the costume are simple. All you need is a red shirt, blue overalls, a red hat, and a mustache.</p>







<h2 id="h-mario-is-still-celebrating-his-40th-anniversary">Mario Is Still Celebrating His 40th Anniversary</h2>



<p>Through April, with the release of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/" id="3170">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, Mario continues to celebrate his 40th anniversary. As part of the anniversary, Nintendo has released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mario-tennis-fever-2/" id="170927">Mario Tennis Fever</a>. There’s also an upcoming Yoshi game, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. However, most are wondering when the next 3D Mario experience will be released.</p>



<p>It has been almost 9 years since Nintendo released<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/super-mario-odyssey/" id="165895"> Super Mario Odyssey</a> on the original Nintendo Switch. This is easily the longest timeframe between brand-new 3D Mario releases. Nintendo released a port of Super Mario 3D World on the Nintendo Switch, which included a secondary mode in Bowser’s Fury. However, they have not released a full 3D Mario game since 2017.</p>







<p>With the latest Mario movie celebrating the legacy of one of the best-reviewed 3D Mario games of all time, many are dying to get back to the Mushroom Kingdom in a brand new experience. For now, maybe you can go to New York City and dress up like Mario and hope of winning a free Nintendo Switch 2 so that you’ll be ready whenever that new game does come.</p>



<p>RSVP for the gathering <a href="https://partiful.com/e/BhTQ2ZaAdQaLoiqX0Fb2">here.</a></p>

<p>Would you participate in an event like this? When do you think the next Mario game will be announced?</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/raven-software/" id="1897">Raven Software </a>has revealed <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2026/02/call-of-duty-bo7-warzone-season-02-patch-notes">patch notes</a> for the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" id="147395">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> Season 2 update. The patch includes an update to Killstreaks in multiple modes and other bug fixes.</p>



<p>Regarding Killstreaks, several updates have been made. They have adjusted the spawn rates of Killstreaks in loot. Resurgence modes have received a 50% reduction from Supply boxes and a 25% reduction from ground loot. This adjustment also counts for Ranked Play. Battle Royale modes have received a 10% reduction in Killstreaks overall.</p>



<p>They’ve also made specific adjustments to Precision Airstrikes, Napalm Strikes, Cluster Strikes, and Bunker Busters. The radius for Killstreak call-ins has gone down to 150 meters. It was originally 255 meters. They’ve also adjusted the limit from three to two. Additionally, they’ve made a change to where only one type of Killstreak is allowed in any given radius.</p>



<p>“Individually, you can deploy one Killstreak of a specific type every 20 seconds. Your squad is limited to one active Killstreak of that type as well. Once used, this allows opponents a window to retaliate. We will continue monitoring Killstreak usage and performance across all modes and make adjustments as needed,” the notes state.</p>







<h2 id="h-additional-bug-fixes-in-the-latest-call-of-duty-warzone-patch">Additional Bug Fixes in the Latest Call of Duty: Warzone Patch</h2>



<p>Additional bug fixes include a fix to an issue that prevented players from properly progressing the “Absolute Zero” mastery camo challenge for the NX Ravager. Also, an issue that allowed players to fall through maps in certain areas has been fixed. </p>

<p><strong>The Poodle Cabooble Timed Research during Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos is focused on Furfrou, offering the chance to obtain trims that are not usually available in your region.</strong></p>



<p>While some Furfrou designs are available worldwide, others are locked to a specific region, like the Kabuki Trim in Japan and the Debutante Trim in the Americas.</p>



<p>The tasks are relatively simple, requiring 1km of exploration at each level and changing a Furfrou’s trim, with the rewards being XP boosts. All the details are in the table below.</p>

<p><strong>The A Beautiful Day To Celebrate Timed Research Tasks during Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos are based around the three starter Pokémon</strong> <strong>from the region.</strong></p>



<p>At the beginning of the Timed Research, you are given the choice between Chespin, Fennekin, and Froakie. Over the course of the Timed Research, you can encounter the starter Pokémon that you selected a total of six times.</p>



<p>All of the tasks are the same, no matter which Pokémon you opt for, and they won’t take too much focus to complete, as long as you’re active daily.</p>



<p>The table below shows the tasks, each of which provides a reward of an encounter with the Kalos starter you opted for.</p>

<p>Pokémon Go fans have an action-packed weekend ahead with Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos, including an important decision on whether to opt for the X or Y path of Special Research.</p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-go/" id="1345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a> Tour continues the passage through the generations of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> by focusing on the Kalos region, the sixth generation, landing in a period where the region has received a wealth of attention after Lumiose City’s return in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a-2/" id="3627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re unsure of whether to choose the X or Y path in Pokémon Go, Insider Gaming can help you to decide.</p>







<h2 id="h-should-you-choose-x-or-y-in-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">Should You Choose X or Y in Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Choices to make. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The decision on whether to choose the X or Y path during Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos ultimately comes down to which Legendary Pokémon you want to encounter.</strong></p>



<p>Completing all of the Special Research Tasks from the event provides an encounter with one of the two major Legendary Pokémon of the Kalos region, Xerneas or Yveltal. Both are extremely powerful and handy additions to your squad.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-tour-kalos-an-x-ceptional-yarn-special-research-tasks-rewards/" id="181117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All Pokémon Go An X-Ceptional Yarn Special Research Tasks &amp; Rewards</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If you have already caught one of the Pokémon, but not the other, the best choice is to opt for the one that is missing from your Pokédex. If you already have both, it might be worth checking the stats to see which is weaker and trying to get a stronger version.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-x-amp-y-version-reward-differences">All X &amp; Y Version Reward Differences</h2>



<p><strong>Encounters with Xerneas and Yveltal are the headline rewards for completing the Special Research Tasks during Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos, but they’re not the only reward that varies based on your choice.</strong></p>



<p>The rewards are extremely similar, with the main differences being the Pokémon encounters you will earn, including two different forms of Unown.</p>

</ul>



<p>Opting for the Y path provides slightly more Stardust and XP, but the difference is minimal. During the Research Tasks, one specific Stardust and XP reward is based on the Pokédex numbers, with Yveltal’s, 717, being one higher than Xerneas at 716.</p>



<p>The table below shows the rewards that are exclusive to the choice you make during Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">X Version Exclusive Rewards</th><th data-align="center">Y Version Exclusive Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Swirlix Encounter</td><td data-align="center">Spritzee Encounter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Clauncher Encounter</td><td data-align="center">Skrelp Encounter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Unown X Encounter</td><td data-align="center">Unown Y Encounter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Xerneas Encounter</td><td data-align="center">Yveltal Encounter</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Xerneas Candy x12</td><td data-align="center">Yveltal Candy x12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Xerneas Candy XL x6</td><td data-align="center">Yveltal XL Candy x12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/treyarch-games/" id="52220">Treyarch </a>has revealed patch notes for the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" id="2795">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> Season 2 update. The patch includes an update to the XM325 Titan Wield, along with changes to gameplay, UI, and more.</p>



<p>The weapon’s updates include adjustments to reduce some of its power. It’s said that the TTK should still be extremely competitive, but now with a heavier falloff that can be felt when missing shots at range. They say they went this route rather than hitting the spread “in order to maintain the viability of the ‘turret’ build that comes from combining this with the Prestige Attachment.”</p>



<p>Treyarch announced plans for another damage adjustment targeting scorestreaks to better balance this weapon with other anti-streak builds. The weapon’s maximum damage range has decreased from 23 to 13. The medium damage range has decreased from 18 to 11. Lastly, the minimum damage range has decreased to 10. It’s down from 16.</p>







<h2 id="h-additional-updates-in-the-latest-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-patch">Additional Updates in the Latest Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Patch</h2>



<p>Multiplayer features an update to Safeguard mode that slightly reduces speed and increases the robot’s health. An Overload mode issue has been addressed. The issue previously allowed weapons other than a pistol to be carried while the device was held.</p>



<p>There are also Ranked Play updates. Gameplay-wise, Treyarch has reduced the Trophy System’s charge rate to match normal multiplayer gameplay. Also, they have adjusted the “Forfeit” vote text to specify that the input must be held.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-winds-waves-region-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new adventure in the world of Pokémon is on the horizon following the reveal of Pokémon Winds and Waves, and questions are already being asked about the inspiration for the title and the region it is based on.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Winds and Waves will release exclusively on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2027, marking the tenth generation of the Pokémon franchise.</p>



<p>If you’ve got questions on the region and inspiration for Pokémon Winds and Waves, Insider Gaming has shared everything known so far.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-region-is-pokemon-winds-and-waves-based-on">What Region Is Pokémon Winds And Waves Based On?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Volcanic. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The region that Pokémon</strong> <strong>Winds and Waves is based on has not been officially announced, but it’s widely understood to be based on Indonesia and the surrounding islands</strong> <strong>of Southeast Asia.</strong></p>



<p>Winds and Waves looks set to be a sprawling adventure across multiple islands, lush jungles, and the depths of the ocean, with the trailer offering a hint of what fans can expect from the game.</p>



<p>Additional details on the Winds and Waves official website confirm this, stating that the titles “feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves that ebb and flow.” The description also states the region has a “lush environment” that has seen Pokémon “develop their own unique ecosystems.”</p>

</ul>



<p>That description also connects to Indonesia and Southeast Asia, which have a variety of animals and creatures that cannot be found anywhere else in the world.</p>



<p>Although Pokémon may never officially confirm the region as the inspiration for Winds and Waves, the real world has always served as inspiration for Pokémon games, including Scarlet and Violet being based on Spain, Sword and Shield based on England, and Sun and Moon based on Hawaii.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-other-inspiration-is-in-pokemon-gen-10">What Other Inspiration Is In Pokémon Gen 10?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>often appears to take inspiration from real-world creatures, mythicalogically beast, and elements of nature when developing games, which again seems to be present in Winds and Waves.</strong></p>



<p>Although the reveals so far have been limited, the starter Pokémon all have strong resemblances to familiar creatures.</p>

</ul>



<p>Pombon, the Puppy Pokémon, has striking similarities to a Pomeranian, while Gecqua’s basis is clear with the category of the “Water Gecko Pokémon.” Finally, Browt is clearly based on a baby bird.</p>



<p>Given the names of the titles, the legendary Pokémon that headline Winds and Waves could well be tied to the sky and the sea. While there have already been Pokémon that fit those areas, Gen 10 could delve deeper into the world of Legendary Pokémon, tying the wind and the waves specifically to these new creatures.</p>
