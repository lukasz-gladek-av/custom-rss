<p>Fnatic, one of the oldest esports organizations in Europe, is reportedly evaluating a sale that would come with a whopping $100 million price tag. In a report shared late last week, it was suggested that multiple parties are interested in securing the brand, and Fnatic has brought in a consultancy firm to engage investors.</p>



<p>Potential buyers are said to include companies across a broad array of verticals, including traditional sports, media, and entertainment.</p>







<h2 id="h-fnatic-wants-a-full-acquisition">Fnatic Wants a Full Acquisition</h2>



<p>In early reports, it has been suggested that some serious investors are eyeing up Fnatic, one of the most iconic brands in the modern esports space. Fnatic boasts a legacy that few organizations can attest to, and despite having recent drops in revenue, the company is still bursting with potential.</p>



<p>Historically, the organization has been one of the first labels in esports to innovate and expand beyond mere competition. In 2016, the company launched Fnatic Gear, a high-end peripherals division, which went on to sell <strong>one million units </strong>before the brand was sold to Sony’s INZONE label.</p>



<p>It should be stressed that $100 million is one hell of a target. In recent years, esports organizations have been bought and sold for far less, despite being valued internally with much higher price points.</p>



<p>For instance, Luminosity was sold in 2025 for just over $3 million, and FaZe Clan was valued at just $18 million in 2023. The latter organization once peaked with a valuation of $725 million, but the tumultuousness of the company proved too volatile in too short a time.</p>



<p>Analysts have argued that if any organization can command that tag, it’s Fnatic.</p>

<p>Battlefield fans are up in arms again about a suspected AI design used in the new ‘Windchill’ cosmetics bundle. In recent hours, eagle-eyed gamers discovered telling signs tied to a sticker in this bundle, and all indications point to it being a faulty generative AI creation.</p>



<p>Fans on social media platforms were running rampant, trying to burn the game to the ground. For some, it’s a minor issue, but for others, it’s indicative of that much bigger problem creeping across the games industry.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-ai-sticker-scandal-runs-wild">Battlefield 6 AI Sticker Scandal Runs Wild</h2>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1prq9x9/remove_this_ai_shit_from_the_store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield subreddit</a>, a user shared an image of the new Windchill bundle, revealing a <strong>player card sticker </strong>that stinks of flawed generative AI design. The image showcases a soldier within a snowflake, wielding an M4A1, but there are clear indications that it’s <strong>most likely </strong>created by AI.</p>



<p>The M4A1 in question has two obvious barrels, one above the other. It also seems to have two handguards, which is hardly the most common feature in the world of firearms.</p>



<p>Here’s a zoomed-in shot of the player card sticker:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Users were quick to flock to social posts, stating that this isn’t the only example of something that <strong>looks like </strong>generative AI in Battlefield 6. In social circles, the comments were damning. One user wrote, ‘Just the fact they didn’t catch that before releasing shows how little they are trying.’</p>



<p>Another said, ‘They got your money, so they don’t care about which hill you choose to die on.’</p>



<p>One user condemned the wider use of AI, ‘AI art is generated based on stolen artwork and takes jobs away from real artists.’ Another echoed that sentiment: ‘I didn’t pay for AI garbage. EA pay your f***ing artists!’</p>



<p>In similar news, the world’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-game-playable-demo-codex-mortis/">first game created 100% with AI</a> recently launched a playable demo, and it went as well as you could expect.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#925)—Clues and Answers for Monday, December 22]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re kicking off the <strong>official </strong>festive week with the NYT Connections solutions and hints that you need to get the job done! Today’s puzzle is the first in a few that will lead you up to the big day and beyond, so be sure to scroll down as soon as needed to uncover today’s answers.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-22">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 22)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #925:</p>



<ul>
<li>RUSH</li>



<li>PIN</li>



<li>PLAYING</li>



<li>LATER</li>



<li>GREETING</li>



<li>CYA</li>



<li>RASH</li>



<li>COMING</li>



<li>WAVE</li>



<li>BUSINESS</li>



<li>FUTURE</li>



<li>BROW</li>



<li>WHIT</li>



<li>FOLLOWING</li>



<li>MEMBERSHIP</li>



<li>SURGE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>They’re all about a sudden <strong>increase in amount or intensity</strong></em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em><strong>All imply ‘not yet’ — something ahead in time</strong></em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Which of these words show up <strong>in your wallet, on your desk, or at a game table</strong>?</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are colors that feel like they’re <strong>missing something</strong></em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 22:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>
