<p>A new leak reveals that the LEGO Zelda 2026 set is LEGO The Legend of Zelda: The Final Battle – Ocarina of Time; check out the price, release date, and other details below. </p>



<p>For those unaware, LEGO had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> a new The Legend of Zelda set late last year, with a release date window set for 2026. It seems that the Nintendo partnership is growing faster than ever, with the Great Deku Tree set in 2024, LEGO Mario in 2025, and the recently revealed LEGO <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-reveals-first-five-pokemon-sets-releasing-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon sets</a> for 2026. </p>







<h2 id="h-lego-the-legend-of-zelda-the-final-battle-ocarina-of-time-set-reportedly-releasing-in-march-2026">LEGO The Legend of Zelda: The Final Battle – Ocarina of Time Set Reportedly Releasing in March 2026</h2>



<p>A new leak on the Brick Tap <a href="https://discord.gg/wgcCpdMk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> reveals that the next set will feature LEGO The Legend of Zelda: The Final Battle – Ocarina of Time. The reported pricing for this set is $129.99/€119.99/£99.99. The set will feature 1003 pieces, which include Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf minifigures. It will also include Navi the Fairy, brick-built Ganon, the Megaton Hammer, and Recovery Hearts. The new LEGO Zelda set will seemingly release on March 1, 2026. </p>

<p>Mario’s modern-day voice actor, Kevin Afghani, debunks a rumor about his involvement with Nintendo before taking on the role of voicing several iconic Nintendo characters. He’s also discussing what it means to him to carry on the legacy of Mario, Luigi, and others.</p>



<p>Kevin Afghani began voicing Mario and Luigi with the 2023 release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder on the Nintendo Switch. He also voices the nefarious Wario. He replaced the retired Charles Martinet, the legendary voice actor who had voiced the characters for decades. However, he recently stated that, despite an online narrative, he had never worked for Nintendo before 2023. Specifically, he denied ever narrating the Nintendo Direct presentations.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ll give you one. I was never in Nintendo Direct,” he told <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/14/nintendo-new-mario-kevin-afghani-video-games/88185428007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>. There’s this weird narrative online I was in Nintendo Directs, I narrated Nintendo Directs. I never worked for Nintendo before being Mario.”</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-kevin-afghani-has-nothing-but-respect-for-the-og-mario-charles-martinet">Kevin Afghani Has Nothing But Respect For The OG Mario, Charles Martinet</h2>



<p>Discussing his fandom that led him to this dream role, he says he’s living his dream, but he has nothing but respect for the man who came before him, and in his mind, Charles Martinet is Mario.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Look, Charles, as far as I’m concerned, IS Mario. He created something that is so unbelievably iconic. And he did it so masterfully. If I wasn’t nervous, then I’m the wrong guy,” he said. “I’m the second guy who’s doing Mario. Charles is THE guy. There is such an unbelievable respect for Charles. He is amazing.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Kevin Afghani will be back in the roles of Mario, Luigi, and Wario in the upcoming Mario Tennis Fever game, set to release in February 2026 on the Nintendo Switch 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft says its recent upload of the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag soundtrack to Ubisoft Music’s YouTube account was due to technical issues with some of its videos.</p>



<p>On January 14, 2026, the Ubisoft music account on YouTube uploaded 18 songs from the Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag soundtrack. Naturally, the move excited fans and sparked speculation that the game developer may be preparing to announce the much-anticipated remake of the 2013 game, dubbed Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag Resynced.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has now commented on the uploads, stating in <a href="https://t.co/WYPZTZZtZW">a community post on their music YouTube channel</a> that the songs were re-uploaded due to technical issues with some of their prior videos.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hi there music lovers! We encountered some technical issues with a few of our videos, which we had to reupload. Apologies for the trouble, and hope you enjoy the music.</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-where-things-stand-with-ubisoft-s-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake">Where Things Stand With Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake</h2>



<p>In January 2024, it was first reported that a remake of the game was in development. Insider Gaming later confirmed that the Remake, codenamed Obsidian, was on track to be released before April of this year. Sources familiar with the situation originally said that marketing for the release was scheduled to begin this month, with the release set for March. Learn more about where things stand with the forthcoming remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-leaks-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">at this link.</a></p>



<p>Ubisoft is also working on a Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake. Check out the latest news on that release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-rated-by-esrb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#950)—Clues and Answers for Friday, January 16]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-16-950/</link>
            <guid>1407706</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday – you made it! As another week ends, hopefully your NYT Connections streak <strong>doesn’t</strong>. If I can help you out today, I’ll consider my day a success, and to facilitate that, I’ll direct you to the clues and solutions below. To answer today’s NYT Connections challenge, simply scroll down and tick those boxes.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-16">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 16)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #950:</p>



<ul>
<li>PANAMA</li>



<li>ALABAMA</li>



<li>BATH</li>



<li>BAHAMA</li>



<li>SANTANA</li>



<li>BANANARAMA</li>



<li>SLAM</li>



<li>PAJAMAS</li>



<li>PIANO</li>



<li>PORKPIE</li>



<li>BRUSHNG</li>



<li>KANSAS</li>



<li>DERBY</li>



<li>STORY</li>



<li>CANYON</li>



<li>FEDORA</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think classic headwear you might see at a horse race, a jazz club, or on a 1920s gangster.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Picture the checklist a parent runs through before lights out.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all band names where <em>every</em> vowel sound is the same.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word can follow the same adjective to form a familiar phrase.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 16:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-16-950">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 16 (#950)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DERBY, FEDORA, PANAMA, PORKPIE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BATH, BRUSHING, PAJAMAS, STORY</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – ALABAMA, BANANARAMA, KANSAS, SANTANA</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BAHAMA, CANYON, PIANO, SLAM</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
