<p>Raven Software was forced to step in on April 7 with a new Warzone update in Verdansk after two weapon attachments became overpowered and the number of Buy Stations in trios was incorrect. </p>



<p>It’s not unusual for Warzone updates to accidentally introduce new issues, but Season 3 avoided glaring setbacks. Despite some complaints about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-hdr-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> being too powerful and not having enough armor plates on the map, players have enjoyed having iconic weapons like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-kilo-141-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty-in-2025/#:~:text=The%20Kilo%20141%20is%20a,to%20complete%20your%20Warzone%20loadout." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kilo 141</a> back in the game. </p>



<p>In addition, Season 3’s weapon balancing changes created a healthy variety of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/author/andrewhighton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meta weapon </a><span><a href="http://-/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">options</a></span> for short or long-range engagements. In saying that, two attachments disrupted that harmony.</p>

<h3 id="h-snakeshot-ammunition-and-thermal-6x-scope-removed">Snakeshot Ammunition and Thermal 6x Scope Removed </h3>



<p><strong>.500 Snakeshot Ammunition</strong> is an attachment for the <strong>Basilisk</strong> pistol that transforms the weapon into a shotgun in close-range engagements. Over the years, there have been several instances of the attachment becoming too powerful in Warzone, and it happened again in Season 3. </p>



<p>With the ammunition type equipped with the <strong>Akimbo</strong> attachment, the pistols consistently<strong> two-shot killed enemies</strong> up close, much faster than every other short-range meta weapon. </p>



<p>This update temporarily restricts the attachment. Meanwhile, the <strong>Thermal 6x Scope</strong> has also been temporarily removed because the scope didn’t have any glint. This was a massive issue because scope glint helps warn players that an enemy is looking at them. </p>



<h3 id="h-buy-station-change">Buy Station Change </h3>



<p>Raven Software <strong>reduced the amount of Buy Stations</strong> to Trios to better reflect the larger squad sizes. Usually, the map scales the number of available Buy Stations based on the squad size of a lobby because larger teams don’t need as many Buy Stations. </p>
