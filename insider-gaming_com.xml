<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" id="52204">Electronic Arts </a>has unfortunately announced layoffs for the makers of Skate.</p>



<p>On February 25, 2026, <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Electronic Arts issued a statement </a>announcing that it is reshaping the studio behind Skate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/full-circle/" id="96165">Full Circle</a>. In their statement, they announced that they are changing the team structure and “some roles will be impacted.” The company’s statement does not specify how widespread the restructuring will be or how many roles will be affected.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/skate/" id="352">Skate </a>launched in Early Access in September 2025.</p>



<p>The Full Circle statement, however, states that the decision is not a reflection on those affected and that they will support them through their transition.</p>



<p>“Our work on skate. continues. We look forward to working with you as we move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently for all of you. Our commitment to skate., and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, several studios have been making similar statements about layoffs and major restructurings lately. Riot Games recently severely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">downsized to restructure the team around 2XKO</a>. Highguard’s development team was also<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Why-Highguard-Failed-Highguard-Layoffs-Explained-guide.jpg" id="176090"> heavily restructured</a> less than a month after the game’s release.</p>



<p>Ubisoft continues to make major changes and is restructuring its teams moving forward. Several game projects were canceled, including the much-anticipated remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Learn more about those canceled projects <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" id="176792">here</a>.</p>







<p>Microsoft Gaming and Xbox are also in the midst of a massive restructuring, following Phil Spencer’s retirement and Sarah Bond’s resignation. However, while there have been major changes to the Xbox executive team, no major in-house studio shakeups are planned.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming is proud to announce its debut virtual showcase.</p>



<p>Airing on <strong>May 28th at 3pm ET/12pm PT/8pm UK across Insider Gaming’s YouTube and social media platforms</strong>, the Insider Gaming Showcase comes to you with the goal of helping games get funded or find publisher backing.</p>



<p>But why? Well, to put it simply, the gaming industry is going through unprecedented times, and one of the hardest challenges that developers currently face is funding, and it’s only getting more difficult. That’s why we want to use our outlet and its exposure to help games get seen – <strong>completely free of charge</strong> to developers.</p>



<p>The showcase will feature nonstop, back-to-back game trailers, with no fluff in between to distract viewers from the awesome games currently in development. We’ll also feature a “concept” section in the showcase, featuring amazing concept art and ideas of games that haven’t yet reached a stage of development where footage can be shown.</p>



<p>Following the showcase, we will have separate deep-dive video interviews with the developers, in addition to written coverage on our website and in the app, so viewers can learn more about the games and the developers behind them.</p>



<p>In addition, Insider Gaming will also act as a PR agency to a loose degree. We will be working with other outlets and content creators before, during, and after the showcase to facilitate potential interviews to help get the games seen by as many different audiences as possible, again, free of charge.</p>



<p>To take things one step further, Insider Gaming will also compile all the games from the showcase into a dossier containing the contact information for each featured game, which we will send to our extensive list of investors, VC’s, and publishers after the show. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has high ambitions for the showcase, aiming to add at least 1 million cumulative new wishlists for the games we feature.</p>



<p>Moving past May 28th, we also want the showcase to be a recurring event, with a second showcase tentatively planned for December, with two shows a year moving forward.</p>



<p>Of course, we’re not ignorant of the fact that putting on a showcase costs time and money, and that’s why, behind the scenes, we’ve already partnered with a few companies to sponsor the show and are actively looking for a few more to help support this great initiative in times when developers need the exposure.</p>



<p>You can contact Tom Henderson at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f3879c9eb39a9d809a979681de94929e9a9d94dd909c9e" id="mailto:tom@insider-gaming.com">tom(a)insider-gaming.com</a> if you would like to sponsor the show. Developers can now submit their games by <strong>emailing Insider Gaming’s Executive Editor Mike Straw at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d0bdb9b3b8b1b5bc90b9bea3b9b4b5a2fdb7b1bdb9beb7feb3bfbd">michael(a)insider-gaming.com</a></strong> or <a href="https://forms.gle/3AVqXsLDohEA173K6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filling out our submission form</a>: </p>



<p><strong>Submissions are open until March 20.</strong></p>



<p>Outlets and content creators can contact either email address above to get involved as partners or for potential co-streaming opportunities.@</p>
