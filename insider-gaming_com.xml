            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-have-early-access.1119621/</guid>

<p>The continuation of Assassin’s Creed takes us to Japan, and we’re curious to see if we can play hop on a quicker flight and secure Early Access for Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>‘ content will come to <em>light </em>soon enough. Ubisoft is looking to vacate the shadows after a turbulent 2024 where nothing went right. The company has seen better times with countless layoffs to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-xdefiant-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a> and other projects announcing their closure hitting hard.</p>



<p>But Ubisoft is looking to turn a corner with Assassin’s Creed Shadows. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pre-orders are red hot</a>, and interest in Shadows is almost scalding. Let’s see whether potential Early Access has had a say in the game’s pre-release success and hype.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-assassin-s-creed-shadows-early-access">Can You Play Assassin’s Creed Shadows Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Guess I’ll have to take measures into my own hands. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no Early Access for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and it is set to release simultaneously for everyone.</strong></p>



<p>Shadows doesn’t have online multiplayer, so there’s no component for players to get an edge on each other. However, many single-player games are opting to negate Early Access. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and Baldur’s Gate 3 are classic examples of games being made for players.</p>



<p>They opted against Early Access, and it seems Ubisoft has decided to follow suit.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-why-assassin-s-creed-shadows-doesn-t-have-early-access">Do we Know Why Assassin’s Creed Shadows Doesn’t Have Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>Curiously, Ubisoft hasn’t revealed why they’ve canceled Assassin’s Creed Shadows Early Access, merely stating that the Collector’s Edition no longer has the early bonus.</strong></p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://igamemag.com/assassins-creed-shadows-early-access-canceled-ubisoft-confirms-the-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iGame Magazine</a>, we can see the original Discord Q&amp;A addressing the cancelation of Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Early Access.</p>



<p>Under a question about the Collector’s Edition titled “Will I still get the 3 days of Early Access as advertised,” a Ubisoft developer says: “<strong>No, there is no Early Access for AC Shadows anymore.</strong>“</p>



<p>Is this out of the goodness and thoughtfulness of Ubisoft’s heart? Or is it a way to improve their standing and put gamers before business first? We may never get a proper answer to this question.</p>



<hr>



<p>It looks like we’re all diving into Assassin’s Creed Shadows blind. I’m interested to hear your thoughts: Should the concept of pre-order Early Access be scrapped for good? Or is it a worthwhile bonus for the most committed of fans? </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hextech-chests-will-return-to-league-of-legends-after-mass-player-backlash/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hextech Chests are coming back to League of Legends, after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-devs-defend-unpopular-hextech-chest-changes-promise-better-battle-passes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their removal at the start of 2025 sparked massive outrage within the player base</a>. In Riot’s most recent Dev Update, the League team acknowledged that many of their previous changes didn’t go over well with the community.</p>



<h2 id="h-hextech-chests-are-coming-back">Hextech Chests Are Coming Back</h2>



<p>Beginning in Act 2, with the release of patch 25.05 at the start of March, Hextech Chests will officially return. Going forward, there will be 10 Hextech Chests available for players to earn each act, which translates to 60 per year across six acts. </p>



<ul>
<li>Eight will be available in the free Pass of each act.</li>



<li>Two more can be earned through the Honor system.</li>
</ul>



<p>Previously, before they were removed, Hextech Chests were earned through the Champion Mastery system. The returning chests will be exactly the same as the ones previously earned through Champion Mastery, but they should be more “accessible” through the pass.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>A number of other changes are being rolled back or addressed in the upcoming past. Blue Essence cost for all champions will be reduced by 50 percent, and more Mythic Essence is getting added to the pass rewards system. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h56OC1gqAM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial announcement</a> that Hextech Chests were being removed drew a ton of backlash, with several players threatening to boycott the game altogether. Executive Producer Paul “Pabro” Bellezza and League head Andrei “Meddler” van Roon addressed the team’s goals for Riot’s flagship title:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We want to acknowledge that we know getting League to the right place isn’t about just one set of changes. It’s about continually refining and improving the game. We think today’s updates are an important step, and we’ll keep tracking how these changes feel, talking with all of you about how things are landing, and making adjustments. We’ve always built League along with all you, the community. Thank you for sticking with us and hearing us out, and we look forward to continuing to work with you to make sure League is the best game it can be. Thanks so much, and we’ll see you on the Rift.”</p>
</blockquote>
