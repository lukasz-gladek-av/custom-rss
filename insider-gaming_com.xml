<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 starts on November 14, and with it comes plenty of additions for players. From weapons to modes to general content, there’s no shortage of new things coming to the game. One area that many fans were excited to learn more about after their tease were the new multiplayer maps for Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>As part of its blog detailing everything for Season 1, Activision gave full details on the new maps coming to the game. In total, there will be four new maps, one remastered map, and one variation coming during Black Ops 6 Season 1. </p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-weapons-black-ops-6-coming/">Every New Weapon in Black Ops 6 Season One (and How to Get Them)</a></h6>



<p>The four new maps are Hideout, Heirloom, Extraction, Racket. Hacienda&nbsp;returns from Black Ops 4, and Nuketown gets a Holiday season variant. Three of the maps will be available at launch while the other three come mid-season.</p>



<p>You can get full details on the new maps below <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Activision</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-maps">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 Maps</h2>



<h3 id="h-hideout-launch-6v6-medium-sized">Hideout (Launch) – 6v6, Medium-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Sharpen your combat skills in this mid-sized Multiplayer map featuring an extensive training site including target practice, an obstacle course, and a lifelike recreation of a vault and security room to help plan for the next mission to hit the Luttazzi crime family.</em></p>



<p><em>The vault and blueprints buildings offer intense, multi-level indoor combat while the armory and open bus set the stage to ambush passing enemies.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h3 id="h-heirloom-launch-2v2-6v6-medium-sized">Heirloom (Launch) – 2v2, 6v6, Medium-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Crash a private showing of Luttazzi family art to create a diversion for the other Rogue Black Ops team as they execute the real job. Navigate in and around a huge sculptural centerpiece in the main exhibit or branch out into the lobby or a side exhibit for a closer fight.</em></p>







<figure></figure>



<p><em>All hell has broken loose in the aftermath of a Crimson One ambush when the attack on the Luttazzis goes sideways. The burning rubble of a downed helicopter and a dead pilot signal an attack on the Avalon Heliport, a typically peaceful tourist destination where clients can book sky high views of Avalon’s breathtaking landscape.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-racket-mid-season-2v2-6v6-small-sized">Racket (Mid-Season) – 2v2, 6v6, Small-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Time to crack open the heart of the Luttazzi money laundering operation and hit them where it really hurts. Breach the premises in this small-sized underground bank vault, a line of broken tiles marking the path of the center bulldozer placed before the vault of golden bars. Defaced pieces of art and the crossed-out emblem of the Luttazzi family indicate not just greed but malicious intent.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-hacienda-mid-season-6v6-medium-sized">Hacienda&nbsp;(Mid-Season) – 6v6, Medium-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Last seen in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 4</em>, the iconic competitive map returns, sending Operators back to the infamous vineyard estate. Battle within the open-air, two-story mansion with surrounding views of the pristine courtyard below. From the grand foyer past the lion statue, head toward the showroom garage or move out to the garden to keep the fight outside. On the other end of the estate, marvel at the built-in aquarium above the vault.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-nuketown-holiday-mid-season-6v6-small-sized">Nuketown Holiday (Mid-Season) – 6v6, Small-sized</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>A Holiday-themed version of Nuketown with snow, decorations, and more.</em></p>

<p>In a blog post highlighting everything coming to Warzone and Black Ops 6 in season one, it was revealed that the battle royale platform will have <strong>177 weapons </strong>for players to choose from. The funny thing is that they’re almost entirely useless as a collective, and players will split their time between just a handful of them.</p>



<p>That collection includes a whopping 33 assault rifles and 30 SMGs.</p>



<p>When is enough enough?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-too-many-weps">Too Many Weps</h2>



<p>Warzone needs something of a reset. Over the years, games have fused with the Warzone ecosystem and had their weapons pulled into the fray, but as time has gone on, it has become increasingly ridiculous. Now, with the delivery of season one, Warzone will have 177 weapons to choose from.</p>



<p>That breakdown looks something like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Assault Rifles – 33</li>



<li>Battle Rifles – 10</li>



<li>SMGs – 30</li>



<li>Shotguns – 13</li>



<li>LMGs – 16</li>



<li>Marksman Rifles – 17</li>



<li>Sniper Rifles – 16</li>



<li>Pistols – 17</li>



<li>Launchers – 9</li>



<li>Melee – 15</li>
</ul>



<p>The split includes 60 weapons from Modern Warfare III, 77 from MW II, and 40 from Black Ops 6. At some point, something has to give, because surely keeping up the balancing and maintenance on all 177 weapons is getting a bit tiresome for Activision’s teams.</p>



<p>On November 14, Warzone will also get a new Resurgence map named Area 99, a small-form map inspired by Nuketown. It’s set in the Nevada desert and replicates a top-secret weapons testing facility that was built in the 1950s. It’s almost post-apocalyptic in how it looks, and it should play pretty nicely as well.</p>



<p>Also in the season one update, Urzkistan and Rebirth Island will be returning to the Warzone ecosystem.</p>



<p>Next year, we should have our first return to Verdansk since 2021, which will be a monumental moment for Warzone fans worldwide.</p>



<p>What weapons do you use in Warzone? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>It has been five months since Gears of War: E-Day was revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase, and not much else has been said about the project. Today, The Coalition revealed that both John DiMaggio (Marcus Fenix) and Carlos Ferro (Dom Santiago) will be returning to reprise their characters in E-Day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-glory-days">The Glory Days</h2>



<p>Gears of War surfaced in 2006, and since it dropped, it has spawned several follow-up titles, widely becoming known as one of the best Xbox-exclusive franchises ever created. It has been five years since the last major release in the series, and it could still be a while yet until the next one drops, given that Gears of War: E-Day doesn’t have a release window.</p>



<p>In June, the next game in the Gears of War series was revealed:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>In a post on social media, the team at The Coalition revealed that both John DiMaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their iconic roles in E-Day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>On today’s 18th anniversary of Gears of War, we’re proud to share that John DiMaggio and Carlos Ferro are reprising their roles as the iconic voices of Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago in Gears of War: E-Day.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It wouldn’t have been right to have anyone else voice them – especially Marcus Fenix. That gravelly, foreboding tone has been instantly recognisable for almost twenty years.</p>



<p>E-Day will be a prequel of sorts, taking players back to the beginning of the storyline that saw the Locust rise up and lay siege to the world of Sera. The first Gears of War game was the closest we got to that part of the timeline, but now we’re going even further back.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Gears of War E-Day? Let us know your expectations in the comments.</p>
