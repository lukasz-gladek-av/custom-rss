<p>The first five LEGO Pokémon sets have been revealed, and they feature iconic Pokémon like Eevee, Pikachu, Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur. </p>



<p>The LEGO x Pokémon partnership was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in 2025</a>, and since then, fans have been eagerly awaiting what kinds of sets this collaboration will entail. The five new sets are intricate pieces where you can not only recreate some of the most popular Pokémon in the series, but also badges and Pokémon centers. </p>







<h2 id="h-lego-pokemon-sets-prices-release-and-other-details">LEGO Pokémon Sets: Prices, Release, and Other Details </h2>



<p>A post by <a href="https://www.thebrickfan.com/lego-pokemon-2026-sets-officially-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Brick Fan</a> reveals the first-ever collection of LEGO Pokémon sets, and they are set to release on February 27, 2026. The first three sets feature beloved Pokémon from the games, Pikachu, Eevee, Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise. In contrast, the other two include a Kanto region Badge set and a Mini Pokémon Center. Learn more details about each LEGO Pokémon Set below, including price, pieces included and more. </p>



<h3 id="h-pikachu-with-poke-ball">Pikachu with Poké Ball </h3>



<p>The first one features the most iconic Pokémon of all, Pikachu, leaping out of a Poké Ball. It is a 2,050-piece set that features a black lighting-rod-shaped base and blue lighting coming out of the Poké Ball. The price for LEGO Pokémon Pikachu with Poké Ball set is $199.99. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-eevee">Eevee</h3>



<p>Next up is Eevee, another fan favourite, which is the smallest out of the 3 Pokémon-based sets. Coming at 587 pieces, the Eevee set also features movable tail, head, and limbs, allowing builders to change the pose as they like. The LEGO Pokémon Eevee set has been priced at $59.99. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise">Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise</h3>



<p>The Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise LEGO set is the biggest of them all, featuring the final evolutions of all the Kanto region starter Pokémon. Coming at 6,838 pieces, it features themed pedestals for each of the Pokémon, with flora under Venusaur, a volcano under Charizard, and a waterfall under Blastoise. It seems these three LEGO Pokémon can be placed on their own as well. The LEGO Pokémon Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise is the most expensive of the lot, priced at $649.99. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-kanto-region-badge-collection">Kanto Region Badge Collection</h3>



<p>Next, we have the Kanto Region Badge Collection, which consists of Gym Badges that players can collect in this region. It is a 312-piece set; however, it cannot be purchased conventionally. The only way to get your hands on the LEGO Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection set is by receiving it as a gift with purchase when buying the LEGO Pokémon Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set. The offer is only available between February 27 and March 8, 2026. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-mini-pokemon-center">Mini Pokémon Center</h3>



<p>Last but not least is the Mini Pokémon Center, the best place to give all your Pokémon a good rest after a strenuous battle. It is a mini-replica of the Pokémon Center that also features a place to rest small Poké Balls. Similar to the Kanto Region Badge Collection, the LEGO Pokémon Mini Pokémon Center can be purchased conventionally; it is reserved for LEGO Insiders members and can be bought for 2,500 Insider Points while stocks last. </p>

<p>Hytale’s pre-purchases have helped Hypixel Studios secure development costs for the next 2 years. </p>



<p>Hypixel Studios’ highly anticipated title, Hytale, is all set to release in early access tomorrow, January 13, 2026, and it seems that it could be a massive launch as the founder of the studios is expecting over one million players. The founder may not be wrong, as the pre-purchases alone have helped them secure capital to keep supporting the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-hypixel-founder-reaffirms-his-commitment-to-support-hytale-for-10-years">Hypixel Founder Reaffirms His Commitment to Support Hytale for 10 Years</h2>



<p>Through a new post on <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Hypixel’s founder revealed that they have “officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases.” That, along with his personal commitment to support the game for the next 10 years, will make the fans happy that the game’s future is in good hands. In the same thread, the founder also revealed that the development team now consists of over 50 developers. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Hytale has had a turbulent history to reach where it is now. Riot Games had closed down the game for good; however, Hypixel Studios decided to reacquire the rights of the title and breathe new life into it. The popularity of the title is now higher than ever, and the early access launch will decide what lies in the future for this sandbox game blended with RPG action and adventure. </p>







<p>In other news, Hytale is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-skipping-steam-initially-to-avoid-negative-reviews-console-launch-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skipping the Steam launch initially</a> to avoid negative reviews during early access, and a console launch is also planned. Additionally, developers have been given the green light to include a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-receives-blessing-to-include-technoblade-tribute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Technoblade tribute</a>.

<p>A new official Palworld card game has been announced, scheduled to release on July 30, 2026. </p>



<p>The game that was dubbed Pokémon with Guns, then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-devs-were-shocked-by-nintendos-patent-infringement-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued by Pokémon and Nintendo</a>, still seems to be following the same path, with a new Palworld TCG announced. It is being developed by Bushiroad, known for card games such as Cardfight!! Vanguard, Weiß Schwarz, and many more. </p>



<h2 id="h-palworld-tcg-arrives-july-2026">Palworld TCG Arrives July 2026</h2>



<p>A new <a href="https://en.palworld-official-cardgame.com/news/post-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> reveals that Bushiroad has announced a brand-new trading card game (TCG) based on Pocketpair’s highly popular title, Palworld. The card game will be released on July 20, 2026, allowing players to take part in 2-player competitive battles, using different strategies and tactics to deploy their favourite Pals. Players will be able to gather resources and build bases as they leverage their Pals’ unique traits to secure victory. </p>



<p>Palworld has faced Pokémon rip-off allegations since its announcement, with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company suing the developers for patent infringement. Announcing a new TCG based around Palworld, knowing full well that Pokémon is a dominating name in that space, is not going to help it beat those allegations. However, TCG is not a realm meant solely for creature-based games; in recent years, we have also seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-tcg-announced-by-cdpr-and-wierdco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games like Cyberpunk 2077</a> enter this realm.</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo’s patent in the Palworld dispute was being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-patent-in-palworld-dispute-is-being-reexamined-by-uspto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reexamined</a> by the USPTO. Additionally, the developers have addressed the possibility of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-dev-addresses-story-based-future-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing a story-based game</a> in the future. What are your thoughts on Palworld TCG? Do you think the Pokémon rip-off allegations will grow even more?
