<p>The Gamescom team has revealed a monumental partnership between Gamescom Asia and the Thailand Game Show, the fruits of which will be witnessed later this year. Gamescom is the leading name in gaming events and over the last four years, the Asian representation of that label has gone from strength to strength.</p>



<p>Now, Gamescom Asia will be relocated from Singapore to Bangkok, linking up with the Thailand Game Show to welcome more visitors than ever before.</p>

<h2 id="h-historic-collaboration">‘Historic Collaboration’</h2>



<p>In a press release published by the Gamescom PR team, the new partnership was celebrated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This partnership is a game-changer for the region’s games industry. gamescom asia’s success has been built on a solid foundation in Singapore, where it has flourished since its inception in 2021, positioning Southeast Asia as a hub for gaming innovation. </p>



<p>By joining forces with Thailand Game Show, we are unlocking unprecedented opportunities to connect global video game players with one of the world’s most vibrant and passionate gaming communities. With its rich culture and expanding gaming ecosystem, Bangkok is the ideal stage for this exciting next chapter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The President of Thailand’s Digital Economy Promotion Agency echoed that sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The collaboration between gamescom asia and Thailand Game Show marks a significant milestone for Thailand’s growing role in the global gaming industry. This partnership strengthens our commitment to advancing digital innovation and creativity. </p>



<p>DEPA and the local gaming industry are excited to be part of this unified event, creating new opportunities for global collaboration, investment, and talent development, and reinforcing Thailand’s position as a leading destination in the digital entertainment sector.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The 2024 edition of Gamescom Asia attracted more than 40,000 attendees from 78 countries, the press release explained. It’s not as gargantuan as the core version of Gamescom, which takes place annually in Cologne, Germany, but it’s growing – and that’s all that matters.</p>



<p>This kind of ‘combination activity’ isn’t a new concept. Last year in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-mcm-comic-con-same-event/">MCM and EGX</a>, two of the biggest pop culture and gaming events in the nation, joined forces to produce one mega event.</p>
