<p>If you’re a fan of first-person shooters and FPS games in general, you’re in for a treat in 2026. From epic multiplayer games to core single-player campaigns, there’s something for everyone.</p>



<p>Some genres and trends have come and gone over the years. First-person shooters will be here until the end of time, thanks to the fine, fun foundations laid down by the likes of Wolfenstein, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-bethesda-must-go-back-to-the-drawing-board-after-doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a>, Call of Duty, Duke Nukem, Battlefield, and many other Hall of Fame-worthy franchises.</p>



<p>2026 already looks like a rootin’, tootin’, shootin’ good time.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-first-person-shooters-launching-in-2026">Biggest First-Person Shooters Launching In 2026</h2>



<p>One important thing to note about this list of big-time shooters coming in 2206 is that <strong>everything is subject to change</strong>. The video game industry can be great at times, but delays and unexpected events can alter plans in a heartbeat. Some games are one GTA 6 delay or date change away from a drastic U-turn. So bear this in mind with the attached release dates.</p>



<h3 id="h-highguard">Highguard</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Wildlight Entertainment, Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Everyone needs to be on guard for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a>. It quickly became one of gaming’s biggest enigmas after its The Game Awards 2025 reveal. The game effectively closed the show, and the reception wasn’t good. Official Highguard social media pages also weren’t active in the weeks following. There’s still a feeling that it could do <em>something</em>. </p>



<p>It’s made by former Respawn Entertainment devs, which means it should be as mechanically efficient and effervescent as it can be. Whether the interest in another free-to-play shooter is there remains to be seen, but it might have been written off prematurely.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: January 26</strong></p>







<h3 id="h-high-on-life-2">High On Life 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>It turns out critics weren’t as high on High On Life as Squanch Games may have expected. However, this didn’t stop everyone from gulping down a helping of Fleeb juice, throwing back some Schleems, and seeing what the Rick and Morty-inspired shooter on Xbox Game Pass. The interest was there, and it was enough to push through a sequel. If you enjoyed the first game, High On Life 2 should be worth checking out, and if you decided to give the first game a pass, you should maybe consider shouting “Show me what you got” at the follow-up.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: February 13</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-toxic-commando">Toxic Commando</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Saber Interactive is on a bit of a heater at the moment. Not content with the nightmare-inducing Hellraiser debut or the studio’s brilliant work on Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 (and the upcoming sequel), the team has concocted Toxic Commando. It can be enjoyed in either single-player or multiplayer, but there’s a real emphasis on fun and freakish terror when played with more people. You need to battle through eight missions of hideous creatures with your backbreaking arsenal of weapons and implements, and it looks like an old-school FPS delight!</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 12</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-mouse-p-i-for-hire">Mouse: P.I. For Hire</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Fumi Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Insider Gaming team is very excited about Mouse: P.I. For Hire. The rubberhose animation immediately makes it an endearing and unique-looking game, bringing back fond (and frustrating) memories of StudioMDHR’s Cuphead. Instead of cutesy-looking bosses, Mouse: P.I For Hire is a clever FPS making excellent use of its theme and style. It’s an FPS game at its cartoonish core, but you only have to watch a trailer to realise there’s an unmistakable air of bold brutality about it. Mouse: P.I. For Hire could be one of 2026’s sleeper hits.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 19</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-marathon">Marathon</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Bungie</figcaption></figure>



<p>After months of testing and trying to work out the kinks to ensure Marathon is not DOA on release, like many are already condemning the extraction shooter to, Bungie is gearing up for the game’s March 2026 release. The game has literally been on a marathon in the last 12 months: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/artist-accuses-bungie-of-plagiarizing-work-for-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plagiarism</a> claims, low internal <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/morale-at-bungie-is-reportedly-in-free-fall-over-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">morale</a>, and the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Art Director leaving Bungie prior to the game’s release</a>. The shooter has endured it all, and even now, the game’s future feels like it could go either way. It could still end up as one of 2026’s biggest shooters, and try not to become another Concord.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Halo Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s hard to see Halo: Campaign Evolved being anything but a win. There’s a quiet acceptance that its PS5 release signals the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-2025-is-the-year-the-console-wars-ended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end of the console wars</a> and is the beginning of the series’ PlayStation arc. Still, the OG Halo campaign stands head and shoulders above most contemporaries and modern-day shooters that can only offer pale imitations of a legendary story. No multiplayer is a disappointment, but if you want to experience some of the purest and smoothest shooting mechanics in any video game ever, Halo: Campaign Evolved has the goods.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-hell-let-loose-vietnam">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Expression Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Vietnam conflict is still remembered as one of the most brutal wars, one that lasted for two decades. Hell Let Loose is the pinnacle of realism in military shooters, and the new Vietnam setting is a purist’s paradise for those wanting to indulge in a dark period of human history. Insider Gaming experienced a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, with Tom Henderson saying: “Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is going to be an unforgettable entry into the Hell Let Loose franchise, giving players a fresh and immersive gaming experience that is often overlooked in the first-person shooter scene.”</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-call-of-duty-2026-modern-warfare-4">Call of Duty 2026 (Modern Warfare 4)</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Call of Duty will always happen, and whatever does happen with each release, <em>another </em>one will be waiting just around the corner. It’s the best-selling FPS franchise by all metrics (including Guinness World Records), and Black Ops 7 will be consigned to history come the end of 2026. Why? It will be time for Call of Duty 2026—rumored to be Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-campaign-reportedly-set-in-north-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly set in North &amp; South Korea</a>, and a BIG effort and push will be needed after the coldly-received Black Ops 7. Even if there’s not, everyone will still buy it anyway.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: Late 2026 (Oct/Nov)</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[After Shutting Down Crucial, Micron Says It’s Trying To “Help Consumers”]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shutting-down-crucial-micron-trying-help-consumers/</link>
            <guid>1403671</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Back in December, Micron announced that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/micron-shutting-down-its-consumer-crucial-ram-and-ssd-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down its consumer memory</a> and storage brand Crucial. At the time, the company said it was due to the “AI-driven growth” within the industry. Now, just over a month later, Micron is addressing the decision to shutter the budget-friendly brand in favor of powering data centers and large AI companies.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WCCFTech</a>, Micron’s VP of Marketing, Mobile, and Client Business Unit, Christopher Moore, was asked about the decision and the consumer backlash that followed. </p>







<p>Moore says that the “perception may not be exactly correct” from his point of view. The perception being that the company turned its back on consumers to favor large companies and the continued expansion of data centers. He says that the decisions being made are done to “help consumers around the world.”</p>



<h2 id="h-micron-is-still-involved-in-the-consumer-market">Micron Is Still Involved In The Consumer Market</h2>



<p><strong>“So, I would never want to tell someone what to think or that they’re wrong, but our viewpoint is that we are trying to help consumers around the world,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We’re just doing it through different channels. We still have a very sizable business in the client and mobile markets. We are also, of course, servicing our data center customers.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“And what’s going on right now is that the TAM and data center is growing just absolutely tremendously. And we want to make sure that, as a company, we help fulfill that TAM as well.”</strong></p>







<p>Moore said that it’s still suppling LPDDR5 to companies like ASUS and Dell, which he uses to defend is point on helping consumers. He said that the company is <strong>“in contact with every single PC brand out there to supply memory modules”</strong> and holds a <strong>“large portion of the consumer supply chain through the OEM model.”</strong></p>



<p>That said, Micron <strong>“cannot ignore the demand coming from AI right now.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding the continued shortage of memory and storage, Moore believes that things might not get better until 2028. At least, on Micron’s side. They are working on building new facilities, including a new facility in Idaho scheduled to open in mid-2027 as well as facility in New York. But, Moore says that everything won’t be up and running until 2028.</p>



<p>In the meantime, consumers might have to stick with their older machines a while longer as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices continue to soar</a> throughout the market. </p>
