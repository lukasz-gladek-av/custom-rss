<p>Updates have been announced for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6 </a>in version 1.2.1.0</p>



<p>The Battlefield Communications team announced the next major update to the game. This next update adds new weapons, the “Contaminated” map, new limited-time modes, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-modes-coming-to-battlefield-6">New Modes Coming to Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>The update, scheduled to go live on February 17, adds new modes. These limited-time modes are built around a new psychoactive weapon, VL-7</p>



<p>VL-7 Strike is a limited-time mode where psychoactive smoke spreads across select areas in multiplayer and REDSEC. Players must wear masks and carefully manage their filters, as running out will leave them vulnerable to the disorienting effects of VL-7.</p>











<h2 id="h-map-and-mode-fixes-weapon-balancing-coming-in-new-update">Map and Mode Fixes, Weapon Balancing Coming in New Update</h2>



<p>The update fixes numerous map exploits, traversal issues, capture logic problems, and world reset bugs across Conquest, Breakthrough, Strikepoint, Gauntlet, and other modes.</p>



<p>Additionally, the update delivers a broad recoil tuning pass across automatic weapons, alongside targeted balance fixes to improve consistency, clarity, and long-term weapon handling.</p>







<p>Other issues related to Portal stability, audio, and more were addressed. Players can check out the full statement <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/2022340361868198355?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does God of War Sons of Sparta Have Co-op or Multiplayer?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-co-op-multiplayer/</link>
            <guid>1435543</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The confusion surrounding co-op and/or multiplayer being present in God of War Sons of Sparta at launch was so big that it threatened to consume Olympus itself. If you’re also wondering the same thing, we’ve got the latest on the co-op controversy.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> games have always been without co-op or multiplayer—apart from Ascension’s additional multiplayer add-on. Traditionally, every Greek and Norse tale has revolved around our sometimes bearded, sometimes goatee’d God of War on his lonesome.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-2/" id="3594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sons of Sparta</a>‘s marketing and advertising have made everyone think twice, though.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-in-co-op-or-multiplayer">Can You Play God of War Sons of Sparta in Co-op or Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Disappointment, boy. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Officially, there seems to be no way to play God of War Sons of Sparta with another player in co-op or multiplayer, and it’s unclear if this is an accident or a bug.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, the reveal trailer only showed Kratos battling alone; no second person was controlling Deimos. Which begs the question: Why do people think Sons of Sparta has local or some sort of online co-op multiplayer (there’s 100% no competitive multiplayer, that’s for sure)?</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Complete God of War Sons of Sparta Trophy List</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The official PlayStation Store listing for God of War Sons of Sparta CLEARLY states that up to “1-2 players” can enjoy the game in “Offline play.”</p>



<p>Again, just to reiterate, there is <em>no</em> online component.</p>



<p>If you check Reddit, X, and various forms of social media, you’ll see that many players have bought Sons of Sparta on the pretense that the 2026 God of War title has co-op integration.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has done some testing and tinkering, and there is simply <strong>no way to play co-op in Sons of Sparta so far</strong>. </p>



<p>Leaving us to assume one of three things:</p>



<ul>
<li>God of War Sons of Sparta NEVER had co-op, and it’s a miscommunication issue falsely letting consumers believe it’s the case.</li>



<li>God of War Sons of Sparta DOES have co-op, but it’s currently bugged and not working as intended.</li>



<li>God of War Sons of Sparta DOES have co-op, but you need to unlock it somehow.</li>
</ul>



<p>Realistically, the most likely outcome is the <strong>first explanation</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-ever-get-co-op-or-multiplayer">Will God of War Sons of Sparta Ever Get Co-op or Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, your guess is as good as anyone’s, as neither PlayStation nor Santa Monica has commented on the co-op confusion, at the time of writing.</strong></p>



<p>You’d think something this big would’ve been addressed quite quickly if it were a simple bug. More than likely, it’s a misunderstanding, and the game was not intended to have co-op.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>That’s not to say Sons of Sparta won’t get a co-op mode in the future, and maybe it’s even being worked on behind the scenes. You’ll have to enjoy GOW Sons of Sparta as a single-player title until any announcement or confirmation.</p>
