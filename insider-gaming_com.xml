<p>If you are a citizen of the United States, you may want to get ready see the the price increase on your game consoles, PC parts, and other electronic devices in the coming weeks and months. The United States <a href="https://x.com/spectatorindex/status/1907534017223864812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">government has announced</a> a 25% tariff on all computer imports as of April 2.</p>



<p>These imports include all laptops, desktop parts and components, and, likely, video game consoles.</p>



<p>As of publishing, it’s uncertain how and when prices could be impacted by the tariff announcement. Video game hardware sales in the United States <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-continued-to-fall-in-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have regularly fallen</a> over the last year. With the likelihood of the increased cost being passed down to American consumer, it could be expected to see spending continue to fall.</p>



<p>Where many could see a higher cost is with the Nintendo Switch 2. The Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is slated to have a price</a> of $449.99 in the United States. However, the United States government enacted a 46% tariff on all products from Vietnam where Switch 2 production is taking place. Those tariffs, on top of the aforementioned 25% ones, could see the latest Nintendo console price increase at some point in the near future.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, and other major PC and video game hardware companies for comment on what these tariffs could mean for consumers. Should responses be received, they will be amended to this article.</p>



<p>How much impact do you think these tariffs will have on consumer video game spending and the price of game consoles and PC parts in the United States? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1806/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-game-pass-this-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new email from Rockstar Games, it’s been revealed that GTA 5 will be coming to Xbox and PC Game Pass later this month.</p>



<p>The news comes from primarily Rockstar Games related X account <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1907516701123461261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@videotechuk_</a>, who says that Rockstar Games has sent an email to GTA-related community pages telling them of the news.</p>



<p>For those unaware, GTA 5 has been on Xbox Game Pass a couple of times, but this would be the first time that GTA 5 would be coming to PC Game Pass. Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-could-come-to-pc-game-pass-its-rumored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar insider Tez2 tweeted that Rockstar Games</a> was preparing to launch GTA 5 on PC Game Pass, so its something that the has been in the works for a while.</p>



<p>Ben also said that GTA 5 would be coming to xCloud, which would also be for the first time.</p>



<p>As for when GTA 5 coming to Xbox and PC Game Pass will be announced remains to be seen, but with Rockstar Games sending the announcements to creators today, an official announcement is likely to come soon.</p>



<p>In December 2024, Take-Two Interactive reported that GTA 5 had sold an eye watering 210 million copies worldwide across all of its platforms. </p>



<p>Currently, Rockstar Games is working on GTA 6, which is scheduled to launch in 2025 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but Take-Two Interactive is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-about-not-announcing-gta-6-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet to announce an official release date for PC</a> (which traditionally comes later than consoles).</p>



<p>Will you be playing GTA 5 on Game Pass? Let me know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming community forum</a>.</p>
