<p>It’s Saturday, and as we usher in a new weekend, it’s time to present you with the best NYT Connections solutions you’ll find anywhere. Today’s puzzle is a tricky one, but the hints I’ve got below will help you find the answers as quickly as possible. With that done, you can get on with your weekend!</p>



<p>Read on to check out today’s NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-18">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 18)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #860:</p>



<ul>
<li>HAND</li>



<li>HOCK</li>



<li>PEDAL</li>



<li>SKATE</li>



<li>BACON</li>



<li>CELL</li>



<li>PICKLE</li>



<li>CAGE</li>



<li>DODGE</li>



<li>COAST</li>



<li>FORD</li>



<li>BREEZE</li>



<li>CRUISE</li>



<li>RACQUET</li>



<li>FLOAT</li>



<li>TRAYED</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Think effortless motion across surfaces — air, water, ice, or pavement.</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Each word sets the stage for a different sport or quirky pastime</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – These names rack up IMDb credits like it’s a competition.</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Each word echoes a term for ‘to sell,’ but plays a phonetic trick.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 18.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-just-became-steam%E2%80%99s-most-popular-extraction-shooter-and-it%E2%80%99s-not-even-close.1328404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders players are enjoying the ‘server slam test’ as we speak, pouring into the game to explore everything it has to offer two weeks before it officially hits the market. It’s the last opportunity to play the game for free before it launches on October 30, and it has been met with a seriously positive reception.</p>



<p>The hype driving ARC Raiders has proven to be such a success that the game has almost hit a peak player count of 200,000 concurrent users on <strong>Steam alone</strong>. That’s a phenomenal number that makes ARC Raiders the most popular extraction shooter on the platform.</p>







<p>ARC Raiders has been pieced together by Embark Studios, of The Finals fame. It’s a third-person extraction shooter that throws players into a world devastated by a robot uprising of sorts, putting them into the shoes of scavengers desperately trying to make a buck and resolve quests while avoiding death in the field.</p>



<p>The earliest beta tests of ARC Raiders were rampant successes, and Embark Studios has rolled out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-final-open-beta-server-slam-test-start-date-how-to-play-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a server slam</a> to test the game’s infrastructure before launch and the results have been <strong>dramatically </strong>positive.</p>



<p>On Steam, the game <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2427520/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit an all-time peak</a> of 189,668 users as the server slam unravelled, effortlessly topping <strong>every other extraction shooter ever released on Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>To put that into perspective, here are some top numbers:</p>



<ul>
<li>Arena Breakout: Infinite – 66,007</li>



<li>The Cycle: Frontier – 40,854</li>



<li>Gray Zone Warfare – 72,548</li>



<li>Dark and Darker – 57,164</li>



<li>Escape from Duckov – 61,066</li>
</ul>



<p>Escape from Tarkov, arguably the most popular extraction shooter in the world, is set to be released on Steam on November 15, so it’ll be interesting to see if it can top ARC Raiders. We know that more than 500,000 people have Escape from Tarkov on their wishlist, but that only puts the game in 67th place on Steam’s wishlist activity tracker.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is in fourth place.</p>



<p>Do you think we’ll see ARC Raiders secure the top spot in the extraction genre? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
