<p>The new update and patch notes for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Version 1.02, are out now for Nintendo Switch 2. With it, new quests, weapons, and fixes have been added.</p>







<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-announced-at-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the newest entry</a> in the Hyrule Warriors spinoffs for The Legend of Zelda. In it, fans get to see the original Guardians that took a stand against Ganon, which is shown in flashbacks in Tears of the Kingdom. The Musou hack-and-slash combat and colorful visuals are well worth it, especially on Nintendo Switch 2, but now, there’s a lot more to get excited about with Version 1.02.</p>



<p>For Version 1.02 of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, available now, there’s some new content to enjoy. The biggest of all are new battles and quests, which are unlocked after beating the main story. New stylish Sync-Strike Attacks between Zelda and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-new-trailer-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calamo</a> have been added, as well as the Longsword of Light for Rauru. Furthermore, some improvements to split-screen and UI have been addressed and fixed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Studios Has Explained Why Scrappy The Rooster Exists in ARC Raiders]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/scrappy-embark-arc-raiders-back-story/</link>
            <guid>1365919</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone who has played ARC Raiders knows that Scrappy the Rooster exists. He’s a quirky little bird that struts around your Raider Den, collecting all kinds of resources while you’re off topside fighting the ARC – and other Raiders. But nobody really knows how he got there and what his purpose in life is, besides gathering scrap items.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has just set the story straight on where Scrappy came from and why he exists in ARC Raiders.</p>







<h2 id="h-scrappy-has-an-origin-story">Scrappy Has an Origin Story</h2>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-story-of-scrappy-the-rooster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders website</a>, Johan, a 3D artist working on the game, revealed the origin story behind Scrappy, everyone’s favorite and lovable rooster character:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was living with my parents at the time – they happened to keep chickens. Mid-zoom meeting, the birds somehow snuck into the house and strutted around behind me, instantly stealing the show and derailing the meeting entirely. Among those birds was Hȧkan, the rooster that would go on to become Scrappy.</p>



<p><strong>Hȧkan was unlike the other roosters.</strong>&nbsp;Friendly, cuddly, and blind in one eye, he had a habit of stepping in his food and tripping over himself. I adored him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One day, I decided to photoscan Håkan and sneak him into the game as a silly little easter egg. In early builds, you could sometimes spot a rough version of Hȧkan sprinting around the cantina.</p>



<p><strong>But then, Hȧkan</strong>&nbsp;<strong>got his chance to shine.&nbsp;</strong>The team needed an in-game asset that would be used as a “resource producer,” something that would provide you with materials after each raid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cycled through many ideas: robots, cats… robot-cats! But the art team didn’t have time to build them and the meeting stalled, until someone raised their hand and said, in a moment of brilliance, “don’t we have a rooster?”</p>



<p><strong>That spark of inspiration turned into a phenomenon.&nbsp;</strong>Scrappy went from hidden easter egg, to “temporary mesh we’ll definitely replace later”, to a beloved and irreplaceable part of the ARC Raiders universe. So next time you see Scrappy, tell him I say hello!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a quaint story, but it perfectly explains why Scrappy exists in a world so devoid of animal life. Most of the humour has been sucked clean out of the world on account of it being a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but knowing that Scrappy is waiting for you when you return to Speranza is always a nice touch.</p>
