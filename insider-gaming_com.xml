<p>Bethesda and Microsoft have released a nearly 15-minute deep dive into the gameplay of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>

<p>The deep dive gives players a look at an entire section of the game, including cutscenes, puzzles, and Indy’s classic whip in action. Players also get a look at “Adventure Points” which are earned and used to unlock skills as you progress through the game.</p>



<p>One specific puzzle in the gameplay involves Indy pouring out wine to reveal a hidden number.</p>
