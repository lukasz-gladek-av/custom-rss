<p>A new report by Capcom reveals that they will bring new releases and remakes of Devil May Cry, Mega Man, and Ace Attorney to new hardware. </p>



<p>Capcom has some massive franchises under its belt, which include Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, and Street Fighter. However, they also have smaller franchises, which have a considerable user base. Capcom has stated that it will work to bring more projects for these franchises as well. </p>

<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.rockman-corner.com/2025/12/capcom-moves-to-revitalize-mega-man-ace.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockman Corner</a>, Capcom has released its <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2025/annual_2025_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2025 integrated report</a>, in which COO Haruhiro Tsujimoto has spoken about developing new projects, remakes, and ports for its other IPs. The statement first talks about Capcom aiming to sustain their “KPI of 10% or better annual operating profit growth along with our long-term goal of annual software sales of 100 million units.” Their efforts are “focused on core IP such as the Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, and Street Fighter franchises, and mapping out mainline series entries and sequels, remakes, new IP, and ports of content to the latest hardware.” </p>



<p>The statement adds that the developers release “two or three major new titles each year,” but have recognised they need to grow their pipeline. Capcom owns popular IPs such as Devil May Cry, Ace Attorney, and Mega Man, and their goal is to expand the user base and improve performance “through new releases, remakes, and ports of titles in these series to new hardware.” They will grow these franchises into core IPs “by enhancing the brand power and cultivating loyal fan bases.”</p>







<p>In other news, Capcom stated that Resident Evil Requiem’s development started <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-says-resident-evil-requiem-development-started-way-before-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“way before” RE Village</a>. Additionally, a former Capcom designer recently stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-crossed-a-line-says-former-capcom-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld “crossed a line”</a>.

<p>Jeffrey Dean Morgan wants to play Arthur Morgan in a Red Dead Redemption adaptation.</p>



<p>During a recent appearance at a convention, the The Walking Dead star took part in a fan Q&amp;A session. As part of that session, one fan as him if he’d be at all interested in playing the main protagonist from Red Dead Redemption 2. </p>







<p><strong>“That’s the one that I want to do,” </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/__GLLVjR2O0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he&nbsp;told the fan</a>. <strong>“It’s not even a question. One, the only genre… My favorite genre is western and there’s not even a close second. And my son plays that game and it’s freaking awesome. In a heartbeat, I would do it for free.”</strong></p>



<p>Though he’s mainly known for film and television roles, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is no stranger to lending his voice to video games. Back in 2019, he voiced a virtual version of his The Walking Dead character Negan for Tekken 7 DLC. </p>



<p>Do you think Jeffrey Dean Morgan would make for a good Arthur Morgan in a Red Dead Redemption show or movie?

<p>PlayStation has revealed an odd but intriguing crossover for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, as the popular flight-sim game is bringing Netflix’s Stranger Things to the game, and in this day and age, stranger things have happened.</p>



<p>Stranger Things Season 5 is all the rage right now. Netflix’s hit show is into its fifth and final season, bringing down the curtain on one of the most-watched TV shows ever. In the gaming world, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-release-date-early-access-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> has launched on PlayStation 5, marking the first appearance for the franchise on a Sony console.</p>



<p>Someone behind the scenes was clearly interested to see what would happen if you joined these opposing forces together, and now there’s an answer.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-visit-iconic-stranger-things-location-in-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">You Can Visit Iconic Stranger Things Location In Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stranger crossovers have happened. Credit to Xbox Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll be able to explore Hawkins like never before. See and visit real locations from the show in the new Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024: Stranger Things expansion, available December 9.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/09/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-introduces-netflixs-stranger-things-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation</a> Blog said: “You will be able to explore a highly detailed map and recreation of the town with more than 40 iconic locations made famous by the show.”</p>



<p>Some of the locations include Starcourt Mall, Hawkins Middle School, and Hawkins Junkyard.</p>



<p>The expansion includes five new missions taking you around the town in a Bell UH-1H Huey helicopter, and you need to rescue residents in danger. It makes sense for any game right now to cash in on the Stranger Things final season hype, but a Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 wouldn’t have been near the top of your lists!</p>
