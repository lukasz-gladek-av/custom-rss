            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A popular way to get better items and abilities in Demonfall quickly is to make use of the many October 2025 Demonfall codes. This makes Demonfall codes extremely popular among newer players of the game, as it allows them to bridge the gap between themselves and the competition fairly fast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you a fan of the popular anime series Demon Slayer? If yes, we suggest that you take a couple of minutes to check out this riveting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-type-soul-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game—Demonfall. Inspired almost entirely by Demon Slayer, Demonfall drops players into the role of a demon hunter, responsible for fighting against various characters in the game. This then helps players progress through the game’s story, while also helping improve their own abilities—and you can progress faster with Demonfall monthly codes and rewards.</p>

<p>Redeeming Demonfall codes is a straightforward process and doesn’t require any specific criteria to be met before the code redemption feature gets unlocked. It’s as simple as navigating through the menus and finding the codes section. For players who may be unfamiliar with the Roblox ecosystem, here’s a simple step-by-step guide to redeeming Demonfall codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Demonfall</li>



<li>Click on the Tab button to open up the menu</li>



<li>Click on the Cog (Settings) button</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box</li>



<li>Hit the ‘Enter’ key to receive your rewards</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-demonfall-codes">How To Get More Demonfall Codes</h2>



<p>Although there is currently only one working code in the game, players are urged to wait patiently, as new Demonfall codes are surely on the horizon. Considering the popularity that Demonfall has gained since its release, the developers are almost certainly working on new content for the game, and new content updates usually mean new codes.</p>



<p>Although there’s no set timeline for code drops, they usually come out along with updates, so players would be smart to keep their eyes peeled. While tracking the game’s socials and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/eAUgs3PvD9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a> for new codes is an option, a simpler and more hassle-free way to stay ahead of the curve would be to simply bookmark this page. We update this article as soon as any new codes drop, so checking in every now and then would be the best course of action.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-wind-waves-everything-we-know-about-gen-10-leaks.1324135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A huge dataleak has struck the world of Pokémon, revealing huge details about upcoming titles and the long-awaited arrival of Gen 10, said to be titled Wind &amp; Waves.</p>



<p>A series of leaks have dropped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details about Gen 10</a>, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap for future titles and DLC</a>, and teases the introduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-reveals-boss-fight-and-mmo-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MMO mechanics in the next era</a> of the franchise.</p>



<p>Keeping on top of all the leaks is practically impossible, but we’ve made it easier for you to track everything revealed about Pokémon Gen 10, Wind &amp; Waves, in this guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-we-know-about-pokemon-wind-amp-waves">Everything We Know About Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big additions. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-game-location">Game Location</h3>



<p>Pokémon’s tenth generation will return to the Asian continent, having ventured to Europe and Hawaii in recent years, with the islands of Indonesia and Southeast Asia serving as the location.</p>



<p>The island locations will certainly be reminiscent of Sun &amp; Moon, based on Hawaii, and these rumours have been circulating for some time, though it was previously indicated that it would be based on the Greek islands. That appears not to be the case, however, with Indonesia and surrounding nations set to star.</p>



<h3 id="h-seed-pokemon">Seed Pokémon</h3>



<p>Seed <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> will reportedly be introduced in Pokémon Gen 10, with a particularly unique mechanic. According to datamines, the evolution of the Seed Pokémon will be based on the unique island you discover (more on that later), meaning your evolved form will feature unique patterns and colors.</p>



<p>There has been some confusion, however, as the Japanese use of ‘Seed’ for Pokémon description is also used in the TCG to describe ‘Basic’ Pokémon, so it may be that this Pokémon is ‘Basic’ and not ‘Seed’. However, the evolution mechanics seem to stand.</p>



<h3 id="h-underwater-exploration">Underwater Exploration</h3>



<p>Underwater exploration, not seen since the Hoenn games, is returning for Gen 10 and is said to be a huge feature, with datamined images showing a player riding on the back of Lumineon. Footage leaked from the graphics engine suggests it will have free exploration, not just available on designated routes.</p>



<h3 id="h-riding-amp-petting-mechanics">Riding &amp; Petting Mechanics</h3>



<p>Pokémon games have had riding mechanics in the past, notably with Pokémon Legends: Arceus having various mounts with different uses, but Gen 10 is seemingly set to take that to the next level with mechanics that make every Pokémon rideable, or pettable—likely depending on their size.</p>



<p>It’s noted that these details were in the planning document from 2020, so the feature may have been adjusted or removed entirely during development.</p>



<h3 id="h-model-redesigns">Model Redesigns</h3>



<p>It’s not surprising to see Pokémon getting model redesigns in new eras of the franchise, and it seems it’s happening once again for Gen 10 as images showing several images comparing Pokémon to their new forms and older models have been shared.</p>



<p>Pikachu, Charizard, Lumineon, and Machamp are all explicity stated as receiving new models for Gen 10, though it’s likely all Pokémon will be adjusted to fit the new era.</p>



<h3 id="h-mmo-features">MMO Features</h3>



<p>MMO features are set to be introduced in Gen 10, the leaks state, with a mix of open-world and MMO elements. Though not confirmed, this sounds like exploration areas will be limited to parties and groups, while main areas, acting as hubs, will have players across the world joined together.</p>



<p>The features are seemingly going to serve as a soft-launch ahead of being expanded in the Pokémon Seed project, a game that joins several regions together including Hoenn and Sinnoh. A similar approach has been seen in the past, with large open-world areas introduced in Legends: Arceus, which occurred before the huge open-world map seen in Scarlet &amp; Violet.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Leaks. Credit to Game Freak</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-release-window">Release Window</h3>



<p>As expected, Pokémon Wind &amp; Waves, the tenth generation, will launch in 2026, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the franchise. This would come four years after the release of Scarlet &amp; Violet, slightly longer than the standard three-year gap we’ve seen in the past.</p>



<p>These plans have seemingly been updated; however, as documents initially stated Gen 10 was planned to release in 2025, likely as a big lure alongside the Switch 2 launch, with Legends: Z-A launching in 2024. That is not the case, however, as we know.</p>



<h3 id="h-procedural-generation">Procedural Generation</h3>



<p>Procedural generation is reportedly going to be a huge feature in Gen 10, with islands generated randomly for you to explore. If you like what you find, you’ll be able to share an island with your friends.</p>



<p>It’s not known whether you can save islands permanently and have them serve as a ‘base,’ or if they’ll merely be for exploration and catching new Pokémon. </p>



<h3 id="h-switch-2-exclusive">Switch 2 Exclusive</h3>



<p>Unsurprisingly, it has been confirmed that Gen 10 of Pokémon, Wind &amp; Waves, will be exclusive to Switch 2 and won’t be available on the original console, unlike Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>



<p>Legends: Z-A is likely to be the final Pokémon title released onto the original Switch console, with Pokopia arriving next year and confirmed to be a Switch 2 exclusive. </p>



<h3 id="h-sustainable-development-goals">Sustainable Development Goals</h3>



<p>Similar to Scarlet &amp; Violet, there will be a group of objectives rather than just the standard gym badges, with the theme said to be inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>



<p>In total, there are 18 challenges, one for each type, and completing them all allows you to challenge the champion. However, if you want to, you can skip this whole stage entirely and head straight to the final boss as soon as open-water exploration in the game is unlocked.</p>



<h3 id="h-characters">Characters</h3>



<p>Descriptions for several characters have been unearthed, including the protagonist, a child whose mother wins a lottery and a vacation to the region. A sibling is also mentioned, with their development playing a key part in the story, and there’s the customary friend/rival to challenge you along the way.</p>



<p>The antagonist is said to be the chairman of a group of hotels, who initially planned to build resorts where humans and Pokémon could co-exist. However, an accident led to the loss of a child, changing his views. There’s also a younger sibling to that child who survived and is described as “naive” about the world.</p>



<p>The role of the evil team is taken by a Land Development Team, who destroy nature to expand land for profit, likely working for the hotel chairman. Finally, the professor is younger than we usually see in the franchise, age 21, and is known as the “Survival Professor,” with survival skills being a core strength.</p>

<p>In 2023, Fallout’s creator, Tim Cain, uploaded a video explaining <strong>which country </strong>dropped the first nukes in the Fallout universe. It was revealed that it was <strong>China </strong>that fired first, which put to rest the assumptions made by many over the game’s twenty-plus-year history.</p>



<p>Now, in an all-new video, Tim Cain has doubled down on his confirmation, explaining in more depth <strong>why </strong>China fired first. It’s lore that is mostly understood by die-hard fans, but it’s always nice to get a little more of a backstory for a universe so expansive and densely populated as Fallout’s.</p>



<h2 id="h-china-fired-first">China Fired First</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-first-nukes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Two years ago</a>, Tim Cain confirmed that China dropped the first nuke in Fallout, kicking off the Great War and bringing about the destruction of the entire planet:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The reason we got nuked is: bio-weapons were illegal and somehow China found out we were doing FEV. And they were like, ‘You have to stop it.’ And we went, ‘Okay’. But all we did is move it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a new video, Cain once again touched on the topic and went into more depth about why China dropped the first wave of nukes on the United States:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>China nuked first.</p>



<p>It’s pretty obvious from the game. This isn’t canon, but let me explain what I mean and why we thought that. </p>



<p>In the original game we had established that the US was doing bio-weapons research. We weren’t supposed to, we had signed a UN treaty saying we wouldn’t do that, and I think you can find that out in the game. China discovered that we were doing it, but how did they discover that? </p>



<p>Espionage. </p>



<p>We went, ‘Oops our bad we’ll stop doing it. But we just kept on doing it, we just moved the research to another base. It’s the hidden base where you discover ZAX the supercomputer.</p>



<p>They just nuked us. We nuked back, other countries nuked, because all anyone saw was missiles flying. China technically started it by firing the first nuke, but you could argue that technically the US started it by doing illegal bio-weapons research then lying about it multiple times.</p>

<p>It’s an expansion on what we already knew, but Fallout fans <strong>love </strong>this kind of lore, so they’ll eat it up (myself included).</p>



<p>In the video, Tim Cain goes on to talk about Fallout-themed tidbits, such as why Vault Suits look the way they do, and how some brands wound up being implemented in the universe. It’s a treasure trove for the game’s biggest fans, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>If you’re planning on booting up Battlefield 6 with a Cronus Zen attached, there’s bad news waiting for you. In a series of posts on social media, it has been revealed that users are receiving account suspensions from Electronic Arts when trying to play Battlefield 6 using a Cronus Zen, an infamous piece of technology mostly used by malicious operators in games.</p>



<p>An image uploaded to social media showed that<strong> </strong>Electronic Arts is <strong>permanently blocking access </strong>to Battlefield 6 for those found to be using a Cronus Zen in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-won-t-prosper">You Won’t Prosper</h2>



<p>The Cronus Zen input device has long been the face of controversy in the gaming world, simply because it offers malicious advantages to those using it. It can massively reduce recoil, aid with accuracy, and introduce macros that users can lean on to gain an upper hand over their opponents, and it works on both PC and console platforms.</p>



<p>In a string of posts on social media, users started sharing images of bans after trying to boot Battlefield 6 with a Cronus Zen engaged:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The discourse has proven that both console and PC platforms are being impacted by these punitive actions, which have been met with jubilation from fans worldwide. In one post, a user wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Cronus</strong> Zen community is losing their minds and getting banned on <strong>Battlefield</strong> 6 lmao. How about play the game how it was intended to be played and have fun?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stated that the ‘lead programmer’ for the Cronus lineup has mentioned how the device is ‘cooked’ for Battlefield 6, and that the team has advised users <span><strong>not to</strong></span><strong> </strong>use their Cronus Zen when playing the all-new FPS title.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a huge win for Electronic Arts? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>
