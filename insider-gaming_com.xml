<p>Insomniac Games wanted to develop Resistance 4, but PlayStation turned it down. That’s according to soon-to-be president of Insomniac Games Ted Price.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZWKbHKCUkpw?t=1311s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kinda Funny Games</a>, Price was asked about a favorite game of his that was pitched but never greenlit.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’ll share one,” Price said after a brief pause. “Resistance 4.”</p>



<p>He continued: “We did pitch that one and it was a wonderful concept, and, it just, in terms of timing and market opportunity, didn’t work out. But it was the result of a lot of Insomniac  team members being passionate about extending the story further because I do believe that Resistance has set up a really cool alternate history base where anything can happen with the Chimera and where they go and what their origins are.”</p>



<p>Price said that they spent a lot of time working on backstory and brainstorming on where the series could go in the future.</p>



<p>“Personally, I love this franchise,” he said.  “I was fortunate enough to be creative director on the first two Resistances. And I will remember many, many moments—good and bad—when it comes to development that taught us all a lot about how we can elevate ourselves under some pretty difficult situations.”</p>



<p>Resistance, which first debuted with 2006’s Resistance: Fall of Man, hasn’t seen a mainline game since 2011’s Resistance 3. Price said that there’s no answer to the question of if the studio will ever develop another Resistance game, but it’s something he hopes will happen in the future.</p>

<p>There is going to be a major update coming to Balatro sometime in the future. What’s included in that update, however, is currently unknown, and that’s by design.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-07/maker-of-smash-indie-hit-balatro-talks-about-what-s-next?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODk1NTUwNCwiZXhwIjoxNzM5NTYwMzA0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUkJVTUxEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.vnpDPy2eO2srUo1cO71bFTutl-JvFojih-o2zs4niu4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, Balatro developer LocalThunk gave a small update on the next update he’s working on. </p>







<p>The update, which he calls a “1.1” update for the game will include new Jokers along with various other features. LocalThunk didn’t want to get into exactly what those features will be because of potential constraints that would put on him such as the ability to “pivot if something new doesn’t work.”</p>



<p>“I think it’s healthier for the game that I keep my cards close to my chest, then give you the best version of whatever this new content update is,” he said.</p>

<p>Despite not wanting to give anything away, he did reveal two changes that will come with the update. The first is a change to the “blue stake” modifier while the second is a change to the Matador Joker—Earn $8 if played hand triggers the Boss Blind ability. As far as what those changes will involve, that wasn’t said. Details on that, along with everything else players can expect, will come closer to its release.</p>



<p>The update is expected to arrive sometime this year.</p>

<p>In a VALORANT match with massive qualifying implications, Vitality star Nikita “Derke” Sirmitev busted out the silliest play in the playbook. And somehow, the gamble worked, leaving his opponents embarrassed, and insuring a spot for his own team at the first Masters event of the year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-derke-does-the-unthinkable">Derke Does The Unthinkable </h2>



<p>In the upper bracket final of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-esports-lands-sony-inzone-sponsorship-for-next-2-seasons-of-vct-emea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VCT EMEA Kickoff</a>, Vitality and Team Heretics went haed-to-head for one of two spots at Masters Bangkok. To beat Heretics, a two-time grand finalist at international events in 2024, Vitality would need to play with the utmost confidence. </p>



<p>Derke, the former star of Fnatic who switched to Vitality this past offseason, certainly didn’t lack confidence when he caught Heretics off guard with the fake Yoru clone. Typically, when a Yoru player uses their Fakeout ability, they send a clone forward that will hit enemies that shoot it with a blinding flash. So normally, enemy players just ignore the clone walking completely straight forward. </p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250207_CrackyStormyCrocodilePJSalt-cXdQVUEvEo_Sf8k7_source.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Unfortunately for Heretics, it wasn’t Derke’s clone that walked onto the site, it was Derke pretending to be his clone. To make matters worse, Heretics’ Ričardas “Boo” Lukaševičius teleported right next to Derke before he turned, gifting him an additional kill. It’s a play that VALORANT fans have sometimes seen during streams and maybe in their own ranked games, but never on a pro stage as big as this one. The play also gifted Vitality a bonus round win, taking a third straight round to start Haven despite not completely buying. Vitality ended up winning Haven, and then owned Heretics’ own map pick of Abyss to claim the series, and the Masters spot, in dominant fashion.</p>
