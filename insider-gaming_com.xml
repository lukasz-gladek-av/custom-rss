<p>Takeshi Ichikawa, the producer of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dragon-quest-7-reimagined/" id="3414">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a>, reflects on preserving the spirit of Akira Toriyama’s designs in the remade video game.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest 7 was originally released back in 2000 on the Sony PlayStation. However, over a quarter-century later, the game has been reimagined in a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/square-enix/" id="87637">Square Enix</a> release. Not only have some major gameplay mechanics been overhauled, but the 2D visuals have been overhauled as well.</p>



<p>The original game featured art by the legendary Akira Toriyama, and it was important to the 2026 development team that the spirit of that art style be preserved to remain faithful to the original drawings.</p>







<h2 id="h-preserving-the-spirit-of-toriyama-s-original-work-on-dragon-quest-7-was-essential">Preserving the Spirit of Toriyama’s Original Work on Dragon Quest 7 Was Essential</h2>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-quest/dragon-quest-7-reimagined-producer-says-square-enix-tried-to-convey-the-cuteness-of-legendary-dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyamas-original-designs-without-compromising-the-jrpgs-unique-atmosphere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Takeshi Ichikawa discussed the importance of preserving the cuteness of Toriyama’s designs while still capturing the game’s atmosphere for a modern audience. As for the direction of modern art, Ichikawa noted that current movies and games featuring doll designs had been well received, so they chose to combine that with Toriyama’s original designs.</p>



<p>“We felt this approach would create a visually appealing style, leading to our decision to move forward with the hand-crafted aesthetic,” he said.</p>







<p>The remake has been well-received. It currently has an 83 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic </a>score and a 7.6 user score on the platform.</p>



<p>Akira Toriyama also worked on an upcoming Dragon Ball video game project before his passing. Learn more about that upcoming game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/" id="171842">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dead-by-daylight/" id="741">Dead by Daylight</a>, the popular co-op survival horror game from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/behaviour-interactive/" id="1742">Behaviour Interactive</a>, is being adapted into a film. The <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dead-by-daylight-movie-adaptation-writers-1236505104/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollywood Reporter</a> has confirmed that Blumhouse-Atomic Monster has selected David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, known for his work on The Conjuring series, and Alexandre Aja as writers for the upcoming adaptation.</p>



<p>Alexandre Aja has writing credits, including 2006’s “The Hills Have Eyes,” but he’s also known for his directorial work. According to the report, he’s not directing this film because he’s slated to direct Under Paris 2 at Netflix. Therefore, Dead by Daylight is still looking for a director.</p>







<h2 id="h-blumhouse-founder-is-confident-in-choice-for-dead-by-daylight-writers">Blumhouse Founder Is Confident in Choice For Dead by Daylight Writers</h2>



<p>Jason Blum, the founder and CEO of Blumhouse, praised Aja and McGoldrick in a statement. He said the pair offers a rare balance of character-focused storytelling and genre intensity. He also dubbed the pairing an excellent blueprint for attracting prospective directors.</p>



<p>“Drawing from survival horror and psychological terror, their work establishes a world where fear is not just experienced, but earned. It is a cinematic blueprint designed to attract a director who can elevate that vision through performance and scale,” said Blum.</p>







<h2 id="h-video-game-adaptations-are-all-the-rage">Video Game Adaptations Are All the Rage</h2>



<p>Dead by Daylight is just one of many video games currently being adapted for film and TV. Sega’s House of the Dead franchise is slated for a new movie release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/house-of-the-dead-movie-casts-isabela-merced-in-lead-role/" id="174954">starring Isabela Merced</a>. Additionally, the God of War franchise is being adapted into a TV show on Prime Video. That series has already been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" id="161464">greenlit for a second season.</a></p>



<p>Also, Sega has announced that many of its classic franchises, including Streets of Rage and Shinobi, will receive animated adaptations. Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/streets-of-rage-shinobi-outrun-getting-animated-adaptations/" id="176639">this link.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/six-invitational-2027-back-to-brazil/</link>
            <guid>1436332</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In Rainbow Six esports fashion, Ubisoft has used the biggest stage in the space, at the Six Invitational, to announce the setting for <strong>the next Six Invitational</strong>. As the action unfolds in Paris, France, the team took it upon themselves to declare <strong>Brazil</strong> the spot for next year’s Six Invitational, one of the most valuable esports tournaments in the business.</p>



<p>This will be the <strong>second </strong>Six Invitational to hit Brazil in three years, with the 2024 event taking place in Sao Paolo and setting a record as one of the most-viewed events in the game’s history.</p>







<h2 id="h-six-invitational-goes-back-to-brazil">Six Invitational Goes Back to Brazil</h2>



<p>The Six Invitational is wrapping up in Paris, France, tomorrow, and it has been one hell of a tournament thus far. It’s the first Six Invitational to land in Paris since 2021, and the European fans have been <strong>very </strong>receptive to the power of the event.</p>



<p>In a new press release, Ubisoft and BLAST unveiled a reinvigorated, three-year partnership, pushing further into an alignment that has proved fruitful over the last few years. BLAST will host the next Rainbow Six Major events, which were <strong>also </strong>revealed today:</p>



<ul>
<li>Salt Lake City R6 Major: May 8 – 17, 2026</li>



<li>Japan R6 Major: November 2026</li>
</ul>



<p>Speaking on the announcement, the CEO of BLAST, Robbie Douek, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Over the past three years, BLAST and Ubisoft have worked side-by-side to elevate Rainbow Six esports on a global scale, from unforgettable live events to a more competitive and connected ecosystem. Renewing this partnership was a natural next step and sends a strong positive message to fans of BLAST Rainbow 6, and the competitive entertainment industry. </p>



<p>With incredible destinations confirmed for the 2026/27 season and exciting plans ahead for the ecosystem, we’re excited to continue in our mission to elevate and improve BLAST Rainbow Six Esports for fans, players, teams and brands.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the statement, Francois-Xavier Deniele, the VP of Marketing &amp; Esports (Rainbow Six) at Ubisoft, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Renewing our partnership with BLAST is a strong vote of confidence in what we’ve built together over the past three years, and in where we want to take Rainbow Six esports next. With a unified global structure for 2026, new event destinations across the US, Japan, and Brazil, and the CNL joining as a fully integrated region, we’re creating a clearer competitive journey for teams and a stronger, more consistent experience for fans. </p>



<p>We’re excited to keep innovating, investing in the live product, and growing the ecosystem sustainably for the long term.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last year, Deniele went on record talking about the immense success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege/" id="1507">Rainbow Six Siege</a> as an esports game. He was part of the crew suggesting there’s a <strong>very long </strong>and lucrative road ahead for the game, which Ubisoft wants to become an ‘annual billionaire’ franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another week draws to a close, but how was it for you? Did you enjoy Valentine’s Day? Or did you miss a day of the NYT Connections puzzle and now your streak is lost, and you’re inconsolable? Whatever happened, I’m back again with another round of NYT Connections hints to help you wrap things up quickly.</p>



<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections answers and tips.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-15">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 15)</h2>

<li>CALLIOPE</li>



<li>OEDIPUS</li>

<p>The Pokémon EUIC takes place in London this weekend, and just like previous events, the closing ceremony will provide some big indications of future events, and potentially more.</p>



<p>EUIC is another big one in 2026, with attention starting to turn towards Worlds in San Francisco in August, and players will be able to book their spot based on their performances. More importantly, however, is the move to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-champions/" id="2457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Champions</a> for VGC, and release details could be imminent.</p>



<p>If you want all the details on when the closing ceremony for Pokémon EUIC 2026 takes place and how to watch it, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>

<p><strong>The closing ceremony for the 2026 Pokémon</strong> <strong>EUIC takes place at 11 am PT on Sunday, February 16, following the conclusion of the competitive events.</strong></p>



<p>Sunday is the final day of EUIC, and is reserved for finals, and the closing ceremony takes place after the last of the events comes to a close, so the times are subject to change. </p>



<p>The starting time for the Pokémon EUIC 2026 Closing Ceremony in major regions worldwide is shown in the table below.</p>

<p><strong>The closing ceremony for the EUIC 2026 will be livestreamed on both Twitch and YouTube, so you can watch all the announcements wherever you are in the world.</strong></p>



<p>Co-streaming is also supported across the entirety of the EUIC weekend, so you can also watch the closing ceremony alongside your favorite creators.</p>



<p>All major headlines and clips will also be shared across Pokémon’s social media accounts, so it will be easy to catch up on anything you might have missed.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-the-pokemon-euic-closing-ceremony">What to Expect From The Pokémon EUIC Closing Ceremony</h2>



<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>EUIC 2026 closing ceremony is likely to feature some big news about the competitive scene of the franchise, including upcoming events.</strong></p>



<p>Last year’s closing ceremony provided details on the Road to Worlds VGC events, alongside details of the finals in San Francisco, and similar details are expected to be shared this year.</p>



<p>Most important, however, is news surrounding the release of Pokémon Champions, which is set to replace Pokémon Scarlet and Violet as the format for VGC competitions this year. It has already been confirmed that Pokémon Champions will be the format for Worlds this year, but there is still no concrete release window.</p>



<p>While there is still the NAIC to take place in June, it has been widely expected that EUIC will be the final major event using Scarlet &amp; Violet for competitive tournaments, and the closing ceremony could provide key details.</p>

            <guid>1436290</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gtfo/" id="3598">GTFO </a>developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/10-chambers/" id="3597">10 Chambers</a> has confirmed a large number of layoffs as part of a significant restructuring.</p>



<p>Several staff members began sharing news of the restructuring on their LinkedIn profiles. Even Hjalmar Vikström, co-founder and former chief development officer, announced that he was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hjalmarvikstrom_hey-im-not-the-most-active-on-linkedin-activity-7427282044239413248-_sVU/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">entering a new chapter in his career</a>, one in which he will focus on developing smaller, independent games and prioritizing his health.</p>







<h2 id="h-10-chambers-remains-focused-on-den-of-wolves">10 Chambers Remains Focused on Den of Wolves</h2>



<p>The studio then confirmed in a statement to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-gtfo-developer-10-chambers-lays-off-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a> that a large number of individuals were “impacted” by the restructuring. In their statement, they stated this move is to ultimately ensure that the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/den-of-wolves/" id="3599">Den of Wolves</a> game becomes what it “deserves to be.”</p>



<p>“We remain focused on the vision of Den of Wolves. Ulf Andersson and Simon Viklund remain fully committed to the game and to leading the studio forward. When we have more concrete news to share, we’ll do it through our official channels,” they stated.</p>



<p>The studio was formed in 2015 by former Payday designers. Den of Wolves is to be the return to the heist genre for many on the team. In 2025, they announced plans to develop a documentary video series. Titled “Do the Game,” the documentary will explore the behind-the-scenes development of Den of Wolves.</p>







<h2 id="h-mass-layoffs-continue-in-gaming">Mass Layoffs Continue in Gaming</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, discussions of major layoffs and restructuring are becoming far too common in gaming. Less than a month after the release of Highguard, Wildlight Entertainment announced it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" id="175994">downsizing the development team of that game</a>. Riot Games recently shared <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">a similar announcement</a> concerning the 2XKO fighting game.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is perhaps the most well-known studio undergoing a restructuring. A decision that has resulted in several games being canceled. Learn more about the canceled titles <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" id="176792">here</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to report the latest news concerning development studios.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021.
