<p>Fresh challenges await with the launch of Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, which includes several new bosses to defeat, and this guide has all the location details for Hush.</p>



<p>Hush is one of three bosses waiting to be encountered in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, alongside <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-human-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Bill</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-beach-brutus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beach Brutus</a>, with unique weapons and abilities available as rewards once defeated.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has all the boss location details for Hush in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 below, along with all the loot earned for defeating them.</p>

<p><strong>Like the other bosses in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, Hush doesn’t have a single guaranteed spawn location, with several potential spawn points across the map instead.</strong></p>



<p>Though this can be frustrating if you’re on the hunt for a specific boss, like Hush, and the available loot, it keeps things fresh in every Fortnite match and prevents a flood of players dropping on the same guaranteed spawn location for an all-out brawl to defeat the boss and claim the loot.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of potential Hush boss locations in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ripped Tides</li>



<li>Classified Canyon</li>



<li>Painted Palms</li>



<li>South of Paws Inn</li>



<li>Sunset Falls</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for Hush, the best landing spot is Painted Palms, as this is a potential spawn location for all three bosses. Additionally, it’s near two other spawn points, so there’s quick rotation if your first point of call doesn’t yield the results you’re looking for.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-hush-loot-drops-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Hush Loot Drops in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>Hush has a decent crop of valuable loot when defeated in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, including the ability to transform into the boss and benefit from increased Health and Shields.</strong></p>



<p>Alongside those boosts, transforming into Hush unlocks the Kit In ability, which is used to Zero Point Dash. With this ability, traversal in combat, or for general movement across the map, becomes much faster.</p>



<p>In terms of weapon, defeating Hish drops Hush’s Deadeye Assault Rifle, a Mythic version of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapon available elsewhere in the map</a> with increased headshot damage, and low recoil. This makes picking enemies off at mid-to-long range much easier and can be a turning point in the battle.</p>



<p>Like the other bosses, defeating Hush also drops a Chug Jug, which can be used to restore Health and Shields. With a boost to both when you turn into the boss, it’s another invaluable piece of kit.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 Beach Brutus Boss Location—Where to Find & All Loot]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-beach-brutus/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A fresh beginning has occurred in Fortnite with the launch of Chapter 7 Season 1, which brings with it a new map and new bosses to defeat, and this guide has all the location details on where to find Beach Brutus.</p>



<p>Beach Brutus is one of three bosses waiting to be encountered on the Fortnite map, alongside the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-boss-location-human-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Bill</a>, and offers unique rewards that can turn the tide in any match, so he’s well worth hunting down.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming is here to help you track down the boss location, along with details on the loot dropped once Beach Brutus has been defeated.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-beach-brutus-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">Where to Find Beach Brutus in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s go to the beach. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Like the other bosses in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, there isn’t a single location guaranteed to have Beach Brutus waiting. Instead, there are several spawn points across the map.</strong></p>



<p>While it can be frustrating to have rotating bosses with a list of several spawn locations, it adds additional variety to each Fortnite map. Additionally, Beach Brutus is possibly the easiest to find, as the majority of the spawn points are located near each other.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of where Beach Brutus can be encountered in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ripped Tides</li>



<li>Classified Canyon</li>



<li>Painted Palms</li>



<li>Paws Inn (East of Wonkeeland)</li>



<li>Sunset Falls (Southeast of Wonkeeland)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for Beach Brutus, Painted Palms is a good place to start as he is often found here, and other spawn locations near Paws Inn and Sunset Falls are not too far away. However, he’s often found in Ripped Tides and Classified Canyon, both of which are popular initial landing locations, so competition to defeat him can be fierce.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-beach-brutus-loot-drops-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Beach Brutus Loot Drops in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>Beach Brutus drops a host of valuable loot when defeated in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, including the ability to transform into the boss.</strong></p>



<p>Transforming into Beach Brutus provides a boost to maximum Health and Shields, along with a special ability in the Beach Brutus Kit that allows you to regenerate shields without needing to consume Shield Potions, which provides a huge boost in any combat situation, and you can also spawn Henchmen to assist in battle.</p>



<p>The downside, however, is that transforming into a boss like Beach Brutus will permanently mark your location to nearby players in a more precise manner than Medallions have done in previous Chapters and Seasons.</p>



<p>In terms of weapons, Beach Brutus drops The Brutus’ Twin Hammer Shotguns, a Mythic weapon that has a much faster reload speed than the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-Mythic variant</a>. While they have a limited range, they are extremely lethal and can either be fired at the same time, or individually.</p>



<p>Finally, defeating Beach Brutus will also drop a Chug Jug, a valuable item that restores both Health and Shields—and it’s even more useful with the boosted amounts you’ll receive of both when transformed into the boss.</p>

<p>A new Chapter in Fortnite means new bosses to track down and defeat, but finding the specific boss locations is tricky if you don’t know where to look. Fortunately, this guide can direct you straight to Human Bill.</p>



<p>Human Bill is one of three bosses in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, offering powerful items when defeated that can change the course of a match and put you on course to secure victory, but the blue alien can be tough to track down.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has detailed where to find Human Bill in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, along with the loot offered once defeated.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-human-bill-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">Where to Find Human Bill in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The hunt is on. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Human Bill does not have a single set spawn in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, and can instead appear in several locations across the map.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite has adopted travelling bosses with varying spawns in the past, including in The Simpsons mini-season, and it seems this mechanic will remain. Although it can be frustrating if you want to farm the boss, it does make every match more interesting with no single set spawn that all players can flock to.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of where Human Bill can be encountered in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ripped Tides</li>



<li>Classified Canyon</li>



<li>Painted Palms</li>



<li>South/East of Wonkeeland</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for Human Bill, the areas around Wonkeeland are a good place to start, particularly Sunset Falls. The benefit of starting your search here is that Painted Palms, another potential spawn location for Human Bill, is a short distance away if you’re unsuccessful in your initial search.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-human-bill-loot-drops-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Human Bill Loot Drops in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>The most important loot dropped by Human Bill in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is the boss transform item, transforming you into Human Bill and providing a special ability.</strong></p>



<p>Human Bill’s Kit can be activated for Low Gravity for a short period, making traversal to hard-to-reach places much easier and providing a quick escape. Transforming into Human Bill also provides an increased bar for Health and Shields, making you tough to beat.</p>



<p>Beware, though, as transforming into a boss will permanently mark your exact location to nearby players, in a more precise manner than Medallions have done in previous Chapters and Seasons.</p>



<p>Weapon-wise, defeating Human Bill drops Human Bill’s Arc-Lightning Gun, a Mythic version of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new weapon introduced this season</a>. It takes significantly longer to overheat, making it easier to defeat enemies without needing to switch weapons or wait for the Arc-Lightning Gun to cool down.</p>



<p>Finally, Human Bill also drops a Chug Jug when defeated, which is always a useful item but is even more so when transformed into a boss, as it restores the higher amount of Health and Shield you have earned.</p>
