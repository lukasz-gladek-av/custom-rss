<p>After years of waiting, The Division 2 is getting a survival mode called Survivors is coming in 2026. Announced at Gamescom, the team at Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment showed off some of the new mode.</p>



<p>Since its release in 2019, The Division 2 has been going strong with new updates and expansions. Earlier yesterday, the team laid out the roadmap for Year 7, with plans for two new updates. Beyond that, as revealed today, a whole new way to play will be what fans have been asking for for quite some time.</p>

<p>While a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/division-2-project-gamescom-reveal-panels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tease earlier this month</a> did hint at it, it has now been confirmed that The Division 2 will get a Survival Extraction mode. Called The Division 2: Survivors, the project is in early development with Magnus Jansén directing. However, in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/enWR3N37m6wAbtZbV4nuA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> on the official page of the game, executive producer Julian Gerighty released a statement, saying:</p>



<p><strong>“The Division 2: Survivors is as much your baby as it is ours, and we strive for transparency during its development,”</strong> Gerighty states. <strong>“Clear communication and community involvement are a focus as we build the new experience, and we will be closely involving you as we move forward on the development journey.”</strong></p>



<p>Concept art of the mode, including Survivors’ logo, can be found on the blog, as well. We see some familiar landmarks in Washington, DC, all dusted in snow. Given how the base game plays, it’ll be interesting to see how the mode comes out. Still, it seems like it may be far off in terms of release. However, the team sounds positive that it will live up to expectations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Super Meat Boy 3D is just as frustrating, just as hair-pulling and soul-destroying, and just as fun as the original—maybe more. Super Meat Boy Forever shifted the focus from freedom and autonomy to auto-running, a move that proved divisive. Super Meat Boy 3D gives you back control and adds more dynamic gameplay, and I had a blast playing it at Gamescom 2025 in an early Super Meat Boy 3D preview.</p>



<p>Everything you play Super Meat Boy for is here: Trap-filled levels, instant restarts, and an embarrassingly high death counter. The foundation of the game remains the same, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-meatboy-3d-revealed-at-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Meat Boy 3D</a>‘s new perspective is a total shift. The game maintains a constant 45-degree side angle, and Sluggerfly and Team Meat have devised a new way to create chaos, which ironically puts things into perspective.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-deadly-good-time">A Deadly Good Time</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beat the game without dying, I dare you. Credit to Head Up Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>My experience of the original <a href="https://sluggerfly.com/smb3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Super Meat Boy</a> and other difficult platformers lulled me into a false sense of security early on when I played the demo. I completed the first two or three stages without dying, but I was bracing myself for the inevitable, brutal storm—which arrived very quickly.</p>



<p>More mechanics were introduced, more dangers were thrown at me, and the death count shot up quicker than a person out of bed with a delivery driver at the door. Like I said, it’s still Super Meat Boy. But the 3D element is fascinating and genuinely creates a whole new way to play the game. You can run around obstacles, and you need to be more precise than ever.</p>



<p>There’s also more happening on screen. Where the original would generally throw individual dangers at you, SMB 3D requires you to survey the area, see which traps are hidden, and plan ahead—all at the same time. You can face several dangers in one passage of time. The platforming itself remains as tight and intricate as ever, and levels require multiple playthroughs to beat (let alone master).</p>



<p>I describe the Super Meat Boy games as a constant learning curve. The difficulty is always scaling. The first few levels were an obvious indicator of this, but whenever I died, I wanted to start over straight away. The controls and setup—from what I played—are the same, and it’s largely a one-button game. The same input allows SMB to jump, wall jump, etc, but the Dash from Super Meat Boy Forever returns!</p>



<p>This simple maneuver gives you a buffer to clear long spaces or help you if you mistime a jump, but it’s also a crucial move required to string together sequences of jumps, falls, dashes (and even more deaths).</p>



<p>3D also brings the world to life in new ways. Aside from the on-screen action, I had fun checking out the extended scenery. It adds more character, quality, and polish to an addictive gameplay loop. Super Meat Boy 3D’s original identity is back, but refreshed in a simple yet effective way. It’s going to be an instant buy from me when it comes out, and I can’t wait to see what other traps and terrors the development team adds to the game before launch.</p>
