<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is confirmed as the largest game in the franchise’s history, at a whopping 123.2 GB in size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows game size was revealed through its listing on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/assassins-creed-shadows/id6497794841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mac App Store</a>. The title can be pre-ordered now for $69.99. Players will need macOS 14.0 or later and a Mac with an Apple M1 chip or later to play the game. The 123.2 GB file size is the largest in the franchise’s history, more than double that of recent instalments like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla or Odyssey, which needed around 50 GB and 45 GB only, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With such a massive file size for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players will expect Ubisoft to go all out on the game. The visual fidelity and attention to detail should be second to no past Assassin’s Creed title if the game size exceeds the previous instalments by that much. If you are wondering about Assassin’s Creed Shadows PC system requirements, check out the details <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Players should note that SSD storage with 123.2 GB of free space is mandatory for any preset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is an upcoming historical, open-world action-adventure by Ubisoft set in Feudal Japan. Players will experience this adventure through the eyes of 2 characters: Naoe, a shinobi Assassin and Yasuke, a legendary samurai. Both characters feature distinct playstyles. Naoe is more stealthy and agile, whereas Yasuke is the tank responsible for dealing the heavy blows. If you are interested in the game, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Mac on March 20, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ art book recently leaked online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-artwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on an 18+ website</a>, showcasing new art for the game. Also, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shaodws-censored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graphic content will be censored in Japan</a>.

<p>Iron Galaxy Studios—known for Rumbleverse and bringing The Last of Us to PC—has let go of 66 employees in what the company has called a “last resort”.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7292952527195516929/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>, the studio says that it has been “making sacrifices” in order to keep its team together. Unfortunately, those efforts haven’t been able to keep things sustainable leading to the moves being made.</p>



<p>“It has been our hope that we could emerge from this long winter alongside all the teammates who have come to work with us over the years,” they said. “Today, we’re making the unfortunate announcement that we have run out of room to maneuver amidst this slow recovery.</p>



<p>“Today, Iron Galaxy is parting ways with some of our developers and support staff. In total, we have reduced our employee base by 66 people. This was a means of last resort for us. It’s a measure we do not take lightly to enable our long-term survival.”</p>



<p>The latest employment numbers put Iron Galaxy Studios at <a href="https://www.builtinchicago.org/company/iron-galaxy-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">270 employees</a>. The 66 employees account for nearly 25% of the companies workforce. </p>



<p>The studio says it’s still “committed to serving” its partners in game development. They are also going to look for “new ways to support” the industry.</p>



<p>“At this moment, our focus is on our teammates who have begun a journey toward their next role,” they added. “We thank them for working with us. We’ll be doing everything we can to support them in the search for the next phase of their careers.:</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-provide-real-energy-for-fc-and-madden-says-ea/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-might-provide-%E2%80%98real-energy%E2%80%99-for-fc-and-madden-says-ea.1101177/</guid>

<p>EA recently stated that franchises like Madden and FC might find ‘real energy’ on a platform like Nintendo Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-madden-and-fc-might-find-real-energy-on-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, EA CEO Andrew Wilson was asked whether Nintendo Switch 2 is a platform they are focusing on during a recent earnings call. Wilson replied that a new console arriving in the marketplace is a “benefit” for them as it allows them to “acquire new players.” Wilson added that EA’s franchises have “typically” performed well on Nintendo’s platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EA CEO then discussed some of their most popular franchises, EA FC and Madden, stating that products like those could “find real energy” on the Nintendo Switch 2, “as they have done in the past.” Wilson also provided an example with The Sims and My Sims cozy bundle, explaining how it performed better than expectations, with “50% of all players” new to EA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EA revealed “nothing in our models at this juncture.” However, they expect that “anytime a great new console” hits the market, it will allow them to reach new players and communities, so they need an IP to benefit from that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EA Sports FC 24 is already available for purchase on the Nintendo Switch, and the next instalments of the franchise should arrive on the Switch 2. The fascinating addition would be Madden, as no games from that franchise have made it to Nintendo’s prized console. Also, it will be interesting to see if the platform can breathe new life into these franchises, as EA FC is struggling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, EA is working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-working-major-apex-legends-update-after-battlefield/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">significant Apex Legends update</a> that will arrive after the upcoming Battlefield, which is scheduled to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch before April 2026</a>. What are your thoughts on EA stating that Madden and FC might find ‘real energy’ on the Switch 2?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-superstar-zywoo-says-the-scene-misses-his-rivalry-with-s1mple/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cs2-superstar-zywoo-says-the-scene-misses-his-rivalry-with-s1mple.1101147/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-superstar-zywoo-says-the-scene-misses-his-rivalry-with-s1mple/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The rivalry between Counter-Strike superstars Mathieu “ZywOo” Erbeau and Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev is an era-defining one. As the game fully embraces a new CS2 era though, along with some new stars, the MVP of the final CS:GO Major says that his rivalry with s1mple is missed.</p>



<p>But not by him.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-zywoo-and-s1mple-dominated-counter-strike-together-for-four-years">ZywOo and s1mple dominated Counter-Strike together for four years</h2>



<p>In an interview with bo3.gg, <a href="https://bo3.gg/news/exclusive-zywoo-about-s1mple-absence-from-the-pro-scene-for-me-though-nothing-has-changed-donk-and-m0nesy-are-now-the-rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZywOo was asked</a> about his own rivalry with s1mple and how it compares with the rivalry between <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new stars Danil “donk” Kryshkovets and Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov</a>. ZywOo said that donk and m0NESY reminds him of great sports rivals like LeBron James and Michael Jordan, and Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>



<p>From 2019 to 2022, the rivalry between ZywOo and s1mple was on par with those sports greats. In all four of those years, the two owned the top two spots in HLTV’s Players of the Year list. ZywOo won in 2019 and 2020, and s1mple won in 2021 and 2022. S1mple won his Major first at PGL Stockholm 2021, but he slipped to number 7 in the 2023 players list. That year, ZywOo reclaimed the top spot and won his first Major at BLAST Paris.</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t say I miss it,” ZywOo said when asked about his rivalry with s1mple. “But I think the scene does. He brought so much to the game.”</p>



<p>Since the release of CS2, the player regarded as the GOAT of CS:GO has not managed to find the same level of success. After CS2 came out, he took some extended time off, as he was unhappy with the state of the game. While away from NAVI, the team won the first CS2 Major without him, which he says <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/38871/s1mple-on-return-navi-won-the-major-so-some-plans-have-changed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“changed plans”</a> for his return. He stood in for Team Falcons early in 2024, then re-joined the team on loan from NAVI to close out the 2024, but is now back on NAVI’s reserve roster.</p>



<p>Even if s1mple never returns to the top echelon again, the way ZywOo says his rival pushed him to be better as laid a foundation for new rivalries to blossom. But hopefully, the story of their rivalry doesn’t end here.</p>
