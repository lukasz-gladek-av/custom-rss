<p>This weekend’s round of Call of Duty League matches unfolded in a typical fashion, with the teams that you’d expect walking away with their heads held high. Toronto Ultra is the only organisation to remain unbeaten during the Major I qualifiers, and Atlanta FaZe is still trying to claw its way up the standings after a miserable season opening.</p>



<p>One team that shone this weekend was OpTic Texas, which now sits on a 5-1 record for the stage after punishing LA Thieves and the Vegas Falcons this weekend. The match against LAT was something special.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-record-you-want">Not The Record You Want</h2>



<p>The OpTic Texas v. LA Thieves fixture was nothing short of chaotic, opening with OpTic 100-clubbing LAT in a round of Hardpoint on Hacienda. During this match, LAT’s Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst secured a record he’s probably not too proud of. He became the first player in Call of Duty League history to land less than 1000 damage on a single round of HP.</p>



<p>By the time the dust had settled, he’d produced a kill-death ratio of 6 – 19, marking his place in history with one of the worst performances since the CDL debuted in 2020. </p>



<p>He took it in jest, though:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Map 1. 6 kills, 750 dmg. 10 miles ran.</span></p></article></div>







<p>As the match unfolded, it looked as though the LA Thieves found their footing and secured wins in the first round of Search and the game of Control, but OpTic Texas held firm. The second Hardpoint, which took place on Skyline, was a relatively easy win for OpTic, and during game five, something monumental occurred.</p>



<p>From a 5 – 1 lead, LAT crumbled, being reverse-swept by OpTic Texas. In the final round, Kenny clutched a 1v2 finish that was nothing short of spectacular, netting the win and the much-needed COD points that almost guarantee a top seed for the team at Major I.</p>



<p>We’ve got one more regular weekend of CDL action before Major I arrives. It’s the first CDL Major to take place in Europe, and it’ll unravel in Madrid from January 30 to February 2.</p>



<p>I’ll be on location for the whole weekend with Insider Gaming – so keep an eye open for the hottest coverage from the CDL.</p>

<p>The World Series of Warzone Global Finals unravelled in Las Vegas in September 2024, with hundreds of thousands of people tuning in to catch the battle royale action unfold. As the biggest tournament in the Warzone space, it naturally attracts the most prolific competitors, and it bears a $950,000 prize pool.</p>



<p>Recently, a claim surfaced on social media from Biffle, the Team Falcons player who was part of the trio that won the Global Finals. The group scooped a $300,000 prize, but according to Biffle, ‘around 20 people’ (including him) still haven’t been paid more than four months later.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-debt-owed">A Debt Owed</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/DiazBiffle/status/1881038922114879847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Biffle wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Its been 4 months since WSOW and there is probably around 20 people that haven’t been paid out that I know of (including my $100,000). No one is answering the email that was provided to us for WSOW support. Completely unacceptable and unprofessional.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Biffle, Soka, and Shifty claimed the $300,000 prize at the World Series of Warzone Global Finals just two months after winning the top prize in the Warzone category at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>For a while, there have been concerns regarding Activision’s stance on battle royale-based esports events, and for a few months, it has seemed like the scene is wavering and perhaps preparing to fade away. Presently, nobody has any idea what this year’s competitive ecosystem looks like for the World Series of Warzone.</p>



<p>Biffle has gone public with his concerns, and rightly so. To be missing out on a $100,000 payment is ludicrous, and it shows a lack of integrity that could forever mar Activision’s competitive Warzone ecosystem.</p>



<p>In a follow-up comment, UnRationaL, who secured the second-place spot behind Biffle’s team, said that he’s still waiting on a $53,000 payment.</p>



<p>There are no indications that the Call of Duty League teams have their payments held for so long when they win a Major or COD Champs, so why is Warzone being forgotten about by Activision and Microsoft?</p>

<p>TikTok has stated that their services will return online following the services ban earlier today.</p>



<p>The statement came from the official X (formerly Twitter) account of TikTok, which reads:</p>



<p>“In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive.”</p>



<p>They continued, “It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.”</p>



<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/us-tiktok-ban-statement-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok was forced to limit its service</a> to US residents following the United States’ decision to ban the app due to “safety and security concerns.” Other countries, including the UK have said that they would not follow the US in banning the app, despite widespread reports that US allies may impose similar bans.</p>



<p>Darren Jones, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in the UK said cats and dancing videos do not “seem like a national security threat.”</p>



<p>TikTok’s ban was said to impact some 170 million users who use the social media app, with tens of thousands of content creators and small business using it as a source of revenue.</p>



<p>The ban also meant that Marvel Snap, the competitive digital collectible card game developed by Second Dinner, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also banned in the US</a>. Second Dinner, who said they had no idea about the ban, is yet to comment on when Marvel Snap will return to US residents. </p>
