<p>The Apex Legends live service wagon just keeps rolling along, consistently bringing out new battle passes and content to keep players coming back time and time again. Up next is Apex Legends Season 27.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-apex-legends-season-26-fuse-mad-maggie-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 26, titled Showdown</a>, Apex Legends brought in a new permanent game mode called Wildcard, focusing on faster gameplay and chaos. It also added amps, which make a new way to augment your team in tough situations. Now, it’s time to look to the future.</p>



<p>Here is everything we know about Apex Legends Season 27.</p>

<p><strong>While there is not an official release date announced for Apex Legends 27 as of this writing, leaks are suggesting that the update will happen on November 5.</strong></p>



<p>Of course, things can easily change between the information that leakers get and an official announcement, but typically, this does line up with the usual release for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-expected-decline-further-few-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a> seasons, which last about three months.</p>







<p><strong>You should expect the update for Apex Legends Season 27 to go live around 10 AM PT / 12 PM CT / 1 PM ET / 7 PM GMT on November 5.</strong></p>



<p>This is the usual time that seasons go live in the game, unless, of course, there are setbacks in the server maintenance or possibly delays.</p>



<h2 id="h-leaked-content-in-apex-legends-season-27">Leaked Content in Apex Legends Season 27</h2>



<p>The biggest leaked content that people are talking about in the upcoming Apex Legends Season 27 is a second Olympus. According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KptWKFHZI3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apex Legends leaker HYPERMYST</a>, there will soon be new screens displayed around the Olympus map that say, “Discovery on Pagos: Another Olympus?” If you ping that screen, your character will have a unique voiceline mentioning the scary prospect of a second copied city appearing out of nowhere.</p>



<p>So what does the second Olympus mean for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-launches-on-nintendo-switch-2-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a>? We highly doubt that this will be an additional map added to the rotation. Instead, the current version of Olympus might be getting a significant rework, this time receiving a lot of ice theming considering the mention of Pagos. A potential in-game event could follow it.</p>



<p>Outside of the second Olympus, HYPERMYST also says that the Sentinel will be getting a reactive skin, and Bangalore, Lifeline, and the Hemlock will be getting legendaries in the battle pass. There is also <a href="https://x.com/Osatou_Apex/status/1976969684949074254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">footage of dual-wield blades</a> coming to the game alongside the new season.</p>



<p>As of this writing, that is all we know about the Apex Legends Season 27 update. Expect some official announcements to be coming very soon.</p>

<p>Like many other live service games, everyone is always looking forward to the next season of content, so we continue the cycle with Marvel Rivals Season 5.</p>



<p>In Season 4, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-showcases-daredevils-duelist-moves-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daredevil</a> and Angela were both added to the playable roster, adding to the already expansive set of heroes in the duelist and vanguard classes.</p>



<p>Here is when you can expect Marvel Rivals Season 5 to begin.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-5-release-date-and-time">Marvel Rivals Season 5 Release Date and Time</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Wolverine is ready for some old friends to join the party. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals Season 5 will begin on November 14 at the usual start time of 2 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>The date has been confirmed by <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1974142618360570254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NetEase as of the release of the Season 4.5 roadmap</a>, which notches that day as&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below is a table that goes over the release in major time zones.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-coming-in-marvel-rivals-season-5">What is Coming in Marvel Rivals Season 5?</h2>



<p><strong>As of this writing, there is no official announcement of the new content coming in Marvel Rivals Season 5, but various leaks, rumors, and in-game references point to Gambit and Rogue being added to the hero roster. Leaks suggest Gambit is a duelist and Rogue is a specialist.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Additionally, </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cross-progression-season-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>cross-progression</strong></a><strong> is making its full debut for all players after some have been able to test it in Season 4.5.</strong></p>



<p>With Gambit and Rogue being such a powerhouse couple being added to the game, the theme for Season 5 is rumored to be focused on romance and love. An interesting theme to take considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> had the Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman wedding day skins and event, which was held earlier this year.</p>



<p>The Season 4 Gallery Card also teases an upcoming tournament being held by Shou-Lou, who is directly linked to the new K’un-Lun map. With this map just recently being added, we would be surprised for another to be added so soon, so this tournament might be a new in-game mode, potentially something similar to Overwatch 2’s Stadium Mode, which was introduced in that game earlier this year.</p>



<p>That is just about all we have heard for possible content coming to Season 5, but knowing NetEase, there will be some surprises in store, including new skins, especially themed around romance.</p>

<p>If a new Nintendo patent is true, we may be seeing DS games on the Nintendo Switch 2 soon.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, the Nintendo Switch 2 has become one of Nintendo’s best-selling consoles. With its catalog growing each month, with the latest being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-preview-the-new-battle-system-could-become-the-new-standard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, there’s a lot to enjoy. For those who pine for the past, the Nintendo Switch Online brings a treasure trove of classic titles from the Game Boy and N64. Even with the most recent addition, Virtual Boy, being outside the box, it seems it may get ever crazier and cooler, thanks to a newly discovered patent.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-ds-games-may-be-next-for-nintendo-switch-online-with-new-patent">Nintendo DS Games May Be Next for Nintendo Switch Online With New Patent</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo DS coming to NSO Confirmed! Patent Discovery of a lifetime! Breaking News!

<p>In a post from user <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1978839968895074613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MikeOdysseyYT</a>, they discovered a new patent from Nintendo. The images they provided show the Nintendo Switch drawn up to have a second screen show up during gameplay. What’s interesting is that each image correlates to one of the ways you could do a dual screen, like picture-in-picture and dual screen. While it could just be for new mechanics, it’s more than likely that it’s a possible way to bring Nintendo DS titles to the console. </p>



<p>For many, the Nintendo DS was home to dozens of amazing titles and one of the coolest ways to experience a game. If true, it’ll be interesting to see how it plays in action. Most games on the DS used the second screen for a map or, in Pokémon’s case, the action menu. Given it’ll likely be all Nintendo-branded titles, they’ll likely tweak some things here and there to make it look good, much like they did for the other NSO games. As it is a patent, nothing is yet confirmed by Nintendo, so be wary.</p>

<p>According to information that wasn’t part of the leaks earlier this week, Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave will have a turn-based battle system. </p>



<p>For those living under a rock, The Pokémon Company and Game Freak have experienced a massive leak, with tons of data about their upcoming games surfacing. We already have an idea about Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story, setting</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mechanics</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-reveals-boss-fight-and-mmo-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boss fight, and MMO details</a>. Now, new details about Gen 10’s battle system have surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-legends-z-a-s-real-time-battle-system-might-not-make-it-to-gen-10-wind-and-wave">Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s Real-Time Battle System Might Not Make it to Gen 10 Wind and Wave</h2>



<p>According to a new post by CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978632737541271993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), some of the information that wasn’t a part of the Teraleak has now surfaced online, revealing details about Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave’s battle system. The post explicitly states that “the game is turn-based,” and if players like the new real-time battle system in Legends Z-A and want it to return for the next mainline instalment, then they should let the devs know. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We have some new information about Pokémon Wind and Wave that wasn't part of the Teraleak documents released this week:</p><p>– The feature to ride all Pokémon has been scaled down significantly<br>– The character bios / story have changed a lot<br>– The game is turn based, if you enjoy the…</p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978632737541271993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The post also discusses another feature from the Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave leaks. The leaks had stated that all Pokémon could be ridden or touched; however, the new update states that the feature to ride all Pokémon has been scaled down significantly. Lastly, there’s another point in the post which states that character bios/story have changed a lot. </p>



<p>In other news, the leaks have also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed the roadmap</a> for upcoming Pokémon games until 2030.
