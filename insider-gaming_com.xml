<p>It seems that ID Software might be returning to one of the most famous franchises under its belt, Quake. </p>



<p>The Quake series is one of the most popular franchises in gaming, redefining how the industry approaches first-person shooters. However, it’s been a very long time since we saw a new Quake instalment, with the latest being Quake Champions, along with some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quake-2-remaster-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enhanced versions of older titles</a>, so it’s high time we received a new game. </p>







<h2 id="h-id-software-rumoured-to-return-to-quake-or-hexen">ID Software Rumoured to Return to Quake or Hexen</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, which talks about Xbox’s plans in 2026, discusses the rumours about ID Software returning to Quake or Hexen, as Microsoft now owns all the rights to both franchises. There’s a chance that we could hear about these games at Bethesda’s Quakecon event; however, if it is a big reveal, then it might be featured during the Xbox Showcase. Regardless, players should take this information with a grain of salt, as it’s just a rumour. </p>



<p>As mentioned above, the last Quake game was Quake Champions, a free-to-play title that was released in 2022. However, the previous mainline Hexen game was Hexen 2, released in 1997. At the last QuakeCon, definitive versions of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders and Hexen: Beyond Heretic were released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Switch. However, we haven’t received a new mainline instalment in close to three decades. </p>







<p>In other news, Doom: The Dark Ages was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-biggest-launch-id-software-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest launch</a> in ID Software’s history.

<p>A report about the next Xbox has surfaced online, and it seems that it will heavily lean into the Windows experience. </p>



<p>We were informed late last year that Windows 11 would receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/windows-11-xbox-full-screen-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full-screen support</a> for the Xbox App, allowing players to easily switch between desktop and Xbox’s “full-screen experience” when playing games. It seems that Microsoft will be leveraging the same technology for its next Xbox console. </p>







<h2 id="h-next-xbox-console-s-only-difference-from-a-traditional-pc-is-the-ability-to-run-xbox-one-and-series-x-s-games">Next Xbox Console’s Only Difference from a Traditional PC is the Ability to Run Xbox One and Series X/S Games</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Central</a> provides a lot of details on what to expect from Xbox in 2026, revealing exciting details about the upcoming console. The report shows that the plan to run “full bore Windows” on the next Xbox console has remained the same. Thanks to their partnership with AMD, this console’s interface will be delivered through the “Full Screen Experience” in the Xbox PC app, and Microsoft is hard at work to make the app capable of executing it. </p>



<p>The report says that the main difference between the next Xbox console and a traditional PC is the ability to run Xbox One and Series X/S, allowing players to bring forward their existing libraries to the next-gen console. The Xbox President has also confirmed that the next console will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-consoles-backwards-compatible-ai-enhance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backwards compatible</a> and will be enhanced with AI. The report also discusses “credible rumors” about an OEM “Xbox” PC in 2026; however, players are asked to treat this information with caution until it is properly verified.</p>







<p>Earlier last year, Corden had already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-not-a-console-at-all-insider/">stated</a> that the next Xbox console would lean more towards a PC experience, stating “a PC in essence but with a TV-friendly shell that also has a specific set of specs in mind.’ Xbox President Sarah Bond has also stated that they are hard at work developing their next-generation hardware and that it will be a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-double-down-powerful-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">powerful experience</a>“. </p>

<p>The layoffs across the video game industry are getting started early in 2026. Ubisoft has announced the closure of Ubisoft Halifax.</p>



<p>The closure will see 71 people lose their jobs.</p>







<p>The news of the studio’s shutdown comes just days after it was announced that 61 of the studio’s employees joined the Game &amp; Media Workers Guild of Canada, Local 30111. The certification for the union came on December 18, 2025, and was branded as the Ubisoft Workers of Canada, Halifax.</p>



<p>In a statement, Ubisoft says that decision comes after two years of “company-wide actions to streamline operations”.</p>



<p><strong>“Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs,” </strong>the company said. <strong>“As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. </strong></p>



<p>“<strong>We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance.”</strong></p>







<p>The decision, Ubisoft claims, was made “well before” the staff unionized. Ubisoft added that it respected its employees right to join a union. Insider Gaming has reached out for a statement from members of the Union. Should that be received, it will be added to this story. </p>



<p>Prior to its closure, Ubisoft Halifax was working on mobile games for Rainbow Six and Assassin’s Creed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long-rumored StarCraft shooter looks set to be revealed this year. </p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden at Windows Central</a>, the StarCraft third-person shooter is “likely” to be revealed at BlizzCon 2026 in September.</p>







<p>“The headline for BlizzCon 2026 is most likely going to be&nbsp;StarCraft,” Corden writes. “It was&nbsp;previously reported that StarCraft is getting the third-person shooter treatment, and I confirmed these rumors true via my own sources a while back.”</p>



<p>As mentioned, rumors of this new game are nothing new. As far back as September 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-starcraft-shooter-in-development-at-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported</a> on this new title, which first came from Jason Schreier. It was mentioned as being in development in his latest book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725429/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future Of Blizzard Entertainment</a>, and former Far Cry head Dan Hay was leading the team.</p>



<p>No other details about this game are known at this point, but to hear it’s still moving forward has to be excited for fans of the franchise. Of course, this isn’t the first time Blizzard is attempting a shooter based on the StarCraft franchise. </p>







<p>Back in 2002, Blizzard announced StarCraft: Ghost, a stealth-action shooter. Eventually, the game was put on an “indefinite hold” in March 2006 before being canceled. </p>



<p>Overall, there hasn’t been a new release in the StarCraft universe since StarCraft: Remastered in 2017. The last new original release was StarCraft 2 in 2010.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mysterious Fallout Countdown Isn’t Related to Fallout 3 Remake, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-3-remake-not-linked-to-mysterious-countdown/</link>
            <guid>1399441</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re at all invested in the Fallout space, you’ll have heard about the ‘mysterious countdown’ that’s running on the Amazon Prime platform. It’s set to expire when the last episode of the Fallout TV show’s second season drops on February 4. From the moment the countdown popped up, fans have believed it to be counting down to a reveal of the Fallout 3 remake.</p>



<p>However, a new report from a notable source has suggested this <strong>is not the case</strong>. It’s not counting down to a shadow drop or announcement of the Fallout 3 remake, <strong>but </strong>the project <strong>is </strong>on the way.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-3-remake-is-coming-but-nobody-knows-when">Fallout 3 Remake is Coming, But Nobody Knows When</h2>



<p>In a new and extensive report from Windows Central, the future of Xbox and the many studios under the gaming titan’s banner was explored. It’s a huge year for ‘Team Green’, and several high-profile anniversaries promise some sizeable announcements should be lined up.</p>



<p>Fans of the post-apocalyptic series from Bethesda Game Studios have been expecting a reveal of the Fallout 3 remake for quite some time. However, despite references to the project being found in documents some years ago, <strong>nothing concrete </strong>has been announced by the studio.</p>



<p>That might be about to change soon, but what’s suspected to be the biggest indicator of an impending announcement has been <strong>debunked</strong>.</p>



<p>In Jez Corden’s <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent supersized breakdown</a> of what’s coming in the Xbox space, the insider stressed that the Fallout countdown running on the Amazon Prime site is <strong>not </strong>related to a Fallout 3 remake announcement.</p>



<p>He wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m told this is not the case. However, we are&nbsp;<em>eventually&nbsp;</em>getting a Fallout 3 remake in the vein of&nbsp;Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not clear when Bethesda Game Studios plans to announce the Fallout 3 remake, but at this point, it’s almost guaranteed that it’ll be unveiled soon. In the last couple of years, the Fallout TV show, updates to Fallout 4, and the ongoing expansion of Fallout 76 have all combined to push franchise sentiments sky-high.</p>
