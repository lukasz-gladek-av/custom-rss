<p>You can grab DayZ for free as part of Sony’s PlayStation Plus Monthly Games scheme for August 2025. The promotion has seen a huge surge in players and given Bohemia Interactive cause for celebration.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-new-in-dayz-1-72-heres-the-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DayZ</a> is still popular on multiple platforms all these years later. Its 2019 launch on PS4 and Xbox One gave the MMO multiple platforms to scare the pants off players on. By being a free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-headlines-augusts-free-playstation-plus-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS Plus game in August 2025</a>, newbies are getting to find out what the fuss is all about.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Outstanding. Credit to Bohemia Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>The DayZ <a href="https://x.com/DayZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page reports that “DayZ has been claimed by 1.3 million new players through PlayStation Plus monthly games.” This doesn’t mean everyone is playing it, but over one million game libraries are now infected with DayZ fever.</p>



<p>Continuing: “On Day 1 alone, over 300,000 freshies arrived in Chernarus and Livonia.” </p>



<p>This means nearly a quarter of the people who downloaded DayZ hopped into the game straightaway. Combine this figure with all platforms, and it had over 650,000 players at once.</p>



<p>The sudden influx of players did cause some significant stress on the game’s servers. Despite adding over 300 new servers, the post had to apologize for server issues.</p>



<p>Still, this is a great accomplishment, and many more will likely find the drive to survive.</p>



<div><article><p><span>📢Good news, survivors!
DayZ has been claimed by 1.3 million new players through PlayStation Plus monthly games. On Day 1 alone, over 300,000 freshies arrived in Chernarus and Livonia.
We hope you’ve already met some friendly survivors out there.

<p>Gears of War: Reloaded brings the OG Gears game into 2025. But it’s not to be confused with Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, and the differences between the two releases are very different.</p>



<p>From the outside, Gears of War’s Ultimate Edition and Reloaded are very similar. They’re both updated versions of the 2006 classic. There’s a 10-year difference between the two releases. But you’re probably wondering to yourself: What’s included in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> that can’t be found in the Ultimate Edition?</p>



<p>It’s a good question. I’ve already answered another burning query: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-games-does-gears-of-war-reloaded-include/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Which games does Gears of War: Reloaded include?</a> So let’s now run through each version and what to expect.</p>

<p>Hell froze over the day <a href="https://www.gearsofwar.com/games/gears-reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reloaded</a> was announced. Xbox and PC players getting to play it wasn’t a surprise, but a Gears title coming to PS5? It’s a sign of the times and how the era of exclusives and first-party media is coming to an end.</p>



<p>Reloaded is coming out on PS5 the same day as Xbox and PC—August 26. Again, crossplay is a great asset for speedier matchmaking and great interconnectivity. The Ultimate Edition can’t be purchased on PlayStation, but Reloaded sure can.</p>



<h3 id="h-reloaded-is-a-remake-not-a-remaster">Reloaded is a Remake, Not a Remaster</h3>



<p>The two words are fairly interchangeable, but there is a big difference between the two. A remaster is the same content but with shinier visuals, whereas a remake upgrades the visuals, but also includes new features and might make the odd tweak to a map, gun, or sometimes even the story.</p>



<p>From what I understand, the narrative is unchanged—which is good for those seeking purity. But expect subtle differences here and there.</p>



<h3 id="h-updated-graphics">Updated Graphics</h3>



<p>The Ultimate Edition was released in 2015 and boasted 1080p / Full HD / 30 FPS for the campaign and 60 FPS for multiplayer. This was impressive at the time, but it seems cute now.</p>



<p>Gears of War: Reloaded comes locked and loaded with 4K, HDR, VRR, and 120 FPS. The difference in graphical fidelity is massive and a serious upgrade, even if you played the Ultimate Edition. </p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-play-gears-of-war-reloaded-if-you-own-gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Should You Play Gears of War: Reloaded if You Own Gears of War: Ultimate Edition?</h2>



<p><strong>If you love the first GOW game, I’d still recommend playing Gears of War: Reloaded if you’ve purchased the Ultimate Edition before.</strong></p>



<p>I’m the kind of person who buys remasters of remasters—don’t judge me. If I love a game enough, I find new excuses to play it again. Reloaded’s content is <em>mostly</em> the same as the Ultimate Edition. It has all the fun DLC included, too.</p>



<p>The major improvement Ultimate Edition owners will experience is the graphics and performance. I think these are reasons enough to play Reloaded.</p>



<p>Notice how I’ve said “play” instead of “buy” throughout this guide? This is because if you’ve owned the Ultimate Edition before, you might be entitled to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-gears-of-war-reloaded-free-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Gears of War: Reloaded upgrade</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>I hope I’ve cleared up the key differences between Gears of War: Ultimate Edition and Reloaded. If you know of any more, let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6’s Portal mode has been designed to make the game feel fresh “years after you first picked it up”. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-portal-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Battlefield Portal was returning to the main series this year, and we finally got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-upgrade-players-build-own-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmation</a> during BF6’s multiplayer reveal. The new Portal mode puts the tools for creating in the hands of players, allowing them to craft custom and unique experiences. Now, developers have revealed the philosophy behind the Portal mode. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-portal-mode-is-for-players-that-want-to-do-more-than-completing-a-game">Battlefield 6’s Portal Mode is For Players That Want to Do More than Completing a Game</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/battlefield-6-devs-explain-portal-map-maker-absolutely-essential-for-modern-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, UX director Alan Pimm revealed some new insights for BF6’s Portal mode. Pimm first spoke about how the developers are looking to improve the Portal from 2042. The mode had several “clever tools,” such as scripting your own AI, customising the mode to your preferences, and more. They realised that people want terrain options, where they can pick different bits and not just their modes, and also manipulate and play with them. </p>



<p>Pimm goes on to say that the new Battlefield 6 Portal creations can be certified as modes in their own right, such as a “locked weapons mode”. However, if players try to make an XP farm for themselves, they will be told, “Actually, you won’t get XP from this one”, along with other warnings in the Editor.  </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Pimm elaborates that players don’t want a game they can complete, they want to grow with it, evolve with it or “make their dreams come true”. Battlefield 6’s Portal mode was designed with one philosophy in mind: longevity. The developers want to make the game feel fresh, “years after you first picked it up”. </p>



<p>Pimm concluded, stating that some players play for only an hour, while others play for 8 hours straight. These tools will cater to all types of players, “listen to the whole community, and make it accessible to do as much as possible.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98battlefield-6-game-servers-full%E2%80%99-40-000-players-are-waiting-for-the-beta-to-start.1263375/</guid>

<p>If this isn’t the biggest indication of how excited fans are for the Battlefield 6 beta to start, I don’t know what is. As I write this, more than 40,000 players are sitting in a queue to play the beta, being met with nothing more than a ‘Game Servers Full’ message on Battlefield 6’s title screen.</p>



<p>The number has skyrocketed in the last couple of hours, and it’s easy to see it hitting six figures soon enough. The first portion of the Battlefield 6 beta starts tomorrow, let’s just hope that the ‘Game Servers Full’ message disappears…</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-join-the-queue">Join the Queue</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is set to erupt this weekend as the beta welcomes millions of players (probably). From the multiplayer reveal last week to the countless leaks we’ve seen surface on social media in the last few months, everything is shaping up in Electronic Arts’ favor with Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Could this be the year it overtakes Call of Duty? The hype for Black Ops 7 couldn’t be lower right now.</p>



<p>If you open Battlefield 6 right now, you’ll be met with a message advising you: ‘Game Servers Full’. It’s not a representation of any technical error (I hope), but it’s more of a placeholder that’ll keep things contained and buttoned up until the beta goes live.</p>



<p>If nothing else, it’s entertaining to watch the number ebb and flow as more players attempt to open the Battlefield 6 beta, only to find it’s not live and they’ve got their timings wrong. Perhaps I need to get out more.</p>



<p>Here are a few handy resources if you’re sitting there and staring at the ‘Game Servers Full’ message:</p>

<p>The first round of the Battlefield 6 beta starts tomorrow at 08:00 UTC (1 AM PT). Have you got your squad ready? Let me know in the comments what role you’ll be playing.</p>
