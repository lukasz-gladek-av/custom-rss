<p>Electronic Arts (EA) is trying to ease concerns for employees about what could happen to their games if the planned sale to a group that includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) is finalized. </p>



<p>In a new SEC filing, first spotted by Stephen Totilo of <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, EA has updated its employee FAQ to answer numerous questions surrounding the proposed sale. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">specific section</a> regarding the culture at the company, EA says that its mission and values will <strong>“remain unchanged.”</strong> It adds that the company will <strong>“maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact.”</strong></p>



<p>The section continues, <strong>“We will continue to be guided by our cultural values of creativity, pioneering, passion, determination, learning, and teamwork,”</strong> and that “<strong>The Consortium is supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and our strong culture.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-other-changes-at-ea">What About Other Changes At EA?</h2>



<p>It’s not just control over projects and games that employees have had questions about. With the group that includes the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners taking on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-bioware-producer-suggests-ea-sell-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$20 billion in debt</a> for this deal, some were concerned about future growth and even layoffs.</p>



<p>To both points, EA, as of now, says there shouldn’t be any worry.</p>



<p><strong>“There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction,”</strong> EA says. </p>



<p>Regarding growth, the company says that they will continue to pursue “<strong>organic and inorganic growth opportunities as a private company, even with new debt”</strong> and that there is an expectation to invest in the business in order to <strong>“accelerate innovation.”</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$55 billion deal to sell</a> EA and take it private is expected to close sometime after the start of Q1 fiscal year 2027 (after March 31, 2026).</p>



<p>What do you think will happen when the sale of EA to the group led by the Saudi Arabia PIF is finalized next year?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new public beta for Obsidian Entertainment’s Pillars of Eternity has been announced to test a mode fans have been asking for. Furthermore, it’s open to everyone starting on November 5th.</p>



<p>Obsidian Entertainment has been in rare form in 2025. From Grounded to The Outer Worlds 2, the RPG-centric company has had quite the year. Fortunately, it hasn’t forgotten about its past, especially its Pillars of Eternity series. Inspired by Baldur’s Gate, the top-down RPG has gone on to have a sequel, Deadfire, and be the setting for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-so-far-about-avowed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> in Eora. One feature that fans of Deadfire got to try was turn-based combat, evolving the game’s stop-and-play style. After a tease this year, the team has announced that it’s coming to the original in beta form.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/eternity/public-beta-for-turn-based-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post from Obsidian</a>, it announced that Turn-Based Mode is coming to the original Pillars of Eternity. The mode, available via a public beta, is releasing on November 5th, 2025. You can see the gameplay in action <a href="https://youtu.be/_Mj6HObhD_8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">above</a>, but it seems the team wants to fix some of the snags it encountered during its incorporation into Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire. Combat feels a lot faster and accurate, which fans should enjoy. Luckily, if you want to test it out or change it, you can freely switch between regular and turn-based whenever. </p>



<p>For fans of Pillars of Eternity, this seems like the perfect time to return to the series. A third entry is unknown, as the previous two titles needed crowdfunding to come together. However, after Deadfire, Obsidian was bought by Microsoft, followed by The Outer Worlds and Pentiment. Perhaps this addition could lead to a franchise return? We shall see but, for now, this should do for fans and newcomers alike.</p>



<p>What do you think of Turn-Based Mode coming to Pillars of Eternity? Did you play the mode in Deadfire? Will you join the beta on November 5th? Would you like to see the series return?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>NetEase is closing one of its studios, just two years after it was first opened. </p>



<p>As per studio head Greg Street, Fantastic Pixel Castle will be shutting down as of November 17. It’s likely that the entirety of the staff at the studio will be made redundant.</p>



<p>“While there is still a chance we can secure funding after that date, it will depend on how much of the team remains,” Street said on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_fantastic-pixel-castle-will-close-its-doors-activity-7391147465636397057-0xA6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. “While we’d love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that’s at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there.”</p>



<p>Fantastic Pixel Castle was formed in 2023 by NetEase, and had been working on a triple-A fantasy MMO codenamed “Ghost”. Prior to heading Fantastic Pixel Castle, Street was a lead systems designer on World of Warcraft.</p>



<div><p>“To the literally dozens of people who reached out trying to help us raise capital, or through introductions to people who could, you humble me,” he continued. There is still a chance one of them works out, and it really only takes one. To our supporters at NetEase, thanks for taking a chance on us.</p><p>“For our team, I appreciate you coming with me on this journey, and let us hope we can continue to work together.”</p></div>



<p>The studio’s confirmed closure comes just weeks after Street first announced that NetEase was pulling funding from the studio. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_i-wanted-to-share-the-news-that-fantastic-activity-7382143103379587072-LfgX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">At the time</a>, he said that NetEase had been “gracious and supportive” while they looked for a new publisher. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to NetEase for a statement on what happened during efforts to find a new partner. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>
