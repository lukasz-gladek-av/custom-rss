<p>In just a couple of days, players worldwide will get their hands on the long-awaited release of Civilization 7 (stylised as Civilization VII). It has been almost a decade since the last major release in the Civ series, and fans are understandably very excited for the chance to drive empires forward once again.</p>



<p>Recently, an entirely new perspective on the Civilization series was revealed – a <strong>VR version </strong>of Civ 7. It’s being developed by PlaySide Studios and 2K in collaboration with Firaxis and it’s coming to Meta Quest 3 and 3S in the spring.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-truly-immersive">Truly Immersive</h2>



<p>Firaxis, PlaySide, and 2K worked to release a new trailer for Civilization 7, this one surprisingly showcasing a never-before-seen VR version of the game:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Sid Meier's Civilization VII - VR Official Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lavuwKvZki8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The world of VR has gone from strength to strength of late. The technology is sharpening, price points are dropping slightly, and the library of games and apps available on the best headsets is forever expanding. It’s still a tentative area for some, but some developers are investing much more in the technology, which is great for those who love the immersion.</p>



<p>This is the first time in history that a Civilization game has been available on VR platforms, and it’s coming <strong>exclusively </strong>to Meta Quest 3 and 3S – which isn’t an unheard of thing these days. These headsets dominate the market, and as a Quest 3 owner, I can say that they’re generally the cream of the crop.</p>



<p>The trailer shows exactly how this’ll work, with a unique UI and configuration created solely for VR users to enjoy the relatively complex experience that Civilization 7 promises to offer. Given how long the average game of Civ 7 lasts, it could be pretty exhausting and you might need an external battery on your headset, but those are choices for you to make.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll pick up Civilization 7 on Meta Quest? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Sony has given an actual reason for the PlayStation Network (PSN) outage that brought the service down for roughly 20 hours on Friday and Saturday. </p>



<p>In a post late Saturday night on <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the company blamed the outage on an “operational issue”. Specifics on the issue weren’t given nor was anything said about preventing another issue. However, PlayStation  did, once again, apologize for what happened.</p>



<p>“Network services have fully recovered from an operational issue,” they said. “We apologize for the inconvenience and thank the community for their patience.”</p>



<h6 id="h-new-episode-gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">NEW EPISODE:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Still On Track For 2025: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>As a make good for nearly a full day of service being lost, PlayStation is giving all PlayStation Plus members five extra days. The extension will automatically be added to all plans.</p>



<p>The PSN <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally went down</a> on Friday, February 7 around 6pm ET. The outage impacted users across the globe, taking down the ability to sign in, play online, and even access the PlayStation Store. It started to come back around 3:40PM ET on Saturday, February 8.</p>



<p>As the service was offline, the company didn’t provide any updates to players aside from an acknowledgement of PSN being offline hours after it went down. The next update came to state that service was restored. </p>



<p>What do you think about the reason PlayStation gave for the PSN outage? What about receiving five days of PlayStation Plus for the troubles? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>The PlayStation Network is back online after being down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for nearly 20 hours</a>. Now, shortly after service was fully restored, PlayStation has issued a (very) brief update on the status of the network via social media.</p>



<p>“PSN has been restored,” the <a href="https://x.com/askplaystation/status/1888376843255824475?s=46&amp;t=hX1f8t9VMLBATttRMgQR3A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post said</a>. “You should be able to access online features without any problems now. </p>



<p>“Sorry for the inconvenience!”</p>



<p>The company also pointed people to the official PlayStation Network <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">status page</a> where it lists all services as currently functioning.</p>



<h6 id="h-new-episode-gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">NEW EPISODE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Still On Track For 2025: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>Aside from the apology, nothing else has been said by PlayStation. There has been no mention of what caused the outage in the first place. In fact, it was the first official statement from Sony since they made a post on Friday night stating that it was  “aware some users” were having problems. In between the post acknowledging the problem and the service being restored, the only other thing PlayStation posted was <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888316952004673561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">how to add M.2 storage</a> to the console.</p>



<p>PlayStation Network originally went down on Friday night around 6pm ET. The outage impacted users across the globe, taking down the ability to sign in, play online, and even access the PlayStation Store.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to PlayStation in an attempt to get an update as to what caused the PlayStation Network to go offline this weekend. Should a response be received—or an more in-depth statement be made in an official capacity—it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-patch-10-02-notes-all-changes-and-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT</a> scriptwriters for VCT Americas brought back a favorite from last season. Sentinels have qualified for the first Masters event of the year after a hot start at Kickoff, thanks to a masterful performance from Jordan “Zellsis” Montemurro in the lower final versus MIBR.</p>



<p>Known to some fans as the “vibes merchant” or just the Sentinels’ bundle salesman, Zellsis had his best individual series performance in years against MIBR. After the series in which he got just his second ace in VCT, the former Sentinels sub turned superstar spoke to Insider Gaming on his otherworldly performance, his progression as an emotional leader, and the things the team still needs to improve.</p>



<hr>



<p><em>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</em></p>



<p><strong>IG: A stupendous series from you against MIBR. What was the key to your performance?</strong></p>



<p>Zellsis: It has to be my teammates. Usually I’m the one that has to come in and keep everyone’s mood up, lift the energy, everything like that. And I kind of did not do that [today], I was just mellow, I kept my vibes neutral and focused on the game, instead of bashing my head against the wall like I usually do to keep emotions up.</p>



<p>My teammates started off the series with really good energy, so it made my job a little bit easier. When we got to Split though, I got a bit more amped because we loss a very intense [game of] Pearl, so I wanted us to get a bit more hype. But my teammates are insane as well; if I had brought the mood, one of them would have picked up the shooting.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Speaking of that Pearl, we saw a little bit of frustration from you after that knife from Aspas, and then some disappointed faces from the team after the map ended. How did you and the team recover after those moments?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, on the 1v2 I kind of raged. I was just very into the series, I did not want to lose. There were a lot of rounds that should have gone our way, and a lot of rounds where I messed up some key things. I knew one guy was Pit and one was Art, and I just whiffed and got very frustrated in the heat of the moment.</p>



<figure><figcaption>All smiles in SEN City. Photo by Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The MVP of vibes was N4RRATE. He was phenomenal today in keeping the vibes up, micro calling for people, and calling out mistakes. I think that’s a big thing that we’re starting to learn on stage together. We need to be calling each other out more when shit goes wrong. None of us are babies, we can fix it in the moment, and if you can’t, then you obviously don’t want to win.</p>



<p><strong>IG: You spoke the other day about your emotional maturity improving and “clicking” over these past couple years. Are there other players or coaches that helped you get better?</strong></p>



<p>All my coaches have always looked at me to be the leader on all my teams from Immi on Version1, to mCe on Cloud9, to now kaplan on Sentinels. They heavily rely on me being the emotional leader for everyone. People who know me know I’m very honest, I’m very brute, and I don’t beat around the bush. But I never try to put someone down when I’m saying something, it’s all about getting better and improving and making sure we’re in the right spot to win.</p>



<p>On C9, when vanity and yay left, mCe forced me to be more of a leader. When we got runi and jakee, we needed a huge voice on that C9 roster. We had the talent, we just didn’t have a lot of voices, we didn’t have a lot of decisive decision-making. And whether I wanted it to be me or not, mCe forced me into that. We had a lot of one-on-ones [together], and it kind of just spiraled me into always having to be like that now. And I’m not complaining, it’s made me a better player overall and a more complete player overall. I can control my emotions more. I can control when I talk about mistakes more and everything like that.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Do you feel your leadership role has increased this year after the departures of Sacy and TenZ?</strong></p>



<p>I definitely think we lack a little bit in high pressure mid-rounding situations. Sacy didn’t really do a lot of micro mid-rounding, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-valorant-champions-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his blueprint of playing the game was fundamentally the right way to play</a> the game. And that’s what he would kind of bring: “Okay, they’re doing this, we need to be doing this.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He just plays culturally differently than a lot of Americas teams. [NA teams] are always rushing, taking ones, whereas I feel like Brazilian teams always played fundamentally sound and he’s always played like that. So he brought that to this team when he played with us. I think with this team, we’re definitely missing a little bit of that discipline that he brought us. But we’re working on it.</p>



<p><strong>IG: What does it say about this team to be able to rebound from such a lopsided loss to G2 and qualify for Masters Bangkok?</strong></p>



<p>I think people need to remember we haven’t been a team [with this roster] that long. We’ve changed roles, we’ve changed so much to fit this team. And we’re still so young, I mean I’m 26 turning 27, John’s 26 turning 27. And then the drop off is insane: N4RRATE’s 22, bang is 20, and zekken is 19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s so much more re: mental and maturity to work on, but we all want to win and we work hard. I can confidently say this team is one of the hardest working teams I’ve ever been on, from the coaching staff to the players.</p>



<p>Can Zellsis and Sentinels claim another trophy this year? Let us know down below or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Co-creator of Back to The Future, Bob Gale, has said that a new video game is in the works. </p>



<p>The news came in a new interview by <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2024/05/back-to-the-future-co-creator-bob-gale-on-why-disney-rejected-script-possible-sequel-or-reboot-more.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cleveland.com</a> (paywalled), who had the opportunity to sit down and speak to Back to the Future’s co-creator Bob Gale.</p>



<p>In the interview, Gale was asked “what’s next” for him in the Back to the Future universe, to which he replied, “We’ve got a shot at a new video game based on Back to the Future.”</p>



<p>Gale continued, ”&nbsp;I don’t want to tell you any more than that because I’m not allowed to, but this is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time. Knock on wood that it will happen. Of course, 2025 is the 40th anniversary of the original movie. We’re planning on some events, plus there’s a documentary that’s in post-production now about the making of the musical.”</p>



<p>For those out of the loop, Back to the Future has had a game before called “Back to the Future: The Game” and released in December 2010 by Telltale Games and released in 5 parts, known as espisodes.</p>



<p>The game received fairly positive reviews and reached number 3 in the PlayStation 3 sales charts on its release, however, Telltale Games did not release any sales figures.</p>

<p>It hasn’t been a smooth launch for the new-generation Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card. After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-launch-to-be-worst-when-it-comes-to-availability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limited availability</a> alongside allegations of a paper launch from consumers, those who’ve been lucky enough to get one of the new $2,000 GPUs aren’t without their issues.</p>



<p>Over the last few days, posts on various <a href="https://www.chiphell.com/thread-2669678-1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/1if73o9/rtx_5090_not_detected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddits</a> have appeared with claims that the GPUs—both the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and Chinese-specific RTX 5090D—are bricking. The common claim among all posts is that the cards are being undetected by their systems. Some have tried clearing the CMOS while others simply cleaned and reinstalled the drivers for the cards. None of those efforts have seemed to work.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Still On Track For 2025: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>The reports began to get so frequent that Nvidia had to issue a statement on the matter.</p>



<p>“We are investigation the reported issues with the RTX 50 series,” the company told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/nvidia-is-investigating-the-reported-issues-with-the-rtx-50-series-cards-after-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-owners-and-some-rtx-40-series-folk-report-black-screen-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>.</p>



<p>It’s a vague statement from Nvidia, but it does acknowledge that they know there’s an issue. What’s caused the problem will likely be revealed if and when Nvidia releases a fix or offers solutions for those suffering.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is staring the naysayers in the face and battling them back with reckless abandon. Despite campaigns on social media to smear the game’s image, the Warhorse Studios RPG is soaring up the charts. It has now more than <strong>doubled </strong>the peak player count of 2018’s Kingdom Come: Deliverance on Steam, and it’s not slowing down.</p>



<p>KCD2 is proving to be a smash hit. Not only did it receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glowing praise in my review</a>, but it’s already one of 2025’s most decorated games. It sold more than one million copies in a single day, with Warhorse Studios and Plaion making a profit within 24 hours of launch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-up">On the Up</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 had, at the time of publishing, hit a peak player count of 233,586 users. That dwarfs the record set by the first title, which was released in 2018 and secured a peak count on Steam of 95,800.</p>



<p>Incredibly, the launch of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has worked wonders for the first game. Players worldwide are flooding the first game to get the scope of the story before landing in the sequel. At the time of writing, the first game was sitting on a peak player count of 38,669 users, the highest it had been since March 2018.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has had some trouble on social platforms because of some of the more complex themes present, but that’s not enough to slow down the growth of this phenomenal title.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has already revealed that this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/">three major expansions</a> will be released for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. The developer has a wonderful track record in that arena, having released a string of top expansions for the first game that provided entertainment long after the story was completed.</p>

<p>The PlayStation Servers are the equivalent of a quality midfielder in EA FC 25, if you don’t have a good one, everything around you falls apart. EA’s servers are known for being hit-and-miss, but it’s another thing if PSN is lunging in with two-footed tackles to break things down.</p>



<p>EA FC 25 relies so heavily on Servers. The game’s biggest modes include Rivals, Champions, Rush, and Squad Battles, and the Servers can ruin any matches in the blink of an eye. It’s always been a complaint and one that likely isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>



<p>It’s not always EA’s fault EA FC 25 doesn’t work though. Xbox might have issues, but so might Sony and its PlayStation Network. Let’s look into the state of PSN for you right now to see if there’s a hitch in the formation.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-ea-fc-25-servers-down-right-now-on-playstation">Are EA FC 25 Servers Down Right Now on PlayStation?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Please help us, Zinedine. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You should be able to play EA FC 25 online after the servers were restored from the PlayStation Network outage on February 8.</strong></p>



<p>Not since the 2011 PlayStation Network outage has PSN been down this long. Alas, this is the case as Sony’s solid infrastructure is down for maintenance. You might have been unaware of this happening, so let’s fill you in on the timeline.</p>



<p>The early hours of February 8 saw the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Network go down</a> for maintenance across the board. This prevented players from accessing any PlayStation Network Services—crucially, online <strong>multiplayer</strong> being one.</p>



<p>PlayStation has been very hush-hush throughout the outage, outside of one message for the community during and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-posts-short-update-after-playstation-network-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one after</a>. The company’s <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ask PlayStation</a> X page communicated a message to PS users: “<strong>We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN.</strong>“</p>



<p><strong>EA FC 25 is currently playable on all formats</strong> as EA servers are working. If you do have access to EA FC 25 on another platform, you can still play online if you need a fix.</p>



<p>We have an up-to-date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSN Server Status tracker</a> monitoring the PlayStation Network’s status. Keep checking back with Insider Gaming for breaking updates.</p>



<hr>



<p>The PlayStation Network is having a detrimental effect on all online multiplayer gaming. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fortnite-down-on-playstation-now-fortnite-psn-servers-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-gta-down-on-playstation-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-down-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marvel-rivals-down-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> are all high-profile casualties throughout the maintenance.</p>



<p>Do you think PlayStation and Sony should be more vocal throughout this? Are PS users going to be handed a free game or two to make up for the chaos? Only time will tell. Drop a comment to let us know what you think about all of this.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 started as a single-player exclusive game, and then along came GTA Online. This live-service, open-world epic has been the backbone of the GTA franchise for more than a decade, and it’s where friends and foes alike congregate to share their crime-fuelled adventures.</p>



<p>Sadly, GTA Online is inherently tied to the wonders of the internet on PlayStation. That means if PSN goes offline, GTA 5 will be down – and <strong>that means </strong>that GTA Online will be offline too. In this guide, we’re taking a look at what to do if GTA Online stops working and answering a key question: ‘Is GTA 5 down on PlayStation?’</p>



<p>Let’s find out how you can check the GTA Online PSN server status.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-gta-down-on-ps5">Is GTA Down on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>GTA Online is down at the time of publishing due to an ongoing global issue with the PlayStation</strong> <strong>Network </strong>(last checked 08/02/25).</p>



<p>On February 8, the PlayStation Network buckled, crashing worldwide and plunging tens of millions of gamers into darkness. The major outage was a show-stopping event, taking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all PSN services offline</a> in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>For future reference, there are things you can do to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check the PSN server status</a>, but in most cases, it’s a matter of just waiting until the network comes back up again.</p>



<p>If GTA Online is down on PS5, you can bet your last dollar it’s offline on PS4, too.</p>



<p>Read on to check how you can figure out whether it’s a global outage or a more localised issue that’s taking GTA down on PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-rockstar-server-status-for-gta-online">How to Check Rockstar Server Status for GTA Online</h2>
