<p>The developers of Hyper Light Breaker are ending development on the game and laying off a number of employees at the studio.</p>



<p>First reported by Game Developer, Heart Machine has confirmed its plans to wrap up the game’s development. However, they didn’t confirm how many people would be losing their jobs. </p>



<p><strong>“As we wrap up our work on&nbsp;Hyper Light Breaker, we’ve had to make the difficult decision to part ways with a number of talented team members,” </strong>a Heart Machine spokesperson <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told the outlet</a>. <strong>“This was not our ideal path, but rather the only one available given the circumstances.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“While this path will include a conclusion on the project, it reflects broader forces beyond our control, including shifts in funding, corporate consolidation and the uncertain environment many small studios like us are navigating today.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as that “conclusion on the project” is concerned, the studio says it still has something planned for the game in January that will be “meaningful and as polished and complete” as they can. </p>



<p><strong>“We’re doing our best to refine what we can, complete key systems, and have the game culminate in a satisfying punctuation point,” </strong>they said. <strong>“Given our limited resources with team members rolling off the project, we won’t be releasing any more updates or hosting any Q+As for the rest of this year. We want to make sure the team can focus fully on getting this next release into the best shape possible.”</strong></p>



<p>Hyper Light Breaker, a prequel to 2016’s critically acclaimed Hyper Light Drifter, launched in January 2025 in Early Access to generally mixed reviews. </p>

<p>SEGA recently filed for a new trademark for Shadow the Hedgehog, sparking widespread speculation in the community. </p>



<p>Shadow the Hedgehog is one of the most popular characters from the franchise, and SEGA could be well on its way to using the character again in a new title. The last game featuring Shadow was Sonic x Shadow Generations, which sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-already-surpass-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 1 million copies</a> on launch day. </p>



<h2 id="h-a-new-shadow-the-hedgehog-trademark-has-been-filed">A New Shadow the Hedgehog Trademark Has Been Filed</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://sonic-city.net/2025/10/08/sega-files-new-trademark-for-shadow-the-hedgehog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SonicCity</a>, SEGA filed a new Shadow the Hedgehog trademark in September, which players can see in Japan’s public trademark <a href="https://chizai-watch.com/t/2025112443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">repositories</a>. The trademark is for clothing, toys, education, and more. However, further down in the filing, players will find home video game consoles and more. There is no official confirmation of a new Shadow the Hedgehog game, but many players have begun speculating that it could be a remake. </p>



<p>While we wait for some official announcement to arrive from SEGA, players can check out the latest multiplayer racing title from the series, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. It is a new title that features races across land, sea, air, and space, where players can use Travel Rings to transport themselves into new dimensions. The game features 24 tracks, and players can warp to 15 CrossWorlds with Travel Rings. It also featured 45 unique original vehicles, 70 different gadgets, and&nbsp;23 iconic Sonic characters at launch, one of which is Shadow the Hedgehog. </p>



<p>In other news, earlier this year, SEGA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-accidentally-makes-sales-data-public-for-11-major-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accidentally</a> made sales data for 11 major games public.
