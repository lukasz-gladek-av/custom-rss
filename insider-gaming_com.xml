The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty Hit by WARDOGS Comment: ‘No Nikki Minaj Skins’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bulkhead-wardogs-call-of-duty-comment-nikki-minaj/</link>
            <guid>1429906</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last week, Bulkhead revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wardogs/" id="3558">WARDOGS</a>, a developing first-person tactical shooter with an impressive amount of ambition. It has been in development for several years and shone brightly in the game’s first trailer, which offered a tasty lay of the land for what’s set to come.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, the team at Bulkhead was explaining how many aspects of WARDOGS will work, including monetization. In a thinly-veiled stab at Call of Duty, they stressed that there will be ‘No Nikki Minaj skins. No bullshit.’</p>







<h2 id="h-wardogs-is-all-about-realism">WARDOGS is All About Realism</h2>



<p>WARDOGS is bursting with potential and has already garnered a sizeable following since dropping its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wardogs-reveal-trailer-100-player-tactical-warfare/">inaugural trailer last week</a>. It’s a large-scale, wide conflict game with destruction elements, vehicles, a unique economy model, and above all else, <strong>realism</strong> running deep in its veins.</p>



<p>That’s why the team recently addressed the game’s monetization model and said that there won’t be any battle pass features or ‘Nikki Minaj skins’.</p>



<p>This is a reference to Call of Duty, which has spent the last few years promoting inane crossover cosmetics packs that have featured the likes of Nikki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, Family Guy, Beavis and Butthead, and Squid Game, to name a few. It has long since diluted the Call of Duty name and made it feel like something closer to Fortnite.</p>



<p>Here’s the full post from the team at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bulkhead/" id="3559">Bulkhead</a>, WARDOGS’ developer:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>// MONESTISATION?</p><p>No Battlepass. No Pay to Win.<br>No Nikki Minaj Skins. No Bullshit.</p><p>Earn cosmetics by playing.</p><p>WARDOGS is an immersive, Tactical All Out Warfare FPS that doesn't forget it's a game… <a href="https://t.co/Yp3d280XxQ">pic.twitter.com/Yp3d280XxQ</a></p></div>— WARDOGS (@WARDOGS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WARDOGS/status/2020591501785678082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>WARDOGS doesn’t have a release date yet, nor does it have a testing window arranged, but prospective fans are being invited to sign up to receive updates on that front as soon as they’re available.</p>



<p>In WARDOGS, players start a match with $10,000 in their pocket, and as they play, they earn more money. That money is then spent on weapons, vehicles, upgrades, and other items designed to turn the tide of battle. It’s a large-scale concept that can be scaled right down to the individual player, of which there are 100 in every match.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Won’t Have ‘Fortnite Skins’ in a Bid to Protect Game’s Vision]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-wont-have-fortnite-skins-protect-game/</link>
            <guid>1429849</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone was concerned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a>, the hyper-popular extraction adventure title from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">Embark Studios</a>, would feed into the ‘skin hype’ kickstarted years ago by games like Fortnite. It has become something of a pandemic in recent years, with military shooters generating skins and cosmetics that can be, at times, quite bizarre and out of place.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Patrick Söderlund, CEO at Embark Studios, confirmed that ARC Raiders <strong>will not </strong>be getting any inane crossovers or irrelevant skins, out of a fear of diluting the game’s vision and overall image or theme.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-will-not-get-fortnite-style-skins">ARC Raiders Will Not Get Fortnite-Style Skins</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has a sublime post-apocalyptic vibe that shines through in every skin that Embark Studios has created, even in the skins that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-skin-makes-sense/">might not hit as well</a> with the audience. They’re authentic, grounded, and apply very nicely to the game’s aesthetic, so adding in a collaboration skin pack with another brand <strong>might not </strong>make sense, unless… Well, unless <em>it does</em>.</p>



<p>Patrick Söderlund recently spoke <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to IGN</a> and offered up his two cents on the skin debate, explaining that the game’s art director, Robert Sammelin, has the driving control over the game’s cosmetics, and wants things to keep making sense going forward.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I mean, there are other games, very successful games out there – The Finals being one of them – in which the IP is designed so it basically happens to be very elastic. You can do whatever the hell you want, and people are like, ‘That makes sense. It’s completely plausible.’ </p>



<p>I can be a pink banana, and you can be whatever, and everyone’s like, ‘That makes sense. It fits the universe. No problem.’ ARC Raiders has a more curated lore, curated world, so we have to stick within boundaries slightly to a different extent than maybe The Finals or Fortnite or another game in which Batman can shoot Bart Simpson.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He said simply, ‘That’s not the vision for our game.’ There are plans to deepen the lore of ARC Raiders, expanding it from what we already know and offering more meat to the post-apocalyptic bones, which fans are eager to soak up. At no point does a cash-grab crossover feed into that concept.</p>



<p>Söderlund explained how he uses ARC Raiders’ customization mechanics quite often, swapping out his gear as new items surface and keeping his appearance fresh, so this is important to <strong>him</strong> too:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That won’t change. I think that’s going to be very important. I personally never believed that I would care about what I was wearing in a video game. Listen, I’m just being very honest with you, but I’m like a child. Whenever something new comes out, I need to have it. I swap my gear. I swap my backpacks and things and charms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>ARC Raiders continues to be one of the most consistent games to emerge in recent years. It dropped at the end of October and has remained strong since, keeping up a solid player count and deep impressions across all platforms.</p>

<p>It’s no big secret that xQc is a big-bucks streamer with plenty of cash behind him, but when the numbers start getting revealed, things start to get a little mind-blowing. Recently, the somewhat eccentric content creator revealed that he was paid a whopping $1 million, more money than some people will see in their entire lives, for <strong>streaming Call of Duty: Warzone for 12 hours</strong>.</p>



<p>What’s more amazing is that the sum was paid for a single stream <strong>despite </strong>the original ‘deal’ being for several streams over two weeks.</p>







<h2 id="h-chump-change-for-a-streamer-like-xqc">Chump Change for a Streamer Like xQc</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with Dexerto, xQc revealed he was paid a mighty sum of $1 million for streaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/warzone/" id="54">Warzone</a>, Activision’s battle royale, for just half a day. That wasn’t even his best day, as he also unveiled an eye-watering $15 million payday for <strong>gambling content</strong>.</p>



<p>The streamer, who often confuses viewers with his hyperactive cadence, has made an immense name for himself over the years, ever since dropping out of competitive Overwatch. He’s now a multi-faceted streamer who is often regarded as one of the biggest earners in the industry, and it’s obvious why.</p>



<p>The recent interview <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/xqc-reveals-he-was-paid-1-million-to-play-call-of-duty-for-12-hours-3315972/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with Dexerto</a> uncovered his insane payday for streaming a battle royale game for 12 hours:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When it comes down to a sponsor, I had a late sponsor kick in. It was Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>I hadn’t answered their request for their sponsors for like the whole season. At the end, they were like, ‘Yo, dude, we’ll give you like the rest of the budget or whatever.’</p>



<p>They’re like, ‘Well, you were supposed to play like once or like a couple times for 2 weeks, but you can do it all in one day if you want.’</p>



<p>I played for like 12 hours, I think. And it was like $1 mil flat. That was the biggest condensed sponsor I’ve ever taken.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It seems bizarre to think a streamer can make that much money for broadcasting a game for half a day, but that’s the world we live in. It’s a fact that content is king, and developers and publishers would rather stump up for a group of streamers to play their game than opt for traditional marketing approaches these days.</p>



<p>While that’s axiomatic, xQc is perhaps an exceptional circumstance, as not <strong>every </strong>big streamer out there will secure such a massive bag for a simple, single stream.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Delta Force is in the midst of a huge leap, spurred onwards by a massive update and a lucrative creator-backed content initiative. It has been such a roaring success that the game has <strong>breezed </strong>past similar shooters on Steam to land in the top five most-played games on the platform today.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, a whopping 138,120 people were playing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/delta-force/" id="878">Delta Force</a> on <strong>Steam alone</strong>, marking a huge overtaking of some of the biggest shooter franchises in the world.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-delta-force-soaring-on-steam">Why is Delta Force Soaring on Steam?</h2>



<p>Delta Force is revving up <strong>big time </strong>on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/steam/" id="173">Steam</a>, effortlessly overtaking games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" id="2795">Black Ops 7</a>, and it’s mostly because of the game’s eighth season – Morphosis. This supersized update has introduced incredible destruction, a new operator, and a fresh tweak on the game’s extraction mode, called Fiery Owl Hunt.</p>



<p>In the last few days, Delta Force viewers found themselves enjoying an enormous creator campaign backed by some of the biggest names in the business. The top-tier streaming community, represented by xQc, shroud, summit1g, TheBurntPeanut, NICKMERCS, and Nadeshot, all participated in the ‘Streamer Week’ initiative, backed by TiMi, the game’s developer.</p>



<p>This brought unreal eyes to the game, which was released in December 2024 but has recently seen a surge in players.</p>



<p>Going back a little, the new Fiery Owl Hunt mode introduced in Morphosis is a limited-time event that allows players to step into the shoes of an in-game <strong>boss character</strong>, Saeed. This was a hit with extraction fans, offering up a perspective <strong>never before seen </strong>in the space.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Delta Force occupied the fifth-place spot in Steam’s leaderboard, sitting above Rust and behind the likes of PUBG and Counter-Strike 2. By comparison, Battlefield 6 sat in 52nd place with 27,500 players, while Call of Duty was in the 45th spot, with 30,300 players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rainbow Six, Escape from Tarkov, Apex Legends, ARC Raiders… They all sat below Delta Force.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Helldivers 2’s Cyborg Legion is Back, New Trailer Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-cyborg-legion-return/</link>
            <guid>1429795</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Helldivers 2 countdown that was running recently has <strong>ended</strong>, resulting in the publishing of a super short trailer that has unveiled a revelation: the Cyborg Legion is <strong>back</strong>.</p>



<p>This means that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/helldivers-2/" id="850">Helldivers 2</a> players are about to come face to face with former citizens of Super Earth, once defeated and now rising back up with a threat. If Cyberstan is attacked, their retribution will be swiftly felt across the galaxy. This is a throwback to the original Helldivers game, and fans are here for every second of it.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-cyborg-legion-is-back-beware">The Cyborg Legion is Back – Beware!</h2>



<p>Cyberstan, for the uninitiated, is a hostile world in the Helldivers universe, populated by ‘former’ humans augmented with cybernetic abilities, used originally to withstand harsh working conditions. They foster a hatred for humans and have dubbed Cyberstan their homeworld, despite originally coming from Super Earth.</p>



<p>Here’s the short teaser trailer that dropped after the Helldivers 2 countdown ended recently:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="01001000 01000101 01001100 01001100 01001111 00100000 01010111 01001111 01010010 01001100 01000100" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mJSxy5uc0aQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The video’s description was written entirely in binary, but a simple translation tool uncovers the meaning behind it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>DET HÄR ÄR ER SISTA CHANS. ÅTERGÅ GENAST.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s Swedish, in case you don’t recognize the characters. The game’s developer, Arrowhead, is, of course, located in Sweden. Here’s the English translation of the message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE. RETURN IMMEDIATELY.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Helldivers 2 fans are now pondering the implications of this message. Will residents of Super Earth launch an attack on Cyberstan, or will the Cyborg Legion launch the first initiative and attack en masse with renewed, unseen strength?</p>
