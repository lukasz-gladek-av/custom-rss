            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has smashed past the 500,000 concurrent player mark on Steam, surpassing Call of Duty‚Äôs all-time high of 491,670.</p>



<p>The milestone was hit just minutes ago as the game sees its first Open Beta date kick off today (the past two days were a closed Beta period with limited access).</p>



<div><p>While the comparison against Call of Duty is somewhat unfair, it‚Äôs worth noting that Battlefield 6 is in an Open Beta period, and its concurrent player count success does not reflect how many people will buy the game when it launches on October 10, 2025.</p><p>However, the game has smashed past Call of Duty‚Äôs all-time high for Steam, which includes the highly popular and free-to-play Call of Duty: Warzone and any betas that have taken place over the past couple of years. </p></div>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported that Activision executives were not worried</a> about Battlefield 6‚Äôs success because Call of Duty is ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù. But perhaps the recent success has had executives rethinking that thought.</p>



<p>Of course, Call of Duty will remain one of the highest-selling games each consecutive year, but there has to be some props given to EA and Battlefield Studios for turning around the franchise. </p>



<p>You can watch the Battlefield 6 concurrent player count chart on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB here</a>.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC on October 10, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sentinels-ceo-says-marvel-rivals-team-bundles-are-critical-for-esports-future/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-sentinels-ceo-says-marvel-rivals-team-bundles-are-%E2%80%98critical%E2%80%99-for-esports-future.1266411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sentinels CEO Rob Moore believes the introduction of team bundles to Marvel Rivals is ‚Äúcritical‚Äù for the future of the game in the Esports scene.</p>



<p>Still in its infancy, Marvel Rivals has created a storm on the Esports front, luring big names to make the jump from Overwatch. Other pros have been attracted from the likes of Fortnite and Halo.</p>



<p>An impressive showcase at the Marvel Rivals Ignite Mid-Season Finals in Guangzhou is evidence that NetEase holds the cards required to become a mainstay on the scene. However, speaking exclusively to Insider Gaming at the event, Moore is adamant the next step must be team bundles and skins.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-open-to-team-bundles-being-added">Marvel Rivals Open To Team Bundles Being Added </h2>



<figure><figcaption>First of many. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>‚ÄúThe real key is what happens next. In terms of skins that are part of the game for tournaments, or something to continue to reward the investment in the game.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThat is a critical element of having organisations continuing to invest, showing that support. I think that‚Äôs the one key additional step that needs to take place.‚Äù</p>



<p>Moore confirmed that no talks between Sentinels and the Marvel Rivals team have taken place yet for such an addition, though he hopes it is a ‚Äúpriority‚Äù and pointed to other Esports that have introduced those items as ‚Äúreally having helped the economics of the game.‚Äù</p>



<p>Although there is no concrete news on whether team bundles or the like will be added to Marvel Rivals, Esports Tournament lead Adam Huang <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1953474966185214111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed to Jake Lucky</a> that they need to be considered and more needs to be offered to teams beyond the initial prize pools up for grabs.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Marvel Rivals could be adding esports skin bundles in the futureüëÄ</p><p>"We have to launch something similar to team bundles‚Ä¶ maybe bundles that contribute to the players, teams, and grand finals prize pools" <a href="https://t.co/TlV92MCJN5">pic.twitter.com/TlV92MCJN5</a></p></div>‚Äî Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1953474966185214111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>While Moore is hopeful more will be offered by Marvel Rivals in the future, he was clear in his praise for the efforts so far and the quick impact that NetEase has made on the Esports scene.</p>



<p>‚ÄúAs an organisation, we really try to prioritize getting into new games that have a lot of growth, and we saw this early, it took off. We had the opportunity to be one of the first brands in the game.</p>



<p>‚ÄúNetease has made a real commitment to the esports game and really supported it, you can see with what they have put on, bringing in all the teams early so they can boot camp. All in all, it‚Äôs been a really good event considering it‚Äôs the first they‚Äôve put on.‚Äù</p>



<h2 id="h-next-marvel-rivals-finals-will-be-bigger-amp-better">Next Marvel Rivals Finals Will Be ‚ÄòBigger &amp; Better‚Äô</h2>



<p>Next on the agenda for Marvel Rivals‚Äô Esports scene is Stage 2 of the Ignite Regionals, culminating in the Grand Finals later this year. Speaking to Insider Gaming, game director Guangguang outlined his hope that tournament, which could take place outside of China, will be ‚Äúbigger and better.‚Äù</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe are so glad to see many professional teams and media friends joining the tournament. This is our first time holding an offline tournament like this, so we‚Äôre feeling the challenge. </p>



<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working very hard and focusing our effort on making a better game to see players enjoy themselves.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThis offline tournament is a different environment from the in-game environment, so we will try to make the finals bigger and better.‚Äù</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-movie-fresh-edgy-weird/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-resident-evil-movie-will-%E2%80%98feel-fresh-edgy-and-weird%E2%80%99.1266228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Zach Cregger, the writer and director of the next big Resident Evil movie, keeps putting little tidbits of information out in the open. In July, he revealed that he‚Äôs using his creative license to tell a game that‚Äôs authentic to the experience presented by the Resident Evil games without leaning into <strong>any </strong>of the established lore.</p>



<p>Now, the writer, actor, producer, and director has set out the vision for how his Resident Evil movie <strong>will feel</strong>, suggesting it could be something pretty bizarre.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-totally-original">Totally Original</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Zach Cregger <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/weapons-director-zach-cregger-movie-1236340007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained how</a> the Resident Evil movie is coming together. He pointed out in July that it‚Äôs not tied to any other story and that it‚Äôs something unpredictable.</p>



<p>He said to THR:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That‚Äôs an original screenplay, by the way. It‚Äôs a weird story. I wrote it and I love the story. It has nothing to do with any of the other&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>&nbsp;movies. If I do my job, it will feel fresh and edgy and weird.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In July, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-director-wont-focus-on-lore-people-are-going-to-come-for-me-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cregger said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm trying to tell a story that just feels authentic to the experience you get when you play the games. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm breaking any major rules, but I also recognize that no matter what I do, people are going to come for me online.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nothing has been <strong>officially </strong>confirmed about the next Resident Evil movie, but in July, a leak courtesy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-leak-reveals-link-to-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of Daniel RPK</a> offered up a walkthrough of the synopsis. But this should be taken with a pinch of salt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bryan, ‚Äúa laid-back organ courier‚Äù, will reportedly be portrayed by The Walking Dead‚Äôs Austin Abrams. Bryan has to go on a late-night delivery to Raccoon City General Hospital, and that‚Äôs where the strangeness starts to unfold.</p>



<p>During the delivery, Bryan has to pass a snowy mountain road, where he accidentally hits a strange woman with his car. The woman survives somehow, but something seems ‚Äúvery wrong‚Äù. Bryan tries to help the lady and ends up stumbling ‚Äúinto a full-blown outbreak involving horrifying tentacle-based mutations and bio-engineered monstrosities‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It‚Äôs not so far removed from what we‚Äôd expect from a Resident Evil movie, but there‚Äôs no indication of when it‚Äôll be revealed, so for now, that‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got to go on.</p>



<p>What do you want to see from the next Resident Evil movie? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
