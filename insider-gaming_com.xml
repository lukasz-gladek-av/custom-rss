<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is tweaking the reward process in Ranked for Season 2, reducing the requirements to earn exclusive Mega Evolutions in the game.</p>



<p>The latest Pokémon title earned criticism for locking a trio of Mega Evolutions behind Ranked performances, with a minimum rank of K required to claim Greninjite and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mega-greninja-greninjite-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlock Mega Greninja</a> in Season 1.</p>



<p>However, that approach is being shifted for Season 2, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-ranked-season-2-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kicks off next week</a>, with significantly lower requirements to claim the latest batch of rewards.</p>

<p>In a post published by The Pokémon Company, which has since been deleted but can still be read on social media platforms like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1ojaaqn/comment/nm1hax1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, the requirements to earn Delphoxite and unlock Mega Delphox were shared.</p>



<p>Initially, the post stated the requirements would be the same, with Rank K required to be reached, but a later update reduced the level of unlocking Delphoxite to Rank S—a whopping eight levels lower than the initially stated reward.</p>



<p>Additionally, those who missed out on Greninjite and Mega Greninja in Season 1 would immediately have the opportunity to claim the required item for the Mega Evolution, with Rank Y required.</p>



<p>The post also outlined the duration of Season 2, stating it will kick off at 10 PM PT on November 5 and last for 20 days until November 25. </p>



<p>The deletion of the posts from The Pokémon Company raises questions about whether any additional changes will be made and why the posts were deleted, though it seems the information was published earlier than was planned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><strong>Update: ARC Raiders is out now!</strong></p>



<p>ARC Raiders is out today, October 30, bringing the most highly anticipated extraction shooter ever made to the global market. It has been pieced together by Embark Studios, of The Finals fame, and it offers a unique perspective and take on a typically gruelling and super-challenging genre.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’ll break down the official launch times for ARC Raiders, letting you know when in your region ARC Raiders will be released. It’s being opened up to the world on a simultaneous basis, so that means it goes live for everyone at the same time.</p>



<p>What time does ARC Raiders go live? Find out below.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-arc-raiders-live">When is ARC Raiders Live?</h2>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders will go live at 02:30 AM PDT on October 30, which is today. </strong>It’s available for preload on all platforms, but there’s not that long to wait before it kicks off.</p>



<p>Here are all the time zones for the ARC Raiders launch:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Timezone</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Launch Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">PDT</td><td data-align="center">02:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">MDT</td><td data-align="center">03:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CDT</td><td data-align="center">04:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">EDT</td><td data-align="center">05:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">UTC</td><td data-align="center">09:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GMT</td><td data-align="center">09:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CET</td><td data-align="center">10:30 AM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">IST</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CST</td><td data-align="center">5:30 PM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">JST</td><td data-align="center">6:30 PM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">AEST</td><td data-align="center">7:30 PM</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>It’s safe to expect some kind of technical or network issues, which are typical when a game has a global launch like this. With the launch not being staggered by local time, it means that everyone who wants to play this game will be jumping online at the same time, which inevitably causes some issues, and there might be some kind of server queue system arranged.</p>



<p>However, that’s what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-playtest-end/">recent server slam</a> was supposed to iron out.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-arc-raiders">How to Preload ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>If you want to get ready for the launch of ARC Raiders, you can preload the game on your platform of choice after purchasing it.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is available on PS5, Xbox Series, Epic Games, and Steam, and every storefront has mostly the same process for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/preload-arc-raiders-file-sizes/">preloading the game</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Head to the storefront you want to use</li>



<li>Complete your purchase</li>



<li>Find the game in your library and hit the option to preload or pre-install</li>



<li>Wait for the download to finish</li>



<li>Sit back and wait for the ARC Raiders launch time to come around</li>
</ul>



<p>You won’t need to soak up much storage space with ARC Raiders either, as the game has a relatively small install size:</p>



<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 – 16.19 GB</li>



<li>Xbox Series – 27 GB – 32 GB</li>



<li>PC – 29.05 GB</li>
</ul>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord</a> which ARC Raiders launch time you’re preparing for, and we’ll see you in Speranza!</p>

<p>Pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem, which launches on February 27th, 2026, are now live. Furthermore, a showcase including the upcoming title will air closer to release.</p>



<p>Celebrating the 30th anniversary next year, Resident Evil Requiem is the next big title for the iconic horror franchise. Following Grace Ashcroft, daughter of Outbreak’s Alyssa Ashcroft, you’ll survive horrors beyond compare in the now-desolate Raccoon City. Story details are under wraps but, assuming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some leaks are true</a>, it’s sure to be quite the journey for new and returning fans. Earlier this month, details about its pre-orders came out, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing an October 29th date</a> with a special video. Now, the content in question is out and holds another surprise: a new Resident Evil Showcase.</p>







<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQODLCylKbM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the 10-minute video</a>, narrated by Lady Dimitrescu herself Maggie Robertson, we see a flashback to how the Resident Evil series got to where it is today. From the original 1996 title to the latest mainline entry, Resident Evil Village, it’s all there and connected with Requiem.</p>



<p>While there isn’t any new footage of the upcoming game, you won’t have to wait long to see more. Towards the end of the video, <strong>a Resident Evil Showcase is announced</strong>, and is planned to release <strong>early 2026</strong>. While there’s no specific date, it’s likely taking place in January as Requiem releases in February. As for what we can expect, more gameplay will probably be shown, but there’s a chance we could see the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-0-remake-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored Resident Evil 0 remake</a>.</p>



<p>The biggest announcement was the fact that <strong>pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem are now live</strong> on all storefronts. The game is available for <strong>$69.99</strong> for Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. A Deluxe Edition is also available, costing <strong>$79.99</strong> and including the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Five costumes, including one of Grace as Lady Dimitrescu</li>



<li>Four weapon skins</li>



<li>Two screen filters</li>



<li>Two charms</li>



<li>One Audio Pack (Raccoon City Classic)</li>



<li>One File (Letters from 1998)</li>
</ul>



<p>The physical Deluxe Edition will also come with a Steelbook casing featuring a limited edition lenticular card. Also announced during the video is a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller adorned for Resident Evil, coming out at launch, as well as a Grace Ashcroft Amiibo, releasing in Summer 2026. Furthermore, Grace Ashcroft has been revealed to be going to Fortnite as a skin, though no date is given for that.</p>

<p>A skin for Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil Requiem Deluxe edition has been accidentally mentioned on PlayStation 5’s store page in Portuguese, seemingly confirming the character’s appearance in the upcoming title. </p>



<p>Leon Kennedy’s appearance in Resident Evil Requiem has been a subject of concern since the very start. One of the leakers in this space has been adamant that Leon is indeed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-have-3-playable-characters-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of three playable characters</a>. Now, the RE Requiem Deluxe Listing has seemingly confirmed that character’s presence in the latest title. </p>



<h2 id="h-leon-dso-agent-skin-coming-to-resident-evil-requiem">Leon DSO Agent Skin Coming to Resident Evil Requiem</h2>



<p>Spotted by DuskGolem on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1983676774207967556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the pre-order page for Resident Evil Requiem Deluxe Edition on PlayStation Portugal gave away the details of a Leon skin. Just like Grace’s Dimitrescu outfit, which was announced as a pre-order bonus today, Leon Kennedy will get a DSO Special Agent outfit. 5 outfits were mentioned, but only two were revealed: one for Grace and the other for Leon. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sony just accidentally leaked Leon in Resident Evil Requiem. On the official PlayStation 5 pre-order page for RE9 Deluxe in Poruguese, it accidentally lists a Deluxe Costume for Leon. <a href="https://t.co/xKA1Pj0Tm0">pic.twitter.com/xKA1Pj0Tm0</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1983676774207967556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Other Deluxe edition bonuses for Resident Evil Requiem include two filters, one of which is Apocalypse, four weapon skins, which include S&amp;S M232 Apocalypse Weapon Skin, two charms, including the Mr. Raccoon charm, the Raccoon City Classic audio pack, and files: Letters from 1998. The pre-order bonus also includes the Apocalypse outfit for Grace. </p>



<p>Players should note that even though the skin seemingly confirms Leon Kennedy’s appearance in Resident Evil Requiem, Capcom is yet to confirm the arrival of this character officially. </p>



<p>In other news, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiems-first-trailer-featured-leon-leaker-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaker has claimed</a> that Resident Evil Requiem’s first trailer featured Leon. Additionally, the game’s bosses will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-bosses-will-have-players-using-their-wits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">require players to use their wits</a>.
