<p>The <a href="https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reaction Time test</a> on the Human Benchmark website is a common destination for Counter-Strike 2 or VALORANT players who want to quantify their brain’s reflexes. But what does reaction time actually mean, and how much of an advantage does a faster mental response time give players?</p>



<p>Let’s dive into what reaction time is, what the Reaction Time test actually is grading, and what it means as a CS2 or VALORANT player.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-reaction-time">What is Reaction Time?</h2>



<p>Reaction time is defined as the amount of time it takes for an individual to recognize and respond to a visual and/or auditory stimulus. For gamers, and for players of tactical shooters like CS2 or VALORANT, reaction time is how long it takes for a player to respond to a specific visual or audio cue. This could be an enemy or grenade appearing on screen, or the sound of the bomb being planted or an ability being popped.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="donk INHUMAN Reaction Flick (with pov)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKG99h5gF3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When CS2 or VALORANT players talk about “reaction time,” they’re typically referring to the time it takes a player to react (i.e. shoot) an enemy that appears on screen.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-reaction-time-test">What is the Reaction Time test?</h2>



<p>The Reaction Time test on the Human Benchmark website is described there as a “simple tool to measure your reaction time.” It measures the milliseconds it takes for you to recognize when the red box turns green and then click. When you perform the test, you are given an average reaction time after four applications of the test.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to the site, the median reaction time is 273 milliseconds, while the average is 284 ms, though input/monitor lag can play a factor. These numbers are produced from over 81 million reaction time clicks. Top esports pros score much higher though. During a recent stream, VALORANT star Tyson “TenZ’ Ngo <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1894802864910016862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casually performed the test</a> and scored 138 ms, more than twice as as fast as the test’s average.</p>



<p>The Human Benchmark website also recently added a simplified “aim trainer” game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-practice-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you’d find in programs like AimLabs</a>. This test is actually a better method of grading a gamer’s reaction time, since it includes moving the mouse to hit your targets. The median reaction time in the aim trainer game is 400 ms.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-important-is-reaction-time-in-games-like-cs2-or-valorant">How Important is Reaction Time in Games Like CS2 or VALORANT?</h2>



<p>High reaction time is important in games like CS2 or VALORANT, but high reaction time doesn’t guarantee success. Of course, higher reaction times will help players win aiming duels or turn away from flashbangs. But fast reactions are only a small part of the skillset players need to go from casual to competitive to professional.</p>



<p>Skills like communication, coordination, emotional maturity, and the ability to read or predict enemy actions are all crucial. Without them, you’d just have players going by instinct, trying to make hero plays. A player that can react and make a play in a bad situation is great, but so is a player that can predict or avoid getting into dangerous situations altogether. If your reaction time is slow, that can be improved by training or improving diet or posture. But because it eventually falls off with age, pro players that stay around CS2 or VALORANT for a long time need to rely on more than just reaction time.</p>
