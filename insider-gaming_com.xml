<p>According to a new report, the God of War live-action series has secured its Sif, and it’s none other than Teresa Palmer. </p>



<p>Things have been shaping quite well for Amazon’s God of War live-action series, with new castings being announced over the past day. Yesterday, we were informed that the man taking on the iconic role of the God of War will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sons-of-anarchy-star-cast-kratos-god-of-war-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sons of Anarchy’s Ryan Hurst</a>, who will pick up the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos as Kratos. </p>







<h2 id="h-teresa-palmer-to-play-sif-in-god-of-war-s-live-action-series">Teresa Palmer to Play Sif in God of War’s Live-Action Series</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/teresa-palmer-cast-prime-video-god-of-war-1236684477/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> reveals that Teresa Palmer will play Sif/Phoebe, Thor’s wife. Amazon has declined to comment on whether this news is true. Fans will remember Palmer from movies like Sorcerer’s Apprentice, Lights Out, The Fall Guy, and more. </p>



<p>The report on this casting has also made fans wonder about the series’ timeline. Players who have played both games will remember that Sif and Thor do not make an appearance until God of War: Ragnarok. So, will the live-action series follow the game’s events or set its own flow? </p>



<p>Additionally, a report from last month discusses who will play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-series-thor-baldur-cast-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur and Thor</a> in the upcoming series. It seems Max Parker from Boots will be taking on the role of Baldur. At the same time, Olafur Darri Olafsson from Severance will be playing the God of Thunder, Thor. </p>



<p>There are still many essential characters left to cast, including Atreus, Odin, Freya, Mimir, Sindri, Brok, and more. Which characters do you think will best fit these roles? </p>



<p>In other news, the voice actor of God of War’s Kratos has expressed his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-wars-kratos-actor-wants-to-go-to-egypt-for-the-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desire to go to Egypt</a> for the next game. Additionally, check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshots</a> from a cancelled God of War multiplayer title. </p>
