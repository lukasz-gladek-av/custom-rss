<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed that Helldivers 2’s file size has been reduced by 85%, and the new ‘slim version’ can be tried in beta. </p>



<p>The performance issues and installation size in Helldivers 2 have become a pain in Arrowhead’s neck, and they have been hard at work trying to solve these problems. The developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-comment-on-installation-size-and-load-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> in October on improving the game’s file size, and now they have delivered the result, reducing the installation size by more than 3 quarters. </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-file-size-reduced-from-154gb-to-23gb">Helldivers 2 File Size Reduced from 154GB to 23GB </h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on Steam states that the Helldivers 2 developers have made good progress on reducing the PC installation size while adding new content. Thanks to their partnership with Nixxes, the team has reached its goal sooner than expected, with all data being de-duplicated. The file size reduction will also help improve load times, “seconds at most”. </p>



<p>The new file size for Helldivers 2 on PC has been reduced to 23GB, which cuts 131GB (85%) from the previous 154GB installation size. The new ‘Slim version’ of the game has gone through several rounds of internal QA and has been rolled out for early adopters as a public technical beta. After the public beta returns with no issues, the slim version will become the default for Helldivers 2. </p>



<p>At the same time, the legacy version will be available as opt-in once the slim version becomes the default to help players “self-troubleshoot any issues that were not picked up during our internal testing or the public technical beta.”</p>

<p>Nintendo’s Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is the first new Metroid Prime game in over a decade. No one thought it would happen at one point, and it has. Unfortunately, it’s the lowest-rated game in the Prime series, but it’s still reviewed quite well.</p>



<p>Another game is ready to go under the Christmas tree: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. The legendary franchise sees all of your hopes and dreams curl up into a literal ball as you hunt Space Pirates and Metroids. Its review scores are ultimately not disappointing, but it probably misses GOTY conversations.</p>

<p>The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review scores have all but settled on Metacritic. As of writing, based on 63 Nintendo Switch 2 reviews, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has an aggregate score of 80/100!</p>







<p>Before you say anything, this is a very good score. An average game is usually around the 7/10 mark, making an 8/10 verdict excellent. Long-time fans and people who’ve been hyped for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond might be a bit disappointed by this score, compared to previous Metroid Prime games.</p>



<p>According to Metacritic, the original Metroid Prime sits at 97/100, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is on 92/100, and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption drops slightly further to 90/100. This makes Beyond the first mainline ‘Prime’ game to fall below 90, and for a while, it was even under 80.</p>



<p>Everyone is so hyper-critical about reviews and scores nowadays, when the reality is that games should be supported. Will the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review scores stop you from buying it? Or is it a day one? The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is the perfect outlet to let everyone know.</p>
