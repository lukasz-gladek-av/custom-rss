<p>This Roblox Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending guide will help you earn 300 Toilet Paper fast, allowing you to blitz through the objectives and escape via the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pre-Christmas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-spin-a-brainrot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Dig to Escape update featured the debut of the third ending. Dubbed as the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending, players must purchase the Illegal Keycard and head into the kitchen to access this new escape route. This ending is seen as an easier option compared to the Janitor’s Ending since all you need to do is spend 300 Toilet Paper to reach the kitchen vent. That said, the final part of this ending will remind you of Subway Surfers and the iconic rooftop chase from the “The Chase” mission in GTA Vice City. This guide will help you earn those 300 Toilet Paper faster, walk you through the objectives, and complete the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-kitchen-ending-in-dig-to-escape-nbsp">How To Get Kitchen Ending In Dig To Escape&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 id="h-what-you-need-to-know-before-going-for-the-dig-to-escape-kitchen-ending">What You Need To Know Before Going For The Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Your first goal towards the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending is to earn 300 Toilet Paper.</li>



<li>You’ll need 200 Toilet Paper for the Illegal Keycard and 100 Toilet Paper for the Crowbar.</li>



<li>Once you spawn in your cell, roll up the carpet and start digging in a rectangular pattern.</li>



<li>Digging straight down limits the number of items you find. Clearing the ground in a rectangular shape helps you uncover more items in less time.</li>



<li>Since you need 300 Toilet Paper, consider buying the Toy Shovel. It increases your digging speed, allowing you to collect more items and clear more ground quickly.</li>



<li>Trade only for Food and the Shovel. Avoid spending Toilet Paper on Energy Surge or Storage.</li>



<li>It usually takes 9–10 in-game days to save 300 Toilet Paper. On Hard difficulty, it may take longer.</li>



<li>The kitchen door is located on the left side of the Chef. Use the Keycard to scan and open it.</li>



<li>Once you’ve saved 200 Toilet Paper, buy the Illegal Keycard and head straight to the kitchen.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-what-to-do-after-buying-the-illegal-keycard-for-the-dig-to-escape-kitchen-ending">What To Do After Buying The Illegal Keycard For The Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending</h2>



<ol>
<li>Scan the door and enter the kitchen area. There’s plenty of Food all over the place, collect them, and head back to your cell.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Continue digging for items and leave your cell only to sell them.</li>



<li>The free Food should keep you going without needing to trade for more.</li>



<li>After earning 100 Toilet Paper, return to the kitchen and open the freezer room.</li>



<li>Inside, you’ll find the Frozen Chef. Interact with him to buy the Crowbar for 100 Toilet Paper.</li>



<li>Walk up to the vent, equip the Crowbar, and use the interact button to remove the plants.</li>



<li>Move through the vent to reach the Janitor’s office in a new building.</li>



<li>Climb the five sets of ramps to reach the rooftop, then open the door to begin the final phase of the Kitchen Ending.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-dig-to-escape-kitchen-ending">What Happens At The End Of The Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once the rooftop door opens, a short cinematic plays. When it ends, the chase begins. Follow these steps to escape safely:</p>



<ol>
<li>Your avatar must outrun the prison guard to avoid getting caught. You’ll have a flashlight and a dark path ahead, with the guard chasing.</li>



<li>Keep running forward and get over obstacles like building gaps, planks, and slow-down zones.</li>



<li>After covering some distance, climb the ladder and continue moving forward.</li>



<li>Jump only when you reach the edge of a building. This is safer and helps you avoid falling.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Use your mouse to see the path before you.&nbsp;</li>



<li>You need to be fast and accurate at the same time, as untimely moves can end the run.</li>



<li>If there’s a plank connecting to the next building, use it instead of making risky jumps.</li>



<li>Once you lose the guard, walk into the white blip to unlock the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending.</li>
</ol>



<p>The best Classes for the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending, are the Bargainer, Heavy Lifter, and Speedster.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Emergency Hamburg monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash, XP and much more.</p>



<p>Emergency Hamburg transforms players into heroes of Hamburg, Germany’s virtual streets in this immersive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-merge-and-fight-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience. As first responders, you’ll tackle emergencies across a sprawling cityscape that developers have expanded by over 60% since launch. Choose your path – join the police force to maintain order, become a firefighter to battle blazes, work as a paramedic saving lives, or experience city life as a civilian. Each role offers unique vehicles, equipment, and responsibilities within the game’s dynamic emergency system.</p>







<p>Progression in Emergency Hamburg centres around earning and spending coins, the game’s primary currency. Players accumulate coins by responding to emergencies, completing missions, and performing their professional duties. This currency lets you purchase new vehicles, equipment upgrades, and specialised tools to enhance your emergency response capabilities. While dedicated gameplay naturally earns rewards, players can use promo codes shared by developers on social media and Discord to claim free coins, exclusive vehicles, and limited-time boosters, significantly reducing the grind required to reach higher ranks and acquire better equipment.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Emergency Hamburg Codes Redemption Menu | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike other Roblox games, redeeming codes in Emergency Hamburg is a bit different as it has been incorporated into the game’s phone system. Here are the steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up Emergency Hamburg in Roblox</li>



<li>Press and hold C (or TAB) on your keyboard to access the phone</li>



<li>Click on the Settings option on the left side of the screen</li>



<li>Move to the Redeem Codes tab</li>



<li>Enter the code in the text box that says Enter Codes</li>



<li>Click on the redeem button to get your freebie</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-emergency-hamburg-codes">How To Get More Emergency Hamburg Codes</h2>



<p>Emergency Hamburg codes can be found through several official channels, making it easier for players to boost their emergency response careers with free euros and special items. The most reliable sources include the official Emergency Hamburg Discord server, which you can join to participate in discussions, announcements, and exclusive giveaways where new codes are frequently shared. The developer regularly posts codes across their social media pages including their X and YouTube pages.</p>



<p>However, keeping track of all these sources can become overwhelming, especially since codes have no notification system to alert players when codes expire. Therefore, we recommend bookmarking this guide in your browser, as it is regularly updated with the latest Emergency Hamburg Codes and removes expired ones promptly to ensure you always have access to valid codes.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox SpongeBob Tower Defense monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Shells, Cash and much more.</p>



<p>SpongeBob Tower Defense is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-build-to-climb-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game where players strategically place and upgrade towers to defend against waves of enemies inspired by the SpongeBob universe. While it might seem like a simple tower defense game, players need to carefully select and position different towers, manage their resources, and upgrade their defenses to withstand increasingly challenging enemy waves. The main objective is to unlock powerful towers, enhance their abilities, and survive as many waves as possible.</p>







<p>Progression in SpongeBob Tower Defense revolves around the game’s primary currency, shells and cash, which players earn by defeating enemies and completing waves. They can be spent on purchasing new towers, upgrading existing ones, and unlocking special abilities. Players can also obtain temporary boosters that increase coin earnings or tower effectiveness for a limited time. Although all of these rewards can be earned through normal gameplay, redeeming promo codes is one of the quickest ways to get ahead, as codes often grant free currency or boosts that allow players to progress faster without excessive grinding.</p>

<p>The countdown to the release of the Ascended Heroes Pokémon TCG set is ramping up, and more the the secret rares likely to be included in the set have been revealed in Japan.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG’s Ascended Heroes set will be made up from two Japanese releases: the already available Mega Dream ex, and the Start Deck 100 Battle Collection, due to release on Friday, and more reveals from the latter have surfaced.</p>







<h2 id="h-japan-start-deck-100-battle-collection-secret-rares-revealed">Japan Start Deck 100 Battle Collection Secret Rares Revealed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hunting. Image via Pokemon</figcaption></figure>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/12/secret-rares-from-start-deck-100-battle-collection-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokebeach</a>, the secret rares available in the Japanese Start Deck 100 Battle Collection have been revealed ahead of Friday’s release, showcasing a bunch of hits that are expected to be included in the Pokémon TCG Ascended Heroes set.</p>



<p>Several of the Art Rares have already been showcased in high definition, but the reveal stream showed off a bunch of SARs to chase down, including some for Mega Meganium, Mega Feraligatr, and Mega Emboar.</p>



<p>A new Lillie’s Clefairy is also set to be introduced, following on from the SIR introduced in Journey Together earlier this year, and the chase cards could actually be easier to pull in the English set.</p>



<p>The Japanese Start Deck 100 Battle Collection contains a whopping 742 cards in the main set, the majority of which are reprints, and each deck contains one of 100 60-card theme decks, but you won’t know which deck you’ve pulled until the box is ripped open.</p>



<p>Hits of Art Rares or SARs are not guaranteed, however, so hunting down the chase cards will be tricky, although the decks do have an affordable price of around $6.</p>



<p>As is often the case with the transfer to English sets, some cards may be saved to feature as promos in specific products, and some may be held back for future releases, too.</p>
