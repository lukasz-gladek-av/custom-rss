<p>A new update from Battlefield 6 developers reveals that bots are being reintroduced to Verified Experiences. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 developers have been addressing bots across various modes in their title since the game’s launch. The lead producer recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-bots-system-explained-by-lead-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a> how the bot system works in BF6, the criteria that need to be met, and how they can help the situation. Now, a new update reveals that bots will be returning for their community experiences.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-bots-will-grant-reduced-xp-and-each-game-mode-supports-12-of-them">Battlefield 6 Bots Will Grant Reduced XP and Each Game Mode Supports 12 of Them</h2>



<p>The latest update regarding bots returning to Battlefield 6’s Verified Experiences was shared through an official post from the BattlefieldComms <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986550835615027359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). <span>The developers had&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981556746482307086" target="_blank">temporarily removed</a>&nbsp;bots from Verified Experiences to support healthier matchmaking in their Community Servers and Portal Experiences update last month,</span> and are now reintroducing them to Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The post explains that each game mode will support up to 12 bots. If bot backfill is enabled, matches will require eight players to start, with up to 6 bots filling each team. If backfill is not enabled, you will need 20 players to start the match. </p>



<p>Bots will provide reduced XP in BF6, and player XP will remain at 100% (similar values to Multiplayer modes). Moreover, when bots are enabled, players’ statistics, such as hours played, kill/death ratio, and total revives, will not show any gains or losses. The stats system is currently not functioning as intended and is being actively adjusted. Lastly, challenges will remain completable.</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 players are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-players-turn-off-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">editing game files</a> to turn off matchmaking against ‘overpowered’ aim assist. Additionally, the game has reportedly sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-10-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million copies</a> across all platforms.

<p>Skydance Games’ Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is delayed and will not release in early 2026, according to the company. A new release date has not been announced yet.</p>



<p>If you are a big Marvel fan, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-gameplay-emerges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> has been on your radar for some time. As a showcase for Unreal Engine, the game brings players to 1943 with Black Panther and Captain America to defeat Hydra. With an all-star cast including The Walking Dead’s Khary Payton and Horizon Forbidden West’s Drew Moerlein, it was set to be not only a graphical marvel, but a fun one with a rich narrative. Unfortunately, it seems fans are going to have to wait until later in 2026 to get their hands on it.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-not-releasing-early-2026-skydance-confirms">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra Not Releasing Early 2026, Skydance Confirms</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1986539089164972440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from Skydance Games</a>, the company revealed that Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will not make its planned early 2026 release. Instead, it will launch at an unspecified date, likely still in 2026. According to the developers, the team wants to ensure that the game lives up to the hype. The delay announcement does come at an inconvenient time, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> pushed its release to November 19th, 2026.</p>



<p>We hadn’t seen much of Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra in quite some time. The last update we had about it was from leaked gameplay and screenshots. Unfortunately, the game hasn’t had a new trailer since 2024, which showed off the story. Early 2026 usually lasts from January to March, so the delay could only have been a month or two behind its planned release. We’ll likely hear more in the coming months, but, for now, our adventures with Captain America and Black Panther are on hold.</p>



<p>What do you think about Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra’s delay? When do you think it’ll come out? What superheroes do you want to see in the game?
