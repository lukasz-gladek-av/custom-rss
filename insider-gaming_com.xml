<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has confirmed that Xbox is planning an Xbox handheld console, but it’s a few years away from release.</p>



<p>The news comes from a new interview with <a href="http://eyjzb3vyy2uioijtdwjzy3jpymvyr2lmdgvkqxj0awnszsisimlhdci6mtczmtq5otu0mswizxhwijoxnzmymta0mzqxlcjhcnrpy2xlswqioijttvcxq01umecxs1cwmcisimjjb25uzwn0swqioijcmuvbqki5njq2qum0rezfqtjbrki4mji1mzgyqtjfqsj9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. Spencer said that the company is currently working on prototypes and considering what it [a handheld console] might do.</p>



<p>Spencer said the “expectation [internally] is that we would do something”&nbsp;in that category of the handheld console market.</p>



<p>However, if you’re currently saving up the pennies in hopes of buying such a console soon, Spencer promptly squashed any false expectations and said that such a device is still a few years out.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, rumors of Xbox’s next-generation console and a handheld device have been circulating for some time. In March 2024, <span>Windows Central’s Jez Corden&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed that Xbox was already prototyping an Xbox handheld.</a>&nbsp;Other rumors also circulated</span> that Xbox could be planning to release its next-generation console sooner than PlayStation. </p>



<p>On the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By7ne7lHKLY&amp;ab_channel=RandalThor19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Two podcast</a>, Corden said, “I know that they’ve [Xbox] have got handheld prototypes right now”. Corden soon clarified that these are “new prototypes” and not the old prototypes often referred to.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-next-gen-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox announced that its next-generation console</a> would be “unique” and “powerful.” But apart from usual buzzwords, its currently not clear on what exactly that entails.</p>



<p>What do you think of Xbox working on its own handheld console? Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/farming-simulator-25-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Farming Simulator 25</a> allows players to create and develop their very own farms, with a plethora of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-animals-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animals</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/products-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">products</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-crops-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crops</a> to choose from. Raising animals and harvesting crops is a rewarding experience, and many love the realism and progression Farming Simulator offers.</p>



<p>You’ll need to put in the hours though, as farm work isn’t easy. Speaking of which, if you’re wondering how many are online dedicating their time to their virtual farm, here’s the Farming Simulator 25 player count.</p>



<h2 id="h-farming-simulator-25-player-count">Farming Simulator 25 player count</h2>



<p>Farming Simulator 25 has <strong>44,265 live players on Steam</strong> at the time of writing (November 13, 2024), and an <strong>all-time peak player count of 126,761</strong> on Valve’s platform, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2300320/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. The all-time peak was reached on its release date of November 12, 2024, which saw players flocking to start their farming journey.</p>



<p>These numbers are only for players enjoying the game via Steam on PC, and as the game is available through other platforms on PC and also consoles, the player count is likely much higher than what’s found on SteamDB.</p>

<h2 id="h-is-there-a-player-count-for-farming-simulator-25-on-consoles">Is there a player count for Farming Simulator 25 on consoles?</h2>



<p>Farming Simulator 25 is also <strong>available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles</strong>, but unfortunately, we <strong>do not have access to the player count numbers</strong> on these platforms. However, it’s safe to assume that the player count would be much higher if the player count was accumulated for all the platforms the game is available on.</p>



<p>The game also features cross-platform play and a multiplayer feature for up to 16 players on a dedicated server and up to 6 on console servers. The multiplayer feature is very popular for Farming Simulator and it’s likely one of the main reasons for its high player count, as people are hopping on to create a farm on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-fast-travel-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive maps</a> with friends.</p>



<p>If the devs, Giants Software, ever decide to release details on the Farming Simulator 25 player count or sales numbers across all of the platforms the game is available on, we’ll be sure to update this piece with all the relevant information.</p>

<p>The official FNCreate account on <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1856366599059427510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) has revealed that Fortnite’s First-Person Camera Mode device publishing will arrive on December 11, 2024. As the announcement hasn’t come from the main Fortnite account, the first-person mode will be reserved for Fortnite Creative and will not be included in the game’s standard battle royale mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s first-person mode has been rumoured to arrive for years, and players finally have an official date to look forward to. It will be interesting to see what kind of island creators come up with this new perspective, what kind of weapons will be compatible with this mode and other features. Hopefully, the implementation in creative mode will pave the way for the first-person to arrive in the standard battle royale mode, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite has confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-fortnite-map-returning-permanently-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the original map of the game will be returning permanently</a> from December 6, so players can enjoy Season 1 Chapter 1 whenever they wish.

<p>TiMi Studio Group and Capcom have just announced Monster Hunter Outlanders for iOS and Android devices. It is an upcoming open-world survival game set in the Monster Hunter universe. The developers did not provide a release date in the new announcement trailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Monster Hunter Outlanders announcement trailer footage, players can explore a massive open world featuring different types of biomes, such as jungles, swamps, deserts, and more. You will see some familiar monsters from previous instalments and maybe some new ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Monster Hunter Outlanders announcement trailer also revealed different types of traversal mechanics players can use in this world. Regarding traversal tools, we see the player character use a glider to cover large distances, a grapple to move more freely in jungles and a catapult that launches them in the air. We also get to see the character climb rocky surfaces and swim in some water bodies, so you won’t just be running around in this massive world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game will also introduce a crafting function that makes exploring this open world easier. Moreover, players can use weapons they have seen in the previous Monster Hunter titles, as the developers have optimised the battle system to make it “as enjoyable as possible” while “retaining the gameplay experience” from previous games”. &nbsp;</p>
