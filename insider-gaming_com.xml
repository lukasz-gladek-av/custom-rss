            <title><![CDATA[Is Pokémon Coming to Fortnite? Pokémon x Fortnite Collab Rumors, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-pokemon-coming-to-fortnite/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a big week for Pokémon fans with the 30th anniversary celebrations taking place this week, and fresh rumors have emerged concerning a huge collab with Fortnite.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> is the undisputed behemoth in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battle-royale/" id="127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale</a> scene, while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> is the strongest franchise among the creature-collecting games. For many, that may seem like a natural fit for a collab.</p>



<p>If you want to know what the source of the Fortnite x Pokémon rumors is, and whether a crossover is on the cards, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-pokemon-coming-to-fortnite">Is Pokémon Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not likely. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no official news regarding a collab between Fortnite and Pokémon. While it’s not been ruled out either, it seems unlikely to occur.</strong></p>



<p>While Epic Games are the masters of collabs, bringing the likes of South Park, Star Wars, and major anime titles into the game, working with Nintendo provides different challenges. So far, Epic Games and Nintendo haven’t managed to come to an agreement.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-things-we-want-to-see-announced-on-pokemon-day-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Things We Want to See Announced on Pokémon Day</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Fortnite previously wanted to bring Samus from the Metroid franchise into the game, but Nintendo wanted significant restrictions. It’s been widely reported they only wanted Samus to be playable on Nintendo consoles, even if you already owned the skin.</p>



<p>Additionally, Pokémon is a family-friendly franchise, and while it’s no denying the likes of Pikachu and Eevee would make amazing Sidekicks, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are unlikely to want their valuable IP running around in a world filled with guns.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-did-the-fortnite-x-pokemon-rumours-start">Where Did The Fortnite x Pokémon Rumours Start?</h2>



<p><strong>The desire from fans to bring Pokémon</strong> <strong>into the world of football is not new, but the rumors have been ramped up following a recent viral social media post.</strong></p>



<p>On Instagram, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DVE04N_gT9X/?img_index=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forthnite</a>, a page with over 2.7m followers, shared a fan-made trailer made by feraalsy that showcased what a collab between the two major franchises could look like.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green Nintendo Switch Release Date</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The trailer was done expertly, showcasing the likes of Ash Ketchum, Pikachu, and Charizard in their full might, and went viral on social media. At the time of writing, the post has over 15.5k likes.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, as we’ve mentioned, the collab is likely to be a pipe dream, and if Nintendo were to partner with Fortnite, there are other franchises, including Zelda and Super Mario, more likely to feature first.</p>
