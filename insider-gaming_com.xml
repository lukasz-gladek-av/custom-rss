<p>Once Human’s next big update lands next week, it was announced at Gamescom, as the title continues to grow with more features and experiences.</p>



<p>First released in July 2024, Once Human has grown in the year since, including the launch of a PvP spin-off, RaidZone. Now, the base game itself is getting a big update.</p>



<p>Stellar Resonance is a new gameplay mode that lands in Once Human next week, introducing Gravity Integrators and a host of rewards.</p>

<p>In a press release sent to Insider Gaming, the Stellar Resonance update is said to “drastically change” gameplay and offer “all-new challenges” for players.</p>



<p>Further details were shared on the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20250821/40780_1255304.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, with the event period beginning August 28 and running to September 25. After the update is live, players will receive a Gravity Integrator blueprint when a Star Advent Loot Crate is opened for the first time, which can be used at an Intermediate or Advanced Supplies Workbench.</p>



<p>Once placed and activated, the Gravity Integrator will begin to ascend, constantly accumulating Stellar Core Gravity Samples and unlocking tiered rewards the higher it ascends. However, it will also attract Deviants and must be defended.</p>



<p>Global Research is also available in the update, with progress shared across all servers for the same region, unlocking new bonuses and additional reward claim chances. However, the mission is “extremely urgent”, and, if a new research phase is not within five days, bonuses will be lost and attacking Deviants will be stronger.</p>



<p>Additional optimizations were also deployed, including increased gliding and descending speed, improved airbone mechanics, and the ability to cancel aiming when performing a plunging melee attack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>TT Games is back with a bang with the upcoming release of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, telling the story of decades of the Caped Crusader’s history, and multiplayer details have already been announced.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Revealed at Gamescom</a> with a 2026 release window, eyebrows have been raised following news that LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight seemingly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only has seven playable characters</a>, which would be a huge change given previous titles have featured hundreds of minifigures to choose from.</p>



<p>Multiplayer has been a core feature in TT Games’ LEGO franchise for years, with no major changes to the format so far. Here, we’ve got all the details on whether that approach is being adjusted with the new LEGO Batman title.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-online-multiplayer">Will LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have Online Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Switch up. Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will not support online multiplayer or co-op, it has been confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>In an <a href="https://legogamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/43979623023123-LEGO-Batman-Legacy-of-the-Dark-Knight-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ post</a> about the game, it was announced that online co-op will not be available, continuing the trend from other LEGO titles from TT Games.</p>



<p>The most recent release, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, also did not feature online co-op. While there has been a desire from players for the feature to be added, it will not be available in LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight.</p>



<p>It remains be seen whether any future LEGO games from TT Games change this trend, though it doesn’t seem likely currently.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-split-screen-co-op">Will LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have Split-Screen Co-Op?</h2>



<p><strong>While LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight does not have online co-op support, two-player couch co-op has been confirmed as a feature.</strong></p>



<p>Couch co-op is a staple of TT Games’ LEGO titles, and, while couch co-op is becoming increasingly rarer in modern gaming, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will not be removing the feature.</p>



<p>Only two players are supported at a single time, however, which makes sense given that a fair amount of screen space is required to truly enjoy the LEGO experience.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for the next couch co-op title to play with a friend, partner, or other relative, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight could tick the boxes.</p>

<p>Excitement levels continue to rise for Hollow Knight: Silksong ahead of release, and a flood of new gameplay from a demo has made its way online, leading to the question of whether it can be downloaded.</p>



<p>In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/">hands-on preview</a>, we made it clear that the hype for Hollow Knight: Silksong is well placed, and the assessment from others who have gotten a chance to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play at Gamescom</a> is similar. Now, though, players around the world want their own chance to play.</p>



<p>The guide below details everything we know about the Hollow Knight: Silksong demo, including whether you can add it to your library to try out.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-available-to-download">Is The Hollow Knight: Silksong Demo Available to Download?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Worth the wait. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is not currently a Hollow Knight: Silksong demo available to download, and all gameplay footage currently emerging is from Gamescom.</strong></p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is playable on both Xbox and Nintendo Switch platforms at Gamescom in Cologne, but it is exclusively available at the event for the time being. Therefore, it cannot be downloaded.</p>



<p>The demo is also the same stage of the game that was first playable at E3 2019 six years ago, which, though it may be surprising, could mean it takes place very early in the game.</p>



<p>Fans around the world will need to wait at least a little while longer to get a taste of the game, as currently the only details we know about the playable demo is it’s availability at Gamescom. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-hollow-knight-silksong-demo">Will There Be A Hollow Knight: Silksong Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>No announcements have been made regarding a Hollow Knight: Silksong demo, but there could be one provided before launch.</strong></p>



<p>A big Hollow Knight: Silksong announcement is coming today via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGeJwsUP9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, which could reveal the release date or details about a demo, early access, or other details.</p>



<p>If there is a demo, expect it to be available across all platforms, though given the hype for the game, it could release without one. </p>



<p>For now, though, there isn’t a way to play Hollow Knight: Silksong early, but keep an eye on Insider Gaming for more coverage and news as it breaks.</p>



<p>Is Hollow Knight: Silksong going to be a Game of the Year contender? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. </p>
