<p>Fortnite continues to shine year after year, and Christmas is a time when a flurry of festive skins are made available, and the vast quantity of them makes it difficult to rank the very best.</p>



<p>With the annual Winterfest celebration, Fortnite adds new Christmas-themed skins every year, featuring entirely new creations or established characters with a festive spin.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has run the rule over all of the Christmas skins introduced to Fortnite over the years to issue a verdict on the best ever released.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-fortnite-christmas-skins">Best Fortnite Christmas Skins</h2>



<h3 id="h-crackshot">Crackshot</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Terrifying. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Initially introduced on Christmas Eve in 2017, Crackshot is a terrifying nutcracker that makes regular appearances in the Fortnite Item Shop, and stands out as one of the best festive-themed skins in Fortnite.</p>



<p>With five Selectable Styles, Crackshot is certainly worth the 2,000 V-Bucks it costs to purchase, and it will take some doing for the skin not to be considered among Christmas’ best.</p>



<h3 id="h-grimbles">Grimbles</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Gnome. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Grimbles was first introduced to Fortnite in Dedcember 2018, making repeated appearances since then, and, while he has a much more approachable look compared to some of the other Outfits on this list, it’s certainly not one to mess with.</p>



<p>Grimbles has a Selectable Style that includes red, glowing eyes, transforming the friendly gnome into a rather haunting nightmare.</p>



<h3 id="h-krampus">Krampus</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Ho ho horror. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another iconic Christmas skin in Fortnite that first appeared in 2018, Krampus is an Outfit that splits opinion in the Fortnite community, but there’s no doubting it boasts an iconic look.</p>



<p>Anti-Claus is inspired by European folklore, said to be a half-goat, half-demon figure who acts as the opposite to Santa Claus, punishing those who misbehave, so play nice.</p>



<h3 id="h-sgt-winter">Sgt. Winter</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Naughty or nice. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A Battle Pass skin all the way back in Season 7 in 2018, Sgt. Winter shows what Santa would look like if he were to have chosen a different lifestyle and brought the pain rather than spreading Christmas cheer.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Sgt. Winter came in the Battle Pass before Fortnite removed the exclusivity restrictions, so the original Sgt. Winter won’t be available again.</p>



<h3 id="h-dolph">Dolph</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hooves and all. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Introduced in 2019 on Christmas Eve, Dolph is a bipedal, almost humanoid version of Santa’s favorite reindeer, though points have to be docked due to the lack of a shiny red nose.</p>



<p>Still, Dolph is a classic Christmas skin in Fortnite and provides a stellar look while you sleigh your enemies.</p>



<h3 id="h-polar-patroller">Polar Patroller</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Beary good. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Polar Patroller was initially introduced on New Year’s Eve in 2019 and has regularly returned to the Item Shop, including a styint available in November this year, and pairs well with the Dolph skin as both show animals transformed into Fortnite characters.</p>



<p>He doesn’t look as imposing without the grenade launcher he carries in promotional art, however, but you still shouldn’t cuddle this bear.</p>



<h3 id="h-sled-ready-guff">Sled Ready Guff</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Unbeatable. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Guff is a fan-favorite character introduced in Fortnite and the Sled Ready skin is arguably the best of them all, with the reindeer attire certainly looking better than the Santa approach in Guff Gringle, where it looks like he’s suffered a bit of sunburn.</p>



<p>Sled Ready Guff was initially available in Chapter 4, Season 1 in December 2022 through completing challenges, and has not been obtainable since. </p>



<h3 id="h-winterfest-bushranger">Winterfest Bushranger</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Winter is coming. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A Christmas twist to the traditional Bushranger Outfit, Winterfest Bushranger comes equipped with a Christmas tree design, a Santa hat, and plenty of decorations.</p>



<p>Winterfest Bushranger was released in December 2023, obtainable through challenges, and may feature in the Item Shop in future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Sorry Fam’: Epic Games CEO Addresses Fortnite Outage on Social Media]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-outage-addressed-epic-games-ceo/</link>
            <guid>1392049</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hours ago, the gaming space went into a downward spiral as several major titles went offline. In a global network issue, the likes of Fortnite, ARC Raiders, Steam, Rocket League, and Marvel Rivals suffered, and of course, gamers took to social media to vent their frustrations.</p>



<p>In a quickshot post on socials, Tim Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Epic Games, lamented the issues with an apologetic message of sorts.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-servers-are-melting-down">The Servers Are Melting Down</h2>



<p>Fortnite was one of the most heavily impacted games in the recent server outage issue that knocked multiple games offline. The blip took down countless top-tier titles, leaving players stranded on Christmas Eve.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2004019861807374671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post</a> acknowledging the issues, Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The servers are melting down, sorry fam.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He followed that up three hours later with a much more encouraging comment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s back, and Merry Christmas everyone!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The simple message was a nice note to indicate that even the top-most individual at Epic Games has his finger on the pulse, even at the height of the festive break.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been documented what caused the issue, but given the widespread nature of the blip, it’s safe to assume it was related to the global network infrastructure that seems to be so shaky these days. The issues impacted a diverse array of titles, and this is a problem that’s becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly this year.</p>



<p>As the world becomes increasingly reliant on networking and the likes of AI, connected living, and cloud computing become much more important, we’re going to see these problems surface much more often.</p>



<p>Which is a shame, given that gaming is almost inherently dependent on good internet these days.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#928)—Clues and Answers for Thursday, December 25]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-25-928/</link>
            <guid>1392046</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s finally here! It’s the ultimate festive day of the year, but before you start tearing open your gifts and scoffing down a Christmas lunch, you need to complete one of the final NYT Connections puzzles of 2025. Below, I’ve provided the top NYT Connections hints and solutions so that you can complete the puzzle as quickly as possible, keep your streak going, and get back to the festivities.</p>



<p>Read on for today’s NYT Connections answers!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-25">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 25)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #928:</p>



<ul>
<li>EXCESSIVE</li>



<li>COIN</li>



<li>FLOWERY</li>



<li>FASHION</li>



<li>MELODRAMATIC</li>



<li>HATCH</li>



<li>PURPLE</li>



<li>MAKE UP</li>



<li>CHERRY</li>



<li>LAREDO</li>



<li>FLOWER</li>



<li>MIRE</li>



<li>MUSICAL NOTE</li>



<li>RETIRE</li>



<li>WINE GLASS</li>



<li>SOLTI</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Why be plain when you can go over-the-top?</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Be inventive with this group</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Hopefully the answer <strong>stems </strong>from this hint</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Think singing scales and warming up your voice</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 25:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-25-928">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 25 (#928)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– EXCESSIVE, FLOWERY, MELODRAMATIC, PURPLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COIN, FASHION, HATCH, MAKE UP</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CHERRY, FLOWER, MUSICAL NOTE, WINE GLASS</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – LAREDO, MIRE, RETIRE, SOLTI</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-wants-play-fallout-5-600-hours-rookie/</link>
            <guid>1392037</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone knows that Fallout games are designed to be played for a <strong>very long time</strong>. In the case of Fallout 76, the last major release in the post-apocalyptic series, there’s an infinite number of hours waiting to be explored. In a recent interview, the team at Bethesda Game Studios revealed that these concepts are being built into Fallout 5.</p>



<p>One of the lead developers working on Fallout’s next major iteration revealed that the goal is <strong>600 hours</strong>, in an ideal world. It’s not the kind of game that can be played for just ’20 hours’, but players are going to be given enough meat on the irradiated bones to play for an extremely long time.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-we-expect-from-fallout-5">What We Expect from Fallout 5</h2>



<p>Being honest, we expected nothing less from Fallout 5. With each new release in the series, Fallout has gotten increasingly expansive and ambitious. Fallout 76 (2018) is a live-service MMORPG that has never stopped evolving, so it stands to reason that Fallout 5 will be similarly impressive.</p>



<p>While we know very little about the game, Bethesda’s Todd Howard did recently confirm that it’ll be tied in with the ongoing television show.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/23/bethesda-talks-fallouts-future-and-lessons-learned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, several members of the Bethesda Game Studios leadership team spoke about the future of the franchise. Emil Pagliarulo, one of the most notable developers on the team and the studio’s design director, dropped a tidbit about Fallout 5’s ideal duration:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I would be happy with a game that is as successful as the previous Fallout games that continues to give fans what they love, you know, and to give them a story that they can get into and systems that they love and really just an experience that they play not for 20 hours and not for 100 hours, but an experience they can play for 200, 300, you know, 600 hours, because that’s the kind of games we make. That would be my hope going forward: Keep doing what we’ve done, and also to evolve.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For some, those are rookie numbers, as Fallout is the kind of series that can keep providing new experiences 1000+ hours into a run. With the implementation of mods, Creation Club content, expansions, and regular updates, Fallout games have been kept alive and kicking for <strong>decades</strong>, in some cases.</p>



<p>Fallout 5 doesn’t have any kind of a release window, but at this rate, and with the ambitions of the studio, we’d expect it to be 2030 before we even have a teaser trailer released.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Update Adds Long-Awaited Quality-of-Life Feature]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-update-quality-of-life-feature/</link>
            <guid>1392034</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov players are loading into the game after the most recent patch (1.0.1.0) to find a quality-of-life feature that they’ve been needing for years. When you deploy into your next raid, you’ll notice a UI upgrade that includes a progress bar that represents how long it’s going to take for you to load into your session.</p>



<p>This means it’s no longer based entirely around guesswork as to how long it’s going to take to load into your game. The progress bar shows you exactly where you’re at in the queue, how long the estimated load time is, and how long you’ve already been waiting (which isn’t new, of course).</p>



<h2 id="h-small-tarkov-change-big-impact">Small Tarkov Change, Big Impact</h2>



<p>For the longest time, fans of the pioneering extraction shooter that is Escape from Tarkov have been left wanting when it comes to loading into raids. In the worst cases, it can take double-digit minutes before you get into your raid, and you’re left to sit there and let the clock run up.</p>



<p>This latest update, introduced with the 1.0.1.0 patch that also brought about the winter event, ensures that players have a UI upgrade that fixes that to some extent.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: AirwingMarine on X</figcaption></figure>







<p>It doesn’t address long load times – that comes later. Instead, it gives players a mostly accurate representation of how long it’s expected to take for them to get into their raid. This means that players no longer need to sit in their queue ad infinitum. If they see there’s an estimated load time of 10 minutes, they can just back out and try again.</p>



<p>It <strong>has </strong>been reported by players on socials that it’s not entirely accurate right now. One user wrote that their estimated deploy time was over six minutes, and they were in their raid in three.</p>



<p>It’s a minor change for some, but for those who have been playing Escape from Tarkov for a lot longer, it’s a no-brainer addition that is long overdue.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see the UI upgrade in Escape from Tarkov’s latest update? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>1391854</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When it comes to single-player games, 2025 offered no shortage of memorable experiences. Big sequels, ambitious new IPs, and long-anticipated releases all took turns dominating the conversation, making it one of the more competitive years in recent memory. With so many strong options on the table, the Insider Gaming community had plenty to consider when casting their votes.</p>



<p>In the end, one game stood above the rest. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been voted the Insider Gaming community’s Best Single Player Game of 2025.</p>







<p>In a poll hosted on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>, Clair Obscur finished first with 22.6% percent of the votes. Sandfall Interactive’s RPG edged out a packed field that included Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and Dispatch.</p>



<p>The result also lines up with the game’s wider reception. Clair Obscur has been universally acclaimed by fans and holds a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">9.6 user score</a> on Metacritic.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-the-votes-shook-out">How The Votes Shook Out</h2>



<p>As mentioned, the poll was filled with worthy recipients. Dispatch finished second with 14.8% of the vote, while Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 followed at 12.2%. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Death Stranding 2 each earned 11.3%, highlighting just how divided the community was among several games.</p>



<p>What ultimately pushed Clair Obscur ahead was how strongly it resonated with players. Rather than leaning on spectacle or familiar franchise beats, the game delivered a focused, self-contained experience that trusted its atmosphere and presentation to do the heavy lifting. Its distinct visual style and deliberate pacing helped it stand out in a year crowded with massive releases.</p>

<p>We recently sat down with Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, creator of Escape from Tarkov. Amongst other things, we took a dive into the concept of Escape from Tarkov coming to consoles, which is something that the developer teased at the recent Tokyo Game Show event.</p>



<p>In his own words, Nikita has stressed that an Escape from Tarkov console port wouldn’t be made ‘easier’. In fact, it would be ‘the same frustrating experience’ that players have been experiencing on PC for many years, retaining that hardcore, unwelcoming vibe.</p>



<p>It’s his mission to make players break controllers.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-would-escape-from-tarkov-on-console-look-like">What Would Escape from Tarkov on Console Look Like?</h2>



<p>Many have surmised that Escape from Tarkov on PlayStation or Xbox would represent a slimmed-down, ‘lite’ version of the tough-as-nails extraction shooter. But after catching up with Nikita Buyanov on the most recent episode of Insider Gaming’s Access Granted, we have gathered a different picture entirely.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure that it would be a ‘lite’ version of EFT. The main goal is to create the same experience for the consoles, so there won’t be any kind of aim assist, any simplifiying of the gaming features.</p>



<p>I really want to get the same frustrating experience for the consoles, to bring on this hardcore feeling to a wider audience.</p>



<p>We don’t plan to conquer something, we just want to create something new for the consoles, something new, a new experience, because they’ve never had that before, I mean the true hardcore experience that will break their controllers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Nikita made the ‘frustrating experience’ comment with a chuckle! </p>



<p>Nikita explained what the challenges are. It’s a discussion mostly centered around the complexity of Escape from Tarkov, which features inventory and health management, survival mechanics, and most importantly, <strong>stacks </strong>of keybinds that only a keyboard and mouse player can realistically handle.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It won’t be something simplified or a casual version of EFT. It will be the same EFT, but of course it needs to be optimized for the current-gen consoles.</p>



<p>The main challenge will be to put in all the controls. It will be the main challenge for us, but in general, I think it will be pretty interesting to do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Given that Escape from Tarkov only hit ‘full release’ in November, it might be ambitious to believe that Battlestate Games will muster up a console version any time soon. The only thing to go on is Nikita’s mention of ‘current-gen consoles’ for any kind of a timeline.</p>
