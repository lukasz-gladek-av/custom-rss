<p>Worlds Untold, a NetEase-backed studio founded by former Mass Effect producer Mac Walters, is “pausing operations” just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-adds-new-studio-led-by-mass-effect-veteran/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a year after being founded</a>.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>, Walters said the studio is looking for a new partner and that halting operations was a “very difficult decision”.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we’ve made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life,” Walters said. “This was not a decision we made lightly—it’s been a deeply personal journey, and we’re all so proud of everything this team has built together.”</p>



<p>Worlds Untold had been working on a “AAA action-adventure game” since it was founded. However, NetEase recently decided to pull funding due to “current market conditions”.</p>

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, a NetEase spokesperson said discontinuing funding was an “incredibly difficult decision”.</p>



<p>“This choice was not made lightly, as we have been consistently inspired by the team, their unwavering dedication and the bold vision behind their project,” the spokesperson said. “Although current market conditions have required us to reassess and prioritise our opportunities, we are actively collaborating with the studio to explore potential next steps and provide support during this transition.</p>



<p>“While this chapter comes to a close, our commitment to a strong global presence remains unwavering, and we are excited about the promising projects underway at our other studios. We thank Worlds Untold for their remarkable contributions and wish them every success in the future.”</p>



<p>Walters added that all of the studio’s staff are able and looking for work elsewhere. He said that while the studio is “pausing for now”, it’s not the end of the line for Worlds Untold and their plans.</p>



<p>“[There’s] more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right,” he said.</p>

<p>It seems Hunt: Showdown is following in the footsteps of titles like Dead by Daylight and Call of Duty, with big-name collaborations with other franchises and musical artists. As it were, this one makes a little sense. It turns out that Post Malone is a massive fan of Hunt: Showdown, having spent over 400 hours playing the horror-based extraction shooter while on tour. As such, Crytek partnered with the rapper-turned-country-singer for a collaboration known as Post Malone’s Murder Circus—the game’s most significant event to date!</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-post-malone-s-murder-circus-event">What is Post Malone’s Murder Circus Event?</h2>



<p>Hunt: Showdown’s first major event with a celebrity, Post Malone’s Murder Circus, transports players into the same nightmare universe as the rest of the extraction shooter, albeit with a twist. You’re thrust into a murderous traveling circus, transformed by an artifact known as the HelioStone. The former Ringmaster, the Deposed King, played by Post Malone, enters the fray.</p>



<p>The event features a new monster, Ursa Mortis, an orphaned bear cub with a deformed body and endless hunger. It stalks the Circus in search of prey to consume. Along with the terrifying creature, the map itself is unique, awe-inspiring, and downright dreadful in equal measure. And yes, you’ll encounter horrific clown enemies.</p>



<h2 id="h-yeah-post-malone-is-a-huge-fan-of-hunt-showdown">Yeah, Post Malone is a Huge Fan of Hunt: Showdown</h2>



<p>Talking about the game, Post said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’re either hundred percent in or you’re done. I could either rock this dude and send him off, or I’m totally naked…. Every game I’m shaking, like this is awesome. Whenever you pull it off, I feel like I’m the best player in the entire world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And on bringing Post Malone into the project, Game Director Scott Lussier said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re thrilled to have had the opportunity to collaborate with such a passionate and high-profile Hunt fan such as Post Malone. Hunt: Showdown 1896 has always been about creating immersive, high-stakes gameplay. And with Post Malone’s Murder Circus, we’re bringing a new level of intensity and dark entertainment to the Hunt universe.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896’s Post Malone Murder Circus will launch shortly on PC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-1896-on-ps5-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dayz-developer-responds-to-frostline-dlc-review-bombing-over-price.1046472/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dayz-developer-responds-to-frostline-dlc-review-bombing-over-price/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Review bombing is a practice that’s picked up steam over the last handful of years when players of a game feel they’ve been  wronged  in some way. For fans of DayZ, that happened when the Frostline DLC launched in October.</p>



<p>Over the last <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968040/DayZ_Frostline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">30 days on Steam</a>, the DLC has a 77% negative reaction with players upset about a variety of things. The bulk of it, however, involves the DLC’s cost of $26.99 and what fans see as not much content for their money.</p>



<p>“DayZ itself is great for the price, this price for just a map alone is not worth it, especially when there are so many better modded maps out there for free,” one player wrote. “Do not waste your money on this map, you are not missing out on much sadly.”</p>



<p>Said another: “For this price, they’ve handed us a rehashed map from Arma 3, stripped-down content, broken balance, and shamelessly copied ideas.”</p>



<p>In a response to the backlash on <a href="https://x.com/maruksp/status/1861353665455366218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Marek Spanel, head of developer Bohemia Interactive, said that players aren’t being forced to buy the DLC. </p>



<p>“Did you know that 8 million users for whom we have data on Steam played for an average of 188 hours and paid an average of 30 USD gross in DayZ?” Spanel asked.</p>



<p>“That means we received less than 10 cents for an hour of live online gaming, for which we host the online infrastructure and have been updating it for 10+ years. Yet Dayz Frostline is currently being review-bombed on the same platform for being too expensive: $26.99 for ‘just a map’, and some users demand ‘gimme more for less money’.”</p>



<p>In a separate social media post, the game’s official account said that they are reading the feedback received and “always try to make the most of it.”</p>



<p>“The DayZ dev team continues working hard to pack in more awesome content with each update,” the post reads. “We read carefully your feedback and always try to make the most of it. We also don’t forget about our amazing modding community – and yes, they’ve got tons of free maps that’ll keep you busy if you are not ready to join people on frosty Sakhal just yet!”</p>

<p>While there aren’t too many weapons available in Gray Zone Warfare currently—it’s still early days for the tactical shooter—you do have a few highly customizable options. Perhaps the most accessible is the M4, the go-to rifle for most players from the early game through Tiger Bay. Once you enhance the gun with the right attachments, it becomes an absolute monster in most scenarios. Here’s how to construct a Gray Zone Warfare M4 build that is ideal for CQB scenarios!</p>



<h2 id="h-an-sbr-m4-in-gray-zone-warfare-is-peak">An SBR M4 in Gray Zone Warfare is Peak</h2>



<p>I’m a huge fan of an SBR M4 build in Gray Zone Warfare, as it allows for tight, controlled movements in primarily close-quarters environments like the starting town. While you won’t immediately have access to all these attachments, leveling up Gunny will unlock a large selection of viable components to make or break this build.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>M4 Lower</strong></li>



<li><strong>M4 Upper</strong></li>



<li><strong>M4 Buffer Tube</strong></li>



<li><strong>AR-15 M401 Nylon Stock</strong></li>



<li><strong>AR-15 Barrel – 10.5″</strong></li>



<li><strong>DD MK12 Low Profile Gas Block</strong></li>



<li><strong>KAC M4QD Flash Hider</strong></li>



<li><strong>SCH 5.56 Charging Handle</strong></li>



<li><strong>Torque Pistol Grip</strong></li>



<li><strong>DD RIS II 9.5</strong></li>



<li><strong>RVG Foregrip</strong></li>



<li><strong>HWX EXPS2 Holographic Sight (Circle 1-Dot)</strong></li>



<li><strong>AR-15 5.56x45mm 30-Round PMAG Magazine (5.56x45mm AP (M855)</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-short-barrel-m4-stats">Short-Barrel M4 Stats</h2>



<p>First and foremost, you should know that, as the game remains in Early Access, weapon and attachment stats may vary and change over time. These are accurate now but could change in a future balancing patch or content update. You’ll find this particular short-barrel rifle excels at taking down targets in close to mid-range encounters with ease, with relatively straightforward recoil and stamina drain. That said, handling does take a minor hit.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Accuracy</strong></td><td>3.89 MOA</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Recoil Control</strong></td><td>+24%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Arm Stamina Drain</strong></td><td>+4%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weapon Handling</strong></td><td>-8%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Reload Time</strong></td><td>-9%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weapon Type</strong></td><td>Assault Rifle</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fire Rate</strong></td><td>800 RPM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fire Mode</strong></td><td>Single/Auto</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Manufacturer</strong></td><td>COLT</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
