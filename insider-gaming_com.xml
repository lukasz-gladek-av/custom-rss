<p>Embark Studios has unveiled the ARC Raiders roadmap for 2026, lifting the lid on a long-awaited pipeline of content for the all-new extraction adventure title. It arrives after the festive window saw a little lull for the game, with players complaining about content stagnation and a lack of things to do outside of the winter-themed event.</p>



<p>The new roadmap has rewarded patient players with four months of content, but some argue that it’s taking too long to release key elements, like new maps. The last (and first) new map was Stella Montis, released midway through November, but the <strong>next new map </strong>won’t arrive until <strong>April</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-arc-raiders-suffering-from-a-lack-of-updates">Is ARC Raiders Suffering From a Lack of Updates?</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has proven to be a smash hit, pulling in around 12 million sales since dropping on October 31, and it has reshaped the face of the extraction genre. That hasn’t stopped players from complaining ad infinitum about several issues, especially those that plagued the community over the festive break.</p>



<p>Out-of-map exploits, cheaters, a lack of new content, and lacklustre rewards from the first Expedition Project all compounded over the last few weeks to make many players feel tired with what was being offered by Embark Studios.</p>



<p>Additionally, it took the team almost a month to release the first roadmap of 2026, which includes content spanning January to April.</p>

<p>It starts with new matchmaking options, fresh player projects to expand the game’s lore and quest loop, and some minor ARC threats. In February, a new Raider Deck and Expedition Project come around, and some reworks will be applied to the existing map pool.</p>



<p>However, a new map and large-scale ARC enemy aren’t appearing in ARC Raiders until<strong> April</strong>, which has left some fans of the sensational extraction adventure title a bit disappointed.</p>



<p>If the new map, which we expect will be a waterborne map arriving with Riven Tides, emerges midway through April, it will have been a gap of <strong>five months </strong>between new maps.</p>



<p>In the extraction shooter space, that’s hardly unfamiliar territory. You just need to look at Escape from Tarkov, which only adds new maps once every year or two, to get an idea of how it works. For instance, the ‘Ground Zero’ map was added to Tarkov in December 2023, and before that, Streets of Tarkov surfaced in December 2022.</p>



<p>That’s just one example.</p>



<p>Extraction shooters typically have larger, more detailed maps than your run-of-the-mill first-person shooters. It’s not like Call of Duty, which traditionally receives several new multiplayer maps once every two or three months. It’s a much bigger deal, and everything from the balancing of the map, to loot routes, to spawns, to extract locations all need to be studied and optimized at length.</p>



<p>While it might seem an issue that ARC Raiders players have to wait so long for a new map, it should be stressed that the current pool is more than large enough to facilitate an engaging session.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s a problem that we’re waiting until April for a new ARC Raiders map? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE announced on the January 23 episode of WWE Friday Night SmackDown that there would be a special Attitude Era edition of WWE 2K26. The game’s cover features a multitude of superstars from the era that defined the late 90s and early 2000s in the promotion. Stars on the cover include Steve Austin, The Rock, DX, Undertaker, and more.</p>



<p>As this is a special edition release for the game, they have not announced who will be on the standard cover. Pre-orders are set to go live in one week on January 30.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-more-details-on-what-s-new-in-wwe-2k26">More Details on What’s New in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> that CM Punk will serve as the centerpiece of this year’s 2K Showcase. Players can relive CM Punk’s iconic career moments and play through dream matches that might have occurred if he hadn’t departed WWE in 2014.</p>



<p>Additionally, Insider Gaming reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new match types are coming to WWE 2K26</a>. Of the four game modes, only one is debuting, while three others return. All of them are gimmick matches that are emblematic of the WWE Attitude Era.</p>



<p>The Inferno Match, where the objective is for one opponent to throw the other into flames surrounding the wrestling ring. Originally introduced in 2008’s WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, the mode disappeared after its inclusion in WWE 2K14 over a decade ago. </p>



<p>I Quit Matches are also slated to return to WWE Games, last seen in the aforementioned 2K14. That match type is an anything goes contest, where one opponent must make the other say the words “I Quit” into a microphone. That match type first appeared in WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role in 2000. It has been removed several times over the years.</p>



<p>3 Stages of Hell is another returning match type. First appearing in 2001’s WWF SmackDown!: Just Bring It, the unique take on a best two out of three contest, where each fall has a different stipulation, has not been a selectable match type since WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 in 2005.</p>



<p>The only new match type rumored to be coming to the game is the Dumpster Match. In that match type, one competitor must put their opponent inside a dumpster and slam the lid.</p>







<p>There’s currently no release date set for the game. It is expected to be playable on all current-gen consoles and PC via Steam. Insider Gaming will keep you up-to-date with the latest WWE 2K26 news.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Most Hilarious Medieval Combat Sim is Finally Entering Early Access Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hilarious-medieval-combat-early-access-half-sword/</link>
            <guid>1414873</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Half Sword Games has finally unveiled an early access release date for its medieval combat simulator, Half Sword. The physics-based title emerged in October 2023 as a demo that turned (and impaled) heads <strong>very fast</strong>, almost entirely due to it being absolutely hilarious, in the worst way possible.</p>



<p>In Half Sword, you enter the arena against a range of opponents and use tricky, hard-to-master combat mechanics to slice, dice, crush, slash, slam, and impale your foes. It’s brutal, but the physics elements just make it an utter hoot to behold, and it’s finally entering early access on January 30.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-sword-hits-early-access-on-january-30">Half Sword Hits Early Access on January 30</h2>



<p>Half Sword’s demo was a roaring success, finding a social media and content niche that saw hilarious clips surface aplenty. The unique combat simulator focuses on being as realistic as possible while also being downright satirical. In one fight, you could be almost naked, windmilling your balled fists at enemies, and in another, you can be a knight in gleaming armor, decimating a group of peasants.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, more than 6,000 people were enjoying the Half Sword demo on Steam, and that’s with the test product representing a minuscule portion of the full potential of Half Sword Games’ first title.</p>



<p>To announce the impending early access launch, the team published a fantastic new trailer:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>They followed this up with a disclaimer of sorts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bugs, performance, occasional crashes and other things are being actively ironed out as well as fast as our tiny team can handle.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s so much to love about Half Sword, but fair warning – the fiddly mechanics are not easy to master <strong>at all</strong>. It’s the kind of game where a single misstep can result in a total wipeout and the loss of progress, such is the game’s progression system, so you’d best be ready to potentially rage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A release window has been set for the next game in the Control franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-resonant-confirmed-the-game-awards-remedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">At the 2025 Game Awards,</a> Remedy Entertainment announced the sequel to CONTROL would be released in 2026. CONTROL Resonant is the follow-up game to the popular 2019 action-adventure game. Now, a clear release window for the next game has been confirmed: Remedy announced to investors <a href="https://www.inderes.dk/en/research/remedy-release-of-control-resonant-marks-turning-point-in-investment-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in filings at the end of 2025</a> that Resonant would be released in the second quarter of 2026.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are now waiting for the release of Control Resonant at the end of Q2’26 (was H1’27), which has significantly altered our revenue estimates for the coming years. Additionally, we had previously assumed that Annapurna’s share of the game’s sales would be outside of Remedy’s income statement, but it appears that this share will also flow through Remedy. Thus, our revenue estimates have increased accordingly, but Annapurna’s share is reflected as an expense in the income statement as well. Our net assumption regarding Control Resonant’s returns for Remedy over the first three years remains essentially unchanged. We now assume that Remedy will receive royalties from the Max Payne project only in 2027 (was Q4’26), even though the game may still be released in 2026. We estimate that Control Resonant will sell approximately 1.8 million copies in 2026 and approximately 2.2 million copies in 2027. Consequently, Remedy’s revenue is projected to surpass 120 MEUR in 2026–2027, with EBITDA reaching slightly over 20 MEUR. Conditions for strong game sales are favorable, as the original Control has sold over 5 million copies and has additionally been played by over 20 million players across various platforms.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>A fictionalized Manhattan will be the setting for the open-world game. Fans will play as Dylan Faden and learn to control supernatural abilities with the promise that things will only get weirder as more information about the game is released.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Manhattan is at the peak of a paranatural crisis, the likes of which it has never seen, and the Federal Bureau of Control is running out of options. The FBC deploys Dylan Faden, their former captive, to take on a mysterious cosmic entity that is altering the fundamental aspects of our reality. As Dylan, you must harness your newfound supernatural abilities and take on a myriad of mind-bending threats.</p>



<p>Your fight will take you through multiple warped areas of Manhattan, allowing you to explore an unfamiliar world reshaped by a cosmic force that is defiling natural law, distorting gravity, and reordering Manhattan into a geophysical nightmare.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The CONTROL games also share the same universe as Alan Wake. The second game in the Alan Wake series has sold well over 2 million copies. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-over-2-million-copies-and-is-finally-profitable/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will provide updates on the next CONTROL game as more information becomes available.</p>
