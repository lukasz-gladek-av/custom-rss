<p>Phil Spencer has revealed that there is no top-down mandate to use AI for Xbox.</p>



<p>Some new details about Xbox have surfaced recently through an interview with the president, Sarah Bond. Bond recently stated that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-president-says-console-exclusives-are-antiquated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">idea of exclusive games is now antiquated</a>. She also confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-president-confirms-series-x-s-successors-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Series X/S successors</a> are in development. Now, a new interview with Phil Spencer talks about Xbox’s approach to AI. </p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-lets-creative-teams-choose-whether-they-want-to-use-ai">Xbox Lets Creative Teams Choose Whether They Want to Use AI</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://in.ign.com/xbox-series-s/245018/news/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-on-ai-use-much-more-operational-than-it-is-in-the-creative-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, during a panel at the Paley International Council Summit in Palo Alto, California (moderated by Double Fine Studio Head Tim Schafer), Phil Spencer spoke about the use of AI at Xbox. Spencer first spoke about how most use is focused on the “security and protection” of their networks. He added that the scale has grown so much that people alone cannot ensure safety. </p>



<p>Which is why they use AI to keep a check on the conversation and topics, protect child accounts, see who gets to talk to those people, and whether the account is locked down by parents or guardians who are setting those controls. </p>



<p>On the creative side of things at Xbox, AI use is left to the teams. Spencer explains that he has&nbsp;“found that creative teams will use tools that make their job easier when it makes their job easier, and any top-down mandate that ‘Thou must use a certain tool’…is not really a path to success.” The process is to make tools available for the teams and let things “organically percolate”. </p>

Additionally, Microsoft wants Xbox to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieve a 30% profit margin</a>, well above the industry standard.

<p>It seems that 2023’s Game of the Year, Baldur’s Gate 3, could make its way to the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>The Switch 2 is set to receive a whole bunch of new titles in the coming days, with Metroid Prime 4 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows </a>arriving in December 2025, followed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-nintendo-switch-2-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4 anniversary edition in 2026</a>. It seems that the next title Nintendo could be looking to add to its third-party collection is Larian Studios’ critically acclaimed hit. </p>



<h2 id="h-baldur-s-gate-3-could-be-a-great-third-party-addition-for-the-switch-2">Baldur’s Gate 3 Could be a Great Third-Party Addition for the Switch 2</h2>



<p>The talk about Baldur’s Gate 3 coming to the Switch 2 originates from NateTheHate’s recent reply on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1980357667035181154" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). In one of his recent replies, the insider was asked whether he had any updates for Red Dead Redemption 2’s launch for the platform. To which he replied, stating he doesn’t have anything new on RDR2, but he has “heard something on BG3 for SW2”. However, he needs “more verification” before he can share anything. In a later reply, Nate stated that he will update on this topic soon. </p>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 is a solid choice for Nintendo Switch 2 as it’s one of the most decorated titles out there. In April 2024, the title became the first game to win Game of the Year at all five major award ceremonies, including the Golden Joystick Awards, the Game Developers’ Choice Awards, the DICE Awards, the BAFTAs, and The Game Awards. The game has also received a lot of post-launch love from the developers, including loads of new content and enhancements to improve the gameplay experience. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield: RedSec Is Battlefield 6’s New Battle Royale Mode]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-new-battle-royale-mode.1334191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A fresh story has revealed that Battlefield: RedSec is the name for the rebranded battle royale game mode coming in Battlefield 6. ‘Firestorm’ is now a thing of the past, and BF 6 is gearing up for its strongly rumored October 28 battle royale shadow drop.</p>



<p>We’ve known for weeks that Battlefield 6 is getting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> mode. It features an innovative insta-death circle mechanic, and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">datamine revealed that the Battle Royale is to release on October 28</a>. Now, we’ve learned the new game mode’s full title. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-is-the-name-of-battlefield-6-battle-royale">Battlefield: RedSec Is The Name Of Battlefield 6 Battle Royale</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It will be war. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Get ready to enter Battlefield: RedSec! </p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ModernWarzone</a>‘s exclusive story, we’ve learned that this is the new name for EA’s rebranded, free-to-play battle royale mode in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Here’s what they’ve said about the news:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“EXCLUSIVE: The F2P Battlefield 6 battle royale is officially named “Battlefield: RedSec”. Releasing October 28th as previously reported, however, it looks like there won’t be any trailers or official announcements until the 28th itself, instead of a day before. Full on shadowdrop.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This doesn’t alter the gameplay in any way, but it is a cool name. It’s unclear if this is a way to get clear of Firestorm and start anew, or if Battlefield Studios is simply looking for a fresh relaunch.</p>



<p>Either way, the shadow drop is looking less like a shadow drop and more like a surprise birthday party where everyone knows it’s happening. Still, EA will be looking to right the wrongs of Firestorm and hope Battlefield: RedSec is the start of something special.</p>
