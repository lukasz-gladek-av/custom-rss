<p>Lumiose City is the home of Pokémon Legends Z-A and the successor to Legends Arceus. The release window is out in the tall grass, and the Pokémon Legends entry could pose stern competition to its contemporaries.</p>



<p>There was a year between <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A’s announcement</a> at the 2024 Pokémon Presents showcase and the first full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-release-window-extended-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a> at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 edition of Pokémon Presents</a>. It may have taken a while, but the wait was worth it, and we’re beholden to The Pokémon Company for revealing the scope of Lumiose City.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A looks to have taken feedback regarding Legends Arceus, so let’s see how long we’ve got to wait until we get our hands on it.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A is scheduled to release in Late 2025—but it doesn’t have a concrete launch date for now.</strong></p>



<p>The Pokémon Presents presentation on February 27 is where we learned about the title’s release window. The word “late” is vague, but it might not be hard to decipher if we consider previous Pokémon titles. Scarlet and Violet, Sword and Shield, Sun and Moon, and the Pokémon Brilliant Diamond&nbsp;and&nbsp;Shining Pearl remakes all came out in November of their respective years.</p>



<p>Yes, Pokémon Legends Arceus released in January 2022. But we’ve not had a new game for a while, so a <strong>November 2025</strong> is a likely release window for <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-legends-z-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>.</p>







<p><strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A is a Nintendo exclusive, meaning the only way you can play Legends Z-A is either through a Nintendo Switch—or the Switch 2 if the console is available at the time.</strong></p>



<p>Sadly, Pokémon games don’t release on formats other than Nintendo hardware or mobile. Despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation and Xbox’s escalating partnership</a>, don’t expect to see <strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A</strong> on another console. </p>







<p><strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A is still only advertised as a wishlist item, but with this being Nintendo, expect Pokémon Legends Z-A to cost $59.99 or £49.99.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo notoriously doesn’t discount games easily. It also launches all new AAA titles at full price. It’s almost a lock Legends Z-A will cost $59.99 or £49.99. You’d better save up your <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-will-discontinue-my-nintendo-gold-points-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Gold Points</a> before they’re discontinued.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s going to take some beating for Pokémon Legends Z-A to overtake Legends Arceus. What are your impressions of Pokémon Legends Z-A so far? Will the Switch’s technical performance hinder the title’s chances of being more Legendary than any Kanto birds could dream of?</p>
