<p>The CEO of Twitch, Dan Clancy, posted a recent update on the site’s blog page detailing some <strong>major </strong>changes coming to the platform. One of the most monumental points was around monetisation, which has long been a sticking point for streamers on the site.</p>



<p>It was revealed that in 2025, <strong>every streamer, </strong>regardless of their status, will be able to earn via subscriptions and ‘bits’. These features have, until now, been locked behind the ‘Affiliate’ wall, but this year, <strong>everyone </strong>will be able to take advantage of them.</p>



<p>Does this devalue becoming a Twitch Affiliate? Perhaps.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes-are-a-coming">Changes Are A-Coming</h2>



<p>In the post on the <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2025/02/27/what-s-next-in-2025-an-open-letter-from-twitch-ceo-dan-clancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch Blog</a>, the company’s CEO wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want you to be able to take advantage of our monetization tools, whether you’re just getting your community started, or have been on Twitch for a while.</p>



<ul>
<li>In 2025, we’re excited to open up monetization tools—subscriptions and bits—to most streamers, from day one. This will allow creators, regardless of their status, to grow their communities and start building earnings through direct patronage.</li>



<li>We’re also introducing an option, which will allow all streamers to use their earnings on purchases within Twitch.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>If you join Twitch <strong>right now</strong>, you’ll need to become an Affiliate streamer before you can accept bits and subscriptions. That means you need to jump through a few hoops first.</p>



<p>These new terms will mean that anyone can earn on Twitch regardless of their follower count or stream time.</p>



<p>The ‘most streamers’ clause is interesting, though. I’d assume it’s put there to suggest that streamers with infractions on their account can’t take advantage of these features.</p>



<p>Twitch is also preparing to offer more sponsorship opportunities to creators, and in 2025, the site wants to run more promotional events. </p>



<p>This year, it’s all about collaboration, and that’s reflected in pending changes being made to ‘Shared’ features, such as Hype Trains, Stream Together, and Shared Chat. It was also revealed in the blog post that mobile viewing is getting an upgrade, enhancing the options available to users consuming content via a mobile device.</p>



<p>Furthermore, <strong>clips </strong>will be upgraded, with creators unlocking more ways to edit and share their content as quickly as possible across a diversified portfolio of platforms.</p>



<p>I hate to admit it, but this update is a massive W for Twitch.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Next Fest is live</a> from now until March 3rd, celebrating upcoming games with dozens of playable demos. For many games with big aspirations, getting a demo into the hands of future players is crucial during Next Fest, and some are having greater success than others. </p>



<p>Here are the demos that are attracting the most players during Steam Next Fest for February 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-played-demos-at-steam-next-fest-february-2025">Most Played Demos at Steam Next Fest (February 2025)</h2>



<p>Player numbers are all current as of February 27th.</p>



<h3 id="h-mecha-break">Mecha BREAK</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>With 317,522 players at its peak, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870990/Mecha_BREAK_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mecha BREAK demo</a> is greatly outpacing the other demos available during this Next Fest. The third-person multiplayer mecha shooter has become very popular with the international audience, though critical reactions have been mixed. Many players enjoy the mix of games modes and the numerous customization options, but the demo still fields a Mostly Negative review on Steam, which is attributed primarily to the game’s monetization and server issues. Insider Gaming was invited to the NA offices of developer Amazing Seasun Games, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-interview-mecha-break-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got to talk to Mecha BREAK’s creator about the game’s development</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-fellowship">Fellowship</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/">Fellowship</a>, which has peaked at 16,721 players, is billed as a game for players that want to jump right into end-game dungeon content like you’d see in World of Warcraft. The game features “endlessly scaling dungeon runs,” and end-game WoW fans will feel right at home with the game’s user interface and group finder mechanic. Groups will need to kill packs of enemies to unlock the boss fight, which will feature unique mechanics and challenges that a team will need to overcome.</p>



<h3 id="h-among-us-3d">Among Us 3D</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Us 3D</a>, which has peaked at 6,729 players, is exactly what you think it is if you’ve ever seen Among Us before. 3D uses the same first-person perspective as Among Us VR, but without the need of a VR headset. Among Us 3D features built-in proximity chat, meaning you won’t need to use other programs to manually activate it. There will also be some new and returning mini-game tasks. The game will launch with the Skeld II and Polus Point maps from Among Us VR.</p>



<h3 id="h-roadcraft">RoadCraft</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3456580/RoadCraft_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RoadCraft</a>, which peaked at 12,559 players, is developed by the same Saber Interactive who made Snowunner and Mudrunner. But rather than operating a vehicle offroad, RoadCraft tasks you with rebuilding and reconstructing areas that have been ravaged by natural disasters. In RoadCraft, players will be able to unlock over 40 vehicles to help them replace roads, bridges, and other critical pieces of infrastructure.</p>



<p>While these demos may be the most popular, there are still dozens, it not hundreds of playable demos you should try during this Next Fest. And don’t fret, because <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-2025-steam-sales-schedule-revealed-by-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another Next Fest is coming in October</a>.</p>
