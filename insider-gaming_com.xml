<p>NZXT has released a lengthy response to claims that its Flex gaming PC subscription <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-scam-allegations-gamers-nexus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">service is a scam</a>. After an hour-long video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamers Nexus</a> dove into what it called a “predatory computer scam” from NZXT, the company not only posted a video with statements from its CEO Johnny Hou, but also listed out some of the actions they state will be taken.</p>



<p>“NZXT takes feedback seriously and, ultimately, wouldn’t be here if we didn’t listen to our community,” he said. “A lot of the issues are very serious, and it’s really important to us that we address each and every one of them.”</p>



<p>Regarding price increases after a subscription is started, Hou said that the “only instance” it’s happened is when they were required by certain states to start charging state taxes. </p>



<p>Hou then went on to talk about claims and “misconceptions” around changes to the hardware specs.</p>



<p>“You have to first understand that the Flex program doesn’t give you fixed specs,” he said. “We it comes to the availability of PC parts, it’s hard for us to control when Nvidia or Intel or AMD decide they’re going to need all the parts, so sometimes we don’t have more supply coming in. So, in the midst of that, we actually have to change the specs of our PCs.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>He then reaffirmed that you have to be at least 18 years old to sign up for the service. However, he didn’t address the claims that orders were being pushed through without proper identity verification. </p>



<p>As far as actions go, NZXT says that it will be pulling all “influencer-led” Flex advertising after statements were made within the adds that the company found to “not accurately reflect the details” of the program. They will also be updating the names of products offered through the Flex service in order to provide “a very clear distinction” between what is being bought versus what is part of the subscription.</p>



<p>After those two actions were announced, the <a href="https://nzxt.com/news/nzxt-update-addressing-your-concerns-about-the-flex-subscription-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company listed details</a> about what the Flex subscription program is and is not. You can read that via the company’s website.</p>



<h2 id="h-gamers-nexus-response">Gamers Nexus’ Response</h2>



<p>Not long after the response from NZXT, Gamers Nexus — the original source of the uncovering — made its own statement on what NZXT said. </p>



<p>“NZXT has posted a statement which not only misrepresents facts, but distorts the reality of their predatory rental computer program,” Gamers Nexus Editor-in-Chief Stephen Burke wrote. “The statement ignores major points and introduces several new concerns. GamersNexus has become aware of deeper elements connected to this story that GN has begun independently investigating.”</p>

<p>Delta Force, a highly-anticipated shooter reminiscent of Battlefield is out <strong>today</strong>. It was pieced together by Team Jade, a branch of TiMi Studio Group, the company that built the most popular COD game of all time – Call of Duty Mobile. For now, it’s a multiplayer-only offering, but Team Jade has confirmed when the game’s single-player campaign will be released.</p>



<p>There isn’t all that long to wait – the single-player portion of Delta Force will be available in January 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-hawk-down">Black Hawk Down</h2>



<p>Delta Force, which started life <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-name-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Delta Force: Hawk Ops</a> before the name came under scrutiny, is available today in open beta on PC.</p>



<p>In earlier testing periods, Delta Force presented an enjoyable and authentic large-scale combat experience that felt diverse and satisfying. Many have dubbed it ‘the better version of Battlefield 2042’, and it has plenty to offer users as it transitions into this open beta period.</p>



<p>Most players will be diving into the ‘Warfare’ mode, a 32 v 32 PvP mode bursting at the seams with military might. Users will be invited to explore land and air vehicles and go boots-on-the-ground with a dense arsenal of weapons across a series of maps.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, there is the ‘Operations’ portion of the game. This is a cooperative mode that pits three players against AI-controlled enemies as they explore developing objectives across a variety of environments.</p>



<p>Team Jade confirmed that in January, the game’s <strong>single-player </strong>component, a story based on the real-world events of ‘Black Hawk Down’, will be released on all platforms. That’ll arrive shortly after the game, which is designed to be crossplay across multiple platforms, is released on the iOS Store and Google Play, opening up two new, huge markets.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the ‘Black Hawk Down’ portion of Delta Force? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Square Enix is pulling the plug on future Foamstars season updates, less than a year after the game’s release.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/documents/notice-regarding-foamstars-season-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s website</a>, the studio said that season updates for the game will end on January 17 at the conclusion of the “Party Goes On!” season of the game. With this final season update, the studio is introducing features to “enhance gameplay”.</p>



<p>Those include the ability to customize shots for each character as well as new various enhancement elements.</p>



<p>“All online services will remain available after the “Party Goes One!” season ends,” Square Enix said. “In addition, we plan to hold the Foamstars Cup, a series of in-game events named after each character.</p>



<p>“Furthermore, to ensure that new players can fully enjoy Foamstars, previous Season Passes will be made available again. Players can switch between Season Passes at any time to proceed along the Season Pass track of your choice and obtain items from past seasons. This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season.”</p>



<p>First launched in February 2024 exclusively for PlayStation, Foamstars released to little fanfare. Ultimately, the game went <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/foamstars-free-to-play-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play in October</a> in order to build its player base.</p>

<p>It’s not every day that gaming actively prevents someone from succumbing to a catastrophic accident, but here we are. On social media, one user recently told the tale of how an Xbox Series S console <strong>may </strong>have saved his life when he was hit by a truck and sent sprawling from his bicycle.</p>



<p>Per the post, the Xbox Series S in his backpack prevented him from striking his head against the curb, and while he didn’t escape unscathed, he believes that if he wasn’t carrying the Series S, <strong>he could have died</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-divine-intervention">Divine Intervention</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Jonzey8828/status/1864267929463988625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Twitter</a>, ‘Brandon J’ explained his story in full:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was on my way home from my local GameStop with the Xbox in my backpack when I was struck by a truck while riding my bicycle. I managed to keep above the trucks steel bumper at first but I eventually was dragged under. I was slammed to the ground and still he kept going so I assumed he didn’t see me. The Xbox in my backpack prevented me from hitting my head or worse, even dying. </p>



<p>I wasn’t gonna get shredded beneath the truck so I used my left leg to attempt to slow the truck. At this point my bike wedged my right leg so I couldn’t move it anywhere. Next thing I know my backpack was only hanging on by my left shoulder and was slammed into the curb along with me afterwards. I look to my left and I feel the full weight of the front end of this truck roll up on my ribs and roll back off. </p>



<p>The truck hit and dragged me 12 feet and soon I was rushed to the hospital with only a single broken bone in my left foot and a few road rashes. I thought the Xbox was a goner but It started up with no hesitation at all and runs games surprisingly well considering what it went through. </p>



<p>If the Xbox wasn’t in my bag at the time a lot more could have happened…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By way of a response, Xbox offered to send Brandon a new Xbox console. The images shown by Brandon reveal a bashed, beaten, and bruised console that amazingly still works just fine. They were uploaded alongside shots of a hoodie bearing signs of some serious road rash.</p>

<p>In the comments under the post on social media, some users started joking that PlayStation could never, and others recommended that GameStop should start listing consoles for sale with crash test ratings. </p>



<p>Many jokes are made about the Xbox Series S, especially those focused on the console’s performance, but at least we can say it’s at least structurally sound.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals is out <strong>tomorrow</strong>, and it’s set to introduce a cultural shift in the hero shooter space, challenging the dominant position held by Overwatch 2 and snatching the attention away from Deadlock. Recently, the team at NetEase have been discussing how the game will work, revealing more characters and mechanics, further stoking the hype train.</p>



<p>One tidbit of information about how the game’s battle pass is going to work turned heads more than anything else, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-more-fomo">No More FOMO</h2>



<p>Typically, live-service games have seasonal battle passes that expire at the end of a given window, and thereafter, you’re prevented from unlocking any content you’ve missed and you’ll need to move on to the next season.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20241205/40954_1198123.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">going to challenge that</a> typical behaviour with a new mechanic: timeless battle passes.</p>



<p>When you purchase the ‘Luxury Battle Pass’, which is the paid version of the free battle pass, you’ll unlock the ability to redeem awards in said pass event after the season has ended. If you don’t dedicate enough time to the game to unlock the rewards in one season, they’ll roll over into the next, but you’ll be free to <strong>also </strong>move on to the next season if you desire.</p>



<p>That means that you won’t miss out on unlocking something <strong>far </strong>into the Luxury Battle Pass in Marvel Rivals just because you might not have the time to grind for it.</p>



<p>Not only that, but NetEase has recognised that the first season (or pre-season) of Marvel Rivals is going to be a shorter one, so they’ve reduced the price of the Luxury Battle Pass by 50% at launch.</p>



<p>Other developers have had their ways of addressing this ‘missing out’ issue. For instance, Bethesda Game Studios often offers ‘catch-up’ bundles in the Fallout 76 store, giving users the ability to catch up on missed rewards, but that comes with a hefty cost.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a good tactic that other developers should mirror? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Crimsix Has Returned to OpTic After Five Years Away]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/crimsix-optic-return-five-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crimsix-has-returned-to-optic-after-five-years-away.1052505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/crimsix-optic-return-five-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter has returned home, gravitating back to OpTic Gaming after a five-year hiatus. His Call of Duty career ended in 2022, and since then, he has become a successful racecar driver and iRacing creator. Following his departure from OpTic Gaming in 2019, Crimsix floated with a couple of organisations in the Call of Duty League but ultimately retired in September 2022.</p>



<p>In a seven-minute video posted on social media, OpTic welcomed back Crimsix, explaining why it’s such a natural decision to make all these years later.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-where-he-belongs">Back Where He Belongs</h2>



<p>Crimsix is part of the Call of Duty ‘dynasty’ represented by Scump, FormaL, Karma, and of course, the man himself. He’s the winningest Call of Duty player in the business, and his profile and abilities helped to spearhead the growth of the COD esports scene.</p>



<p>In 2022, he officially retired from Call of Duty and spun off into something completely different: racecars. Those who know Porter recognise his love for cars, and in the video posted by OpTic, he revealed that most of his income was spent in some way on cars, whether it be buying, maintaining, or upgrading them.</p>



<p>Speaking in <a href="https://x.com/OpTic/status/1864461424904302688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the video uploaded on Twitter</a>, OpTic’s CEO, Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s back to normal. Throughout the years, we’ve always kept in touch, he’s of my favourite players of all time, what he did for OpTic – it put us in a position to win every time.</p>



<p>I’ll always be appreciative of the time he spent here, so it was only right that when the time came for him to come back, after years of butting heads with FormaL, butting heads with Scump… </p>



<p>Bringing him back as we are is inevitable, he’s part of the family and he’ll always be part of the family.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Crimsix has been streaming plenty of Black Ops 6 during his downtime, and many have stressed that the former pro player still has the thumbs needed to win big, prompting plenty of long-time fans to demand his return to Call of Duty esports.</p>



<p>That’s not going to happen, though – but he does have a place back under the OpTic umbrella, and that’s worth celebrating.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see Crimsix back in OpTic? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
