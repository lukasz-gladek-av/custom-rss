<p>In 1996, Denis Dyack created Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, a game that would go on to spawn another four titles over the next seven years. The series license was secured by Crystal Dynamics in the late nineties, pulling control away from Dyack, who would then go on to direct and produce Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem, Metal Gear Solid: Twin Snakes, and Too Human.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, Denis Dyack will be fully unveiling his new game, dubbed a spiritual successor to Legacy of Kain arriving 30 years later. It’s called Deadhaus Sonata, and it’s an action RPG being pieced together by Apocalypse Studios. On social media, the team shared a short trailer, and the title is available to wishlist and <strong>examine closer </strong>on Steam.</p>







<h2 id="h-deadhaus-sonata-the-dead-do-not-sleep-forever">Deadhaus Sonata – ‘The Dead Do Not Sleep Forever’</h2>



<p>The Deadhaus Sonata team published a short trailer for their upcoming narrative-driven RPG on social media, showcasing some of the gameplay mechanics. The account was established way back in 2018, so the game has been in development for quite some time.</p>



<p>Fans of a vampiric tale will be enthused by Deadhaus Sonata’s blurb:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The creator of Legacy of Kain is back. Become the undead in a third-person narrative-driven action RPG where your choices shape your legend and the world around you. Feed to grow stronger, embrace powerful classes, and carve your path alone or in co-op through a dark realm filled with secrets.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142050/Deadhaus_Sonata/#app_reviews_hash"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s no release date yet for Deadhaus Sonata, but the game is being more fully unveiled tomorrow. What we do know is that it’ll be coming first to early access, allowing players to ‘become the undead’ and assume control of a powerful vampire with supernatural abilities.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The marketing spiel for Deadhaus Sonata is ambitious and promises a lot:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Deadhaus Sonata is a new dark fantasy world shaped by psychological depth, interconnected lore, and player-driven consequence. Every choice leaves a mark on your character and the world around you, with sentient gear, persistent events, and outcomes shaped by time, place, and action.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the game can be wishlisted on Steam <strong>now</strong>, the title’s website stresses that it’ll be available on ‘all major platforms.’</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>How’s 2026 going for you? I’m hoping you’ve at least kept up your NYT Connections streak – I know I have! If you’re looking for a quick way to solve today’s NYT Connections puzzle, look no further than this snapshot guide. I’ve got your NYT Connections hints and answers right here, ready to digest.</p>



<p>Read on to wrap today’s NYT Connections challenge and move on with your day!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-15">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 15)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #949:</p>



<ul>
<li>CEREAL</li>



<li>STATIC</li>



<li>MELTED</li>



<li>SNOW</li>



<li>LEVITATE</li>



<li>SALT</li>



<li>PATRON</li>



<li>SHOVEL</li>



<li>HOSE</li>



<li>STATIONARY</li>



<li>SPADE</li>



<li>JACKAL</li>



<li>FROZEN</li>



<li>RAKE</li>



<li>DANDRUFF</li>



<li>STILL</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all things you’d grab from a shed when working in the yard.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These all describe something that isn’t changing position or activity.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each of these can appear as tiny, thin pieces that fall, sprinkle, or scatter.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word hides two common male first names back-to-back (sometimes overlapping slightly in sound or letters).</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 15:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
