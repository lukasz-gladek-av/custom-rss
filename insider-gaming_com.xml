<p>The BLAST R6 Major Montreal tournament is unfolding as we speak, and this weekend, it’ll wrap as the action moves away from ‘Phase Two’ into ‘Phase Three’. Presently, the sixteen teams that made it into the Swiss System portion of the $750,000 tournament are battling away, but in just a few days, the victor will be crowned.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the tournament isn’t having as strong an impact as the last BLAST R6 Major, which took place in Manchester, England. Per a report published by Esports Charts, Montreal’s opening days pulled in 36% fewer viewers than the May Major, and things are yet to improve.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-weaker-traction">Weaker Traction</h2>



<p>Despite the tournament being days away from ending, the viewer count hasn’t risen all that sharply. On the first day of the tournament, per Esports Charts, the Montreal Major’s viewership peaked at 55,000 users. By today, that number has managed to climb to 78,000, but the Manchester Major’s peak hit 162,000 viewers.</p>



<p>It was the most popular BLAST R6 Major ever – but it was admittedly helped by an intense grand final between Team BDS, the tournament’s favourite to win, and beastcoast, an underdog side on a tenacious streak.</p>



<p>In the report published <a href="https://escharts.com/news/r6-montreal-major-day-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Esports Charts</a>, it was mentioned that fewer co-casters were covering the action at Montreal, which might go some way towards explaining the lower viewership, but we’re talking a single-digit difference. There’s still a solid spread of teams present at the event, from FaZe Clan to Team Liquid, so the fans <strong>should </strong>be eagerly tuning into the action.</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see how things pick up going into the weekend. The grand final for the BLAST R6 Major Montreal is set to take place this Sunday, and it’ll hopefully be the biggest and most popular match of the event.</p>

<p>A God Pack is a set of opened cards that almost have to be seen to be believed in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket. Every man and his Growlithe are desperate to secure this most sacred of packs, and if you’re a regular Pokémon&nbsp;Pocket player with no idea what I’m talking about, here’s some quick background on a God Pack.</p>



<p>The Genetic Apex set kicked off Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket at launch. The collection features an array of super-special pulls, and the contents of each Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pack boil down to pure luck and RNG—there are no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-bent-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bent Pack Tricks</a> or secret <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-exploit-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Pick exploits</a> here.</p>



<p>This being said, if luck is on your side, there’s a slim chance you can pull a God Pack—and immortalize yourself in the annals of Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket history.</p>



<h2 id="h-god-pack-explained-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">God Pack explained in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We can all dream. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A God Pack is when every card in a Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pack is either a Holographic, EX, Full Art, or Gold Crown</strong> <strong>card</strong>.</p>



<p>Ordinarily, you’re hoping for at least one of the above in each pack: Or two at a push! As of writing, the closest I’ve come to a God Pack is two occasions where I’ve had two different Full Art cards in the same pack.</p>



<p>Now, there’s a chance you dear reader haven’t even had two in a pack (don’t envy me, I’ve had plenty of stinkers too), but this is nothing compared to some of the obscene Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pulls out there. Trickery and clever photo and video editing are part and parcel of the modern age, so not all “God Packs” are to be believed. However, a quick search of “God Pack” on either X or the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/hot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TCG Pocket subreddit</a> is guaranteed to leave your jaw on the floor.</p>



<p>I’ve seen multiple packs featuring <strong>five Full Arts</strong>, and it’s absurd. The lowest pull percentage for a Full Art is <strong>5.263%</strong>—according to Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s Offering Rates—and it boggles the mind how it’s possible to get two, let alone <em>five</em>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-a-god-pack-in-pokemon-nbsp-tcg-pocket">How to get a God Pack in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket</h2>



<p><strong>You must get extremely lucky to get a God Pack in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket as it’s a completely luck-based process.</strong></p>



<p>There are no special items to use, no one-time-use percentage boosters, and no superstitions in the world that can boost your odds of getting a God Pack. Like any gacha-based system, Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s packs harness the concept of chance, inevitably leading to a ton of duplicates and disappointments once you begin to fill your compendium of creatures.</p>

<p>On November 20, Stellar Blade will receive its first major expansion in the form of a Nier Automata crossover. This will bring new characters and missions to the game, and it’ll come hand-in-hand with photomode and several new outfits. In this snapshot guide, we’re walking through all the new Stellar Blade outfits being added alongside the Nier Automata DLC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-eve-s-new-outfits-in-stellar-blade">Eve’s New Outfits in Stellar Blade</h2>



<p>To usher in Stellar Blade’s first major expansion, Eve will get four new outfits:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>FourSeconds Black</strong></li>



<li><strong>FourSeconds Everyday Wear</strong></li>



<li><strong>War Dress</strong></li>



<li><strong>Neurolink Skin</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>That’s in addition to the four outfits introduced with the Nier Automata crossover: 2B, A2, YoRHa, and 2B Black. Eve will also pick up a stylish new accessory – the Symbol of Legacy. When you use this item, it’ll change how Tachy Mode appears in the game. </p>



<p>Here’s a glance at the new Stellar Blade outfits coming with the Nier Automata DLC:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It hasn’t yet been revealed how to unlock the Nier Automata outfits in Stellar Blade, but that will inevitably be confirmed when the DLC is released on November 20. Most likely, users will be able to purchase the new skins from ‘Emil’s Shop’, a fresh trader interface introduced with the Nier Automata DLC. </p>



<p>The most exciting element of the update is the arrival of photomode, which fans have been eagerly waiting for since the game was released in April. The team at Shift Up has also added further lip-synching support for additional languages, better options for customisation (such as Eve’s hair), and various quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>Hideaki Itsuno, the name behind the Devil May Cry and Dragon’s Dogma franchises, has a new home. The director has taken up a leadership position at <strong>LightSpeed Studios Japan</strong>, a subsidiary of the giant Tencent.</p>



<p>Itsuno will use all his expertise to develop new AAA action games. Hideaki spoke about his new challenge in a <a href="https://www.lightspeed-studios.com/news/Japan-Game-Development-Studio.html">statement to the press</a>.</p>



<p>“<em>Joining LIGHTSPEED STUDIOS is an exciting new chapter for me.</em> <em>With LightSpeed’s strong development capabilities and global network, I’m looking forward to creating original AAA action games together with the amazing team and building innovative and beautiful experiences for the global community of gamers.</em> <em>We welcome all talented and passionate game developers from around the world to join our vision</em>.”</p>



<p>Based in Osaka and Tokyo, the studio’s idea is to build experiences that reach global audiences. Jerry Chen, president of LightSpeed Studios, had this to say:</p>



<p>“<em>The creation of LightSpeed Japan Studio is a significant step in the expansion of LIGHTSPEED STUDIOS and demonstrates our commitment to bringing the best possible games to our players.</em>”</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that the initiative isn’t messing around, signing one of Japan’s leading game developers. Obviously, we don’t have any more details about Hideaki Itsuno’s next adventure. Knowing the director’s style, we can at least hope for addictive combat.</p>

<p>Perks are a staple of Call of Duty games, and they’re extremely important for a successful loadout in Warzone. With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> integration, the battle royale title is getting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major overhaul</a>, which includes a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/area-99-revealed-as-new-resurgence-map-in-warzone-at-codnext-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new map</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-saug-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guns</a>, Perks, and the introduction of Wildcards.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-do-perks-and-wildcards-work-in-warzone">How do Perks and Wildcards work in Warzone?</h2>



<p>Warzone has a “Pick 3 System,” which means you can <strong>pick one Perk from each category</strong> (blue, red, and yellow.) You can then pick <strong>one Wildcard</strong> to compliment your loadout. These Perks will drop on the floor so that they can be looted again upon death.</p>



<p>Players will need to choose one Perk for each slot to make a combination of 3. Most of the Perks can be unlocked through leveling up, while the new ones added in Season 1 (Veteran and Reflexes) are unlocked via Season 1 event rewards. There’s no Combat Specialty. Wildcards are also earned through leveling.</p>



<p>There are also lootable Perks in Warzone that players can find to further fortify their loadout. These include four options from the Pick 3 System and two that are exclusive to loot – Shrouded and Irradiated. Lootable Perks will vanish upon death.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-get-specialist-perk-package-in-warzone">Can you get Specialist Perk Package in Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes</strong>, Specialist Perk Package is back in Warzone x Black Ops 6, and it can be found as a <strong>rare loot drop or via the Care Package Killstreak</strong>. It will give the player all 18 Perks plus the two bootable Perks for a total of 20. Upon death, the Specialist Perk Package will drop and can be looted by anyone.</p>
