<p>Netflix is looking into buying Warner Bros. Discovery, which could include the full library of Warner Bros. Games and intellectual properties (IPs).</p>



<p>The news <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-discovery-sale-potential-game-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes just over a week</a> after Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was opening up sales bids after it had received “unsolicited interest from multiple parties for the entire company.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/netflix-exploring-warner-bros-bid-1236603687/">Deadline</a>, Netflix has hired investment bank Moelis &amp; Co to explore a bid for the company. It’s the same firm that helped with Skydance’s merger with Paramount. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-could-happen-to-warner-bros-games-under-netflix">What Could Happen To Warner Bros. Games Under Netflix?</h2>



<p>What’s unclear, though possible to happen, is if a Netflix acquisition would see all of Warner Bros. Games be assumed into Netflix Games. Currently, Warner Bros. Games holds major gaming franchises such as Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC Comics, Game of Thrones, and more. </p>



<p>Warner Bros. Games also owns multiple studios, including Avalanche Software, NetherRealm Studios, Rocksteady Studios, TT Games, and WB Games studios in Montreal, Boston, New York, and San Francisco. All of which would likely be included in any sale. </p>



<p>Netflix declined to comment to Deadline on the report. Insider Gaming has also reached out to Warner Bros. Discovery for comment on whether any sale would include the games division. Thus far, no response has been received.  </p>



<p>Netflix has attempted to make a dent in the games industry in recent years, but it has never fully gotten off the ground. That said, the company is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-is-doubling-down-on-its-gaming-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continuing to invest in gam</a>ing on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-netflix-major-ip-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various fronts</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blue-ridge-hunting-is-six-one-publishing-first-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blue-ridge-hunting-is-six-one-publishing%E2%80%99s-first-game.1340488/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Six One Publishing, a new publishing wing from the team behind the Six One Indie Showcase, has announced the first game under its label. Introducing Blue Ridge Hunting, a co-op horror game set in the Appalachian Mountains from Jade Meadows.</p>



<p>Players will either go on the hunt solo or with up to two friends to follow the journey of Levi Chambers, <strong>“a disgruntled West Virginia native haunted by sightings of the infamous Mothman his entire life.”</strong> </p>



<p>The game, according to the press release, will explore themes of trauma, grief, and family through the lens of Appalachian folklore.</p>



<p><strong>“The Appalachian Mountains are steeped in some of America’s most chilling folklore, home to legendary cryptids and unexplained phenomena,”</strong> the game’s description reads. <strong>“Step into the boots of the Appalachian Investigation Group, a team dedicated to tracking these elusive creatures. Using a range of tools and equipment, gather evidence, follow the clues, and embark on high-stakes hunts based on real sightings and local legends.”</strong></p>



<p>Features of the game include (courtesy of Six One Publishing):</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Found Footage:&nbsp;</strong>A gritty retro/PSX art style inspired by early 3D horror and analog media.</li>



<li><strong>Always Listening:&nbsp;</strong>Creatures react to proximity voice chat and radio chatter. Communication is crucial, but dangerous.</li>



<li><strong>Into the Woods, Solo or Together:</strong>&nbsp;Explore the Appalachian wilds alone or with up to 5 players in online co-op freeplay mode.</li>



<li><strong>Bump In The Night:&nbsp;</strong>A narrative-driven story (1–3 players) following the Appalachian Investigation Group’s hunt for the truth.</li>



<li><strong>Experience The Legends:&nbsp;</strong>Face unique, intelligent creatures based on real Appalachian legends and folklore.</li>



<li><strong>Dark-Bluegrass Symphony:</strong>&nbsp;An original score that blends haunting melodies with Appalachian roots, amplifying the tension and tone.</li>
</ul>



<p>The game will launch first in early access and include a full story when 1.0 releases. There’s no release date just yet for Blue Ridge Hunting, but a demo is available now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2434930/Blue_Ridge_Hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Steam</a>, along with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jadecompany/blue-ridge-hunting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Kickstarter</a> to help with the game’s development. </p>

<p>Big releases continue to come thick and fast heading into the final months of the year, and the release date for Where Winds Meet stands out as one of the most anticipated in November.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet is set to make waves across the rest of the world, having made its mark in China upon release last year, with millions of players signing up for pre-registration rewards ahead of the drop of the free-to-play title.</p>



<p>If you’re eagerly awaiting the journey across ancient China and are ready to learn the ways of Wuxia combat, we’ve got all the important details on the release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-where-winds-meet-coming-out">When is Where Winds Meet Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>On the horizon. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Where Winds Meet is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC on Friday, November 14, and is available as a free-to-play title.</strong></p>



<p>Initially released in China in December 2024, Where Winds Meet’s global launch is on the horizon and has attracted a wealth of interest, receiving over seven million pre-registrations.</p>



<p>Almost a year since the release in China, Where Winds Meet is well-prepped for the global launch, and there isn’t too much longer to wait before you can begin your adventure.</p>



<p>As ever, though, there will be a bit more waiting depending on where you are located in the world, as the start times vary for time zones.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-where-winds-meet-start-time">Do We Know The Where Winds Meet Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Where Winds Meet has a global release of 3 PM PT on November 14, with access to the game opening for everyone across the world at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike a staggered release, which allows some players in Australia and New Zealand, for example, to be the first to jump in, there are no advantages for such locations this time. In fact, players in those time zones eagerly awaiting the release of Where Winds Meet will actually have to wait a little longer.</p>



<p>The doors open for Where Winds Meet at 3 PM PT, likely to be the same across all platforms, which means a wait until later in the evening, or even the next day, for some time zones.</p>



<p>The table below highlights the release time for Where Winds Meet in major time zones across the world, as shown by the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/where-winds-meet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>.</p>
