<p>PUBG’s time on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will be coming to an end in November with a transition to current-generation consoles, it has been announced.</p>



<p>As previously announced in the 2025 roadmap, preparations have been made to move the console version of PUBG onto current-gen consoles. Unfortunately for those on last-gen devices, it means an end to official support.</p>



<p>Players on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 will benefit from improved visuals, more stable frame rates, and reduced crashes. However, the headline is undoubtedly the end of support for last-gen consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-pubg-moving-to-current-gen-in-november">PUBG Moving to Current-Gen in November</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced on the <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, PUBG will no longer be playable or available to download on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on <strong>November 13, 2025.</strong></p>



<p>The end for the platforms will come following live server maintenance on the above date, though the schedule is subject to change depending on the review process for each platform.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that existing account data and purchased items will be “securely preserved,” with players having the ability to log into the game on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S at any time after the change to continue playing on an existing account—with no separate transfer required.</p>



<p>While Xbox Series X|S players will have their version upgraded via the platform’s Smart Delivery process on November 13, PS5 players are required to download the new PS5 version of PUBG from the PlayStation Store when the update is live.</p>



<p>In the announcement, it was added that a goal of “fairness across all platforms” is a major priority, with the intention to provide a stable 60fps experience across all platforms. To enable this, the Xbox Series S will have selectable options of a Resolution Mode and a Performance Mode.</p>



<p>Is the move to current-gen consoles long overdue for PUBG? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3293/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Black Ops 7 news and leaks are starting to come thick and thin. A Tac-Sprint rumor suggests that the developer is toying with the idea of removing Tac-Sprint altogether from Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, it’s claimed.</p>



<p>Tac-Sprint is an auto-run mechanic allowing you to move faster in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD</a>. It comes with a strict penalty, though: A slightly slower time to aim. Many skilled players have been able to master the nuances of the movement. But there are also plenty of people who wish it weren’t in the game. If you’re one of those people, you might get your wish.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-reportedly-trying-out-no-tac-sprint">Black Ops 7 Reportedly Trying Out No Tac-Sprint</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could be very divisive. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The leak/report comes from one <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostofHope</a>—one of Call of Duty’s most renowned insiders—who claims to have new information on Tac-Sprint.</p>



<p>“There’s currently a build of Black Ops 7 being tested right now that has no tac sprint. This doesn’t mean the final game won’t have it but this is a very GOOD sign,” they said on X.</p>



<p>Now, they have previously reported that Tac-Sprint <em>is</em> in the game. This has probably been the case in the past, but new developments can always arise. It’s quite likely that a lack of Tac-Sprint in some capacity is being tested for Black Ops 7.</p>



<div><article><p><span>There’s currently a build of Black Ops 7 being tested right now that has no tac sprint. This doesn’t mean the final game won’t have it but this is a very GOOD sign.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Whether the feature makes it into the full game remains to be seen. We’ll keep you updated on the latest rumors and leaks. Are you hoping Tac-Sprint sits BLOPS 7 out?

<p>A huge flood of gaming news is on the horizon with Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 right around the corner. For all the details you need, look no further than our guide.</p>



<p>The latter months of 2025 have been blown wide open following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-gta-6-delayed-release-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6’s delay</a> until next year, with plenty of new release dates expected to be announced during Opening Night Live. While not all will release this year, it should pack the schedule with a load to be excited about.</p>



<p>To make sure you don’t miss out on any of the fun, use our dedicated guide for a breakdown of all the important information. </p>







<figure><figcaption>Lock in. Image via Gamescom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Gamescom Opening Night Live takes place on Tuesday, August 19. As the name suggests, it marks the start of the entire Gamescom event.</strong></p>



<p>Gamescom itself runs until Sunday, August 24, with a variety of in-person events and showcases streamed online. This includes several playable titles, ranging from Hollow Knight: Silksong to Borderlands 4, and online showcases from Xbox, Bethesda, and the Future Games Show.</p>







<p><strong>Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 takes place at 11am PT/1pm CT/2pm ET/7pm BST/4am AST (August 20).</strong></p>



<p>The showcase is expected to start bang on time, with no initial countdown beyond the start time, so make sure you’re locked in and ready. If you do miss any of the announcements for one reason or another, we’ll have all of the biggest news and reveals on Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Here’s an easier way to see the times in your timezone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">13:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">14:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">19:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">04:00 (Aug. 2)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025 will be available to watch directly on both YouTube and Twitch.</strong></p>



<p>In our experience, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamescom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> is the best place to follow live streams such as this due to the fact that it’s often slightly ahead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamescom.global" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. So, if you’re scrolling social media at the same time, I highly advise watching through Twitch to avoid spoilers.</p>



<p>Choose whichever platform suits you, though, and remember to keep your eyes peeled to Insider Gaming for all the biggest news as it breaks.</p>



<p>You can also watch ONL through the <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamescom</a> website, while clips and trailers will likely be posted on TikTok.</p>







<p><span><b>Gamescom ON</b></span><strong>L</strong><span><b> 2025 takes place in Cologne, Germany, the home of </b>Gamescom<b>. Specifically, it’s at Hall 1 of the Koelnmesse.</b></span></p>



<p>A live audience is in attendance, with the event ticketed as part of the Gamescom event itself, with fans, media, and streamers in attendance to react to the latest news and reveals. Those with a ticket are advised to arrive by 6pm, with admission closing half an hour before the start.</p>







<p><strong>Gamescom ONL is expected to have a runtime of two hours, as shown by the events schedule on the official website.</strong></p>



<p>Similar to Summer Games Fest and the Game Awards, Geoff Keighley will host the event filled with new game announcements, trailers, gameplay reveals, and special guests. </p>

<p>Following a successful early access launch on PC, inZoi’s unique brand of life-sim gameplay is set to arrive on PS5 in 2026. It looks to include upcoming DLC and should be fully optimized for the console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-inzoi-money-cheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inZoi</a> was heralded as a rival to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-reiterates-plans-for-the-sims-4-multiplayer-the-sims-5-not-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sims</a>—in case you’ve forgotten, it’s the game that initially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-lets-you-run-over-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let you run over children</a>. With EA’s series into the hundreds of millions in terms of copies sold, there’s a lot of catching up to do. inZoi achieved <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-1-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one million copies sold</a> within its first week.</p>



<p>Numbers have dropped off since, but this is to be expected. A PS5 release could be what inZoi needs to get back into the picture.</p>



<h2 id="h-could-inzoi-rival-the-sims-domination">Could inZoi Rival The Sims’ Domination?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hot and steamy on PS5. Credit to Inzoi Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a press release, <a href="https://www.krafton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Krafton</a> declared: “inZOI, its immersive life simulation game, will launch on PlayStation 5 in the first half of 2026. The PS5 version will be fully optimized for console, bringing players the same robust gameplay experience featured on PC.”</p>



<p>The port features “All of the key systems and features that define the PC experience, reworked for console controls and performance to ensure a seamless and intuitive gameplay experience.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-developers-say-ability-to-run-over-children-was-a-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Running over children was eventually declared a bug</a>, so don’t expect to do that on PS5. However, the first major DLC expansion is on the way in 2025—Island Getaway. I’d expect this to come with the PS5 launch, but it remains to be seen if it’s free.</p>



<p>Have you played inZoi on PC? Is there any potential at all for it to challenge The Sims, or other life-sim legends like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-fortnite-shadow-briefings-locations-in-chapter-6-season-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-fortnite-shadow-briefings-locations-in-chapter-6-season-4.1268766/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Chapter 6 Season 4 is well underway in Fortnite, with a bunch of new Weekly Quests to complete, and locating Shadow Briefings is required if you want to net a handy boost for your Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Shadow Briefings are not new in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=Fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, instead being guaranteed in pretty much every chapter and season that features, but the spawn locations can vary. As such, it can be difficult to track them down in times of need.</p>



<p>We’re here to make things easier, however, by pointing you in the direction of all the Shadow Briefings locations in Chapter 6, Season 4. We’ve also included our tips on the best landing spots to help you complete the quest.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-shadow-briefings-locations-in-chapter-6-season-4">Fortnite Shadow Briefings Locations in Chapter 6 Season 4</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pick your spot. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Shadow Briefings spawn randomly at the start of each game, though they do have set spawns—which we’ve highlighted on the map above.</strong></p>



<p>Given the spawns are random, there are no guaranteed spots where you can secure Shadow Briefings. However, as the map shows, some areas are better than others, with a few potential spawns in close proximity. </p>



<p>The best spots I’ve found are:</p>



<ul>
<li>South of the Burd To Go in the northwest of the map.</li>



<li>The Resistance Base in the northeast of the map.</li>



<li>O.X.R HQ in the mid-west of the map.</li>
</ul>



<p>Heading to these locations is a great starting point in your hunt, given the potential spawns nearby. They also offer a decent haul of loot, so you will be well prepared if you encounter enemy players.</p>



<p>It may still take a few matches to tick off the quest entirely, however, but with these locations at your disposal, it won’t take too much time to knock out. You can also revisit the same spot if you enter a different match. </p>

<p><strong>As you approach a Shadow Briefing spawn in Fortnite, a white laptop will appear on your map marking the location.</strong></p>



<p>To complete the weekly quest, follow these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Head to one of the locations on the map above to find a Shadow Briefing.</li>



<li>Approach the briefcase and interact with it to accept a mission.</li>



<li>Complete this step three times to tick off the Weekly Quest.</li>
</ol>



<p>As the Weekly Quest only tells you to find and accept Shadow Briefings, you don’t need to complete the missions they provide. However, if you do, you can net yourself some decent loot and some additional experience.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 already boasts over 600,000 pre-order sales on Steam and has a whopping wishlist total of 2.7m, according to new data.</p>



<p>The EA title is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated games of the year, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over half a million players</a> jumping in during the first Open Beta weekend. The Battlefield 6 Open Beta <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/">return</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-i-play-the-battlefield-6-beta-again/"> this weekend</a> and could hit similar numbers, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new map and modes being added.</a></p>



<p>While Open Beta numbers don’t necessarily guarantee success, it appears the stars are aligning for EA with Battlefield 6 as the pre-order sales and wishlists on Steam suggest the community is ready to purchase.</p>

<p>According to data from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a>, over 600,000 pre-orders have been placed for Battlefield 6 on Steam, while a whopping 2.7m players have added the title to their Steam wishlist.</p>



<p>The data adds that this translates to revenues of around $35m on Steam alone, with Battlefield 6 sitting at number two last week for revenues on Steam and number three for totalsales. Of course, this only equates to one platform, too.</p>



<p>Battlefield’s 6 impressive numbers have been rising for a while, however, taking just a few days to surge past the 500,000 wishlist mark when the game was added to Steam last month, including a staggering period from July 25 to 30 with between 95,000 and 150,000 players adding the game to their wishlists each day.</p>



<p>Those numbers put Battlefield 6 in sixth position in Steam’s top wishlisted games, behind only Hollow Knight: Silksong, Subnautica 2, Deadlock, Borderlands 4, Light No Fire, and ARC Raiders. </p>
