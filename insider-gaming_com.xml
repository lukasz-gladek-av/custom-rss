<p>Ready for Black Friday? With Christmas just around the corner, many gamers are trying to grab the best deals possible. Like every year, Xbox has quite a few deals people can choose from. Here are the best Black Friday Deals for Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-xbox-series-x-s-black-friday-deals">Best Xbox Series X|S Black Friday Deals</h2>



<p>Excited to find the best Xbox Series X|S deals this Black Friday? Well, Xbox will be doing quite a few deals for Xbox Series X|S systems, controllers and games.</p>



<p>However, no actual Black Friday deals have been released by the company, many are already speculating that the system will have huge bundle deals at stores like Walmart, Target, Best Buy and more.</p>



<p>Every year, too, many of these popular retail stores have a bunch of different discounts on games. With popular titles like Call of Duty just releasing a new game, gamers should expect to see deals revolving around the games to release on Black Friday.</p>







<h2 id="h-current-xbox-series-x-s-deals">Current Xbox Series X|S Deals</h2>



<p>Luckily, Xbox has a ton of deals already in its store, meaning gamers can indulge in the Black Friday festivities early on. Below is a list of current Xbox deals gamers can grab in the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/promotions/sales/sales-and-specials">Microsoft store:</a></p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X ($50 off)</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The page also has quite a few games for sale, too. However, the majority of these games for sale are not big titles. The big titles, like Call of Duty and more, will not be released until Black Friday.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-black-friday-deals">How to Get Black Friday Deals</h2>



<p>Luckily, Black Friday deals are not as difficult to come by as they were in the past when you had to wait outside a store until midnight. Many retailers, like Walmart and Target, will release their deals earlier in the day on Thanksgiving, giving consumers the chance to grab whatever their heart desires early on.</p>



<p>Still, many deals, especially on Xbox games and systems, will go incredibly fast, so be prepared to have your money out.</p>

<p>EA Sports and the Professional Women’s Hockey League (PWHL) <a href="https://www.thepwhl.com/en/news/2024/november/13/pwhl-to-be-featured-in-ea-sports-nhl-25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have announced</a> that the league will be coming to NHL 25 in December.</p>



<p>Starting December 5, all six PWHL teams — Boston Fleet, Minnesota Frost, Montréal Victoire, New York Sirens, Ottawa Charge, and Toronto Sceptres — will be added to the game to play in a number of modes. Those include Play Now, Online Versus, Shootout and Season. In addition to being playable in modes, PWHL content will be added to the World of Chel as well Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT).</p>



<p>The launch comes alongside the start of the PWHL’s second season.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to bring the PWHL into NHL 25 as part of a massive holiday update, giving players all-new ways to play, starting in a couple of days with the frenetic energy of NHL Arcade through to the launch of 4 Nations Face-Off in the New Year,” NHL 25 Executive Producer Bill Dollar said.</p>



<p>Women’s hockey has been a growing presence in the EA Sports NHL series for a number of years with international teams being a part of the last handful of games. The PWHL marks the first women’s league to be added to the franchise. In the past, EA Sports did speak with the NWHL about possible inclusion, but no deal was ever reached.</p>



<p>As far as this update is concerned, not all likenesses will be scanned and into the game when the update comes. That said, there is a plan to add more via updates to NHL 25.</p>



<p>In addition to the PWHL, EA Sports announced that the Four Nations Tournament and a new Arcade mode are both coming to NHL 25.</p>



<p>What do you think of the PWHL coming to NHL 25? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>
