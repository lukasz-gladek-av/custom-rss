<p>G2 Esports will reportedly hold on to Russian <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/">CS2 superstar and AWP sensation Ilya “⁠m0NESY⁠” Osipov</a> during this upcoming post-Major roster shuffle. Team Falcons, who reportedly have already gotten the other G2 superstar Nikola “⁠NiKo⁠” Kovač to join them in 2025, will have to look elsewhere.</p>



<p>While these moves are not official yet, they will drastically shake up the CS2 landscape at the start of 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-g2-lock-down-m0nesy">G2 lock down ⁠m0NESY⁠</h2>



<p>The 19-year-old sniper superstar has been highly sought after by the Saudi Arabian for some time. Given his fondness for playing alongside NiKo, many speculated that m0NESY would depart alongside him. <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40587/sources-m0nesy-likely-staying-at-g2-despite-falcons-interest-tc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HLTV reported</a> that ⁠m0NESY⁠ “considered” Falcons offer to join the roster as part of a massive overhaul.</p>



<p>With NiKo garnering a reported $1 to $1.2 million transfer fee, m0NESY could easily fetch an even higher price from Falcons. He finished the the 2024 season as one of the consensus best players in the world. With m0NESY signed to G2 for the rest of 2025, the organization has opted to turn down Falcons’ offer and keep him. G2’s goal for 2025 is to make m0NESY the focal point of the roster, and they’re risking him leaving after 2025 as a free agent to do so.</p>



<p>The hope for G2 now is that Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa can step into the star position left vacant by the departing NiKo. malbsMd had a breakout performance at the Perfect World Shanghai Major, and if he takes on a bigger role while m0NESY stays, the offseason becomes far less daunting for G2.</p>



<p>Falcons are no strangers to getting spurned while pursuing superstars, as they notably failed to acquire NiKo from G2 last year. The organization will now have to look elsewhere for an AWPer, having terminated legendary AWPer Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev’s loan from NAVI back in November.</p>



<p>Is G2 doing the right thing by keeping m0NESY?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>XDefiant is preparing for the ultimate wind-down ahead of its inevitable closure in just a few months. It was recently confirmed by Ubisoft that XDefiant will be taken offline on June 3, 2025, but before then, the team has pushed out one final patch that includes a staggering amount of content.</p>



<p>Per the <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1869382398929965418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> and confirmed by Mark Rubin on Twitter, the season three update for XDefiant includes additional content from <strong>the next five seasons</strong>, which will otherwise never see the light of day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-a-farewell">What a Farewell</h2>



<p>In the post on Twitter, Mark Rubin explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft has not only allowed a small team to stay on and continue working to get our Season 3 content out the door, but we’ve also been able to add some extra content to this release from future seasons. </p>



<p>So, we have our Season 3 content plus some of the content from Season 4, 5, 6,7 and even Season 8. </p>



<p>We are adding 3 new factions this patch with the Assassin’s of course that was planned for Season 3 but also Wolves and Omega Force from Seasons 4 and 5 respectively.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Along with the new factions come six new ‘Arena’ maps and three new ‘Linear’ maps that were planned to be released further down the line. That’s a total of 13 new maps – but if you’ve never downloaded XDefiant, you’ll not be able to access them, which makes them somewhat rare.</p>



<p>This includes a new ‘Rayman map’ that was scheduled for a takeover event midway through season four.</p>



<p>Also, season three marks the arrival of a more esports-focused mode: Defuse. This is the traditional one-life bomb mode that serves as the foundation for games like Rainbow Six Siege and Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<p>Those still playing will also have access to ‘Lum Hunt’, ‘Tilt’, ‘Turbo XD’, and a vs-bots mode</p>



<p>This is all in addition to new weapons such as the G36K, M1A, and Diceros pistol. Everything that was added behind battle passes has been unlocked for the audience still able to access the game.</p>



<p>It’s one hell of an update, but it’s a farewell patch at best for XDefiant.</p>
