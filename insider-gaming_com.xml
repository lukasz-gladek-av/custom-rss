<p>Developer Argonaut Games announced that the remaster for Croc Legend of the Gobbos has been delayed into 2025. The game was originally scheduled to be released in December 2024.</p>



<p>In a message <a href="https://x.com/ArgonautGames_/status/1865093859237056975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted online</a>, Argonaut said that game will now launch in Q1 2025.</p>



<p>“After careful consideration, we have decided to push the launch into Q1 2025,”  they said. “This decision was not made lightly, but we believe that a little more time is needed to add the final touches to ensure the game meets the high standards that we aspire to and which you deserve.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The statement continues by acknowledging that the news is “disappointing” for players to hear. The team wanted to make sure, however, that the game had the “quality and polish” it needs for release.</p>



<p>“[Our] goal has always been to deliver a game with the quality and polish that will truly delight,” they said. “We appreciate your patience and support as we work to bring Croc back in the best possible way.”</p>



<p>Despite the game’s delay, Argonaut seems excited about the return of the franchise. In a reply to a <a href="https://x.com/ArgonautGames_/status/1865976674568880358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fan on Twitter</a> on Sunday, they teased more Croc remasters, including Croc 3, should the first game do well when it launches.</p>



<p>“We’ve already stated that if the Croc remasters do well, we’d like to make Croc 3,” they said.</p>

<p>EA FC 25’s servers are unpredictable at best. It doesn’t matter how good your internet connection and speed are, if the servers don’t want to play ball (literally), then there’s nothing you can do. So let’s update you with the latest EA FC 25 server status changes.</p>



<p>It’s happened to us at all at some point. You’re ready for an epic EA FC 25 sesh with epic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ea-sports-fc-25-tactics-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tactics</a> at the ready, and you’re met with an “unable to connect to the EA servers” screen. EA FC 25 servers are not immune to this most frustrating issue, and I wish I could give it a red card.</p>



<p>We don’t need VAR to help us crack the mystery of EA FC 25’s server status though. There are a few ways to monitor the soccer title’s online servers and keep up with their latest developments.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-ea-fc-25-servers-down">Are EA FC 25 Servers Down?</h2>

<p><strong>Right now, EA FC 25 servers are not down, and they are fully operational and running without a hitch.</strong></p>



<p>Our latest personal check of the EA FC 25 servers is happening now on Dec. 9, 2024. It’s not always easy to keep track of these things though, so, I’ve come up with a multitude of ways you can use to keep an eye on the EA FC 25 servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-ea-fc-25-server-status">How to Check EA FC 25 Server Status</h2>



<p>You can use <strong>EA’s official help page</strong>, <strong>track EA’s X social media communications and EA Help channels</strong>, and keep up with <strong>people’s real-life experiences of the EA FC 25 servers</strong> for the latest information.</p>



<h3 id="h-ea-fc-25-server-help-page">EA FC 25 Server Help Page</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/faq/are-ea-servers-down/?isIhi=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA Help</a> site has tons of different answers for technical questions related to the company’s various games. One of its main uses is the live service check which tracks the online connectivity status of online EA titles. </p>



<p>It includes the EA App and EA Play, along with a bunch of games: Apex Legends, Battlefield 2042, EA SPORTS College Football 25, EA FC 24, EA FC 25, FIFA 23, Madden NFL 24, Madden NFL 25, NHL 24, NHL 25, STAR WARS Battlefront II, The Sims 4, and EA SPORTS UFC 5.</p>



<p>I would be remiss to mention this crucial line on the page though: “We update this page as quickly as possible when a server goes down, <strong>but there might be delays</strong>.” Even though this is a handy source, there are other ways of checking the EA FC 25 servers we need to consider.</p>



<h3 id="h-ea-help-amp-ea-sports-fc-communications-on-x">EA Help &amp; EA Sports FC Communications on X</h3>



<p>Social media site X has two different pages I think are useful for monitoring EA FC 25’s server status issues: <a href="https://x.com/EAHelp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA Help</a> and <a href="https://x.com/EASFCDirect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA SPORTS FC Direct Communication</a>.</p>



<p>EA Help is recommended by EA itself as a more up-to-date page that has the chance of being refreshed quicker than the main Server Help page.</p>



<p>Whereas EA SPORTS FC Direct Communication is a more general way of talking to the player base. Depending on the server status and major outages, it’s always handy to have, just in case.</p>







<p>People like ourselves are as relatable as anyone. If the servers are down and affecting me, there’s a good chance I’m going to complain about it. Many players take to different forms of social media to complain—inadvertently giving a <strong>live update on the situation</strong>.</p>



<p>This is why I’m pushing you to bookmark the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports FC Reddit</a>, as well as the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/easportsfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord server</a>. If you ignore the complaint posts about EA FC 25, there’s a lot of helpful information on these boards!</p>

<p>LEGO Fortnite, the original survival crafting game launched in December 2023, has changed its name to LEGO Fortnite Odyssey. A new Storm Chasers update for this game mode will arrive tomorrow, December 10, along with the name change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s Discover section now has a unique LEGO Fortnite Category, where players can find Odyssey and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-fortnites-brick-life-game-mode-arrives-this-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brick Life</a> as the new game modes. In Odyssey, players will find that the Storm King has invaded the world, and it’s up to them and their friends to take care of him and his storm-wild legion, which Raven leads.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-fortnite-storm-chasers-update-nbsp">LEGO Fortnite Storm Chasers Update&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Your new LEGO Fortnite Odyssey journey will begin at Storm Chaser village, where you meet characters like Carl Ruckus and Dr. Borrasca. Then, you will head out into the storms, where Storm Dungeons are located. Within these dungeons, you will find fragments of Storm King’s power that must be destroyed to loosen his control over the world. The enemies you are up against include the Acolytes, Raven and The Storm King himself.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-gameplay-mechanics">New Gameplay Mechanics</h2>



<p>LEGO Fortnite Odyssey’s Storm Chasers Update also introduces a set of new gameplay mechanics. Enemy health has been balanced, along with their health and damage points. Component-based crafting has been introduced, bringing more flexibility when choosing which materials to use. The Legendary Forge is an upgrade station that you can use to take your tools to the next level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, other players and NPCs can now revive players to get them back into the action. There are new vehicle-guided builds, such as the ‘Lil’ Barge’ and ‘Storm Chaser’. Lastly, LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is fully compatible with split-screen on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>
