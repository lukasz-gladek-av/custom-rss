<p>The countdown to IEM Rio 2026 is well underway, and in the run-up to the event, ESL has unveiled the complete lineup of teams set to compete at the upcoming CS2 spectacle. The tournament kicks off on April 13 and will run for <strong>six days</strong>, with all comers battling for the biggest piece of the $1 million prize pool in Rio de Janeiro.</p>



<p>ESL confirmed the full roster of direct invites sent on January 15, along with the spread of teams selected for the GCQ and ACQ. From these qualifiers, another three teams will surface, two coming from the global bracket and one from the Americas bracket.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-teams-confirmed-for-iem-rio-2026-by-esl">All Teams Confirmed for IEM Rio 2026 by ESL</h2>



<p>The ESL posted a graphic on social media revealing the split of teams invited to IEM Rio 2026. Here’s the full rundown:</p>



<p><strong>Direct Invites</strong>:</p>

<p>Fans noticed a few notable absences, namely from the organizations that were quick to decline their invites: Astralis, NiP, and FlyQuest, for instance. In the Americas Closed Qualifier, PaiN, NRG, and M80 all declined a spot.</p>



<p>There’s more than the face-value price pool to play for at <a href="https://pro.eslgaming.com/tour/2026/01/iem-rio-2026-invited-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IEM Rio</a>, of course. The tournament is one of the main contributors to the ESL Grand Slam, which awards <strong>one organization </strong>$1 million. It’s the most prestigious prize in the Counter-Strike 2 space, and it’s what many of these teams play for.</p>

<p>Prime Video has uncovered our first look at Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, ready and in costume for the upcoming live-action adaptation, the first since 2018’s reboot starring Alicia Vikander.</p>



<p>Fan feedback has been mixed so far, with the Tomb Raider community divided on whether they approve of the casting or not. The team at Prime Video has opted for a classic reimagination of the traditional Lara Croft from the original games, but not everyone is happy.</p>







<h2 id="h-sophie-turner-s-lara-croft-is-dividing-fans">Sophie Turner’s Lara Croft is Dividing Fans</h2>



<p>It was just a few days ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazons-tomb-raider-announces-multiple-castings/">Prime Video uncovered</a> an array of castings for the upcoming live-action Tomb Raider <strong>series</strong>. It has been several months since Sophie Turner was confirmed as playing the iconic lead, but others have since moved into the frame, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sigourney Weaver</li>



<li>Jason Isaacs</li>



<li>Martin Bobb-Semple</li>



<li>Jack Bannon</li>



<li>John Heffernan</li>



<li>Bill Paterson</li>



<li>Paterson Joseph</li>



<li>Sasha Luss</li>



<li>Juliette Motamed</li>



<li>Celia Imrie</li>



<li>August Wittgenstein</li>
</ul>



<p>The more recognizable characters among the roster are the likes of Zip, Atlas, and Winston, all of whom have previously appeared in the decades-old series.</p>



<p>Sophie Turner, who will assume the role of Lara Croft, recently underwent a wardrobe test, appearing in a shot posted on social media earlier today by Prime Video. While the outfit is very much on point, fans aren’t entirely sure if she fits the <strong>look</strong>. In recent months, Turner revealed a physical regime designed to get her in shape to play the adventurous archeologist, but that’s not enough for some.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the comments under the post, one user wrote, ‘It’s difficult seeing anyone in this role besides Angelina Jolie.’ Another wrote, ‘I don’t see Lara anywhere. Sorry.’</p>



<p>The feedback is mixed but leaning in favor of the general acceptance of Turner’s portrayal.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-leaks-rumors/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is many fans’ favorite in the series. The seamless blend of traditional AC gameplay and movement was woven beautifully with pillaging and pirate pilates. There have been endless talks about an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake for an eternity, so here’s the latest on the rumored title.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flags-steam-page-adds-new-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a> is a special game, and anyone who’s played it can sense this very quickly. You could argue that no other game has perfectly captured the feeling of being an exploring and exterminating pirate assassin. Nostalgia is kicking in even while writing about this—might need a lie down and a pint of grog to comfort the soul.</p>



<p>Before that, here’s a look at Black Flag Remake rumors and leaks.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-getting-a-remake">Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Getting A Remake?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It should be a whale of a time. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Insider Gaming can confirm that an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is happening, and you can start preparing yourself for its inevitable launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you haven’t been following Insider Gaming’s coverage, you have missed out on a wild adventure so far. The first confirmation that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake was in development</a> started in January 2024. A Tom Henderson exclusive then pulled back the curtain on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-further-details-on-the-assassins-creed-roadmap-and-what-games-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Roadmap, and what games to expect</a> over the next few years.</p>



<p>It revealed that the Black Flag Remake was happening. These suspicions grew stronger after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft reuploaded Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Soundtracks</a> in January 2026, </p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake-coming-out">When Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake Coming Out?</h2>



<p><strong>Insider Gaming exclusively confirmed that the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is coming out before March 31, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Given that it’s January 2026, you should start getting excited, if you aren’t already! The exclusive story said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is set to launch before March 31</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/33qBiRpCj1Z9Ib5bbfbg5r/d4ab539ca9edd1fa28ebc0aec5b1af27/Ubisoft_H1_FY26_Slideshow_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft H1 FY26 EARNINGS</a> from November 21, 2025, mentioned several games for 2026, with one game listed as an “Unannounced Title.” This is expected to be the Black Flag Remake.</p>



<p>There’s still no exact launch date, but it’s getting closer than a pirate is to water after reaching the end of the plank.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-resynced">What Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced?</h2>



<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced is reportedly the new title for the Black Flag Remake.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone has been referring to a reimagining of the fourth mainline game as the ‘Black Flag Remake’ for a while. Ubisoft has seemingly mooted this with the appearance of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced on the PEGI Ratings site</a>.</p>



<p>As long as it keeps ‘Assassin’s Creed Black Flag’ in the name, it could add ‘Reimagined Pirate Paradise’ on the end, and everyone would still buy it!</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-amp-leaks">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake Rumors &amp; Leaks</h2>



<p><strong>Some of the biggest Black Flag leaks and rumors include suggestions that the game will be more RPG-Heavy than its original incarnation.</strong></p>



<p>Surprisingly, we haven’t heard too many inner details about the actual gameplay, more its release window. Leaks have indicated that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-new-details-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remake is more RPG-Heavy</a>: “Similar to Origins and Shadows.”</p>



<p>Resynced will allegedly also get rid of the modern-day aspects that many dislike about Assassin’s Creed.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/runescape-rs25-project-most-ambitious-evolution/</link>
            <guid>1406866</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new press release, the team at Jagex has confirmed that this year, which marks the 25th anniversary of <strong>RuneScape</strong>, will be the biggest yet in the game’s quarter-century on the market. It was promised that more investment and content development will be rolled out in 2026 than ever before, making for an ambitious roadmap for RuneScape fans everywhere.</p>



<p>The ‘RS25’ programme sets the stage for ‘the most ambitious evolution in RuneScape history.’ The pipeline includes the RuneFest event in the United Kingdom, an OSRS LAN event, better creator commitments, and a ‘reborn RuneScape.’</p>







<h2 id="h-runescape-is-evolving-more-than-ever-in-2026">RuneScape is Evolving More Than Ever in 2026</h2>



<p>RuneScape is turning 25 this year, and that’s not a milestone that many active games have ever managed to celebrate. As an MMORPG, RuneScape was part of the pioneering effort that eventually led to live-service games – titles that evolved over time and constantly provided fresh content and updates to players.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/runescape-membership-charge-tiers-online/">an entirely smooth journey</a> getting here, but the milestone year has finally arrived, and Jagex has a wealth of plans for 2026.</p>



<p>In October, RuneFest 2026 will be held in Birmingham, England, featuring live reveals, developer sessions, and ‘unforgettable community moments.’ RuneScape is taking to the stage in the US with the Deadman All-Stars Live production, and later in the year, a creator-backed LAN event will be held (location pending).</p>



<p>An all-new press release revealed what’s coming this year to the game ecosystem itself</p>



<blockquote>
<p>RuneScape will enter a new chapter with a comprehensive rejuvenation rooted in integrity, visual renewal, and a renewed focus on what makes the game special. Alongside a long-requested Player Avatar refresh and meaningful visual upgrades,&nbsp;and major improvements to player support,&nbsp;all designed to better serve the community at the heart of RuneScape.</p>



<p>This new era will also see the removal of RuneScape’s microtransaction system, Treasure Hunter, following the community vote in November 2025, marking a major step forward in player-first design and transparency.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-shadow-drops-runescape-dragonwilds-in-early-access/">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a> will also expand through 2026 after a successful launch last year.</p>



<p>Jagex was <strong>also </strong>promoting <a href="http://www.runescape.com/25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive merchandise line</a> produced to celebrate the substantial company milestone. As the year unravels, more merchandise will be released across the line.</p>



<p>In a statement, the CEO of Jagex, Jon Bellamy, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s incredible to think a quarter century has passed since&nbsp;RuneScape’s&nbsp;beginnings as a Java-based browser game</em>. <em>Today we’re speaking to the largest and most active&nbsp;RuneScape&nbsp;community in our history, and this milestone is as much theirs as it is ours.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at Jagex uploaded an 11-minute video looking back at the last 25 years of RuneScape history, which you can see below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="RS25: Celebrating 25 Years of RuneScape" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yvlXxr0s5TQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>This year promises to be absolutely insane for RuneScape fans. The game has had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-confirms-layoffs-pauses-key-runescape-project/">a few bumps in the road</a> in the last few years, but the community seems eager to receive what amounts to a bounty of content through 2026.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-reportedly-no-longer-in-production/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new report, NVIDIA has stopped production of the RTX 5070 Ti GPU, and the 5060 Ti 16GB will soon follow. </p>



<p>The growth of AI has led to global memory shortages, impacting even the most prominent manufacturers. We were recently told that NVIDIA doesn’t plan to announce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-isnt-announcing-a-new-gpu-at-ces-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any new GPUs at CES 2026</a>. Now, another report has revealed that they might be halting production of one of their RTX 50 Series GPUs. </p>







<h2 id="h-nvidia-to-halt-production-of-rtx-5070-ti-and-5060-ti-16gb">NVIDIA to Halt Production of RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB </h2>



<p>A recent YouTube video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hardware Unboxed</a> (thanks <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-reportedly-says-rtx-5070-ti-is-no-longer-being-produced-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-to-follow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>) suggests that NVIDIA is halting its production of the RTX 5070 Ti graphics cards. This information&nbsp;was provided by ASUS, NVIDIA’s largest add-in board (AIB) partner, who stated that the RTX 5070 Ti model has been “essentially killed off” and is now in an “end of life status.” ASUS has no plans to produce more 5070 Ti models, meaning that what is currently available in stores will be the last stock of this model offered by the company. <span>This information <span>aligns with an earlier report stating that NVIDIA will&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-cutting-rtx-50-series-production-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span><span>cut</span> RTX 50 series producti</span>on</a>&nbsp;in 2026. </p>



<p>NVIDIA’s RTX 5070 Ti isn’t the only model facing supply issues; the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB has also experienced a significant reduction in availability, effectively leading to its discontinuation. ASUS has reportedly confirmed that this model has been designated as “end of life” and will no longer be produced. Currently, retailers are only able to purchase the 8GB versions, including the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, in bulk.
