<p>During the State of Play event, Split Fiction, the new project from Hazelight, received a new trailer showcasing some of parts of the campaign.</p>



<p>Hazelight is the studio behind popular titles like A Way Out and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=it+takes+two">It Takes Two</a>, with the latter winning the Game of the Year award in 2019.</p>

<p>Continuing their established style, Split Fiction is a cooperative game featuring two protagonists, Mio and Zoe. The two are writers who specialize in distinct genres; one focuses on sci-fi adventures while the other creates fantasy stories. In the beginning of the game, they find themselves trapped within their own narratives.</p>



<p>With a diverse level design, stunning visuals, and highly creative gameplay, Split Fiction could be a serious contender for Game of the Year.</p>



<p>Split Fiction will be released on March 6th for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and the EA app. Players will also be able to invite a friend to play for free on any platform (with crossplay between PS, Xbox &amp; PC) using the Friend Pass.</p>
