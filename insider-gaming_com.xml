<p>Battlefield players have had a reasonably tough time with the franchise these past few years. 2018’s Battlefield V launch was a disaster, but 2021’s Battlefield 2042 was worse, pushing a lot of Battlefield fans away from the franchise. But now, with just a year until the next major installment in the Battlefield universe set to release, EA and DICE have a lot of making up to do. </p>



<p>Officially, EA has said all of the usual buzzwords you’d come to expect in its financial calls to promote the next game from “innovation” to “groundbreaking.” An <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-modern-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with IGN earlier this year</a> with head honcho Vince Zempella confirmed Insider Gaming’s past reports that the franchise was taking a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“back to its roots approach”</a> with 64 players, all-out destruction, and a modern setting. It all looks promising on paper, yet the scars of the past still burn today with its community, and fans of the franchise are still apprehensive about the future. Considering the franchise’s last two blunders, it’s understandable, but this time, EA and DICE seem to be all-in on ensuring it doesn’t happen a third time.</p>



<p>On a funding front, the next Battlefield has the most resources in the franchise’s history. Four studios are currently working on Battlefield: DICE, Motive, Criterion Games, and Ripple Effect. More importantly, EA and its studios seem more interested in gaining player feedback this time around. Of course, it’s not uncommon for games to have playtests during development. Almost every game has them at one point or another, but this time around, things are a lot different. </p>



<p>Sources say that playtests with external players are happening much more frequently than in past installments, and the amount of data and feedback collected is the most the franchise has seen in its history. From small feedback sessions to large-scale player tests, Battlefield is now taking the much-needed “player first” approach. It’s an approach that we’ll see continued to be played out coming to the start of the year, too, as it’s understood that EA and its studios have been eying up the return of the Battlefield Community Test Environment, but to what scale that’s incorporated at this time is unclear. </p>



<p>All in all, Battlefield seems to be trying to mend the mistakes it’s made, and with a return to a modern military shooter with destruction, four classes, and 64-player battles, EA could have a win on its hands. That being said, we’re still a year-ish from release and things can change, but so far at least, Battlefield could be back.</p>



<p>If you have any questions on the next Battlefield game, please <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/battlefield.26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create a thread on the Insider Gaming forum</a>, and I’ll answer them throughout the next couple of days.</p>

<p>Pulling a Machoke is cool, as is landing everyone’s favorite Slowpoke; but opening packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket and getting the rarest cards is why we all play, and I’ve rounded up the absolute best cards Pokémon Pocket has to offer right now.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is the classic card card-collecting and player-battling hybrid that has been popular for 25 years, crammed into an easy-to-use phone app—unless you want to play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pokemon-tcg-pocket-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket on PC</a>. You open the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best packs</a>, assemble powerful decks, and face off with AI or human opponents.</p>



<p>While I enjoy the thrill of winning a battle, nothing beats the unbridled anticipation and eventual disappointment of opening a pack. My dreams of a Crown card usually dissipate instantly as I pull yet another Holographic Golduck. If you play Pokémon TCG Pocket enough, you’re bound to open tons of packs, so here are the best cards to look out for.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-rarest-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">What are the Rarest Cards in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p><strong>Crown cards</strong> are easily the best of the best when it comes to Pokémon TCG Pocket.</p>



<p>These cards are very distinctive as they are completely gold, feature multiple swirling circles coming out to the edge of the design, and their rarity symbol is a gold-crown icon. </p>



<p>As of writing, Pokémon TCG Pocket only has <strong>three Crown cards</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Charizard</li>



<li>Pikachu</li>



<li>Mewtwo</li>
</ul>



<p>Your chances of getting any of them are slim to none—and I think that’s being generous! If you check the “Offering Rates” in Pocket, the probability of getting one of these cards is <strong>0.040% in the fourth position of the pack</strong>. Your chances slightly increase with the <strong>fifth position which is valued at 0.160%</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-rare-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-listed">Best Rare Cards in Pokémon TCG Pocket—Listed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>May your luck be exceptional. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best cards to get in Pokémon TCG Pocket are <strong>Star Rarity cards</strong> as they offer the rarest and most intricately designed cards to pull from booster packs.</p>



<p>There are eight different types of Rarity in Pokémon TCG Pocket: </p>



<ul>
<li>One Diamond</li>



<li>Two Diamond</li>



<li>Three Diamond</li>



<li>Four Diamond</li>



<li>One Star</li>



<li>Two Star</li>



<li>Three Star</li>



<li>Crown</li>
</ul>



<p>One-Diamond cards are your usual array of Caterpies and Ponytas, whereas the bump-up to Star cards introduces Full Art and Full Art EX cards. </p>



<p>Here’s a quick list of every Star card in Pokémon TCG Pocket, and keep checking back with this list to reference.</p>
