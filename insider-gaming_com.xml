<p>Halo Infinite is ending after four years of updates, confirms Halo Studios. However, it seems the company is putting the teams on multiple new Halo projects, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>.</p>



<p>The Halo franchise has been at the forefront of the FPS genre since its debut in 2001 on Xbox. With several entries, the series has become synonymous with gamers alike for its epic space setting and thrilling gunplay. With the 30th anniversary coming up, Halo Studios is going all in, starting with the recently-revealed Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of 2001’s Combat Evolved. Unfortunately, the most recent title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-halo-qa-tester-blames-microsofts-policies-for-halo-infinite-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Infinite</a>, is ending production, but it will lead to new projects in the works.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post from Halo Studios</a>, the team announced that <strong>Halo Infinite’s newest update</strong>, Operation: Infinite, <strong>will be its last major one</strong>. The update, set to go live on November 18th, 2025, will include new armor, maps, challenges, and 2x XP. Unfortunately, it’s the final one for the game, as, in the blog, the team states,</p>



<p>“<strong>With multiple Halo titles in development, we’ll need our whole team’s combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us</strong>,” the blog reads. “<strong>While we remain committed to supporting&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite</em>&nbsp;on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned</strong>.”</p>



<p>Fortunately, it seems the Halo Infinite team is shifting to help on other Halo games currently in the works. We only know of one, Halo: Campaign Evolved, so <strong>this does confirm more is in development at Halo Studios</strong>. There are rumors that a live-service Halo game is planning to release in 2026, so perhaps it’s one of the titles it’s working on. Of course, one can also assume the next mainline entry is in production, though no confirmation has been made for either project.</p>



<p>What do you think of Halo Infinite ending support? Are you excited to see what Halo Studios has in store? What game do you hope is next? Mainline? Multiplayer?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new teaser that has surfaced online, it appears that Genshin Impact developer miHoYo has begun work on a fantasy MMO game with AI-based elements, called Genesis, utilizing Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>miHoYo is known for its work on anime-style games, with Genshin Impact being the developer’s crown jewel. Their roster includes several other games with the same art style, such as Zenless Zone Zero and Honkai Impact 3rd, among others. Now, it seems the developer will be venturing into a new world with Unreal Engine 5 and MMO elements.</p>



<h2 id="h-genesis-is-a-fantasy-mmo-with-ai-elements">Genesis is a Fantasy MMO With AI Elements</h2>



<p>Users on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mihoyo-is-working-on-new-open-world-game-mmo-pvp-ue5-ai.1346665/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hoyoverse-releases-first-tease-for-new-unreal-engine-5-fantasy-mmo-and-yes-it-uses-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) have spotted a video featuring a tease for Genshin Impact devs’ upcoming Unreal Engine 5 MMO title. The video was posted by miHoYo’s hiring department on the Chinese social media platform, Xiaohongshu. Through translations, it has been revealed that the game is being developed using Unreal Engine 5 and will be a fantasy MMO title featuring an Open World and PvP. miHoYo’s was previously using Unity Engine for games like Genshin Impact, Zenless Zone Zero, Honkai Star Rail and more. </p>



<p>Coming to the AI-based elements of the title, the translations have revealed that the title will feature “Artificial Intelligence Stimulated Eco System, All-Terrain Battle AI, and Intellectual NPC. It is difficult to determine the extent to which AI will play a role in the upcoming title, but it appears that it will be utilized in some capacity. However, as these are translations, players should treat this information with caution. </p>



<p>In other news, Genshin Impact has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genshin-impact-shut-down-playstation-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed from PlayStation 4</a>, and support will end next year. Additionally, earlier this year, Congnosphere (HoYoverse) was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genshin-impact-publisher-fined-20-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fined $20 million</a> for selling lootboxes to children and teenagers.

<p>Activision accidentally posted a blog early that revealed details about Black Ops 7’s Endgame</p>



<p>As we inch closer to the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on November 14, 2025, the developers continue to drop various tidbits of information for players ahead of the full launch. We recently learned all launch details for the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombies-mode-complete-launch-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies mode</a>. It seems the next intel drop was going to be about BO7’s campaign, revealing the title’s Endgame details.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-endgame-dev-talk-coming-on-november-10">Black Ops 7 Endgame Dev Talk Coming on November 10</h2>



<p>Spotted by CharlieIntel on <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1986877838310400201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Activision accidentally posted and promptly deleted a blog post early, which revealed details about the game’s campaign. Towards the end of the blog post, it was revealed that after completing the first 11 co-op missions, players will be able to unlock the Endgame for Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>The Endgame will task “JSOC with exploring the vast landscapes of Avalon, dismantling The Guild’s remaining Command Centers while battling exposure zones leaking a mysterious toxin into the city.” It seems that this blog post was intended to release on November 9, as towards the very end it was mentioned, “Expect a Dev Talk, and a Deep Dive Blog with a detailed overview of the Campaign Endgame, coming tomorrow, Monday, November 10.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>The blog post itself was intended to get players up to speed with Black Ops narrative so they are fully prepared once the co-op campaign goes live on the release date. Players can get “more insight on the major plots and players in motion at the start of the adventure” through the upcoming intel drop. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/insomniac-games-doubles-down-on-fall-2026-release-date-for-wolverine.1347427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With a busy late 2026, Insomniac confirms that Marvel’s Wolverine will still release in Fall 2026, despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6’s massive delay</a>.</p>



<p>Continuing on from Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man series, Marvel’s Wolverine is going to be a more mature take on the superhero. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-gets-new-trailer-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Gameplay Trailer</a> showing off some intense gore and violence, it’s clear the game won’t hold any punches. Seeing as it’s a PlayStation exclusive, there’s already a lot of backing behind it to be a huge title for 2026. The trailer announced that the game would release in Fall 2026, but, seeing as delays are common, weren’t sure if it’d hold. Well, Insomniac stood its case with a new tweet, possibly hinting at some heated rivalry with Rockstar’s highly anticipated sixth GTA entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine-still-coming-out-in-fall-2026-despite-grand-theft-auto-6-s-delay">Marvel’s Wolverine Still Coming Out in Fall 2026, Despite Grand Theft Auto 6’s Delay</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1986894458835910839" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from Insomniac Games</a>, the company states that Marvel’s Wolverine is still coming out in Fall 2026. Wishlists for the game on the PlayStation Store are also open, letting fans get all the latest info on the game prior to release. The timing of the message does seem convenient, as Grand Theft Auto 6 was pushed from May 26th, 2026 to November 19th, 2026. </p>



<p>Seeing as many games would want to avoid releasing when GTA 6 comes out, it’s neat to see Insomniac stick to its date. Still, it wouldn’t be too surprising to see Marvel’s Wolverine come out in August or September. That way, it would get a few months of sales and time in before Rockstar’s big new title gets in on the action. Either way, we’ll hear more about both projects next year, seeing as they’ll debut then. In Wolverine’s case, we’ll learn more in Spring 2026, as announced during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last State of Play</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think about Marvel’s Wolverine keeping its Fall 2026 date? Think it’ll come out before Grand Theft Auto 6? Could it stand up against it if it releases near or on November 19th?
