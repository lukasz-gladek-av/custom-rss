<p>The sale of Warner Bros. to Netflix is going to get messier before it gets settled. On Monday, it was announced that Paramount had submitted what is being classified as a “hostile” proposal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. </p>



<p>Their offer would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be for $30 per share</a>, compared to Netflix’s $27.75 per share for just the Warner Bros. side of the company.</p>



<p><strong>“WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,”</strong> Paramount CEO David Ellison said.<strong> “Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion.”</strong></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2025/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Confirms-Receipt-of-Paramount-Skydance-Unsolicited-Tender-Offer/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message to investors</a> on Monday afternoon, Warner Bros. Discovery confirmed that it had received the public proposal from Paramount. The company called the offer <strong>“unsolicited”</strong>, but will <strong>“carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance’s offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s agreement with Netflix”</strong>.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. Discovery made it clear, however, that the Board of Directors will not be “modifying its recommendation” of the Netflix acquisition with respect to the prior agreement. The company plans to inform stockholders of the Board’s recommendation regarding Paramount’s offer with 10 business days. </p>



<p>If counting today, that would mean an update should come by no later than Friday, December 19. With offers being considered and a fight underway, the future of Warner Bros. Games—both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its studios and projects</a>—continues to hang in the balance.</p>



<p>What do you think ultimately happens with the Warner Bros. sale, and will it go to Netflix or Paramount?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The future of the Tomb Raider series is being unveiled at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Game Awards</a>. While no specifics were given, it seems fans will finally know what’s next for Lara Croft during the event.</p>



<p>Released in 1996, the Tomb Raider series has become an icon in the gaming world. The intuitive gameplay, sweeping stories, and, of course, the protagonist Lara Croft, have entertained fans for almost 30 years. The last main entry in the series, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, released in 2018, with re-releases following suit. Developer Crystal Dynamics and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-publishing-next-tomb-raider-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new partner Amazon</a> have been working on a new entry for some time. Now, December 11th is the date players will finally know where Lara Croft is off to next.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-future-of-tomb-raider-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2025">The ‘Future of Tomb Raider’ to be Shown at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, it was announced that Tomb Raider would make an appearance at the show. Specifically, the ‘future of gaming’s most iconic franchises’ will be shown on December 11th <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the show</a>. Apparently, the news was teased in Fortnite, where fans can vote for their favorite nominees for the show.</p>



<p>It has been quite some time since fans reunited with Lara Croft, as 2018 marked the last new entry. However, teasers of Lara’s new look came out in celebration a few years back, though it’s unknown if it’s changed since. It’s also unclear whether it’s a continuation of the new reboot trilogy or of the originals. Given Lara’s look in the silouette, it does look reminiscent of her days in the original titles, though likely with a modern twist. Either way, a new Tomb Raider is finally on its way, and fans won’t have to wait long to find out how.</p>







<p>What do you think the future of Tomb Raider will look like? Excited to see it at The Game Awards? Do you think it’ll be like the reboots? Originals?

<p>PlayStation Wrapped 2025 is the chance to see your full gaming stats for the year. Sony PlayStation users can see a bunch of PS4, PS5, and PS VR 2 stats racked up over the course of 12 months, and it’s all brought to you in one neat wrapped PlayStation Wrapped present.</p>



<p>Forget about wrapping presents; it’s time to unpack a year’s worth of media consumption. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-spotify-wrapped-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify Wrapped</a> has become hugely popular at the end of every year, and even YouTube has gotten in on the act. But for gamers, PlayStation Wrapped is where it’s at. </p>



<p>It’s a full self-assessment of how little time you’ve spent touching grass. PlayStation Wrapped 2025 is coming, so here’s the latest on your next big social media boast (or confession).</p>

<p><strong>Based on recent years, Insider Gaming expects PlayStation Wrapped 2025 to go live on Tuesday, December 9.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation Wrapped 2021 came out on January 20 and really was a reflection of the full year of gaming prior. However, Sony and PlayStation started to follow the trend by releasing it toward the end of the year, and this started when PlayStation Wrapped 2022 launched on <strong>Tuesday, December 13</strong>, 2022.</p>



<p>Next up was 2023’s edition of Wrapped, beginning on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, <strong>December 12</strong>, and 2024’s iteration arrived on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, <strong>December 10</strong>.</p>



<p>There’s a clear theme here, as you can see—it arrives on the second Tuesday of the month. </p>



<p>While there’s no guarantee Sony will do the same again for PlayStation owners in 2025, don’t be shocked to see PlayStation Wrapped become available on Tuesday, December 9.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-playstation-wrapped-2025">What is PlayStation Wrapped 2025?</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation Wrapped gives you an in-depth stat pack detailing your PlayStation playtime, such as most-played games, how many hours you spent on your console, and more.</strong></p>



<p>Wrapped tells you almost everything about your PlayStation year: Games played, Trophies accumulated, multiplayer hours, hours in general, etc.</p>



<p>It’s a comprehensive encyclopedia of your 2025 PlayStation gaming year. Get ready to be wowed and woken up by surprising stats, and be shocked at how many hours you’ve spent dropping into Fortnite and realizing how much Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has sapped your time.</p>



<p>Once it’s out, please share your PlayStation Wrapped 2025 stats with the official, free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, as it will be fun to see the contrast and compare.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Postal: Bullet Paradise Developer Flip-Flops on AI Use Before Shutting Down]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/postal-bullet-paradise-developer-ai-use-shutting-down/</link>
            <guid>1376362</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The developers of Postal: Bullet Paradise have shut down, but not before flip-flopping on claims against it regarding use of generative AI.</p>



<p>On Friday, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-within-a-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported that Running With Scissors</a> had canceled Postal: Bullet Paradise a day after it was first revealed. That cancellation came after being “overwhelmed with negative responses” regarding the game relying heavily on AI-generated assets. Because of that, the studio ended development on the game, and cut ties with developer Goonswarm Games.</p>







<p>After the news broke, Goonswarm Games didn’t stay quiet for long. The studio <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1996984553257279918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted a statement</a> on social media saying that it was “mistakenly accused” of using AI-generated art in the game and that  “every attempt to clarify our work only escalated the situation.”</p>



<p>The studio added that they were “truly sorry” to artists who “put their soul into this” only to be hit with “false AI accusations”. </p>



<p>“It’s tough to pour so much energy into a game and end up caught in the middle of an AI war by accident,” they said. “We’ve decided to shut down the studio and end all future activities.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Being faced with accusations of using AI in your games is nothing new in today’s climate, but shutting down a studio for what they claimed were false allegations seemed like a jump to a lot of onlookers. </p>



<p>Turns out, there was more smoke to the fire.</p>



<p>A day after denying use of generative AI in the Postal: Bullet Paradise, Goonswarm Games put out another lengthy <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1997357931436663056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media message</a> stating that there was, in fact, AI-generated assets used.</p>



<p><strong>“The promo art does appear to include or be influenced by AI-generated material,”</strong> they said. <strong>“We collaborated with external artists for years and never saw any signs of this. The layered PSDs always looked legitimate within our internal pipeline, which is why our initial reaction was to protect our team and defend our innocence.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We understand now that your concerns were valid. And we take responsibility for not catching this earlier.”</strong></p>







<p>The studio then said that the only art they claim was AI generated was promo art, and it <strong>“does not concern the real artists who worked on gameplay visuals, assets, and other content.”</strong></p>



<p>In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi said that they wished them the best as both parties move forward in separate ways.</p>



<p><strong>“Running With Scissors has always operated with an unwavering commitment to the truth and transparency,”</strong> he added. <strong>“We look forward to continuing to support our fans and expand on the&nbsp;Postal universe played by millions.”</strong></p>
