<p>Outside of official mods, it’s very rare to see a life-sim title enable multiplayer in any capacity. With Inzoi looking to take the genre by the scruff of the neck, we’re drawing our attention to Inzoi and whether it has multiplayer or focuses solely on single-player.</p>



<p>Even a cursory glance at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-inzoi-come-out-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a>‘s prerelease images and footage makes the soul feel warm. People playing together in a band or a couple enjoying the creation they conceived together. Everything we’ve seen looks friendly and instills a sense of togetherness. Your job in Inzoi is to micromanage the existence of Zois—plural being the key here. </p>



<p>Each city you build is crawling with characters, but can you bask in your vision with another person?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-inzoi-be-multiplayer">Will Inzoi be Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No buddying up yet. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Currently, Inzoi will not support any multiplayer features at launch.</strong></p>



<p>Like The Sims and other life simulators, there is no multiplayer in Inzoi. Outside of potential mods, this is a strictly single-player-only game. You only have to look at the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inzoi Steam page</a> to see the big “Single-Player” category assigned to it.</p>



<p>This is designed to be your world, your life, and it’s for your eyes only. However, I did say there is no multiplayer at launch. It doesn’t necessarily mean Inzoi won’t feature multiplayer content at any point in the future.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-multiplayer-be-added-to-inzoi">Will Multiplayer be Added to Inzoi?</h2>



<p><strong>Developer Inzoi Team is contemplating adding “various multiplayer features” to Inzoi.</strong></p>



<p>In the Inzoi <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1162040845181124618/1220564610151878696/1349181911481843722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord server’s FAQ</a>, a question asks: “Will the game be multiplayer?” Here’s what the official response says: “We are currently considering various multiplayer features, <strong>such as the ability to meet up with other online players or invite them over to your home.</strong> But specific details have not been decided.”</p>



<p>This feels more uplifting, wouldn’t you agree? There’s no timeframe mentioned as yet though as the team probably wants to ensure the Early Access launch goes smoothly first. We already know a ton of free DLC is coming courtesy of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-inzoi-cost-inzoi-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi’s cost</a>. We’ll keep you posted if the game does decide to integrate multiplayer into the main game.</p>

<p>The February 2025 releases of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is more than just one of the most successful launches of the year. The long awaited sequel produced more than five times the amount of launch month dollar sales than the original, even during a stacked release month.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-outperformed-the-original-in-reviews-and-sales">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Has Outperformed The Original in Reviews and Sales</h2>



<p>According to the latest monthly United States video game sales data from Circana, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was the second best selling premium game of February. Additionally, it’s also the second best selling premium game of 2025 so far, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-united-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sitting below Monster Hunter Wilds on both charts</a>.</p>



<p>But Circana’s video game analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai5tjhs2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> an additional piece of insight about the Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launch. According to Piscatella, the “launch month dollar sales total Kingdom Come: Deliverance II reached in February 2025 was more than 5 times higher than that the original [game] achieved during its February 2018 debut.” Since both games were originally priced at $59.99 USD, this effectively means that the sequel sold five times more than the original did during its launch month. However, the sequel did have a slight advantage in that it released on February 4th, while the original released February 13th.</p>



<p>Even though it had a week more of sales to tout compared to the original, the critical reception to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 show how popular the sequel is. The first game garnered a 76 from critics according to MetaCritic and an 83% positive rating on Steam, which is by no means bad. The sequel though achieved a Metacritic rating of 88, and a 93% positive rating on Steam.</p>



<p>Will Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 finish 2025 as one of the top 10 best selling games? Let us know down below and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>If you have not played GTA Online in the past 60 days, you might be eligible for Rockstar’s one-time exclusive offer, which gives players $3 million in-game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, you read that right: Rockstar is offering players $3 million in-game to return to GTA Online, but there’s a catch. Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/532607/article/rockstar-games-trying-to-win-some-gta-online-players-back-with-3m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, players should meet a set of eligibility requirements before claiming the in-game currency. Moreover, Rockstar only offers $1 million for free; for the remaining $2 million, players would need to make additional purchases, including buying a Shark Card and subscribing to GTA+.</p>



<h2 id="h-eligibility-requirements-for-claiming-3-million-in-gta-online">Eligibility Requirements for Claiming $3 Million in GTA Online</h2>



<ul>
<li>Players should have a Rockstar Games Account that’s linked to their platform.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Claim the offer on Rockstar’s <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Players should not have signed into GTA Online in the past 2 months (60 days).&nbsp;</li>



<li>The account should not have received a ban or suspension from Rockstar at any point.</li>



<li>The offer should not be redeemed already.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-3-million-in-gta-online">How to Claim $3 Million in GTA Online?</h2>



<p>To claim the $1 million, the player must claim the offer from Rockstar’s website and sign in to GTA Online using the same account. Once done, players will receive the in-game money within 72 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To receive the additional $1.5 million, players must purchase a Great White, Whale, or Megalodon Shark card.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, for the final $500,000, players need to subscribe to GTA+. If you are already a GTA+ subscriber, you can still claim the money if you haven’t played GTA Online in the past 60 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, GTA 5 Enhanced has become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-enhanced-worst-rated-steam-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worst-rated</a> Grand Theft Auto title on Steam.

<p>United States video game sales data for February 2025 has been released. Not only is Monster Hunter Wilds the best-selling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-was-february-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game of the month</a>, but it’s the best selling game of 2025 through two months.</p>



<p>According to the latest data from Circana, Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of the month for PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam. When looking at the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai5telk2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam data</a>, it has accounted for “more than half of the title’s total dollar sales”.</p>



<p>When it comes to the Monster Hunter franchise, the release of Monster Hunter Wilds doubled that of Monster Hunter Rise in terms of dollar sales. It’s worth noting that Monster Hunter Wilds launched at $69.99 while Rise launched at $59.99.</p>

<p>Looking elsewhere at the data, Monster Hunter Wilds wasn’t the only new release to make it into the Top 20 best-selling games of 2025 so far. Other new titles to make the list include Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 (2nd), Civilization 7 (3rd), PGA Tour 2K25 (6th), Avowed (13th), and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii (18th).</p>



<p>The prior top game, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, remains in the top 5. However, it has fallen to 4th on the list while NBA 2K25 fell from second to 5th.</p>
