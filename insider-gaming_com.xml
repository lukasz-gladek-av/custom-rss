<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2’s director has put fans’ minds at ease, reaffirming that the game remains unaffected despite the recent restructuring. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusively revealed</a> last week that, despite being one of Ubisoft’s longest in-development projects, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 had survived the recent organizational, operational, and portfolio reset. A spokesperson later confirmed that the game remained a priority for them within their strategy, centred on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world adventures</a>. </p>







<h2 id="h-beyond-good-amp-evil-2-game-and-team-unaffected">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 Game and Team Unaffected</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7421227406130335744/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> post, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 director Fawzi Mesmar reaffirmed that he, the team, and the game “are unaffected by the recent changes.” Mesmar also spoke about the remaining cancellations and studio closures, encouraging people to support those affected in whatever way they can. Check out the complete statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for everyone who has reached out to me over the past few days in regards to recent news at Ubisoft. </p>



<p>Myself, my team and our project Beyond Good and Evil 2 are unaffected by the recent changes. I would direct you to the official press release for more information around the latest organisational structure. </p>



<div><p>Needless to say, I am saddened by the cancellations that has affected my colleagues in other parts of Ubisoft and the industry. I urge everyone – myself included – to offer support whenever and however they can during these times.</p><p>We remain committed and focused on delivering a remarkable game for our players to enjoy.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>For those who may not be aware, Ubisoft’s restructuring has resulted in the cancellation of the highly anticipated&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a>, along with five other games. The new operating model will prioritize open-world adventures and experiences designed for Games as a Service (GaaS), featuring&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five creative divisions</a>. This restructuring has already caused a&nbsp;significant decline in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company’s share price</a>.</p>







<p>In other news, the Black Flag Remake was likely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed by up to </a><span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/" target="_blank">1 year</a>&nbsp;f</span>ollowing the recent restructuring. Additionally, Ubisoft has revealed intentions to make Far Cry, Assassin’s Creed, and Rainbow Six ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-assassins-far-cry-rainbow-six-billionare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual billionaire brands</a>.’  What are your thoughts on the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 director reaffirming the team and project’s status?

            <title><![CDATA[Is PUBG: Blindspot on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pubg-blindspot-platforms-xbox-ps5/</link>
            <guid>1420879</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new entry in the PUBG universe is on the horizon with the release of PUBG: Blindspot into early access, though questions are naturally being asked about the available platforms.</p>



<p>The 5v5 top-down tactical <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/fps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shooter</a> is bringing an entirely new approach for PUBG fans, and there’s a strong audience to appeal to, given the vast success of PUBG over the years.</p>



<p>If you want to know whether PUBG: Blindspot is available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X</a>|S, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a>, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pubg-blindspot-on-ps5">Can You Play PUBG: Blindspot On PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No luck. Image via PUBG</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, PUBG: Blindspot will not be available on PlayStation 5 when it launches on February 5, and there’s no end in sight for PS5 players.</strong></p>



<p>PUBG: Blindspot’s early access period is exclusive for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, but, potentially more significant is that there have been no details of a planned release on PS5.</p>



<p>The top-down shooter is an entirely different genre from the main PUBG title, and may not adapt well to PS5, which could explain its absence.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pubg-blindspot-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play PUBG: Blindspot On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>No, similar to the situation with PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S players will not be able to play PUBG: Blindspot on the February 5 launch date.</strong></p>



<p>Again, the early access launch is for PC only, and there is no news on a potential Xbox Series X|S launch in the future, but it is still early days for the game.</p>



<p>More details about any plans for console releases could come deeper into PUBG: Blindspot’s lifespan, with the early access release merely marking the next step on a long journey.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pubg-blindspot-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play PUBG: Blindspot On Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>No, PUBG: Blindspot is not available on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles at launch, though this isn’t surprising given the overall platform status.</strong></p>



<p>Given that PUBG: Blindspot isn’t on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S, it shouldn’t be much of a surprise that there is no Switch launch, and, of all the platforms the title could come to in the future, the Nintendo platform is likely at the bottom of the list.</p>

Of course, Punk left the WWE for 10 years after a dispute with Vince McMahon and Triple H, which was spurred on by exhaustion and frustration with the direction of his career.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/">Insider Gaming exclusively reported </a>that Punk would be the centerpiece of this year’s 2K Showcase. Not only will players be able to relive some of CM Punk’s classic career moments, but there will also be the opportunity to play through some dream matches that could have happened had CM Punk not left WWE in 2014.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>All three higher-priced editions of WWE 2K26 will feature Triple H on the cover in some respect. The Monday Night War Edition is slated to provide the most content access. It is also expected to be the most expensive.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new report, Helldivers 2 has crossed 20 million copies sold and brought in $700 million in revenue. </p>



<p>Helldivers 2 has emerged as one of the most inspiring success stories in the gaming industry recently. Its success has influenced other games, such as ARC Raiders, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ditched-free-to-play-because-of-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to abandon a free-to-play model</a> in favor of a reasonably priced one. This approach has made a significant impact and has seemingly contributed to reaching a major milestone today.</p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-crosses-20-million-copies-and-700-million-in-revenue">Helldivers 2 Crosses 20 Million Copies and $700 Million in Revenue</h2>



<p><a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/helldivers-2-sells-20m-copies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alinea Analytics</a> has reported the latest sales figures for Helldivers 2. The game has surpassed the 20 million sales benchmark, with the Xbox release helping it cross the threshold, accounting for 1.6 million units sold since launch. In the past month, Helldivers 2 has attracted over 3.6 million players across Steam, PS5, and Xbox platforms. Additionally, estimates indicate that more than 250,000 players have logged over 500 hours in the game.</p>



<p>Sales figures for various platforms have been announced, with Steam continuing to dominate the market. Steam alone sold 13.1 million copies, while PlayStation accounted for an additional 5.6 million. Notably, the Xbox launch was faster-selling during the first eight days than the PlayStation launch. Additionally, China played a significant role in boosting Steam sales, with 10% of Steam players coming from the country.</p>

<p>A new PUBG experience is on the horizon with PUBG: Blindspot, with the release date for early access in the title rapidly approaching.</p>



<p>PUBG: Blindspot is the latest release from developers ARC Team and PUBG Corporation, moving away from the established Battle Royale approach to offer a 5v5 top-down tactical shooter.</p>



<p>For all the details on the release date of PUBG: Blindspot, and the exact time you can dive in and start playing, Insider Gaming has you covered with all the key information.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-pubg-blindspot-release-date">What is The PUBG: Blindspot Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via PUBG Corporation</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>PUBG: Blindspot releases into early access on February 5, 2026, though the precise date will vary depending on where you are located in the world.</strong></p>



<p>PUBG: Blindspot’s early access release is exclusively available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, with no news of a console release yet, but there is still some variation to the release date.</p>



<p>This is due to PUBG: Blindspot, like other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> releases, having a global release structure, and not a staggered release like players on consoles usually experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-pubg-blindspot-release">What Time Does PUBG: Blindspot Release?</h2>



<p><strong>PUBG: Blindspot will be released at 9 PM PT on February 4, with the majority of players in the United States able to jump in before the official release date the following day.</strong></p>



<p>Those in the Central US will be able to jump in on that date, with those on the East Coast having to wait until midnight. Meanwhile, those in Europe have a release in the early hours of the morning, and gamers in the Pacific and Australia face a mid-afternoon release.</p>



<p>All times for the release come through <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3143710/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, which is always a reliable source for this type of information, though, as this is an early access release, the times may be subject to change. If there are any adjustments, all the details in this article will be updated.</p>



<p>The table below has the exact release times for PUBG: Blindspot in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">9 PM – Feb. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Feb. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Feb. 5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League has revealed that the 2026 COD Championship will take place at the Michelob Ultra Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. The city was previously revealed exclusively by Insider Gaming in a September 2025 report, but the venue has now been locked in as tickets go on general sale later today.</p>



<p>Those who secured pre-sale access can get the drop five hours earlier than regular customers. To reiterate, the Call of Duty League Championship 2026 weekend will unfold from July 16 – 19.</p>







<h2 id="h-back-to-vegas-for-cod-champs">Back to Vegas for COD Champs</h2>



<p>The 2023 Call of Duty League Championship, which saw the New York Subliners defeat Toronto Ultra in a stunning 5-0 grand final, also took place in Las Vegas. It was housed at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, while the venue for this year’s COD Champs will be the Michelob Ultra Arena (MUA).</p>



<p>In terms of location and accommodation, the MUA is directly connected to Mandalay Bay Resort. It’s a site capable of hosting 10,000 fans, and it promises to be a fairly stunning event, all things considered.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty League hasn’t got off to the best start in terms of impressions and viewership, but things are expected to pick up as the first Major of the season draws closer.

<p>Cairn allows players to reach new heights with an exploration adventure across the gruelling Mount Kami, and the time it takes to beat the game is variable.</p>



<p>The title from The Game Bakers was released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> on January 29, reaching near the top of Steam’s top-selling chart after its release.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering how long it will take to beat Cairn and climb to the summit of Mount Kami, Insider Gaming has all the details on the number of hours you need to sink in.</p>

<p><strong>Cairn has a completion time of around 12 to 15 hours if you focus solely on the main campaign, though this varies based on exploration and the difficulty selected.</strong></p>



<p>The 15-hour completion mark represents a playthrough on Alpinist difficulty, the standard difficulty in the game, and the one you are recommended to start with, with limited exploration, but the early hours are the hardest as you get used to the control scheme.</p>



<p>The more you explore, the longer it will take to complete the main story, but this is where you can find your rhythm in Cairn and full enjoy the world that has been created.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-cairn-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Cairn Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>Further exploration in the world of Cairn, or playing on a greater difficulty, will increase the time it takes to complete a playthrough, extending it to as much as 30 hours.</strong></p>



<p>Those who stick with a lower difficulty, but who push to explore more of Mount Kami, can increase the playtime to anywhere between 18 and 25 hours. Again, it all depends on how much you explore and push away from the main campaign.</p>



<p>For those undertaking the biggest challenge on a Free Solo run, playtime is pushed up to between 25 and 30 hours, with the added risk of having to start all over again if you die, as there are no saves and death is final.</p>



<p>All of the above times are variable, however, and largely depend on your playstyle and ability levels, which can either shorten or lengthen the run.</p>
