<p>Ubisoft is releasing a manga that will dive into the prequel story of Assassin’s Creed Shadows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The official Assassin’s Creed <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1887426010427089267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) announced the arrival of this Shadows Prequel Manga today. Interested players can purchase it in Japan when the game releases on March 20, 2025. Availability for other regions will arrive later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows prequel manga will focus on the journey of “a young Assassin apprentice.” It isn’t clear whether Naoe is this “Assassin apprentice,” as the cover art features a different woman. This Assassin will fight “against the growing presence of the Templars order in Japan.” The cover art features a woman perched on a roof, wearing the famed white Assassin hood. She holds a katana in her right hand and the iconic Hidden Blade in her left.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some commenters have predicted that the woman featured in the cover art could be “<a href="https://x.com/SuperDropKick17/status/1887532530879942672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Naoe’s Mom</a>.” Others wonder why nothing related to <a href="https://x.com/readonlyac36188/status/1887451162103763304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Yasuke</a> was included in the cover art. More details about the manga should be revealed closer to release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows can now be pre-ordered for $69.99 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and Ubisoft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">file size</a> of Assassin’s Creed Shadows was revealed through its listing on the Mac App Store. The game’s art book, which showcases new art, also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-artwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked recently on an 18+ website</a>.

<p>The fluctuating map pool of Counter-Strike keeps the iconic first-person shooter from getting stagnant, but CS2 players have not gotten to (officially) experience Cache yet. In fact, Cache has not been in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-adds-train-to-map-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the “active duty map pool”</a> for years, and the last time it was played at a Major was before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>So where is Cache?</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-cache-not-in-counter-strike-2">Why Is Cache Not in Counter-Strike 2?</h2>



<p>Cache is not in CS2 yet because the the original map creator, Shawn “FMPONE” Snelling, is still remaking it. According to the creator’s Discord, a portion of the map areas are complete, but this update was last made in July 2024. The areas that are supposedly complete are the A site, A Main, A Long, B Halls, B Checkers, B Site, Garage, Middle, and the T Spawn. This leaves areas like CT Spawn, A Truck, Highway, Z, Heaven, and Tree as potentially still being worked on.</p>



<p>FMPONE is one of the three original creators of Cache for CS:GO, along with Sal “Volcano” Garozzo and Lenz “penE” Monath. While the other two have gone on to other projects, FMPONE has created other maps such as Santorini and Thera. However, those maps never reached the active duty map pool, and fans continued to clamor for a remade Cache.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Back in late 2023, after CS2 was originally announced, FMPONE <a href="https://x.com/FMPONE/status/1645147213205520385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did confirm</a> that he would remake Cache. However, he opted to focus on creating his new maps first. Still, throughout 2024, FMPONE released a series of images teasing the return of Cache and showing progress on the remake. Every update that’s been posted has been met with a wave of excitement from long-time players who are eagerly awaiting the debut of a new look Cache.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-cache-coming-to-cs2">When is Cache Coming to CS2?</h2>



<p>The last public update fans saw of Cache though came back in October, with a collection of screenshots showing T spawn, the CT truck angle of A site, and other areas. Prior to this update, fans were treated to new screenshots every month. But as of February 2025, it’s been more than three months since the last Cache update. Is FMPONE focused on other things at this time? Or is the radio silence building to a soon-to-be-revealed surprise launch?</p>
