<p>Nintendo has been dominating the news over the last couple of days on account of the impending Nintendo Switch 2 Direct and the recent (and final) Switch Direct. There is a stacked deck of games on the horizon, and the new hardware release is imminent, filling fans worldwide with a sense of anticipation.</p>



<p>Recently, eagle-eyed fans discovered a reference to something that’s yet to be covered by Nintendo, and that’s ‘Switch 2 Edition’ games. The reference was found on an official Nintendo site, and it immediately makes us think that remasters and re-releases are inbound.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enhance-it">Enhance It</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new Nintendo page</a> hosted to explain how the new ‘virtual game cards’ will work, the term <strong>Switch 2 Edition games </strong>was coined. It was written in a legal disclaimer tucked away at the bottom of the page, but that’s enough for speculation to be running rampant:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Compatible systems must be linked to a Nintendo Account to use virtual game cards. Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games <strong>and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</strong> can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system. To move virtual game cards between two systems, you must pair the systems via local wireless and an internet connection, but only when pairing the systems for the first time. Up to two systems total can be linked per Nintendo Account.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/nintendo-legal-fine-print-leaks-switch-2-edition-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dualshockers</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>Differentiating between <strong>exclusive </strong>Switch 2 games and Switch 2 <strong>Edition </strong>games is enough to get me envisioning a range of remasters and re-releases, which isn’t a far-fetched concept. The likes of PlayStation and Xbox have done similar things in the past when new generations of hardware have been released.</p>



<p>Everyone’s thoughts now turn to how these Switch 2 Edition games could operate. Will they be free upgrades for those who have already purchased the game on the Nintendo Switch, or will they be paywalled with a fresh price tag and packed with extra features?</p>



<p>It’s hard to tell, but I’m willing to bet it’d be the latter option.</p>



<p>We’ll likely know more on April 2 when the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct takes place.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-working-on-unannounced-game-three-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Naughty Dog was most recently in the news after Neil Druckmann <strong>kind of </strong>suggested that there might not be another Last of Us game. He later expanded on those comments by stressing that he’ll take each project as it comes and that, right now, the team is focused on delivering Intergalactic, an all-new IP.</p>



<p>However, a recent claim from an insider might point to Naughty Dog working on something else <strong>in secret</strong>. Per a recent report, it seems Naughty Dog has a game in the works that has been taking shape for more than three years, and it’s being led by Shaun Escayg, who formerly directed Uncharted: The Lost Legacy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-they-cooking">What Are They Cooking?</h2>



<p>The claim that Naughty Dog is working on an unannounced game that has been in development for three years comes from <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DanielRPK</a>. The report was posted on their Patreon (paywalled) and since shared more publicly by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/naughty-dog-new-unannounced-game-uncharted-director-shaun-escayg-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>. It reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Naughty Dog has a second project (not The Last of Us III), directed by Shaun Escayg. It’s been in development for three years now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann explained after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/not-another-last-of-us-game-druckmann-ambiguous-suggest/">his ‘don’t bet on it’ comments</a> that even The Last of Us (2013) felt so definitive that he didn’t foresee making a follow-up title. We may see The Last of Us Part III in the future, but like the man said, it would need ‘the stars to align’ for that to happen.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Naughty Dog is allegedly working on something new and unknown, and it’s being led by someone with strong ties to Uncharted.</p>



<p>The last major Uncharted game was Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, released back in 2016, and The Lost Legacy surfaced a year later as a standalone DLC. It was a similar operating model employed for The Last of Us and the Left Behind expansion.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been suggested that something related to Uncharted is in development, <strong>but </strong>there were rumours recently regarding a game starring Cassie Drake, Nathan Drake’s daughter in the series. Cassie was played in previous titles by Kaitlyn Dever, who, coincidentally, is still tied to Naughty Dog by way of her role as Abby in the upcoming second series of HBO’s The Last of Us.</p>



<p>What do you think Naughtyt Dog could be working on? Let me know in the comments what you think.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s eagle-eyed players have found a hidden map that is accessed via a transition on Shoreline. It’s called The Labyrinth, and it can be found by unlocking a new door in the basement of the Resort and delving down into a mysterious ruin behind a secret, newly-added bunker door.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-the-labyrinth-on-escape-from-tarkov">How To Find The Labyrinth on Escape from Tarkov</h2>



<p>To find The Labyrinth in Tarkov, you’ll need to load into a raid on Shoreline and head to the Resort. In the basement near the gym and swimming pool complex, a new door has been added, locked by a key that you’ll find while participating in the new Shadow of Tagilla task line.</p>



<p>The key is called the Knossos LLC Facility Key.</p>



<p>Once you get past that door, you’ll go down into the depths of the building to find a new bunker door that’s locked tight – but there’s a keycard that’ll get you in.</p>



<h3 id="h-where-to-find-knossos-llc-facility-key-in-tarkov">Where to Find Knossos LLC Facility Key in Tarkov</h3>



<p>Players have reported finding the Knossos LLC Facility Key in Tarkov in Shoreline. They’ve <a href="https://x.com/inari_akagane/status/1905349168496845008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picked it up</a> as loose loot just past the main entrance of the West Wing in the computer room on the desk. It has also been found in the small rooms behind the winding staircases in both the East and West wings. </p>



<p>Here’s a graphic from the <a href="https://escapefromtarkov.fandom.com/wiki/Hidden_Layer?file=Hidden_Layer_Map_3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tarkov Wiki</a> that will help you find the Knossos LLC Facility Key:</p>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-where-to-find-labrys-keycard-in-tarkov">Where to Find Labrys Keycard in Tarkov</h3>



<p>Players have reported finding the Labrys Keycard, which you’ll need to get into The Labyrinth, on Tagilla and from the Hot Zone quest that you pick up from Ragman after completing the BTR Driver storyline. For completing this event, you get three Labrys Keycards, <strong>and </strong>you unlock the ability to buy it.</p>



<p>To complete Hot Zone, you’ll need to stash LL4 ballistic plates in a secret location on Reserve. This location is on the rooftop of Black Knight, next to a stack of pallets.</p>



<p>From Therapist, the Labrys Keycard will cost you 268,026 rubles, and from Ref, it’s 41 GP coins.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-complete-shadow-of-tagilla-in-tarkov">How to Complete Shadow of Tagilla in Tarkov</h3>



<p>There are three tasks to complete as part of the Shadow of Tagilla event in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>The first is a Ground Zero quest given by Mechanic called Shady Contractor. This will require you to find the Knossos LLC senior manager’s car and pick up their diary, returning it to Mechanic as soon as possible. It’s the black, crashed car outside the small, boarded up car dealership.</p>



<p>Once you’ve done that, you’ll unlock Needle in a Haystack. This is also given by Mechanic, and it unfolds across Ground Zero, Interchange, Streets of Tarkov, and Shoreline. To complete this, you just need to scout several locations:</p>



<ul>
<li>Courtyard park by the TerraGroup HQ on Ground Zero</li>



<li>Kart track on Interchange</li>



<li>Playground on Interchange</li>



<li>Playground near Concordia on Streets of Tarkov</li>



<li>Seaside construction site on Shoreline</li>



<li>Health Resort playground on Shoreline</li>
</ul>



<p>Finally, Hidden Layer will pop, and this task is tied to Shoreline <strong>only</strong>. To finish this task, you’ll need to find the Knossos LLC Facility Key, which I’ve mentioned above. This is how you’ll get into the Knossos LLC facility beneath the Resort. Remember that you’ll still need to get the Labrys Keycard if you want to access The Labyrinth, which is the Knossos LLC facility.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-labyrinth-in-escape-from-tarkov">What is The Labyrinth in Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p>When you get the key <strong>and </strong>the Labrys Keycard and travel to The Labyrinth, you’ll be presented with a mysterious bunker full of haphazard loop and lore, including a reference to a <strong>nuke </strong>triggered by the Cultists that you find in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<div><article><p><span>HOLY FUCKING SHIT IT’S REAL THE NUKE IS IN THE LABRYNTH BOYS WE WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG 
THE NUKE IS REAL </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EscapefromTarkov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#EscapefromTarkov</a></p></article></div>







<p>As the story goes, a nuke was detonated over Norvinsk, the region that houses Tarkov, to create an EMP that shut down electronics in the region, which helped to destabilise the area and create the ‘ground zero’ that we know and love exploring in this popular extraction shooter.</p>



<p>If you want easier navigation, a Labyrinth map has been <a href="https://reemr.se/Labyrinth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">created by re3mr</a>, one of the most resourceful Tarkov players in the business.</p>



<p>You’ll need to tread carefully as you explore The Labyrinth, as it’s filled with puzzles and booby traps, which haven’t yet been documented in maps or guides. Also, four other players can be exploring The Labyrinth at the same time, which means you’re potentially in for a tight fight.</p>



<p>The Labyrinth is available for both PvE and PvP players, which is surprising given recent events.</p>



<p>Also, as you work your way through The Labyrinth in Tarkov, you’ll eventually come face-to-face with the Shadow of Tagilla, a formidable boss that’s drastically unpredictable and very powerful.</p>
