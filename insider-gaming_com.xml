<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 won’t have achievements. That, according to Nintendo of America’s Vice President of Player and Product Experience Bill Trinen.</p>



<p>In talking with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Trinen was asked straight up if the Nintendo Switch 2 would be the first Nintendo system to include the feature for its games. Trinen’s response was a pretty firm one-word answer.</p>



<p>“Nope,” he said.</p>



<p>Hope for achievements on the new system took hold when it was revealed that both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom would have them. Of course, they would be tracked on the Nintendo Switch app as opposed to the system itself, but they’re there.</p>

<p>Despite Nintendo not implementing the feature on its new system, that doesn’t mean no games on the console won’t have them Third-party developers could implement them through their own systems such as EA having achievements for Madden 26 or EA Sports FC tied through the EA Account. It just won’t be something Switch 2 players will be able to show off to others via the console.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is scheduled to launch on June 5, 2025. Pre-orders for the system are set to open on April 8/9 throughout the world. That is, of course, unless you live in the United States where recently implemented tariffs by the government have led to Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delaying pre-orders in the country</a>.</p>

<p>An official announcement for Final Fantasy 9 Remake could be imminent, as Square Enix has just teased the game on its social media.</p>



<p>A new post from Square Enix on <a href="https://x.com/SquareEnix/status/1909229750176075791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) features a quote from the ending sequence of Final Fantasy 9 Remake: “My memories will be part of the sky…” The image was accompanied by a caption, “If you know, you know,” with a crying emoji. Many players speculate that Square Enix is teasing a Final Fantasy 9 Remake announcement with the latest post.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players have been hoping for a Final Fantasy 9 Remake for a very long time; however, this is Square Enix’s first direct reference to the title. A week ago, Final Fantasy 9 Remake rumours heated up with the arrival of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-rumors-heat-up-with-new-ff9-website-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">25th Anniversary website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new Remake series sounds like an excellent idea for Square Enix, seeing how their Final Fantasy 7 Remake Trilogy has performed. We have received two instalments for their current remake project, each performing better than the last. Fans hope other instalments of the stories receive the same treatment, too, and there’s hope that Final Fantasy 9 could be next in line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since April 2’s big Nintendo Switch 2 showcase, the talk surrounding the new console hasn’t been about it’s features, specs, or even release date. Rather, the focus has been on the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 itself as well as—and in some cases more so—its game prices. Now, in a new interview with IGN, Nintendo is defending its decision to charge $80, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more in some regions</a>, for its first-party titles.</p>



<p>During a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sit down with IGN</a>, Nintendo of America’s Vice President of Product and Player Experience, Bill Trinen was asked about the pricing decisions by the company. Right off the bat, Trinen justified the decision to charge $80 for Mario Kart World due to the game’s value to players.</p>



<p>“I would say it’s less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it’s more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what’s the content, and what’s the value?” he said. </p>



<p>“But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there’s still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they’re going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they’ve ever had.”</p>



<p>On the topic of other Nintendo Switch 2 games charging $80, Trinen, again, said it’s because of the value Nintendo sees in its games for players.</p>



<p>“[What] I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, ‘what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?” Trinen said. </p>



<p>“What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you’re looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that’s the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game. For somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there’s no additional charge for those.</p>



<p>“But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what’s the content, what’s the value, and what’s an appropriate price based on that.”</p>



<p>Regarding the $450 price of the console itself, Trinen said that it had to due with the cost of producing the system alongside the value it brought to players. IGN made it clear that the interview took place prior to Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulling pre-orders</a> in the United States, leading to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/trumps-new-tariffs-on-exports-to-u-s-could-push-nintendo-switch-2-price-higher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speculation that the cost</a> of the system could go up.</p>

<p>Call of Duty Warzone brought back Verdansk in 2025. It reminds us of a simpler time, but we must put nostalgia aside and concentrate on eliminating players and taking home dubs. The best Meta Warzone guns are the key, so let’s find out the best guns to use right now.</p>



<p>Verdansk, it’s good to see you again. The reintroduction of (probably) battle royale’s most popular map has seen a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-hits-highest-peak-viewer-count-since-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge uptick in CoD players</a>. The community is scrambling to unlock the devilishly difficult to obtain <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-trail-blazer-skin-unlock-fast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trail Blazer skin</a>, and they’re trying out new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone features such as Casual Mode</a>. </p>



<p>We’ve already covered what we think is the definitive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Meta Warzone Loadout</a>. But if you want a greater pool of guns to choose from, we’ve got what you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-assault-rifle-guns-to-use-in-warzone-verdansk-right-now">Best Assault Rifle Guns to Use in Warzone Verdansk Right Now</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One shot is all you need. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The best Meta Assault Rifles to use in Warzone right now are easily the CR-56 AMAX, Kilo 141, and AK-74.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not naming 10 guns for each category as it’s a waste of time. These are the <em>best </em>of the best when it comes top fast-firing and hard-hitting ARs. You also have to bear in mind that buffs and nerfs will change the Meta, so be ready to pivot when the time comes.</p>



<p>But there’s a distinct old-school feeling with the Warzone AR Meta in 2025. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-amax-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMAX</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-kilo-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kilo 141</a>, and AK-74 have been staples in Verdansk at one point or another.</p>



<p>We think the AMAX is the best of the bunch—which is why it made it into our best Warzone Verdansk Meta Loadout—but you won’t go wrong with any of the three.</p>



<p>Also, while a couple of the Attachments may vary, all three guns benefit massively from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-monolithic-suppressor-attachment-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monolithic Suppressor</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-smg-guns-to-use-in-warzone-verdansk-right-now">Best SMG Guns to Use in Warzone Verdansk Right Now</h2>



<p><strong>The KSV, C9 (AKA MP5), and Saug are the main players in Warzone’s SMG department.</strong></p>



<p>Honestly, I would still prefer the best ARs over SMGs—that’s a personal preference. According to <a href="https://wzstats.gg/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone Meta</a>, these are the top three most popular SMGs as it stands. They benefit players who like to get in close and decimate enemies at close range.</p>



<p>SMGs should serve you better if you don’t care for Sniping or engaging at a distance. Furthermore, throwing a quick <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-thermite-lethal-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thermite</a> before storming a player’s location isn’t the worst idea in the world!</p>



<h2 id="h-best-sniper-rifle-gun-to-use-in-warzone-verdansk-right-now">Best Sniper Rifle Gun to Use in Warzone Verdansk Right Now</h2>



<p><strong>Warzone’s HDR is undoubtedly the best Sniper Rifle in CoD’s battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> one-shots anyone at <strong>any distance</strong>. I’m not saying you need to start dropping shots from 800m away, but you can equip the HDR knowing if you land a headshot, you’ll instantly delete whoever is the unfortunate soul on the other end of the shot.</p>



<p>Other Snipers will likely be buffed to provide competition (Kar98K, please), but the HDR is king right now.</p>
