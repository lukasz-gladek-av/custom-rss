<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Thing</li>



<li>Person</li>



<li>Place</li>



<li>Animal</li>



<li>Work</li>



<li>Nature</li>



<li>Game</li>



<li>Concept</li>



<li>Idea</li>



<li>Food</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-17-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 17, 2026</h2>



<p>Without giving away today’s Contexto answer, here are a few helpful hints to get you thinking in the right direction:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hint 1:</strong>&nbsp;High in the sky</li>



<li><strong>Hint 2:</strong>&nbsp;A Celestial event</li>



<li><strong>Hint 3:</strong>&nbsp;Lunar activity</li>
</ul>







<p>If they don’t help, then here are the nine closest words, going from tenth to second:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sun</li>



<li>Transit</li>



<li>Venus</li>



<li>Solstice</li>



<li>Saturn</li>



<li>Twilight</li>

<p>If you’ve tried everything, and still can’t figure out today’s Contexto answer, then you can find it down below:</p>



<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Eclipse</p>



<p>An occasion when the Sun disappears from view, while the Moon is moving between it and Earth.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-contexto-game-after-1248">When Is The Next Contexto Game After #1248?</h2>



<p><strong>Contexto is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone, meaning the next game will start on February 18.</strong></p>



<p>The Contexto schedule is very consistent, with a new game releasing at the same time every day.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is The Vampire Diaries Coming To Fortnite? Crossover Rumor, Explained]]></title>

<p>Another Fortnite crossover is in the rumor mill, and it’s The Vampire Diaries. The show was a teenage dream with spectacular-looking humans (and vampires), captivating audiences for eight seasons.</p>



<p>It’s conceivable that every franchise in gaming, TV, and movie history could arrive in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>. That said, a The Vampire Diaries crossover would’ve been quite low down the Fortnite crossover list. Let’s see if there’s any bite to the rumor.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-the-vampire-diaries-come-to-fortnite">Will The Vampire Diaries Come To Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It couldn’t, could it? Credit to Outerbanks Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A Fortnite and Vampire Diaries crossover is a rumor and nothing more right now, and it appears to be one source claiming that it’s happening.</strong></p>



<p>It’s incredible how quickly speculation can spread like wildfire. There are many leakers in the world of Fortnite, but even the major ones, for the time being—haven’t outed a The Vampire Diaries and Fortnite crossover.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-week-11-quests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 Week 11 Quests &amp; How To Complete Them (February 12)</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Does this mean it’s not happening? Nope, but the evidence isn’t strong enough to confirm the fascinating collaboration.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-fortnite-amp-the-vampire-diaries-rumor">What Is The Fortnite &amp; The Vampire Diaries Rumor?</h2>



<p><strong>Content creator Incitable posted to Facebook <strong>on February 16</strong> saying: “FORTNITE x VAMPIRE DIARIES is COMING!”</strong></p>



<p>Arguably, the biggest sources for Fortnite rumors and leaks are Shiina and HYPEX, neither of which has said The Vampire Diaries is coming to Fortnite; this could be significant.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-has-a-kingdom-hearts-collab-in-development-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Has A Kingdom Hearts Collab in Development, It’s Claimed</a></li>
</ul>



<p>HYPEX has even outed lots of upcoming crossover leaks, but it doesn’t mention anything about vampires.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>EXPECTED FORTNITE COLLABS THIS SEASON</p><p>• LUNA &amp; MAGIK → Likely Valentine's Day<br>• HONKAI STAR RAIL → February 26<br>• RESIDENT EVIL REQUIEM → Early March<br>• SOLO LEVELING → Likely Next Update<br>• KERNEL HEARTS → ??<br>• OLIVIA DEAN EMOTE → ??<br>• 1-3 MORE COLLABS → ?? <a href="https://t.co/Bp1lEG058t">pic.twitter.com/Bp1lEG058t</a></p></div>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/2020906649301479642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Incitable says a lot of The Vampire Diaries content is on the way, including Damon Salvatore and Stefan Salvatore skins:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Damon and Stefan Salvatore are officially coming to Fortnite as part of the Fortnitemares update scheduled for Fortnitemares 2026. It was heavily rumored collab, but has seemed to gain traction and it is in the works along with the Twilight collab which many players are hyped for!”</p>
</blockquote>



<figure><figcaption>Nom. Credit to Incitable</figcaption></figure>



<p>The crossover could happen, and it might be confirmed sooner rather than later. Until it is, take the news with a pinch of salt, as no one can confirm if the image is real.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft isn’t finished with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which dropped last year to a positive reception and a few controversies, particularly those concerning historical inaccuracies. It became a talking point within the Japanese government, amongst other things, which was pretty insane to see.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, February 17, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ubisoft/" id="26">Ubisoft</a> will release title update 1.1.8 for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, kick-starting a special, limited-time parkour challenge, and adding a feature that many think should have been there the entire time.</p>



<p>Yes, that’s the ability to <strong>jump</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-manual-jump-coming-to-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Manual Jump Coming to Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>Forced automatic parkour will be a thing of the past in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" id="1478">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> with update 1.1.8. Ubisoft is encouraging those still playing the game to participate in a social-driven parkour challenge, creating an unedited shot that they can share to showcase their freerunning abilities in Feudal Japan.</p>



<p>There are prizes up for grabs, but only the cleanest routes will be in with a chance of winning.</p>



<p>To facilitate the challenge, Ubisoft has added <strong>manual jumping </strong>to Assassin’s Creed Shadows. That now means that, at the press of a button, you can <strong>jump</strong>. How’s about that for an update?</p>



<p>If you want to enable manual jumping, you’ll need to hop into <strong>Advanced Options </strong>in the gameplay settings menu and switch the feature <strong>on</strong>. Otherwise, you’ll still be locked in a creative box by automatic parkour.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Ubisoft is adding a detailed statistics page <strong>and </strong>new ‘visual feedback’ for crit hits landed in combat.</p>



<p>Next month, Claws of Awaji, the game’s major expansion, will be released on Nintendo Switch 2. Then, on March 20, the game’s first anniversary rolls around, and Ubisoft has promised something of a small celebration.</p>



<p>Tomorrow’s update will drop at 14:00 UTC and will measure up to 15.77 GB for Xbox users, and as little as 1.7 GB for PS5 users.</p>







<p>Are you looking forward to making some sweet parkour content in Assassin’s Creed Shadows with <strong>manual jumping? </strong>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
