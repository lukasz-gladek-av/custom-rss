            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bully-online-has-been-announced-but-there%E2%80%99s-a-huge-catch.1336480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to play Rockstar Games’ 2006 hit that was dubbed ‘GTA for kids’ alongside your friends, you’ve finally got the opportunity – or at least you will have soon. Bully Online has been revealed, and it features multiplayer exploration, new minigames (some of which are utterly bizarre), and races.</p>



<p>There’s one <strong>huge </strong>catch, though. Bully Online isn’t an official game – <strong>it’s a mod</strong>. It has been pieced together by a team headed by SWEGTA, a popular YouTuber who specializes in Rockstar content.</p>



<h2 id="h-bully-online-actually-looks-like-insane-fun">Bully Online Actually Looks Like Insane Fun</h2>



<p>SWEGTA posted a new trailer to YouTube showcasing Bully Online, a fan-made concoction that brings multiplayer madness to the 2006 open-world title from Rockstar Games. He stressed it has been ‘in the making for a very long time’, and it seems that, for now, Take-Two and Rockstar are willing to let it slide.</p>



<p>The trailer, posted below, showcases the game’s core mechanics, which include things never before seen in the world of Bully (known in some markets as Canis Canem Edit):</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="BULLY Online is Happening!!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2J0_BnWKvEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The team working with SWEGTA to bring this mod to life has left nothing untouched when it comes to creative potential. There are races in everything from cars to shopping carts, clique battles, first-person shooter arenas, gnome skateboarding, and boxing matches.</p>



<p>It’s looking highly customizable, accessible, and entertaining, and as SWEGTA says, there’s really no end to what they can bring to life in Bully Online. It’s a crowdfunded project that is being backed by a Ko-Fi initiative, and it’s only now that SWEGTA and his team feel ready to reveal Bully Online to the public.</p>



<p>In the video, SWEGTA explains:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A lot of the things we thought were impossible just a few years ago can now be done, including making an online mode. We do have an official server for Bully Online, and we plan on making that available to the public to enjoy in due time.</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-october-28-870/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-870-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-tuesday-october-28.1336471/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The week is in full flow, and while you’re off to work, school, or whatever else you’re doing today, you can’t forget to keep up your NYT Connection streak. That’s why I’m here, bringing you the best and latest NYT Connections hints and solutions, so you can get this puzzle out the door as quickly as possible and start cracking on with your day.</p>



<p>Read on to get the solutions for today’s NYT Connections puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-28">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 28)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #870:</p>



<ul>
<li>CHESTNUT</li>



<li>SELECT</li>



<li>OCHER</li>



<li>AWARE</li>



<li>PLATITUDE</li>



<li>MENU</li>



<li>KENYA</li>



<li>WISE</li>



<li>TROPE</li>



<li>CLICHÉ</li>



<li>BACK</li>



<li>HIP</li>



<li>SAVVY</li>



<li>HOME</li>



<li>GUSHER</li>



<li>PELVIS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words all describe ideas or phrases that have been said so often they’ve lost their impact.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these words suggests someone who’s clued in, sharp, or culturally attuned.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>You might see these on a remote control or a game controller—they’re all common interface commands.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Musicians with an extra letter.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 28.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-28-870">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 28 (#870)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHESTNUT, CLICHÉ, PLATITUDE, TROPE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – AWARE, HIP, SAVVY, WISE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BACK, HOME, MENU, SELECT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – GUSHER, KENYA, OCHER, PELVIS</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 6 Free Trial Attempts to Combat Battlefield 6 Season 1]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-trial-battlefield-6-redsec-season-1/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is giving free access to its Multiplayer and Zombies starting October 28th. Coincidentally, Battlefield 6 <span>begins its first season, alongside the rumored shadow-dropping Battle Royale, Battlefield:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/" target="_blank">REDSEC</a>, on the same day</span>.</p>



<p>With Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 releasing on November 14th, many players are looking forward to what’s in store for the new entry. While beta turnout was quite low, its predecessor, Black Ops 6, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received quite well</a> by fans and critics. However, the FPS throne seems to have been taken by Battlefield 6 this year, with its incredible graphics and fun gameplay. You’d think Activision would let Battlefield revel in it for a bit. Well, it turns out it wants to cause some competition.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-gets-limited-time-free-trial-during-battlefield-6-s-first-season">Black Ops 6 Gets Limited-Time Free Trial During Battlefield 6’s First Season</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>A post from <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1982928103417753961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty’s Twitter/X account</a> confirms that Black Ops 6’s Multiplayer and Zombies are going free-to-play from October 28th to November 3rd. The trial will include all of the maps, including a few new ones like Gravity and Mothball. The Halloween event, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-the-haunting-2025-unveiled-poster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Haunting</a>, will also be available, which brings iconic killers like Jason and Predator to the fray. Unfortunately, the campaign is not free, but can be played with Xbox Game Pass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we’ve mentioned before, October 28th is also the day Battlefield 6 launches Season 1. The event will bring new weapons and maps to enjoy. However, the biggest addition is Battlefield: REDSEC, a free-to-play Battle Royale game. The title is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-start-times-battlefield-redsec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to shadow drop</a> with Season One and has been rumored for quite some time. While not confirmed, it does seem rather interesting that Black Ops 6 would open its doors right when Battlefield is going all out with itself.</p>



<p>What do you think about Black Ops 6 going free-to-play? Think it’s a snipe at Battlefield 6? Which game do you prefer?

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-netflix-claim-2025/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Crash Bandicoot may be spinning his way onto Netflix with a new series, a new report claims. The iconic orange marsupial has been charming fans since the early 1990s, and now, he may get some more attention.</p>



<p>The franchise, owned by Toys for Bob and Activision, has had a few new entries in the new generation like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crash-team-rumble-release-date-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crash Team Rumble</a> and Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time! as part of a revival. While no new entries have been greenlit or revealed, a new report hints that one, albeit an animated TV series, is in the works at Netflix with the help of the team behind Sonic Prime.</p>



<h2 id="h-an-animated-crash-bandicoot-series-possibly-in-the-works-at-netflix-and-wildbrain">An Animated Crash Bandicoot Series Possibly in the Works at Netflix and WildBrain</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to a claim by <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">What’s On N</a>etflix, Netflix is quietly working on a Crash Bandicoot animated series. Furthermore, it’s being made by WildBrain Studios, who previously did the Sonic Prime show. Other projects from the company include Johnny Test, The Snoopy Show, and Carmen Sandiego. Unfortunately, the report doesn’t reveal any other details like casting or release, so take it with a grain of salt. That said, Insider Gaming has reached out to Netflix, but has received no comment as of writing.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that no official announcement has been made on the project. However, a Crash Bandicoot series has been asked for, and even attempted at, for quite some time, as recently as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/rumour_looks_like_crash_bandicoots_cartoon_series_has_been_cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2021 with Amazon</a>. During the production of the original 1997 title, Universal&nbsp;Animation Studios created an animated opening and ending that it hoped&nbsp;would inspire a TV series. It unfortunately didn’t come to be, though it did get <a href="https://youtu.be/6d5651XSuh0">uploaded onto YouTube</a> in 2015. Outside of that, the character appeared in Netflix’s Skylanders Academy as a cameo, played by Our Flag Means Death’s Rhys Darby. </p>



<p>Whether the news is true or not, Crash Bandicoot is a great choice for an animated series. The wacky world and colorful characters make for some awesome visuals. Plus, Mario and Sonic already got adaptations, so it’s high time for Crash to get his. Maybe we’ll get Spyro and Banjo-Kazooie next for mascot shows? Here’s hoping!</p>
