            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-movie-fresh-edgy-weird/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-resident-evil-movie-will-%E2%80%98feel-fresh-edgy-and-weird%E2%80%99.1266228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Zach Cregger, the writer and director of the next big Resident Evil movie, keeps putting little tidbits of information out in the open. In July, he revealed that he’s using his creative license to tell a game that’s authentic to the experience presented by the Resident Evil games without leaning into <strong>any </strong>of the established lore.</p>



<p>Now, the writer, actor, producer, and director has set out the vision for how his Resident Evil movie <strong>will feel</strong>, suggesting it could be something pretty bizarre.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-totally-original">Totally Original</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Zach Cregger <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/weapons-director-zach-cregger-movie-1236340007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained how</a> the Resident Evil movie is coming together. He pointed out in July that it’s not tied to any other story and that it’s something unpredictable.</p>



<p>He said to THR:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That’s an original screenplay, by the way. It’s a weird story. I wrote it and I love the story. It has nothing to do with any of the other&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>&nbsp;movies. If I do my job, it will feel fresh and edgy and weird.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In July, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-director-wont-focus-on-lore-people-are-going-to-come-for-me-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cregger said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m trying to tell a story that just feels authentic to the experience you get when you play the games. I don’t think I’m breaking any major rules, but I also recognize that no matter what I do, people are going to come for me online.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nothing has been <strong>officially </strong>confirmed about the next Resident Evil movie, but in July, a leak courtesy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-leak-reveals-link-to-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of Daniel RPK</a> offered up a walkthrough of the synopsis. But this should be taken with a pinch of salt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bryan, “a laid-back organ courier”, will reportedly be portrayed by The Walking Dead’s Austin Abrams. Bryan has to go on a late-night delivery to Raccoon City General Hospital, and that’s where the strangeness starts to unfold.</p>



<p>During the delivery, Bryan has to pass a snowy mountain road, where he accidentally hits a strange woman with his car. The woman survives somehow, but something seems “very wrong”. Bryan tries to help the lady and ends up stumbling “into a full-blown outbreak involving horrifying tentacle-based mutations and bio-engineered monstrosities”.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not so far removed from what we’d expect from a Resident Evil movie, but there’s no indication of when it’ll be revealed, so for now, that’s all we’ve got to go on.</p>



<p>What do you want to see from the next Resident Evil movie? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-blocked-cheating-attempts/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%99s-anti-cheat-engine-has-blocked-330-000-cheating-attempts.1266186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has a huge task on its hands when it comes to the longevity and stability of the game. The beta kicked off just a couple of days ago, and the Javelin anti-cheat engine has already contended with more than 330,000 cheating attempts.</p>



<p>Recently, clips started circulating on social media showing malicious operators cheating during the beta (which is weird, stop doing that). The SPEAR team that manages Javelin (see what they did there?) pointed out that all is well, the community is making plenty of reports, and cheaters are being actively banned.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-bother">Why Bother?</h2>



<p>It’s bizarre that people are cheating during a <strong>beta </strong>of all things, but I guess these slimy, oddball cheat manufacturers have to perfect their craft somewhere ahead of the game’s release on October 10.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a report published</a> on the EA forum by the SPEAR anti-cheat team, the scope of the cheating situation was outlined:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Javelin has prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls.</p>



<p>You’ve reported 44,000 instances of potential cheaters during day one and another 60,000 so far today.</p>



<p>We are already using these with our own Gameplay Integrity team to add and improve our detections for Battlefield 6. They are also working with the Battlefield Positive Play team, to actively remove those reported we confirm to be cheaters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In recent days, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-hit-by-cheaters-clips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clips of blatant cheaters</a> captured from their perspective were uploaded and circulated on social media, putting a sizeable chink in the armor of an otherwise perfect beta.</p>



<p>It’s unsurprising, though. These days, no multiplayer game is safe from cheaters, and some have it worse than others. For instance, Escape from Tarkov’s developers recently published a file showing that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-bans-issued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3,600 cheaters were banned</a> in three weeks, and that kind of report comes out every few weeks from the firm.</p>



<p>Have you run into a cheater yet in the Battlefield 6 beta? Let me know what you’ve spotted on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
