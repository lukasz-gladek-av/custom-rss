<p>The team behind FiveM has officially announced support for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition, allowing users to convert Legacy assets for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition through a new tool called Alchemist. </p>



<p>As we wait for Rockstar’s next big thing to arrive, GTA 6, players still have time to sink their teeth into all that Grand Theft Auto 5 and GTA Online have to offer. Recently, we were informed that GTA Online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-now-included-with-gta-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be included</a> with a GTA+ membership. Now, the modding community has some good news to celebrate, thanks to mods being updated for Enhanced Edition support. </p>



<h2 id="h-alchemist-will-convert-fivem-mods-for-gta-online-enhanced-edition">Alchemist Will Convert FiveM Mods for GTA Online Enhanced Edition</h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/introducing-alchemist-for-fivem/5366795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> by Cfx.re (via <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/new-fivem-conversion-tool-released-by-rockstar-games-owned-team/#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Intel</a>), Alchemist is the first tool in a series of updates set to arrive for GTA 5 Enhanced Edition to support FiveM. The new tool will allow players, server owners, and creators to convert assets that were originally made for the GTA 5 Legacy edition and make them compatible with the Enhanced Edition. Alchemist also lets users refine existing Legacy assets to address potential formatting or compatibility issues introduced by earlier tools.</p>



<p>The Asset Conversion feature in Alcehmist allows users to convert a folder and all its content automatically. When choosing the folder, Alchemist can identify all GTA 5 Legacy assets inside the subfolders and “convert them to the GTAV Enhanced format inside the selected target directory.” The tool will also copy scripts, interfaces, and configuration files without altering them. </p>



<p>In other news, GTA 6’s delay could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-delay-could-impact-halo-remake-gears-e-day-next-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact the launches</a> of Halo Remake, Gears E-Day, and the next Call of Duty. Additionally, Rockstar’s recent firings have led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-after-firings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal issues</a> with IWGB.

<p>Your graphics card is going to get even more expensive. According to a new report from Taiwan’s UND, AMD is set to raise the cost of its GPUs due to rising memory costs.</p>



<p>This follows recent rumors that the company had begun notifying its board partners of the plan. </p>



<p><strong>“The continuous rise in memory prices has led to a sharp increase in graphics card costs,”</strong> <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/11162/9158350?from=edn_maintab_index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the report says</a> via machine translation. <strong>“Industry sources indicate that AMD, the second-largest graphics card manufacturer, has notified its partners of a second price increase across its entire product line. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“The increase is estimated to be at least 10%.”</strong></p>



<p>As of writing, you can still get AMD graphics cards for somewhat affordable prices. This new price point is likely to go into effect for new builds and next-gen cards. </p>



<p>It’s worth noting that AMD has yet to officially confirm its plans, so this claim should still be taken with a grain of salt until it happens. That said, Insider Gaming has reached out to AMD for clarification on what graphics cards will be impacted and if ones already manufactured will be hit with a price increase. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-is-hytale-hytale-v-minecraft-comparison-explained.1362769/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The thought-lost Hytale project has arisen. Hypixel Studios has resumed work on the upcoming sandbox game, and it’s drawing plenty of comparisons to Minecraft. If you’re unsure of what the game is and why people are so excited, this guide has a full explainer for you.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was officially canceled</a> in mid-2025 after 10 years of development. The title’s complexity was deemed one of the main factors in the game (and Hypel Studios) closure. There were also suggestions that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-hytale-dev-says-issues-were-all-internal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘issues were all internal’</a>. </p>



<p>However, merely months later, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was brought back to life</a> by founder, Simon Collins-Laflamme. </p>







<p>Here we are in late 2025 with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-announcement-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale about to enter early access</a>, and many still don’t know what it is.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-hytale">What Is Hytale?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to do and explore. Credit to Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hytale is a sandbox game that allows you to create, build, and explore a procedurally generated world.</strong></p>



<p>From its blocky art style to the ability to uncover and unearth your innermost building skills, Hytale bears resemblance to another popular sandbox game (more on this later), but has more than enough of its own nuances to stand out.</p>







<p>Hytale was initially devised as a Hypixel server in Minecraft. After the spin-off server’s revenue potential was stunted by Mojang-enforced EULA changes in 2014, the idea was coined to make Hytale a standalone game.</p>



<p>Here’s how the official Hytale website describes the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Hytale blends the freedom of a sandbox with the momentum of an RPG: explore a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block. Our Early Access release focuses on polished core systems – exploration, responsive combat, and robust building – alongside creator‑first tools for making your own content, crafting minigames, and running community servers.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-an-mmo">Is Hytale An MMO?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hytale is described as an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) game as players will be able to interact and share the same game space in servers.</strong></p>



<p>In the developer’s words: “Why not invite a friend or two to share the experience and leave a mark on the world together?”</p>



<p>The game features player-run servers and encourages the Hytale community to bond and come together. It’s unclear how many people can be in one server at a time, but make no mistake that the MMO aspect is real.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hytale-like-minecraft">Is Hytale Like Minecraft?</h2>



<p><strong>Despite being developed as a Minecraft server within Minecraft, meaning it is like the game, to an extent, Hytale is its own game, and doesn’t claim to be like Minecraft.</strong></p>



<p>The Minecraft comparison feels obvious at first glance. However, once you watch the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-early-access-coming-soonand-shows-off-16-minutes-of-minecraft-like-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale gameplay</a> and understand the devs’ vision, it might be more appropriate to describe it as ‘the <em>next </em>Minecraft.’</p>



<p>An emphasis on variety with creation tools, mini-games, and the encouragement to share worlds and have players in your server is a big part of Hytale’s identity. The combat is more extensive, and it leans further into RPG elements.</p>



<p>You should check out a 16-minute gameplay trailer to see it for yourself.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>You better believe that Hytale will be very popular once it hits early access. We’ve not got there yet, and announcements have already revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-reveals-plans-for-proximity-chat-multiplayer-portals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans for proximity chat and Multiplayer ‘Portals’</a>.</p>

<p>Palworld’s Ultrakill crossover finally has a release date, and the update is scheduled to arrive on December 17, 2025. </p>



<p>Pocketpair announced Palworld’s crossover with the fast-paced, ultraviolent retro FPS, Ultrakill, back in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-next-crossover-is-with-ultrakill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 2025</a>; however, at the time, we were only told that players would be able to experience iconic weapons from the FPS. Now, a new trailer reveals all the content the crossover entails, along with a tease for update 1.0.</p>



<h2 id="h-home-sweet-home-update-as-ultrakill-collab-along-with-new-base-customization-options">Home Sweet Home Update as Ultrakill Collab Along with New Base Customization Options</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8ey7cKfYo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> kicks off with an Ultrakill character showcasing all the latest weapons players can use in Palworld with the upcoming update. A few of these weapons have shots that can change their trajectories mid-travel to hit their targets, and some have explosive capabilities as well. Some weapons also have the ability to deflect some attacks right back at the Pals with the help of coins. The Home Sweet Home update will also add the ability to colour your bases, along with the new customization option. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>That’s not all: towards the end of the trailer, we cut to a black screen, with the music and theme completely changing. For a split second, we see a humongous Pal’s silhouette intimidating the characters in the area before the trailer ends with the words, “Palworld 1.0 -2026”. For those unaware, the release of Palworld 1.0 will mark the game’s exit from early access, and its release window was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-1-0-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier this year. </p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo’s patent in the Palworld dispute is being reexamined by the USPTO. Additionally, an anti-Palworld patent was recently rejected in Japan.

<p>It wasn’t beyond the realms of possibility for Black Ops 7 to struggle in 2025. The shooter market is fierce, and the impact of rival franchises seems to have hit Black Ops 7 hard, as it’s recorded the worst Japanese retail launch sales ever in the series.</p>



<p>The poor reception to Modern Warfare 3 didn’t stop Black Ops 6 from bringing the franchise back with a bang. It was a tough task for Black Ops 7 to repeat this success, and early gameplay footage and trailers didn’t do much for the game’s hopes. The realisation hit home hard when it was reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sales-are-down-50-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 sales were down 50% in Europe</a>.</p>



<p>Japan’s Black Ops 7 sales have hit a new low.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s first week retail launch sales (shown by <a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@Zuby_Tech</a>) were <strong>12,311</strong>—with the PS4 version reportedly adding to this by allegedly selling under 1,800 copies.</p>







<p>According to a graphic, this is lower than 2007’s Call of Duty 3, which registered 14,117 retail launch units. It doesn’t include the first two Call of Duty titles, but there’s every chance that the result would be the same.</p>



<p>The Japanese market certainly isn’t one of the most popular for Call of Duty games. However, when we’re looking at overall data—factoring in Europe sales again—patterns are emerging across the board. Black Ops 7 isn’t being well-received.</p>



<p>It would be interesting to see how Black Ops 7 would have done without competition, but the fact is that Battlefield 6 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-soared-sales-two-days-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> are both doing exceptionally well with sales and player count numbers. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-player-count-black-ops-7-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 versus Black Ops 7 player count</a> debate was over in one week.</p>

<p>Interest in Call of Duty is currently as low as it’s been for years. Head to the Insider Gaming Discord Server and share your thoughts on whether this is a wake-up call for Activision or not. What does the company need to do for Call of Duty 2026 to rectify the situation?</p>
