<p>The latest Call of Duty title will have the usual seasonal Battle Passes. It gives you the chance to grind matches, earn battle pass XP, and earn in-game items. We’ve got the latest information on the Black Ops 7 Season 1 battle pass.</p>



<p>You know what to expect from the first season of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-split-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>: All the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> content, new Warzone integration, and of course, a snazzy Battle Pass packed with lots of tiers.</p>



<p>The Season One Battle Pass is the first thing on most of your minds, so let’s fill you in.</p>

<p><strong>It’s not confirmed, but we expect the Season 1 Battle Pass to go live on <strong>December 4</strong> with the expected start of Black Ops 7 Season 1.</strong></p>



<p>It’s always the same with new seasonal content. We never know the <em>exact </em>information until it’s close to happening, but historical data means it’s quite easy to figure out the start date, or not far off. The only thing between now and Season 1’s start is the mini-preseason beforehand. Even then, it would be a separate Battle Pass.</p>



<p>We’ve seen from the Vault Edition that the Season One Battle Pass is coming. Speaking of which, if this is your first Call of Duty, you probably need a walkthrough on the pass itself.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-black-ops-7-season-1-battle-pass">How To Get Black Ops 7 Season 1 Battle Pass</h2>



<p><strong>There are two main ways to acquire the Black Ops 7 Season 1 Battle Pass: Buy it from the CoD Shop using CoD points, or by getting it automatically through buying the Vault Edition.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-cod-points">CoD Points</h3>



<p>A Call of Duty seasonal Battle Pass is usually <strong>1,100 CoD Points</strong>—which equates to roughly <strong>$9.99</strong>. There’s the BlackCell Season Pass, but this costs a lot more, and there’s usually an upgraded Season Pass (without BlackCell gear), which offers Tier Skips.</p>



<h3 id="h-vault-edition">Vault Edition</h3>



<p>If you shelled out <strong>$99.99 or £99.99</strong> for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-vault-edition-contents-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vault Edition</a>, not only do you get a ton of goodies like skins and Mastercraft Weapons, but you’re also entitled to the <strong>BlackCell Season One Battle Pass</strong>.</p>



<p>This means you automatically get the best version of the Season 1 Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Whichever method you opt for, you’ll get the Battle Pass for the multi-week duration of Season 1. Let us know if you intend to buy the Season 1 Battle Pass. Is there anything in particular you buy seasonal passes for?
