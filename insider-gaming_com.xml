<p>If you are in the United States (US) and you want to pre-order the Nintendo Switch 2, it looks like you’re going to have to wait. Nintendo has confirmed that Switch 2 pre-orders in the US will be delayed due to the recently announced tariffs by Donald Trump.</p>



<p>In a statement released by Nintendo, the company says it needs to “assess the potential impact” the tariffs will have on the US market before allowing purchases.</p>



<p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,” the company said. “Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”</p>



<p>Pre-orders for the new console move forward as planned for other parts of the world. </p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 was announced as launching June 5, 2025 with a $449.99 price point in the US. Pre-orders for the new system were expected to begin at store opens across various retailers in the country along with other online-only retailers. As of writing, pages for the console remain up on sites like Gamestop and Best Buy. However, no pre-order information can be found. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to a number of US retailers for comment on the delay. Should responses be received, they will be added to this story. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nothing brings momentum to a screeching halt quicker than legal action. This is the prospect Schedule 1 is facing as it’s being deemed too similar to Movie Games S.A.’s Drug Dealer Simulator 1 &amp; 2 franchise, prompting a full investigation into the game.</p>



<p>Whereas people were hyping themselves up for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-verdansk-return-call-of-dutys-player-count-jumps-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone’s Verdansk</a> or continuing to enjoy the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, Steam indie title Schedule 1 was out here dominating. The game is about making and dealing drugs and all the rigors that come with the crime life. This is apparently appealing as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 hit a peak of over 400,000 players</a> and continues to bring in wheelers and dealers each day.</p>



<p>Everything was going great, but on April 3, publisher Movie Games S.A. demanded an investigation into TVGS’ Schedule 1.</p>



<h2 id="h-steam-sensation-schedule-1-under-investigation-for-infringement">Steam Sensation Schedule 1 Under Investigation For Infringement</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is Schedule 1 in trouble? Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p>Evidence on the investigation surfaced on the website <a href="https://biznes.pap.pl/wiadomosci/firmy/movie-games-sa-172025-podjecie-decyzji-o-rozpoczeciu-dochodzenia-wzgledem-tworcow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">papbiznes,</a> featuring a document entitled: “MOVIE GAMES SA (17/2025) Decision to commence investigation against the creators of the Schedule 1 production for claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and related to committing an act of unfair competition against it.”</p>



<p>Movie Games S.A. has its own series of drug-dealing games: Drug Dealer Simulator 1 and Drug Dealer Simulator 2. While the name is more overt in its goal, both titles have attracted thousands of players respectively.</p>



<p>The legal document mentions: “Potential infringement of the Issuer’s intellectual property rights and activities that may bear the characteristics of unfair competition have been identified.” Ergo, Schedule 1 is too similar to the Drug Dealer Simulator series—similar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-devs-were-shocked-by-nintendos-patent-infringement-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s lawsuit with Palworld</a>.</p>



<p>Proceedings began as soon as Schedule 1 released on March 24 and featured: “A comparative analysis of the Company’s IP, which includes, m.in, Drug Dealer Simulator and Drug Dealer Simulator 2 and the Schedule 1 project.”</p>



<p>The investigation is strongly looking into: “Elements of the game’s plot, mechanics, as well as UI – User Interface.” It finishes by saying: “The Issuer will immediately inform about further actions related to the pursuit of claims regarding the infringement of the Issuer’s IP and the act of unfair competition in subsequent current reports.</p>

<p>Casual Mode is another headline-making addition to Call of Duty in Season 3. Warzone players can benefit from this helpful new battle royale variation designed to help you and improve your Warzone skills.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-season-03-patch-notes-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 and Warzone 3</a> is a surreal content launch aiming to bring back players who loved the game years ago when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-verdansk-is-back-calling-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> was first around. Season 3 is also trying to rekindle weary Black Ops 6 players’ love for CoD. On top of this are brand-new players who never had the chance to play Verdansk when it was around.</p>



<p>Activision infamously took the game out of circulation once Warzone Caldera launched. The decision has been reversed in 2025 with Warzone Season 3, and Verdansk isn’t the only thing that’s landed—say hello to Casual Mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-warzone-casual-mode">What is Warzone Casual Mode?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not everyone is prepared for the pressure. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Warzone’s Casual Mode is a semi-tutorial mode featuring Bots and real players designed to bridge the gap between the battle royale’s Bot-only Bootcamp game mode and the PvE nature of real-time battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>The are four Warzone levels for players to choose: <strong>Bootcamp, Casual, Normal, and Ranked</strong>.</p>



<p>Bootcamp was first introduced for Urzikstan and features 20 real-life players in teams of four (yourself and three friends or randomly assigned teammates) against 24 Bots—also in teams of four. You drop into a small circle on the map and get to experience a bite-sized game of battle royale.</p>



<p>After this, players need to step up to a real lobby full of human players. This can be overwhelming, which is why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-launching-battle-royale-casual-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Mode</a> has been introduced.</p>



<h2 id="h-casual-mode-differences-compared-to-normal-warzone">Casual Mode Differences Compared to Normal Warzone</h2>



<p><strong>You get to experience a full-length game of Warzone featuring the entire map of Verdansk in Casual Mode, and the lobby consists of 28 Players and 120 Bots.</strong></p>



<p>This is a far greater number of opponents; you use the entire map, but the game is still largely Bots for the hand-holding experience. Many players might feel intimidated going into a proper game with human operators, so this is the perfect middle ground.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD Blog</a> introducing Casual Mode said: “This is designed as a stepping stone for players to go from the Warzone Bootcamp tutorial mode to an experience closer to our traditional, player-only, experience. Players can learn the game and hone their skills in a lower-stress environment while still embracing the core survival challenge of being the last squad standing among 148 players.”</p>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-casual-worth-playing">Is Warzone Casual Worth Playing?</h2>



<p><strong>Warzone Casual offers a slightly more stress-free way to play and enjoy CoD’s battle royale, but it still features players who can destroy you very easily.</strong></p>



<p>With a ratio of 28 players to 120 Bots, chances are the majority of your combat is against AI until you reach the final few circles. This gives you a chance to grind Camos, earn XP, and soak in the atmosphere of Verdansk.</p>



<p><strong>But be warned</strong>: The community has complained that <em>Ranked Warzone players with high skill levels</em> are hopping into Warzone Casual. This might be because they’re grinding Camos or putting together gameplay compilations. </p>



<p>I stress that even though Warzone Casual hits the nail on the head, don’t be surprised to see a sliding demon come out of nowhere and melt you before you even get a chance to aim your weapon!</p>
