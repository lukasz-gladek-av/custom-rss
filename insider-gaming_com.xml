<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 has topped a new record on Steam thanks to Rockstar Games’ sale, where the game is just $15.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Red Dead Redemption 2 currently sits with a peak concurrent player count of 86,717 according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1174180/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, topping its previous record of 77,655 in November 2023.</p>



<p>Its success comes from the recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/rockstarpublishersale2025?snr=1_4_4__118&amp;tab=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Games Steam sale</a>, where you can save up to 80% off on Rockstar Games. Red Dead Redemption 2 seems to be one of the better deals at a 75% discount and for a game considered as a masterpiece (and still very much holds up today, may I add).</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 first released in October 2018 on consoles, and released one year later for PC on November 5, 2019.</p>



<p>The western-themed action-adventure would go on to win over 175 game awards and by June 2024 has sold over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-millions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">67 million units worldwide</a>.</p>



<p>As for what’s next with Rockstar Games, everyone is waiting for an update on the highly anticipated GTA 6, which will undoubtedly be The Game of the Year, no matter which year it launches. At the time of writing, the game is still slated to launch in 2025, but Rockstar Games’ lack of update has understandably got gamers, and the industry as a whole, wondering if a delay is imminent.</p>



<p>Its delay and lack of updates even resulted in one developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-parody-grand-taking-ages-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launching ‘Grand Taking Ages’ on Steam</a> as a parody.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Red Dead Redemption 2 for just $15? Or are you waiting for that all-important GTA 6 update? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Xbox CEO Phil Spencer denied that Starfield would be coming to PlayStation 5 last year, but after a new interview following the developer direct, his opinion has seemingly changed.</p>



<p>Speaking to Destin Legarie via his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/phil-spencer-120725254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">patreon</a>, Spencer responded “No” after Legarie asked, “Can you solidify that Starfield is staying put for the time being?”</p>



<p>Spencer continued “There’s no specific game that I would… This goes back to my redline answer, there’s no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place that it will find players where we would have business success for us.”</p>



<p>“What we find is we’re able to drive a better business that allows us to invest in a great game lineup that you saw, and that’s our strategy. Game pass is an important component to playing games on our platform, but to keep games off other platforms, that’s not a path for us,” he said.</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://xboxera.com/2024/02/04/exclusive-microsoft-plans-starfield-launch-for-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XboxEra reported</a> that Microsoft would be planning to release Starfield on the PlayStation 5, which is a claim that Xbox would later deny, but is now seemingly true (whether or not Starfield was planned back then remains to be seen).</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – Ninja Gaiden 4 Announced At Xbox Developer Direct</a></strong></p>



<p>Regardless, following the interviews this week, Xbox has finally decided to just rip the Band-Aid off the whole Xbox exclusivity saga, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company now pretty much saying that there games will be on every platform</a>, which ultimately, is better for gamers.</p>



<p>What do you think of Xbox’s strategy moving forward? Do you think PlayStation will eventually follow? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty esports scene isn’t in the best place, that much is for certain. In the last year or two, Activision has tried to shape up the ecosystem a little and has made some positive changes, but prize pools are getting lower, viewership has taken some hits, and Black Ops 6 is currently in the gutter – just a little bit.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, some of the most prolific OpTic personalities, including Scump, Methodz, and Crimsix, sat around the fireplace to talk about the state of COD esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-you-can-actually-make-money">‘You Can Actually Make Money’</h2>



<p>Scump dropped a bombshell (admittedly a somewhat obvious one) by stressing that if <strong>he </strong>were trying to become an esports pro all over again right now, he wouldn’t pick Call of Duty as his game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If I was an 18 year right now, or 16, or whatever age you’re starting in gaming and I was trying to pursue being a professional in a video game, Call of Duty would not even be on my radar.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Methodz echoed Scump’s sentiment, stressing that the Call of Duty scene’s minimum age requirement is too much of a blocker that’s potentially preventing young superstars from finding a spot in the CDL.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been saying to go play Fortnite.</p>



<p>I’m saying, listen bro – unfortunately… This is crazy to me, the age limit…</p>



<p>The fact it’s still an 18 age limit – I was a pro at 14. Like, there’s a lot of 14 to 18 year olds that would probably turn some heads that just can’t play. But I’m like, dude, if you’re 15, why the f*** would you be grinding COD?</p>



<p>Go play Fortnite, you can actually make money in that.</p>
</blockquote>











<p>In the current system, pro players can’t enter the Call of Duty League until they’re 18 years old. It’s not mirrored in every other esports title, of course. For instance, Counter-Strike’s ‘donk’ just turned 18 this weekend and spent the last year becoming known as one of the best players in the business, racking up some mind-boggling achievements in his debut year.</p>



<p>The OpTic guys say that there are so many competing titles in the esports space that Call of Duty shouldn’t even be on your list of potential targets. Do you agree? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>On social media, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley, a senior team member at Pocketpair, revealed how he has been inundated with messages and propositions since the firm announced a publishing endeavour. Bucky, who was recently promoted to the role of Communications Director and Publishing Manager, was transparent in a recent post on Twitter (X).</p>



<p>He wrote, ‘I think I might have underestimated how much interest there would be.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-do-whatever-you-want">‘Do Whatever You Want’</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Palworld’s developer, Pocketpair, revealed ‘Pocketpair Publishing’. At the same time, Surgent Studios, the creator of Tales of Kenzera, announced that it would be the first major partner of the publishing arm, working with the team to create a new horror game.</p>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1882582384052457558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, John ‘Bucky’ Buckley revealed that within 15 hours of publishing the Pocketpair news, he’d received more than 1,600 connection requests, emails, and propositions from small developers wanting to work with the label.</p>



<p>On Twitter, Bucky shot up, pulling in several hundred followers just as the news broke.</p>



<p>In the comments under his post, Bucky was grilled on the nature of Pocketpair’s publishing initiatives, curious to know how involved the company would be with the developer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We give you money. You make game. </p>



<p>If you want help with marketing or something we’ll help out, but otherwise do whatever you want. </p>



<p>We’re giving devs the financial freedom to make games they want so they DON’T have to get wrapped up with stinky rule makers and bullies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was revealed recently that Pocketpair Publishing is ‘100% self-funded’. In a statement, the company wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As a completely independent publisher, we are uniquely positioned to help developers create the games they want, free from the complications of dealing with third parties who may not have their best interests at heart. </p>



<p>Pocketpair and Pocketpair Publishing are beholden to no one. </p>



<p>We remain dedicated to making fun games, and we’re so excited to now be able to help others bring their own fun games to life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you want to work with Pocketpair Publishing, it’s as simple as <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/publishing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">heading to the website</a> and selecting ‘Pitch Your Game’.</p>



<p>Is this a huge win from Pocketpair, or do you see them falling prey to the very thing they’re trying to avoid? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
