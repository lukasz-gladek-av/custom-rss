            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/runescape-dragonwilds-trademark-filed-jagex/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently discovered that Jagex, the long-time developer behind RuneScape, has filed for a trademark in the United Kingdom for ‘RuneScape: Dragonwilds’, an unheard-of game. It’s regarded as being computer software first and foremost, but it’s also representative of what could be interpreted as merchandise lines, suggesting it’s a full-fledged project at Jagex.</p>



<p>The running consensus is that this is Jagex’s open-world survival game, which is being built in UE5. This isn’t a <strong>new thing</strong>, as Jagex has been actively seeking play testers for a while at survival.runescape.com, but it could be the first glimpse we’ve got at the game’s identity.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-the-dragonwilds">Into the Dragonwilds</h2>



<p>It was revealed several months ago that Jagex is working on an open-world survival game aligned closely with the core RuneScape universe. What that game will look like, nobody knows, but this latest <a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00004168748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trademark filing in the United Kingdom</a> puts us one step closer to finding out.</p>



<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds is the name we’re working with, but that doesn’t give much away.</p>



<p>This isn’t Jagex’s first foray into the survival genre, though. In 2018, Jagex was the publisher bringing SCUM to life, which is one of the most well-reviewed survival games on Steam. At the time of writing, SCUM had secured 87,300 ‘mostly positive’ reviews.</p>



<p>What’s most interesting is that RuneScape: Dragonwilds is being assembled in Unreal Engine 5, which is expected to be a far cry from the ‘RuneTek’ engine that was used to piece together RuneScape. It might be set in the RuneScape universe, but it’s likely going to represent a serious technological evolution over what we’ve come to know from the franchise.</p>



<p>As we don’t know a thing about RuneScape: Dragonwilds, you’re free to interpret the game as you see fit. What do you want to see from a Runescape-based survival game? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-texas-finally-wins-a-series-as-cdl-major-ii-bracket-is-locked-in.1136199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-major-ii-bracket-locked-in-optic-texas-win/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>OpTic Texas broke the losing streak of a lifetime last night, beating LAG M8 in the final series of Major II’s qualifying stage. Until that win, OpTic Texas had been standing under a 0-18 map loss streak, with many at the organisation firmly believing that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hecz-curse-optic-texas-cdl-woes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they were <strong>cursed</strong></a>. They cited a move into a new room as one of the reasons why their luck turned for the better.</p>



<p>Now, Major II is locked in, and the bracket is confirmed. This will be OpTic Texas’s home Major, but the team is starting in the worst position possible in the loser’s run. One loss will mean instant elimination, and fans are harbouring trepidation at the path ahead.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-major-business">Major Business</h2>



<p>Two teams managed to put up a perfect record during this qualifying stage. LA Thieves managed to secure a series win record of 7-0, while the Vegas Falcons continued a staggering losing streak, landing a record of 0-7. The Falcons have yet to win a single series since entering the Call of Duty League when the season started in December 2024.</p>



<p>The favourite spot for Major II is split between LA Thieves – the ‘Super Team’ – and Atlanta FaZe, which put up a 6-1 record after winning Major I in Madrid in February. It could very easily be back-to-back wins for Atlanta FaZe, but LAT is looking <strong>white hot </strong>right now.</p>



<p>OpTic’s Pred suggested that ‘it doesn’t matter which’ team the squad faces in the lower bracket, but many have branded that big talk after securing one of the worst losing records in CDL history.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Pred reacts to Major 2 bracket &amp; OpTic facing up against FaZe or Rokkr👀

“At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter which one we have..” </span></p></article></div>







<p>Per the Major operating model, the first four matches have been locked in and are starting on <strong>March 20</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vancouver Surge v. Carolina Royal Ravens (predicting <strong>Surge</strong>)</li>



<li>Cloud9 New York v. Toronto Ultra (predicting <strong>Ultra</strong>)</li>



<li>Boston Breach v. LA Thieves (predicting <strong>Thieves</strong>)</li>



<li>Minnesota Rokkr v. Atlanta FaZe (predicting <strong>FaZe</strong>)</li>
</ul>



<p>While the Green Wall is hoping that OpTic Texas gains ground at Major II, plenty of eyes will be on the Vegas Falcons. The team will face either the Royal Ravens or Surge in the squad’s opening round at the Texas Major.</p>



<p>With a 0-17 loss record in the regular season and a map win percentage of just 15%, the Vegas Falcons represents the worst team we’ve ever seen in the Call of Duty League, but a single win would likely break the internet – even if for a short time.</p>



<p>Who do you have winning Major II? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/standalone-remake-of-counter-strike-1-6-coming-to-steam-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>CS:Legacy, a full standalone remake of Counter-Strike 1.6 built from the ground up on Valve’s official Source Engine SDK, is set to be released on Steam in 2025. The project is being worked on by several former developers of the classic CSPromod project, but could face obstacles in the form of Valve and competition from another classic remake.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-full-remake-of-cs-1-6-is-coming-in-2025">A Full Remake of CS 1.6 is Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>While many current Counter-Strike fans were playing CS2 or watching the ESL Pro League Season 21 finals, the CS: Legacy quietly released an official launch trailer. The standalone remake of CS 1.6 will be “built from the ground up with 100% custom code and game assets,” according to the trailer’s description. While it will use the official Source engine, it will feature the developers’ “own major rewrites to the renderer, shaders and various system.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="CS:Legacy - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PspuiHlF5dM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The trailer showcases many of the original aspects of Counter-Strike that players remember from 1.6, including the classic audio sounds, ragdoll animations, and a remake of the original Nuke map. To support development, the team behind CS: Legacy also created a Patreon which rewards Discord access and your name in the credits.</p>



<p>Some fans are worried if Valve will allow CS: Legacy to release on Steam, but examples like Black Mesa, the fan-made remake of the original Half-Life, indicate that Valve is willing to let it be listed. CS:Legacy isn’t the only classic Counter-Strike project in the works, as another team is working on Classic Offensive, a remake/mod of CS:GO. However, the Classic Offensive project has run into numerous setbacks. Classic Offensive was shutdown out of nowhere this past January, but even after getting reinstated, it was <a href="https://www.dust2.us/news/59005/classic-offensive-mod-blocked-by-valve-one-day-before-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocked by Valve</a> a day before release just this past week. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ashly Burch Has Gone on Record Expressing Concerns About ‘AI Aloy’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ashly-burch-concerns-ai-aloy-video/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ashly-burch-has-gone-on-record-expressing-concerns-about-%E2%80%98ai-aloy%E2%80%99.1135833/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ashly-burch-concerns-ai-aloy-video/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, a clip surfaced online showcasing an AI-driven version of Aloy from the Horizon series. The real-time AI bot was shown having a conversation with a human, responding to questions while standing in an in-game environment. The clip was subsequently taken down, but not before it reached Aloy’s actor, Ashly Burch, who raised key concerns.</p>



<p>She was advised by Guerrilla Games that the AI bot didn’t reflect anything in development, nor did it use her motion capture or vocal talents, but it’s still enough to set a worrying precedent about the character – and all other characters voiced by such iconic performers.</p>



<p>We’ve been here before – a while ago, I interviewed Doug Cockle (Geralt, <em>The Witcher</em>) about AI voice replication, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doug-cockle-ai-voice-replication/">he labelled it ‘theft’</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-feel-worried-about-this-art-form">‘I Feel Worried About This Art Form’</h2>



<p>In a clip <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch/video/7481742753991314734">uploaded to TikTok</a>, Ashly Burch addressed the current SAG-AFTRA strike, which is taking place <strong>because </strong>AI technology exists. She stressed that voice actors are asking for ‘protections’ against AI replication, which is arguably the biggest concern troubling actors – and it has been for the last year or two.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I feel worried, not because the technology exists, not even because game companies want to use it, because of course they do, they always want to use technological advancements, I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it.</p>



<p>That does have someone’s voice, or face, or movement, and the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections, any way to fight back, and that possibility, it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart, it scares me.</p>



<p>I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ashly Burch has long fought for the betterment of the VA vertical. Almost a decade ago, she was unable to reprise her role as Chloe Price in <em>Life is Strange: Before the Storm</em> because she was striking with hundreds of other actors on the grounds of compensation rates and pay scales in the industry.</p>



<p>We’ve seen many actors fight back against AI replication. On social media, Roger Clark (Arthur Morgan, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>) and Ned Luke (Michael de Santa, <em>GTA 5</em>) have been outspoken against videos using AI versions of themselves – even if those videos are silly parodies or memes. </p>



<p>In September 2024, Jennifer Hale <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jennifer-hale-ai-voice-acting/">went on record as saying</a>, ‘AI is coming for all of us.’</p>



<p>Do you think voice actors are right to be concerned about the sharp rise of AI replication? Let me know your thoughts in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-files-defamation-suit-media-outlets/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of Activision Blizzard, has filed a suit in Delaware against G/O Media, naming Kotaku and Gizmodo specifically. The suit complains that both outlets attempted to smear Kotick by ‘going out of their way’ to besmirch his name by mentioning false, withdrawn allegations of discrimination and workplace harassment.</p>



<p>It was claimed by Kotick that articles were penned with the ‘malicious purposes of causing further harm’ to his name, which was at the time already considerably tarnished.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-seeking-damages">Seeking Damages</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://courtconnect.courts.delaware.gov/cc/cconnect/ck_public_qry_doct.cp_dktrpt_frames?backto=P&amp;case_id=N25C-03-157&amp;begin_date=&amp;end_date=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delaware suit</a> filed by Bobby Kotick is pretty basic on the surface, but details of the complaint were obtained and published <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/former-activision-blizzard-ceo-sues-over-news-articles-accusing-him-of-workplace-harassment-discriminatio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Courthouse News Service</a> on March 13.</p>



<p>The complaint from Kotick reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Neither article had anything to do with Activision. </p>



<p>Both were about rumors that Kotick was interested in buying TikTok. Yet, Kotaku and Gizmodo went out of their way to include withdrawn, false allegations relating to workplace issues which G/O Media knew had been conclusively disproven by numerous investigations … purely for the malicious purposes of causing further harm to Kotick.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The articles in question were reports published by Kotaku and Gizmodo about the claim that Bobby Kotick was part of a cabal looking to acquire TikTok in the United States. For reference, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-buy-tiktok/">I also covered those claims</a>, but I neglected to insult the man or bring up his troubled past at Activision Blizzard, aside from mentioning what employees were saying about him on social media.</p>



<p>But that’s probably why I’m not being sued.</p>



<p>Courthouse News Service noted that Kotaku and Gizmodo updated their articles to remove more negative terminology, but Kotick insists that, as a general rule, they’re still ‘mischaracterising’ him, and he’s seeking damages. </p>



<p>Stay tuned to see how this unfolds.</p>
