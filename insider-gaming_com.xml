<p>Microsoft has announced that it is bringing Xbox Cloud Gaming to LG Smart TVs. The <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company says</a> that the deal will bring the feature to new LG Smart TVs later this year. </p>



<p>With Xbox Cloud Gaming, LG Smart TV owners who are Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will be able to stream games from the library within the gaming portal. In addition to games in the service, players will also be able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-of-own-games-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stream their select games</a> that they happen to own on the TVs.</p>



<p>“This gives players even more choice in how they enjoy their favorite games,” Corporate Vice President of Xbox Lori Wright said. “We’ll share more details on the Xbox Cloud Gaming experience with LG TV in the coming months.”</p>







<p>It’s currently unclear if any older models — those released in 2024 and sooner — will get access to the feature in the future.</p>

<p>As promised, Marvel Rivals released their Season 1 trailer today, January 6. We now know that Eternal Night Falls and the Fantastic 4 will arrive on January 10, 2025, at 1 AM PST.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1876297704340385803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> is, unfortunately, a cinematic one, so we do not get to see gameplay for the Fantastic 4. However, we do learn about the overarching plot. With the arrival of Season 1, darkness will cover New York, with Doctor Strange trapped in an Entangled Astral Plane. Dracula and Doctor Doom are making their moves, disrupting the moon’s orbit and releasing an army of vampires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as things start looking grim for the heroes, we see the new additions to the Marvel Rivals roster take charge and protect the work against the evil forces of Dracula. On January 10, we will see the likes of Mr Fantastic, Invisible Woman, The Human Torch, and The Thing join the battle in Marvel Rivals Season 1. If luck is on our side, we might receive a gameplay trailer showcasing these characters in action before they arrive later this week.</p>



<p>In other news, recent leaks have claimed that characters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-claims-deadpool-and-more-are-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool, Emma Frost and Modok</a> are coming to the game. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-reveals-data-about-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details about loot boxes</a> have leaked online.

<p>The first new VALORANT agent of 2025 is <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1876282811667112298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">veteran ballistics expert Tejo</a>, who becomes the 26th agent to join the Riot shooter’s roster. Tejo is also the seventh agent under the initiator role, equipped with an explosive kit that overwhelms the opponent with ordinance. </p>



<p>Billed as a “veteran intelligence consultant from Colombia,” Riot says that the newest VALORANT agent Tejo is designed to “[pressure] the enemy to relinquish their ground – or their lives.”</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-tejo-s-abilities">What are Tejo’s abilities?</h2>



<p>The themes of Tejo’s ability kit are suppression and explosiveness. Like Fade and Sova, he doesn’t have a flash ability. But while those two are geared toward maximum information gathering, Tejo is a disruptive force who can wreak havoc on enemy setups.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Guide Salvo in action. Image credit: Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here’s how each of his abilities work:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Guided Salvo: </strong>Equip a tactical map, and like you’re placing Brimstone smokes, select two spots on the map. Activating the ability will send a self-guided missile to each of the two spots, detonating on arrival with a three-pulse explosion. Great for flushing enemies out of corners and hiding spots, and great for post-plants.</li>



<li><strong>Stealth Drone</strong>: Deploy a drone that you control for a limited time. The Drone controls like one of Skye’s Trailblazer tigers, and you can manually detonate it near an enemy to both suppress and reveal them.</li>



<li><strong>Special Delivery</strong>: Equip a sticky grenade that sticks to the surface and explodes, concussing enemies caught in the vicinity. You can normal fire the grenade to stick to the first surface it hits, or you can alt-fire with right-click to make it bounce once first.</li>



<li><strong>Armageddon</strong>: Tejo’s ultimate ability effectively calls in a super destructive airstrike that travels along a long corridor. Players bring up a tactical map, select a starting area, then use the mouse to choose the direction that Armageddon travels.</li>
</ul>



<p>Tejo will officially arrive in VALORANT on Tuesday, Jan. 7. Riot is also debuting a new cosmetic type called FLEX, which are unique handheld objects that players can interact with. There will be two available starting Jan. 7: one for free, and one in the paid track of the next battle pass. The next VALORANT act will start on Jan. 8.</p>

<p>Images of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons have allegedly leaked online, providing new details about the successor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/523194/article/rumor-leaked-joy-con-2-pics-confirmed-via-serial-number-and-it-fits-nexthandhelds-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hu3rte/new_joycon_photos_from_chinese_sns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NintendoSwitch2</a> subreddit features a post that has leaked images of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons from the Chinese online forum, Baidu Teiba. At first glance, players can spot several obvious changes, such as the larger SL and SR bumpers and new connectors. It seems the successor to the Switch will be ditching the rails for a new connector that will allow players to pop their Joy-Cons in instead of sliding them in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if you look closer, you will find a new addition to the Switch 2 Joy-Cons. The latest addition looks like some kind of sensor next to the new connector. Many players on the r/NintendoSwitch2 subreddit have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1huvbt9/the_mouse_theory_doesnt_seem_so_unreasonable_to_me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">theorised</a> that this might be a sensor that will allow players to turn their Joy-Con into a mouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, the overall Joy-Con is much bigger, with larger joysticks and triggers. Regarding the colour, the Joy-Con is covered with a matte-black casing and has a patch of blue near the connectors. The new images of the Joy-Con also match the Christmas Leak by <a href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NextHandhled</a>, where the alleged Switch 2 console also had connectors instead of rails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Nintendo Switch has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-passes-ps2-in-total-us-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed PlayStation 2 in total US sales</a>. Also, check out the Switch 2 design <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/did-dbrand-give-players-another-look-at-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that was leaked earlier by Dbrand</a>.
