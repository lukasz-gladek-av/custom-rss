<p>Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner have announced that its found a new publisher following the US ban fiasco that saw TikTok and its game banned in the US.</p>



<p>Announced on <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1884400415925817429" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (Formerly Twitter), Second Dinner said that the developer has “already signed agreements and started the work to bring almost all operational and publishing responsibilities in-house at Second Dinner with support from a new U.S.-based publisher, Skystone Games.”</p>



<p>The move is to “ensure this never happens again,” they said, referring to the ban in the United States.</p>



<p>Marvel Snap suffered the same fate as TikTok during the US ban, as ByteDance was the parent owner of Nuverse (the previous publisher), and as such, suffered the same fake as TikTok due to “security concerns.”</p>



<p>At the time of the ban, Second Dinner said that the ban came as a surprise and wasn’t planned and that the game “wasn’t going anywhere.”</p>



<p>Following its return, Marvel Snap announced a “Welcome Back Package,” which contained:</p>



<p><strong>Over Collection Level 500</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>2 Spotlight Keys</li>

<p>Both games will cost £8.99 each, or you can buy both as a part of a bundle for £15.29. You can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dino_crisis_bundle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">purchase them at GOG here</a>. Unlike modern games, they won’t take up too much space, either, as both games combined are only around 1GB in size. </p>



<h4 id="h-here-s-how-we-ensured-that-this-masterpiece-is-better-than-ever-and-what-you-can-expect-with-gog-s-version-of-the-game">Here’s how we ensured that this masterpiece is better than ever and what you can expect with GOG’s version of the game:</h4>

<li>Improved music playback and volume scaling</li>



<li>Improved item rendering and fogging</li>



<li>Improved cartridge boxes alignment</li>



<li>Issue-free video playback, task switching and game exit</li>



<li>Full support for modern controllers (Sony DualSense, Sony DualShock4, Microsoft Xbox Series, Microsoft Xbox One, Microsoft Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, Logitech F series and many more) with optimal button binding regardless of the hardware and wireless mode</li>
</ul>







<p>Dino Crisis first released in 1999, selling around 2.4 million units on the PlayStation. In 2000, Capcom followed it up with Dino Crisis 2, which saw the game sell 1.19 million units.

<p>Warzone is in a bad spot right now. We’re a long way since the heyday of 2020 when Verdansk was on everyone’s minds, and what remains today is a shell of what was once the most popular battle royale game in the business. The competitive scene is in bits, pro players have waited months for payments, and cheaters are harassing the global community with increasing abandon.</p>



<p>But fear not – in the recent patch notes published ahead of Warzone Season 02, Activision’s teams revealed that you now have the <strong>correct number of rocks to throw in the Gulag.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-warzone-in-tatters">Warzone in Tatters</h2>



<p>Last week, I covered the news that many Warzone pro players still chase hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments owed by Activision and Co. </p>



<p>Following the World Series of Warzone last year, players from the top down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/world-series-of-warzone-players-winnings/">failed to secure their winnings</a>. The state of play for Warzone esports was already rough enough, but this revelation extinguished any hope fans had for a resurgence of sorts in the coming months.</p>



<p>On social and streaming platforms, sentiments are at an all-time low.</p>



<p>On Twitch, the game’s <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/512710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">peak of 1.6 million viewers</a> (in April 2021) seems like little more than a fever dream now. The average peak viewer count in the last seven days was around 24,000 users at the time of writing. That could be a symptom of the wider comedown of the battle royale genre, though – other games aren’t faring much better:</p>



<ul>
<li>PUBG – 12,800 avg</li>



<li>Apex Legends – 16,100 avg</li>
</ul>



<p>Only Fortnite stays strong, boasting a 65,800 average peak viewer count over the last seven days – but given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-player-count-record-broken-juice-wrld/">the game’s rampant success</a> in recent years, that’s hardly a surprise.</p>



<p>The recent patch notes for Warzone’s Season 02 update revealed plenty of bug fixes and tweaks, but one that stood out and drew some jibes on social media read:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Fixed an issue where players only had one Gulag Rock instead of five in the Gulag.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This prompted many users to throw jabs at Activision’s prioritisation matrix, suggesting that this fix is but a grain of sand amid a beach of problems. </p>



<p>In a post on Twitter (X), CouRage suggested what needs to be done to revive Warzone:</p>



<div><article><p><span>It’s so sad to see the state of Warzone.

Call of Duty is one of the mismanaged IPs on the planet. Too many cooks in the kitchen. Too many egos. Too much greed from Activision.

Pull the plug. Reset from Warzone 1.0 and let it be it’s own standalone experience. Only additive…</span></p></article></div>



<blockquote></blockquote>



<p>In a spread of comments echoing the general sentiment, content creators across the net expressed their concerns:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Warzone has gotta be one of the biggest embarrassments ever right now…’ – Timmy2Cans</li>



<li>‘The mismanagement of Warzone will go down as one of gaming’s biggest blunders when all is said and done.’ – Loochy</li>



<li>‘Perhaps the magic of Warzone is just gone and we all have grown tired of playing the game.’ – DougDagnabbit</li>
</ul>



<p>What do you think about the state of Warzone in 2025? Are you still playing, or have you long since moved on? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
