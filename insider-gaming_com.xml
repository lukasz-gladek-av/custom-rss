<p>Square Enix is fully aboard the generative AI train. As part of its latest earnings report on November 6, the company says that it wants AI to handle at least 70% of its QA and debugging on projects by the end of 2027.</p>



<p>They said that a joint research project with the Matsuo Laboratory at the University of Tokyo that is <strong>“aimed at improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies.”</strong> Square Enix even held a company-wide idea contest with a theme of AI that has seen <strong>“several selected ideas developed into projects and currently being promoted internally.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as how the research is being done, Square <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">says that it’s a team</a> of more than 10 people. This team includes researchers from the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory as well is engineers from Square Enix. The overall goal, the company says, is to give them a “competitive advantage” in game development.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time Square Enix has brough tup its ambitions for AI. Back in early 2024, president <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/square-enix-aggressive-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Takashi Kiryu said that the company</a> plans to be “aggressive in applying AI and other cutting-edge technologies to both our content development and our publishing functions.” </p>



<p>There were even plans to invest in “blockchain entertainment” in the future.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Square Enix for comment on if this plan would ultimately lead to layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

<p>Steam’s user review system can sometimes be overloaded with user bombing and other unfair measures and tactics. However, the writing has been on the wall for Football Manager 26 since its early access beta, and Steam’s all-time worst games list has sadly welcomed it with open arms.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-open-beta-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager 26 Open Beta</a> was supposed to signal the welcome return of FM. Anticipation quickly turned to agony after it was found that the game was a bug-ridden mess with an unintuitive UI. Problems quickly piled on problems, and the comeback turned into a nightmare. The full release arrived, and as expected, players weren’t happy with the final product.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It wasn’t worth the wait. Credit to Sports Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Developer Sports Interactive said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-26-was-helped-by-last-years-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager 26 Was Helped By Last Year’s Cancellation</a>. FM 25 was infamously delayed and canceled, putting a huge gap in the calendars of Football Manager fans.</p>



<p>Football Manager 26 launched to better-than-expected critical reviews. The FM community wasn’t as kind, and the game’s Steam store page was quickly filled with bad reviews, giving the game a ‘<strong>Mostly Negative</strong>‘ review reception.</p>



<p>This isn’t the end of the world, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-reviews-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 REDSEC launched to Mostly Negative reviews</a>. Yet, it’s still being enjoyed by countless users. For Football Manager 26, it went from bad to worse to <em>abysmal </em>very quickly.</p>



<p><a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-is-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-rated-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FootballGamingZone</a> (through Steam250) found that <strong>Football Manager has moved to number seven on the all-time worst games list</strong> already. It’s better than Command &amp; Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight and FlatOut 3: Chaos &amp; Destruction at least, but it’s a sight for sore FM fans’ eyes.</p>



<p>Strangely, there was no major day-one patch for FM 26 either. Even though it’s <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-riddled-with-performance-issues-on-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">riddled with performance issues on console</a>, it seems like fixes will be a slow rollout. This will surely risk the ire and patience of those who’ve committed to the game early doors.</p>



<p>This is no doubt a huge disappointment for you who’ve had to wait two years for Football Manager 26. Have you bought FM 26 in any way? More importantly, have you played it? Let us know what you think of it, what needs fixing, and if Sports Interactive has any hope of salvaging this mess through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>
