<p>Cyberpunk Trading Card Game (TCG) has been officially announced, featuring characters from Cyberpunk 2077 and Edgerunners. </p>



<p>CD Projekt Red has been hard at work developing the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, even revealing its plans to expand the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-adds-50-new-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development foundation by 2027</a>. However, nobody knew they were working on a physical-only trading card game for the franchise, with an announcement popping up out of nowhere. </p>

<p>In Cyberpunk TCG, players will be tasked with putting together their ultimate edgerunner team by collecting characters from the franchise and putting them up against their friends. Players will receive “stunning custom artwork” with characters from both the base game, Cyberpunk 2077, and the anime adaptation, Edgerunners. The official announcement on <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1998407444121243803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) also arrived with a new trailer, showcasing the type of cards players should expect. </p>

<p>It’s 2025, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is about to be released for what feels like the millionth time. Skyrim is available on just about every platform in the world at this point, even the Amazon Echo to an extent, but now you can add another format to the list.</p>



<p>Yes, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-skyrim-against-call-of-duty-2011/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> is an exceptional RPG. Yes, Bethesda, everyone knows how proud you are of the game and its legacy. It’s at a point now where Skyrim has been ported to every device in the world, making it beyond being a meme at this point. One key platform is missing, and Skyrim is about to be released on it.</p>
