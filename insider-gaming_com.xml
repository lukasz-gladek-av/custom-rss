<p>Former Nintendo of America employees, Kit and Krysta, have provided some insight as to why the “Nindies” branding went away in favor of showcasing independent games coming to Nintendo consoles via Indie World presentations. Largely, it’s due to Nintendo’s careful protection of its core branding.</p>



<p>In the late 2010s, Nindie Showcases shone a spotlight on games like My Friend Pedro and Yooka-Laylee as they were coming to the Nintendo Switch platform. The Branding of “Nindie” was a playful, creative mashup to showcase indie games coming to Nintendo. Ultimately, despite the creativity and an overall positive energy around the branding, it would be that mashup that would ultimately raise concerns for Nintendo’s legal department.</p>

<p>In a clip from The Kit &amp; Krysta Podcast, the namesake hosts revealed that while Nintendo’s Publisher and Developer Relations Department came up with the term and was very proud of it, they were ultimately told that they’re not allowed to warp the Nintendo name in any way, as it runs the risk of hurting the protection of the brand’s intellectual property.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“You definitely cannot, kind of, cut the Nintendo brand in half and tack it to another word. It dilutes the brand, in the words of legal. It makes it so that you cannot defend your brand later on for some sort of legal dispute,” Krysta said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was said that a representative from Nintendo’s PDR team tried to fight the mandate, but he ultimately lost.</p>

<p>There you have it, you can’t fight City Hall. Unless you’re Rocko Wallaby, that is.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[One Million ARC Raiders Players Wiped Their Accounts, Embark Reveals]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Towards the end of December, ARC Raiders’ first ‘Expedition Project’ went live, allowing players to leave the game’s map behind and reset their accounts in search of a fresh playthrough. It’s a balancing mechanic that allows players another go around at the game, and it’s set to recur once every two or three months.</p>



<p>The optional mechanic was explored by more than <strong>one million players</strong>, Embark Studios recently revealed. Given the game has sold an estimated 12 million copies, that means just 8% of players carried out the optional account wipe.</p>







<h2 id="h-embark-will-evolve-the-expedition-project">Embark Will Evolve The Expedition Project</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders is still sitting at the top of the extraction table, for now. It dropped back in October 2025 and quickly became a stellar, award-winning game adored by millions of players. The exposure the game received on streaming and social platforms was unparalleled, and it’s still beating some of the traditional games in the space at the time of writing.</p>



<p>In December, ARC Raiders players everywhere were invited to complete the game’s first Expedition Project. This optional step requires players to collect scores of specific items to build an ‘escape caravan’, migrating away from the game’s safe zone and walking off into the sunset.</p>



<p>They’re then handed a fresh character and must go back through the game again, this time with a few buffs acquired via the Expedition Project process.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Embark Studios revealed that ‘a little over a million players’ completed that first Expedition. That represents a relatively small minority, per sales estimates. There were a few issues with the Expedition Project, such as the grind required to get there and tick the final boxes to unlock <strong>all </strong>the benefits, so that likely explains why so few players completed the task.</p>



<p>Many players had an issue with the hefty requirements to unlock the five free skill points handed down upon the launch of a successful Expedition. They were charged with collecting a whopping <strong>five million credits </strong>in stash value, translated into one free skill point per <strong>one million </strong>credits.</p>



<p>This is one of the areas that Embark is working on, per the recent <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/first-expedition-wipe-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with PCGamesN</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the bigger topics of feedback was the requirements for the final stage to get the skill points, and probably going out a bit too late with that information, because we wanted to hold off until we could calibrate it around the actual economy of the player base, rather than trying to guess really early on.</p>



<p>So then, when we chose the number, which was the five million credits for the full thing, we set that as an aspirational goal that some players&nbsp;<em>might</em>&nbsp;achieve. But then I think a lot of players took that as like, ‘Well, now I&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to do that to get it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was then confirmed that around 35% or 40% of players running the Expedition Project received the full allotment of free skill points. The team also confirmed that they’re examining the Expedition process from every angle, scrutinizing the data and looking for opportunities to improve it.</p>

<p>The next game in the Moonstone Island franchise has been revealed.</p>



<p>Moonstone Island was released on PC in 2023 and later ported to the Nintendo Switch in 2024. Developed by Studio Supersoft and published by Raw Fury, the game is yet another take on the cozy sim, which has proven very successful on the Nintendo Switch. Now, the next game in the franchise which isn’t a sequel, but isn’t not a sequel, according to a new social media post, has been shown off for the first time.</p>







<h2 id="h-introducing-moonstone-academy">Introducing Moonstone Academy</h2>



<p>In a Twitter post, the team behind the Moonstone Island game shared a brief 30-second preview of their work. What followed was a video of a character briefly exploring a tower, then getting on a bicycle with a propeller in front and flying away, before a title reveal reading “Moonstone Academy.”</p>



<p>In subsequent posts, it was clarified that this is a new game in the series, and that while there’s no set release date, more information will follow as updates are made. It’s claimed this isn’t necessarily a sequel, but it wouldn’t be fair to say it isn’t one.</p>
