<p>Pacific Drive, which was released last year, hit <strong>one million sales </strong>last month. Now, the team at Ironwood Studios is preparing to release the next major update for the game, dubbed Endless Expeditions. In a reveal trailer posted a short while ago, the new features coming with the Endless Expeditions update were revealed, and they’ve been very well received.</p>



<p>Nestled in amongst the changes and tweaks sits the ability to suspend a run, which is a mechanic that <strong>many </strong>of the game’s fans have been asking for.</p>

<h2 id="h-endless-entertainment">Endless Entertainment</h2>



<p>In the one-minute trailer posted by Ironwood Studios, the Endless Expeditions update was revealed in full.</p>



<p>Coming next month are several overhauls and additions to Pacific Drive, the post-apocalyptic indie title that sees players assume control of a ‘relic’ in the form of an old car. It’s up to them to explore an ever-changing world, solve quests, uncover mysteries, and upgrade their vehicle to no end to better survive the troubled wastes around them.</p>



<p>The trailer (which you can see below) revealed that the following elements are coming with Endless Expeditions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cluster spawning (no idea what that is)</li>



<li>Suspend run (save, exit, and resume)</li>



<li>Improved tools: Thermal Vacuum, Plasma Scrapper</li>



<li>IDA’s Exchange (new discoverable Zone trader)</li>



<li>Over one hour of new radio music</li>



<li>New cosmetic rewards for the garage</li>



<li>Even more lore to discover</li>



<li>And of course, <strong>Endless Expeditions</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Players can embark on journeys that never end with the Endless Expeditions feature. Ironwood Studios has described the new mechanic in the description under the trailer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Set off from the garage on new continuous drives – Expeditions. Dangerous and filled with their own unique rewards, these challenging trips will test even the most seasoned breacher.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ironwood noted that this is the ‘biggest update yet’ in Pacific Drive.</p>



<p>Endless Expeditions will be released in Pacific Drive on April 3rd on all applicable platforms.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[InZOI Is Now The Number One Most Wanted Game on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inzoi-is-now-the-number-one-most-wanted-game-on-steam.1143816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>InZOI will be released in just a few days, and it has blown past all comers to secure the number-one most-wanted spot on Steam. In the last week, it was creeping up the chart, and now it has beaten the likes of Hollow Knight: Silksong, Deadlock, and Elden Ring: Nightreign. In a 7-day window, it has found its way to 50,000 new followers on Valve’s PC platform.</p>



<p>Many people are curious whether inZOI will be the top-tier Sims competitor it’s shaping up to be. It certainly has the visual effects to go the distance, but is there enough meat on the bones to satisfy the average gamer for as long as a Sims game can?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-coming-soon">Coming Soon</h2>



<p>InZOI will be released worldwide on March 28, which is partly why it has jumped up the Steam wishlist chart to <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/?sort=id_asc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">occupy the number-one spot</a>. It has beaten some of the most widely-anticipated games in recent days, including Mecha BREAK, Borderlands 4, and Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<p>At first blush, inZOI looks nothing short of impressive, giving gamers an entire city to play around with and offering remarkable depth when it comes to things like character creation. On March 28, the game will enter an early access period, where it’ll adopt a semi-premium price tag. </p>



<p>It’s set to arrive exclusively on PC as the early access period plays out, but it’ll eventually land on console platforms in the future – we just don’t know when. It all depends on how long it’s in that early access ‘testing’ period.</p>



<p>Last year, gamers were able to get hands-on with inZOI’s character creation menu, which is intensely detailed and deep, offering ways to customise your character that we’ve never seen before in a game like this. That’s one of inZOI’s unique selling points – it goes beyond the cosmetic and into the obsessive in some ways.</p>



<p>Do you plan to pick up inZOI when it’s released on March 28? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nemesis-system-why-created-monolith-wb-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Nemesis system introduced in 2014’s Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor was a phenomenal thing. It gave players a living, breathing force to fight, one that would learn how you played and keep coming back for more, adapting to your tactics and providing a deeper challenge time after time.</p>



<p>It was last seen in 2017’s Shadow of War, and following the closure of Monolith last month, it seems unlikely we’ll see it again for a <strong>very long time</strong>. In a recent video, a former VP of WB Games explained exactly why the Nemesis system was created in the first place, but the real reason reveals a gaping flaw in the plan all these years later.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-didn-t-work">That Didn’t Work</h2>



<p>Laura Fryer, formerly a VP at WB Games who oversaw studios including Monolith, recently went on record talking about her time at the company. She oversaw Monolith’s operations since 2008, which means she was around for the inception of the Nemesis system.</p>



<p>The reason it was created is a little convoluted but it all comes down to money.</p>



<p>WB Games identified a financial flaw in the industry in the form of second-hand game sales. Players would buy a game once and then sell it back to a store as a ‘trade-in’, with it then changing hands again and again, most likely. WB Games was concerned with seeing no value on those successive sales and ‘only getting paid for the first copy sold’.</p>



<p>The solution? Make people play for longer and have more fun so they didn’t sell their game at all.</p>



<p>That’s how Fryer put it in her recent video (thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-warner-bros-exec-reveals-the-real-reason-shadow-of-mordors-much-loved-nemesis-system-was-created" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> for the spot).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With Shadow (of Mordor), we faced the same problem.</p>



<p>How do we create a single-player game that is so compelling, that people keep the disc in their library forever? We knew Monolith’s game engine wasn’t yet capable of having a fully open world like a GTA, and this team wasn’t interested in going the multiplayer route. But we still had to solve for the constraint. </p>



<p>And this thinking is what led to the Nemesis system, arguably one of the most creative and coolest game features in recent memory.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5f65WksXqA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fryer stressed</a> that second-hand game sales were ‘a disaster’ for developers who were missing out on the ‘millions of dollars’ generated by that particular market. The Nemesis system made players want to hold on to their game for a little longer because it was so unpredictable and it evolved with the gamer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="My Time with Monolith" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5f65WksXqA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Sadly, the Nemesis system didn’t pan out as intended. It was due to appear in the Wonder Woman game that Monolith was working on before being shuttered by WB Games in February 2025. It’s now under lock and key at WB Games for another decade, so unless it’s used in a Batman game or something, it’s unlikely you’ll ever see it again.</p>



<p>Fortunately for WB Games, the industry has changed and drastically fewer people buy second-hand software anymore.</p>

<p>One of the most popular, albeit controversial, skateboarders of all time is going to be in the next Tony Hawk game after all. According to The Nine Club podcast, Bam Margera will be in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 after all.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thenineclub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent episode</a> of the show, host Roger Bagley explained what happened to get Margera into the game after it was noticed at the reveal that he wasn’t part of the roster.</p>



<p>Bagley claims that the game was done and that Margera wasn’t going to be a part of it at all. Hawk himself then reportedly put his foot down to get him on the game’s roster.</p>



<p>“Tony called up Activision and was like ‘hey, we’re putting Bam in the thing’, and they were like ‘hey, we can’t’,” Bagley said. “He goes ‘no, you’re gonna do it’, and basically made them fly Bam back out there to get body-scanned and everything else, and get him back in the game.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/24/bam-margera-featured-tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> has since corroborated the claims, saying that Activision flew Margera out to Los Angeles recently to do motion capture work for the game. Prior to his, now likely, inclusion in the upcoming remake, Margera had appeared in seven Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater Games starting with the original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 in 2001. His last appearance was in 2007’s Tony Hawk’s Proving Ground.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision for comment on the claim and will update this story should a response be received. </p>



<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is set to release on July 11 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It’ll also be available day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC.</p>

<p>Minecraft has been out for over 15 years, and many fans have questioned if the time was right for the game to finally go free-to-play. If you happen to be one of those fans, you’re not going to like the answer.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-its-the-best-deal-in-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Minecraft executive producer Ingela Garneij said that neither Microsoft nor Mojang have any plans for the game to go the free-to-play route. </p>



<p>“Yeah, it doesn’t really work with the way we built it,” she said when posed with the question. </p>



<p>Garneij continued: “I mean we built the game for a different purpose. So monetization doesn’t work in that way for us. It’s a purchase of the game and then that’s it. For us it’s important that our game is available for as many people as possible. And so I think that’s a very core value that it should be accessible for everyone. It’s the best deal in the world.”</p>

<p>Minecraft first launched on PC in May 2009 before released a full 1.0 release in November 2011. It debuted on console when it released for Xbox 360 in May 2012 and is now available on every major platform.</p>



<p>Since its launch, the game has sold over 300 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time. The game, alongside its developer Mojang, was purchased in 2014 by Microsoft for $2.5 billion.</p>

<p>Just a week before the full Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event on April 2, Nintendo is expected to hold a separate event sometime this week. That’s according to well-known leaker Nate The Hate.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1904275415075606643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Monday, Nate The Hate said that he’s “heard there is a Nintendo presentation this week”. He added that he believes it will be on or around Thursday, and that “it’ll be a Direct”.</p>



<p>“I’m not 100% certain on the format at present,” he said.</p>



<p>Also unknown is what type of games will be shown during the event, if it happens. Will it focus exclusively on games releasing for the current Nintendo Switch, or will Switch 2 games be teased or shown as well?</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nintendo for comment on the claims, but the company won’t comment on rumor or speculation.</p>



<p>What do you think about a final Nintendo Direct before the full Switch 2 reveal next week? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>
