<p>The Valve Regional Standings, also known commonly as Valve rankings or VRS, are the primary factor that determines which CS2 teams go <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-counter-strike-major-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the illustrious Majors</a>. In previous years, Major participants were determined by the results of prior Majors and/or RMR qualifier events. But under the new system as of 2025, it’s VRS over anything else.</p>



<p>Checking out pro CS2 for the first time or returning after a while? Here’s a full breakdown of the Valve Regional Standings used in Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-valve-regional-standings">What are the Valve Regional Standings?</h2>



<p>The Valve Regional Standings are four sets of rankings for CS2 teams: one global standings, and three regional standings. Each of the regional standings ranks the teams from the three primary CS2 regions: Europe, the Americas, and Asia-Pacific.</p>



<p>The standings themselves rank teams based on their performances in ranked tournaments and matches. Each match played features several different factors that determine how a match affects a team’s standing. The primary factors are the result of the match, strength of opponent, weight (importance) of an event, and recency. These rankings are updated weekly, usually on Mondays.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-are-the-valve-regional-standings-used">How are the Valve Regional Standings used?</h2>



<p>Valve Regional Standings are used to determine invites to tournaments and tournament qualifiers. For the more prestigious events, organizers will use the global standings to determine who’s invited to the event. Tournament organizers will also use the regional standings to invite teams to regional closed qualifiers.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-confirms-cs2-major-expansion-and-rankings-based-invitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Valve Regional Standings influence which teams are invited to the Major</a>. Specifically, the Major uses the regional rankings and the regional results of the previous Major to decide how many teams from each region are invited and what stage they start in. </p>



<p>For example, at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming BLAST.tv Austin Major</a>, the top six European teams according to the VRS will be invited directly to Stage 3, alongside the number one ranked teams from Americas and Asia-Pacific. The regional rankings will also determine which teams from each region are invited to Stage 2, and which ones that will be invited to the closed regional qualifiers.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-are-the-valve-regional-standings">Where are the Valve Regional Standings?</h2>



<p>The Valve Regional Standings are <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike_regional_standings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted on a GitHub page</a> operated by Valve. From the main page, click on either the invitation or live folder, go to the current year, and select the regional standings page with the most current date. Sites like HLTV and BLAST also host the global and regional rankings, and update them each week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/should-you-replace-pebbles-in-kingdom-come-horse/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Since Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018), Henry of Skalitz has sat atop Pebbles, his trusty nag. While Pebbles isn’t the most attractive or capable horse at first blush, she’s a familiar sight in the series and has sentimental value. With that in mind, should you replace Pebbles in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 when you’re given the opportunity?</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll walk you through how to get your first horse in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and whether you should replace Pebbles once you’ve tracked her down.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-is-pebbles">Where is Pebbles?</h2>



<p>In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, players start the game alongside Pebbles, but a dire set of circumstances unfold, leaving Henry horse-less.</p>



<p>Not for long, though.</p>



<p>Once you’ve completed the opening sequences, you’ll want to make a beeline for Semine. When you’ve been released from the stocks in Troskowitz, you can speak to Bara (the red-clothed woman) and she’ll give you a tip on where to find a horse, recommending that you head to the Semine stables.</p>



<p>If you make your way there, you’ll be greeted with an idyllic location complete with a stables, and upon examining the horses, you’ll notice something strange – <strong>one of them is Pebbles</strong>.</p>



<p>Once you’ve identified Pebbles, you can speak to Groom Ballatay, attempting to buy Pebbles <strong>or </strong>convincing him to give Pebbles back for free. That’ll require passing a speech check or two, and you’ll have to convince him to ‘be reasonable’ to get Pebbles back.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-replace-pebbles">Should You Replace Pebbles?</h2>



<p>If you’re asking yourself, ‘Should I replace Pebbles,’ then I’m ashamed of you. This beautiful horse has been through the wringer and the first thing you want to do is replace her!</p>



<p>Here is the <strong>major reason why </strong>you don’t want to replace Pebbles in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eventually, you’ll unlock the ‘Good Old Pebbles’ perk, which boosts Pebbles’ skills immeasurably after a few hours of relying on her to get around. This makes her better than almost any horse you can buy.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you don’t like how Pebbles looks, you can customise her at a tailor or a saddler by selecting from a range of coats, covers, bridles, and saddles.</p>



<p>Once you’ve got Pebbles, make sure you’re firing from horseback with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/find-best-crossbow-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/">best ranged weapon in the game</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-launch-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-confirms-the-next-battlefield-title-will-launch-before-april-2026.1100301/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-launch-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA</a> has confirmed in its latest financial statements that they plan to launch the next Battlefield title before April 1, 2026.</p>



<p>In its Q3 FY25 results, the company said, “EA unveiled Battlefield Labs, a new initiative allowing player-driven testing and innovation<br>ahead of the franchise’s expected fiscal year 2026 release.”</p>



<p>EA’s fiscal year takes place between April 1st, 2025 to March 31, 2026. Logically and historically, it means that the next Battlefield title is targeting an October – November 2025 release.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, EA announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a>, a brand-new community test environment to test the game ahead of its final release. At the moment, it seems like Battlefield Labs will focus on the titles multiplayer offering, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield is also poised to have a free-to-play Battle Royale experience</a> by Ripple Effect. </p>



<p>Also announced in a behind-the-scenes preview of Battlefield Labs was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-portal-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return a Battlefield Portal</a>, which was first introduced in Battlefield 2042 and brings back classic maps, vehicles, weapons, and more.</p>



<p><strong>RELATED – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-learned-from-the-new-battlefield-game-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everything We Learned From The New Battlefield Game Footage</a></strong></p>



<p>The next Battlefield title is set to take the franchise to a “back to its roots” approach, taking the majority of its inspiration from Battlefield’s most popular days with Battlefield 3 and 4. Modern combat, a class system, and destruction are all poised to return.</p>



<p>Battlefield will now be led by Respawn Entertainment’s Vince Zampella as a part of the franchises restructuring following Battlefield 2042’s weak launch. </p>

<p>IEM Katowice is considered a prestige event in the massive Counter-Strike 2 calendar, and the best CS2 players there are delivering. The best players in the world are competing in the $1 million tournament, and both some familiar and new faces are shining the brightest.</p>



<p>Here are the best CS2 players from IEM Katowice after the conclusion of the group stage.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-from-iem-katowice-2025-group-stage">Best CS2 Players from IEM Katowice 2025 Group Stage</h2>



<h3 id="h-danil-donk-kryshkovets">Danil “donk” Kryshkovets</h3>



<p>Is anyone else surprised? You shouldn’t be. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donk-counter-strike-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last year’s consensus best player</a> of the year has <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/players?event=8034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the highest rating</a> of any player after the IEM Katowice group stages. He also finished with the highest ADR (average damage per round) rating and K/D differential of any player. Unsurprisingly, he was the lead man in Spirit’s playoff-clinching win over GamerLegion.</p>



<h3 id="h-guy-nertz-iluz">Guy “NertZ” Iluz</h3>



<p>Liquid may have fallen short of reaching IEM Katowice playoffs, but fans can be happy with how NertZ performed in Katowice. The team’s newest addition was an absolute force in creating opening kills, and was only outdone in ADR by donk. NertZ is clearly an upgrade for Liquid, and once the team cleans some things up, they should be a more familiar face in playoffs.</p>



<h3 id="h-oldrich-pr-novy">Oldřich “PR” Nový</h3>



<p>Every year, a new player emerges and threatens to break into the top echelon of Counter-Strike players. This year, an early contender for rookie of the year is Oldřich “PR” Nový, a 17 year old Czech player for GamerLegion. After some impressive matches against paiN and MOUZ, PR had a head-turning performance against the once great Astralis. On Mirage in particular, he dropped a staggering 29 kills and only died 7 times. PR and GamerLegion ultimately fell to donk and Spirit, missing playoffs, but he’s a player to keep watching in the future.</p>



<h3 id="h-ismailсan-xantares-dortkardes">İsmailсan “XANTARES” Dörtkardeş</h3>



<p>Eternal Fire is one of the hottest teams at the start of 2025, and XANTARES is a big reason why. The veteran rifler was having a solid event throughout groups, but he shined the brightest in a thrilling multi-overtime Nuke game against FaZe. XANTARES dropped a server-high 49 kills on Nuke, and won 12 out of 16 opening duels, pushing Eternal Fire over the finish line and into playoffs over FaZe.</p>



<h3 id="h-everyone-on-navi">Everyone on NAVI</h3>



<p>NAVI are the best team of 2024 and winners of the first CS2 Major, and everyone on the roster has been red hot in Katowice. Of the top 10 players according to HLTV player ratings, four of them are NAVI players: b1t, jL, iM, and w0nderful. NAVI defeated both FURIA and The MongolZ handedly, and took down donk and Spirit in an incredible series to guarantee playoffs.</p>
