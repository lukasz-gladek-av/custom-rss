<p>Hell is Us is an upcoming third-person, semi-open world action-adventure focusing on melee combat and exploration. The world you step into is very hostile and is filled with supernatural creatures that any of the modern weapons cannot defeat. However, you have a drone and a sword from a different age to help cut down these fierce chimaeras.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game is known for its unique exploration system. Players are placed in a virtual world without conventional navigation tools. They cannot use a map, compass, or quest markers; instead, they rely on their instincts to get ahead. This freedom extends to the narrative portion of the game, where players can make their own decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the previous <a href="https://youtu.be/Q69e1A3ovxI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gameplay trailer</a>, Hell is Us developers revealed how players will use swords, spears, and axes against various game entities in melee battles while taking advantage of the drone’s capabilities. They also discussed different types of exploration mechanics, information trading, and other details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the State of Play showcase, 1047 Games revealed that the first crossplay alpha test for Splitgate 2 is set to go live on February 27, running until March 2. It’ll be hosted across Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S – but the team has stressed that the game will be released on last-gen consoles, too.</p>



<p>Splitgate 2 was revealed in July 2024, emerging from the ashes of Splitgate, the ambitious portal-based FPS that was released in 2019 in early access. It wasn’t until September 2022 that Splitgate was fully released, but by that point, the player base had dwindled considerably.</p>



<p>1047 Games has evolved the Splitgate IP immeasurably in the last couple of years, and the follow-up title is looking <strong>sharp</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-next-generation">The Next Generation</h2>



<p>Splitgate 2, which can be compared to ‘Halo meets Portal’, is shaping up to be a special first-person shooter. This innovative title fuses traditional multiplayer modes and mechanics with portals, allowing players to dynamically deploy and utilise these ‘teleporting devices’ to alter the field of battle in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>It’s a high-octane concept that was delivered well in the first game, but owing to a lack of content and poor long-term player retention, Splitgate did ultimately flounder. </p>



<p>At the State of Play showcase, 1047 Games revealed that an alpha playtest for Splitgate 2 will run between February 27 and March 2, and players across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series platforms are invited to participate. This is the first crossplay test for the game, and it’ll feature a range of modes, weapons, and maps.</p>



<p>One of the biggest selling points of the alpha is an insane 24-player multiplayer mode made up of three teams of eight users.</p>



<p>Splitgate 2 doesn’t have a release date just yet, but stay tuned to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/">Insider Gaming</a> and we’ll let you know as soon as it’s confirmed.</p>

<p>Today (12) during the State of Play, the highly anticipated Lost Soul Aside received a new trailer and its release date was revealed. The game will be released on 30th May on PC and PS5.</p>

<iframe title="Lost Soul Aside - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EKvNt4bijE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Developed by the Chinese studio Ultzero Games and part of the PlayStation China Hero Project, Lost Soul Aside’s journey has been quite long. Initially, the game was developed by just one developer, called Yang Bin.</p>



<p>However, the project ended up attracting the attention of Sony in 2016, which decided to support the game with financial, marketing and development assistance. Sony embraced the game so much that it decided to publish it, making it a second-party title.</p>



<p>What was a game made by just one person, has become an ambitious project that has a team of more than 40 people. The trailer makes clear the inspirations of the creator of Lost Soul Aside. Final Fantasy XV and Devil May Cry are huge influences, both in combat and in character design.</p>



<p>The synopsis reads as follows:</p>



<p>“<em>Lost Soul Aside follows the story of Kazer, a young swordsman who finds himself fused with a symbiotic supernatural race called Arena. The game is set in a war-torn fantasy world.</em>“</p>
