<p>Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most popular multiplayer games in the world, boasting a community made up of millions of players. The ‘online portion’ of the game is thriving and continues to improve with time, but <strong>does Rainbow Six Siege have a campaign</strong>? Is there anything for solo players to do in Rainbow Six Siege?</p>



<p>As something of a live service game, Rainbow Six Siege is kept updated by Ubisoft, getting regular updates that keep the game alive and expanding. That’s all well and good, but what is there for people playing the game on their own? Is there a campaign in Rainbow Six Siege?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-does-rainbow-six-siege-have-a-story-mode">Does Rainbow Six Siege Have a Story Mode?</h2>



<p>There is no campaign in Rainbow Six Siege – and there never has been. It was a development decision made early on by Ubisoft, with the team opting to create a multiplayer-exclusive game that was devoid of a story mode. It was seen as a strange move by some, but it ultimately paid off, making Rainbow Six Siege one of the best multiplayer games ever.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege doesn’t have a campaign, but it has plenty of missions to soak up. There’s also a spin-off title named Rainbow Six Extraction – that has a story to follow, but it’s leagues away from Rainbow Six Siege when it comes to a side-by-side comparison. </p>



<p>Many will argue that Rainbow Six Siege doesn’t <b>need</b> a campaign – it’s all about the multiplayer, and that’s what matters most.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-rainbow-six-siege-solo">Can You Play Rainbow Six Siege Solo?</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has a series of offline missions called ‘Situations’ that you can explore without any other player helping you out. In the solo play portion of the game, you can access various zones with any Operator in the game, picking your loadout and taking on a series of missions based on the game’s multiplayer map pool.</p>



<p>It’s a great way to learn the game’s ropes, mechanics, and maps – but it’s not a replacement for multiplayer. That’s where Rainbow Six Siege truly shines.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-cross-progression/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rainbow Six Siege keeps going from strength to strength as Ubisoft, the game’s developer, keeps pumping it full of meaningful content updates. With a broad esports ecosystem, millions of players, and a solid multiplayer platform, Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most valuable games in the business. It’s a seamless enough game, but <strong>does Rainbow Six Siege have cross progression</strong>?</p>



<p>For many modern multiplayer games, cross progression mechanics are pivotal to delivering a successful game. Many players are cross-platform gamers these days, which means they’ll likely play the same game on different platforms – PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, and Mobile. This is one of the most electrifying multiplayer titles in the industry, but does Rainbow Six Siege have cross progression mechanics?</p>



<p>Let’s answer that question.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-does-rainbow-six-have-cross-progression-features">Does Rainbow Six Have Cross Progression Features?</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has seamless cross progression between every platform it exists on, ensuring players can recover their progress and keep up the fight no matter what platform they’re playing on. It’s done through the linking of a player’s Ubisoft account, which serves as the ‘middle man mechanic’ between these platforms. </p>



<p>There is a caveat though – certain statistics are shared on a limited basis. Three types of progress are only shared between Xbox and PlayStation or PC and Amazon Luna: Current Rank, Rank History, and Skill MMR. That means you’ll have a different skill rating on PlayStation compared to PC.</p>



<p>Aside from those elements, almost everything is available in Rainbow Six Siege on a cross progression basis. This is a feature that has existed since November 2022, and since then, it has been tried, tested, and approved by the community.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-rainbow-six-siege-have-crossplay">Does Rainbow Six Siege Have Crossplay?</h2>



<p>As of 2024, Rainbow Six Siege has a fully seamless ecosystem, allowing players on any platform to play with anyone else. That means that if you’re a PC gamer, you can connect with your friends playing Rainbow Six Siege on PlayStation 5, and vice-versa.</p>



<h2 id="h-faqs">FAQs</h2>



<h3 id="h-how-to-unlock-cross-progression-on-rainbow-six-siege">How to unlock cross-progression on Rainbow Six Siege</h3>



<p>To access cross-progression mechanics, you’ll need to be logged into the same Ubisoft account on the two (or more) platforms.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/us-tiktok-ban-statement-issued/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98tiktok-will-be-forced-to-go-dark%E2%80%99-statement-issued-ahead-of-us-tiktok-ban.1085889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/us-tiktok-ban-statement-issued/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>ByteDance’s US representatives have issued a statement on social media ahead of the application’s impending shutdown on January 19. In the final days before the US TikTok ban, it has been stated that the only thing that can save the app now is the word of the Biden Administration, the very team that brought about TikTok’s imminent doom in 2024.</p>



<p>The US TikTok ban will impact 170 million users nationwide, including tens of thousands of gaming content creators who use the application to supplement their creation-based income streams.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-begin-the-countdown">Begin the Countdown</h2>



<p>Tomorrow, TikTok will be banned in the United States unless President Biden (and his team) issue a statement to ‘assure non-enforcement’. That’s not likely to happen.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/TikTokPolicy/status/1880424906820608180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent post</a> on social media, the TikTok team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok’s availability to over 170 million Americans. </p>



<p>Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It hasn’t yet been revealed exactly how TikTok will be banned in the country, but it’s widely assumed that storefronts like Google Play and the iOS App Store will block downloads of the application. It’s also believed that geoblocking measures will be put in place to stop people in the United States from accessing TikTok via a browser.</p>



<p>The move comes amid a desire from the United States government to distance itself from Chinese companies. In recent days, the Pentagon placed Tencent on a ‘blacklist’, marking it as an organisation that requires heightened attention from security services. ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing, is the parent company over the top of TikTok.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-ceo-addresses-recent-runescape-scandal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98clumsy-and-inconsiderate%E2%80%99-jagex-ceo-gives-update-on-recent-runescape-membership-scandal.1085841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-ceo-addresses-recent-runescape-scandal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier this week, I reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/runescape-membership-charge-tiers-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the changes</a> that Jagex is proposing for RuneScape’s paid membership model. In a series of images shared on social media, it was revealed that a survey had been conducted by Jagex, and in that survey, players were asked to rate a series of proposed membership packages, some of which were audacious.</p>



<p>In a new post published on the RuneScape platform, Jagex’s CEO, Mod Pips, has laid bare the reasons why these changes have to happen. It’s a transparent move from the firm that players have welcomed with open arms, but it’s still not perfect.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-a-major-misjudgement">‘It Was a Major Misjudgement’</h2>



<p>In the post on the RuneScape blog, Mod Pips opened by explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This was clumsy and inconsiderate, to say the least. We failed to think this through from your perspective as players. We got caught up in research mode and rushing a project with a research partner.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ‘exploratory survey’ set the community ablaze, with some of the proposed membership tiers paywalling elements like better account security and enhanced player support. In some cases, users could pay for a RuneScape membership and still have to see ads in the game.</p>



<p>Pips went deeper:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was a major misjudgement to include features that suggested we would consider degrading the game experience or impacting gameplay. Even the mere suggestion of ideas like in-game ads, shorter AFK timers, or making improved player support an additional cost undermined your trust in us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Going forward, the Jagex team has pledged:</p>



<ul>
<li>To not include in-game advertisements in any regular paid membership</li>



<li>To ensure that any subscription ‘provides access to the full suite of core game content’</li>



<li>To not make plugins or features on the official client ‘paid options’</li>



<li>To not paywall player support</li>
</ul>



<p>The blog post was ended with a final statement from Mod Pips:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This kind of transparency and collaboration is at the heart of what makes our games so special. The game is shaped by its community, and your voices remain central to every decision we make. While we recognise that mistakes were made here, the fact that we’ve received such strong and clear feedback reinforces how deeply you care about this game.</p>



<p>Old School RuneScape thrives because of its community, and working closely with you keeps us moving forward, even when the discussions are difficult.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the post has satisfied the community somewhat, it’s clear the road ahead is yet to be fully traversed and that changes <strong>are coming</strong>, whether players like it or not.</p>



<p>Do you think the statement from Mod Pips is a good one or has Jagex forever ruined your interpretation of RuneScape? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In a long-awaited update from Treyarch, it has been revealed that when season two arrives in Black Ops 6, it’ll come hand-in-hand with a feature <strong>many </strong>have been asking for. With the season two update, console players will finally be able to switch off crossplay mechanics, locking them into matchmaking against <strong>only </strong>other console players and <strong>not </strong>PC users.</p>



<p>This is a step to prevent console players from running into cheaters, which are <strong>always </strong>more commonplace on PC platforms. The feature is in testing now and will go live ‘during’ season two.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-finally">Finally.</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1880381003270848925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post</a> on social media and on the Call of Duty blog, Treyarch revealed the impending update:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In Season 02, we are enabling the ability to disable crossplay for console players who to compete only against other console players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This will be deployed for both Warzone and Black Ops 6 Ranked Play, but it <strong>won’t </strong>roll out for general multiplayer playlists, which has been met with disappointment from fans on social media. Treyarch insisted it will ‘be closely monitoring’ and will consider ‘further changes to prioritise the integrity of the ecosystem’ going forward.</p>



<p>Since Ranked Play dropped in Black Ops 6, it has been a shambles of a scene. Even a cursory glance across social media will uncover countless pro players and content creators stressing their frustration about cheaters dominating Ranked Play.</p>



<p>It’s the same thing year after year, but in Black Ops 6, it just seems <strong>worse</strong> than ever before, for some reason.</p>



<p>It’s a similar story in Warzone.</p>



<p>Treyarch also highlighted that ‘Vote to Forfeit’ is coming midway through season two, allowing players to end matches without losing SR or facing any game suspensions. Later, disconnect protection will be added in the form of an ability to rejoin matches when you’ve dropped out.</p>



<p>Do you think this change is a W from Treyarch, or would you rather see it rolled out to cover all multiplayer playlists? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
