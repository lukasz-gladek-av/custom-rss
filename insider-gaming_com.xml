On the awards front, The Game Awards announced their nominees for 2025, and the 43rd Annual Golden Joystick Awards were held this week. </p>







<p>Elsewhere, Concord has been shut down a second time and Hytale is back after being bought out by its creator, Hypixel. All these stories and more in your Insider Gaming weekly recap.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Ubisoft was working on a new entry in the Splinter Cell franchise, but Ubisoft decided to cancel it before it was ever announced.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, AdHoc Studio co-founder Nick Herman spoke about how Dispatch came to be and an interesting situation that led to the studio’s formation.</p>



<p>Herman was hired in 2017 by Ubisoft, along two other AdHoc cofounders Pierre Shorette and Dennis Lenart, and moved to work in Ubisoft’s San Francisco office. Upon arrival, they were put on the new Splinter Cell project.</p>

However, Insider Gaming has covered the game extensively over the past 18 months and has now learned that it’s set to launch&nbsp;before March 31, 2026.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Hypixel Studios is back, and they have brought an old friend along with it. On Monday, founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced that they had reacquired the rights to sandbox game Hytale from Riot Games.</p>

<h3>Concord Has Effectively Been Shut Down By Sony For A Second Time</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>Concord has gone down in infamy as an all-time Sony and PlayStation blunder. It’s also understandable that the company wants to sweep the game’s existence under the rug, which is why Sony has presumably and swiftly issued DMCAs notices to gameplay videos of a fan-inspired Concord reboot, causing access to the game to be halted.</p>



<p>Now, a community effort to resurrect the game has been met with strong action.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>The long road to Star Citizen’s full release looks to be continuing, as it’s been 13 years since the game was announced. We’ve checked back in from time to time, and the latest update is that Star Citizen is still in alpha, and it’s swiftly closing in on $900 million of crowd-funded money.</p>



<p>Say what you want, yes, but&nbsp;Star Citizen&nbsp;actually looks like a quality game. On the other hand, it probably should do when it’s had the development time that many multi-game franchises get and enough money to fund several Hollywood-level movies. Cloud Imperium Games’ Star Citizen could end up being one of the most fascinating games of our time.</p>

<h3>Resident Evil Requiem Producer Addresses Leon Kennedy Rumors</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stevivor</a>, Resident Evil Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa opened up on the upcoming sequel.</p>



<p>It should be noted that Kumazawa’s responses were translated via an interpreter. While we don’t discredit the translator, there’s always the possibility that something was lost in translation. But when asked about the future of Leon Kennedy and the rumors that he might be in Resident Evil Requiem, Kumazawa had a simple response…</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-set-b1a/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket-next-set-release-details%E2%80%94new-set-b1a-explained.1360960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Even though the developers seem to be listening, Pokémon TCG Pocket content is still coming thick and fast. Set B1a will be here before you know it, so you should know its potential release details and what to expect from it.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-b1-release-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Rising</a> was the culmination of one year of Pokémon TCG Pocket. B1 brought us full circle and did so with a huge collection of cards that will take weeks to collect. Creatures Inc. and DeNA have been easing up slightly on the new sets—with Deluxe Pack ex proving to be a rest point for some.</p>







<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is going to drop Set B1a in the future, and it might be wise to have Hourglasses ready.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-pokemon-tcg-pocket-set">When Is The Next Pokémon TCG Pocket Set?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Probably won’t be a big one. Credit to the Pokémon company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to various sources, Pokémon TCG Pocket Set B1a isn’t arriving until December 17.</strong></p>



<p>If this is correct, this means we aren’t getting a new Pokémon TCG Pocket set in November 2025. This would mirror what happened in Pocket’s first year. Genetic Apex was the debut set for the game, and Set 1a didn’t arrive until toward the end of December 2024—giving everyone two months to try and complete the collection.</p>







<p>Leaks suggest the plan is the same for Pokémon TCG Pocket in 2025. Mega Rising will carry over into December 2025, presumably due to the size of the set (over 300 new cards is a lot).</p>



<p>Then, a new, as yet unnamed, set will drop at the end of December 2025, giving everyone some festive cheer.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-can-we-expect-from-pokemon-tcg-pocket-b1a">What Can We Expect From Pokémon TCG Pocket B1a?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket B1a is likely to be a mini-set featuring a much smaller assortment of cards.</strong></p>



<p>Because it’s so far away, we haven’t seen or heard any B1a leaks. Conversely, it’s common sense that the next set will follow in the footsteps of other sets that end with an “a” or a “b.” Genetic Apex was followed up by Mythical Island, which only added 86 cards.</p>



<p>Triumphant Light (A2a) included 96 cards, and Shining Revelry (A2b) had 112 cards, for example. While each new set is growing bigger—thanks to Shinies and other special designs—B1a will probably have between 100-120 new cards—including Rares.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders allows you to customize special skins and sell them for in-game currency. One skin has taken it too far, and the already-infamous bikini skin has been rendered unavailable on the Kirby Air Riders Machine Market.</p>



<p>Sometimes you need to take a step back and realise what you’re saying and typing. But it’s all true: A controversial customizable bikini skin is no longer obtainable in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-1-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a>. The humorous but risqué&nbsp;outfit can no longer be bought, and it’s probably a warning to all players that you need to tread carefully with any sus designs.</p>

<p>Within 24 hours of the game coming out, users were making eye-opening skins and selling them on the game’s Machine Market. Everything is bought and traded using the game’s currency.</p>



<p>One particular skin went viral very quickly: A design showing Chef Kawasaki wearing a micro-bikini. If you didn’t know, Chef Kawasaki is a regular character in the Kirby universe, and their default getup is usually just some kind of cooking apron.</p>







<p>According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chef-kawasaki-micro-bikini-ride-deleted-from-kirby-air-riders-machine-market-immediately-replaced-by-succubus-chef-kawasaki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>: “Chef Kawasaki&nbsp;wearing a micro&nbsp;bikini has been a running&nbsp;joke&nbsp;among&nbsp;a&nbsp;portion&nbsp;of&nbsp;Japanese Kirby fans for quite a few years.&nbsp;The&nbsp;headcanon&nbsp;seems to have resulted from fans looking at Chef Kawasaki’s standard attire –&nbsp;naked&nbsp;save for a single&nbsp;apron&nbsp;– and thinking, ‘Isn’t that kind of lewd?'”</p>



<p>So, once you give players the appropriate tools, they are sure to create inappropriate outfits. Kirby Air Riders’ technology finally allowed the Chef Kawasaki&nbsp;bikini look to happen.</p>

<p>Have you rinsed your eyes yet? Well, it only took hours for the design to be removed.</p>

<p>It was fun while it lasted, but this dual-wields as both an action and a warning to Kirby Air Riders players: Think twice before putting Chef Kawasaki—or anyone, for that matter—in a micro-bikini and selling it on the Machine Market.</p>
