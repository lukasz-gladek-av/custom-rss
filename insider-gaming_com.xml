<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s release date brings with it bloodshed and battles. Warhorse Studio’s brand of historical warfare and realism has proven to be successful, so we’re here to take a look at Deliverance 2’s launch window and available platforms.</p>



<p>The first visit to Kingdom Come wasn’t overly loved by critics, but fans loved it. Its developer revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance has sold 8 million copies</a> and counting. The 2018 RPG made its mark, and then some. Now, the eagerly awaited sequel is preparing to unsheath its blade and plunge it deep into any who have the gall to come back for a second helping.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-playstation-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest releases coming in early 2025</a>, and is set to wrap up the events of the original.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-s-release-date">When is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An epic war is coming. Credit to Warhorse Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is scheduled to launch on February 4</strong>.</p>



<p>It was announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-one-week-earlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deliverance 2 would be released a week earlier</a> than planned, and it’s set to expand on almost everything that made the original so popular.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has been hard at work on the sequel since the first game dropped. The studio has grown from 11 people to over 250, and Deliverance 2 is what the company wanted the original to be like—from the words of creative director Daniel Vávra in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R48DEEjyS5k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s Official Game Reveal Trailer</a>.</p>



<p>There’s improved NPC behavior, better real-world interactions, an emphasis again on sleep and food, and new weapons are included such as crossbows and firearms.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-time">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is likely to be released at midnight worldwide</strong>—unless Warhorse Studios says otherwise.</p>



<p>Most games have a universal midnight release schedule for each region. Deliverance 2 doesn’t seem to be any different, so, for the time being, presume Delliverance 2 is releasing at midnight in your time zone. If you’re in New Zealand, you’re laughing, anywhere else, and you’re playing catch up!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-platforms">All Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s day-one launch platforms.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor (for now), Deliverance 2 is restricted purely to next-gen consoles and formats. 2018’s first entry has versions on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Amazon Luna, and Nintendo Switch. The final format on this list was a newcomer—only debuting on Jun. 10, 2021—which means Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 could opt for extra platforms in the future as well.</p>

<p>We’ve already described the newest Kingdom Come as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Purest Evolution of a Stellar RPG” in our preview</a>. Do you think it can live up to the original? Or is it going to be a King without a Kingdom?</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been delayed yet again. Ubisoft announced on Thursday that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is being delayed from its February 14 release date to March 20.</p>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1877400048314528126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on social media</a>, Marc-Alexis Côté says that the game needs “additional weeks” to implement changes based on feedback received from players during testing.</p>



<p>“Since November, we’ve been thrilled to share our progress through Gameplay Overviews, and the overwhelming excitement has truly inspired us,” he said. “Each week has brought valuable feedback from our community. While we’ve already made remarkable strides, we believe a few additional weeks are needed to implement that feedback and ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience.”</p>



<p>He continued: “We remain committed to delivering a high-quality, immersive experience—fostered by ongoing dialogue between our players and development teams. We know you’re eager to learn more about Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and we’re excited to share that more updates will be coming your way very soon!”</p>







<p>On top of Côté’s statement, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said in a press release that the decision to delay the game again was “part of the renewed focus on gameplay quality and engaging Day-1 experiences.”</p>



<p>Côté also thanked the studio’s “incredible fans and dedicated teams” for their support after first delaying Shadows from November  2024 to February 2025 back in September. You can read his full statement below.</p>

<p>The upcoming open-world action RPG Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is releasing on PC after all. </p>



<p>After first being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-mobile-game-is-launching-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed for iOS and Android</a> at The Game Awards 2024, developer Netmarble has confirmed the game will launch on Windows. The confirmation came via an announcement for <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en/cbt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">closed beta signups</a> that added PC to the available platforms. </p>



<p>Alongside the beta announcement came a list of minimum PC specs that players need. those include an Intel Core i7-9700 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500 CPU, 8GB of memory, 30GB of storage space, Windows 10/11, and at least an Nvidia GeForce RTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT graphics card.</p>



<p>Regarding the Game of Thrones: Kingsroad closed beta, it will take place from January 16-22 and be on both PC and mobile. It will feature the first look at the land of Westeros, three classes to try,  and a look at the original story developed specifically for the game.

<p>As mentioned, the game features a new original story that starts with the dead of King Robert Baratheon.</p>



<p>“As the Lannisters desperately cling to the Iron Throne, the war between those who would claim it for themselves hurtles towards its final act,” the <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">story reads</a>. “The king’s brother, Stannis Baratheon, gathers his forces for a final assault, while the vast, frozen lands of the North smolder after the betrayal at the Red Wedding.”</p>



<p>According to Netmarble, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad also features a “realistic manual combat system” that requires you to defeat enemies using “strategic combos”.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is almost here. Scheduled for release in less than two months, the game’s promotional campaign is in full swing.</p>



<p>Aware of the huge hype for the game, IGN brought the title to its <a href="https://youtu.be/yp-28fhhOs4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN First</a> panel. The show is dedicated to revealing new information about highly anticipated games. In the videos released today, they provided details of two monsters: Ajakaran and Rompopolo.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 9 Minutes of Ajarakan Oilwell Basin Gameplay (4K)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aX0wxnX6WDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to the videos, the two monsters reside in the Oilwell Basin area. A volcanic ecosystem full of caves, tar pits, oil lakes and large thermal vents that spew out smoke and other gases. The region is home to the Azuz Tribe. They use the region’s characteristics to produce energy and weapons. The region’s Apex monster is called the Black Flame, however, no further details about the monster have been revealed yet.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>As we can see in the videos above, the Ajarakan resembles a Flaming Gorilla with a carapace and the Rompopolo resembles a mosquito fused with a mantis. Both monsters are new to Wilds. According to the game’s Wiki, they are very territorial and often fight each other.</p>



<p>The Rompopolo usually buries its tail in mud and oil to cause gas explosions, while the Ajarakan is strong and agile, using its aggression to unleash flaming attacks.</p>



<p>Scheduled for release on February 28th, the next game in the franchise is one of the most anticipated games of 2025. It will come as no surprise if it ends up being nominated for the best game of the year. Judging by all the materials released so far, the game looks spectacular. Of course, we’ll have to see it in action next month!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/one-of-the-most-blatant-pokemon-rip-offs-can-now-be-wishlisted-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>One of the most blatant Pokémon rip-offs is now available to be wishlisted on Steam. Insider Gaming was recently contacted by the developers behind “Fay Keeper,” a brand-new creature-catching game where players collect and battle hundreds of creatures called “Fays.” The request was for a paid partnership – and in the current game industry climate it’s an opportunity that comes few and far between.</p>



<p>Yet, having looked at the game initially, we couldn’t help but feel inclined that the game is a blatant rip-off of Pokémon.</p>



<p>From the color pallet to the creatures themselves, the comparisons are strikingly similar, and although it’s clear that the developers want to capitalize on an itching Pokémon audience on the PC, I can’t help but feel the team is likely going to run into legal issues. You even get your very own “Faydex.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming compiled a couple comparisons between Fay Keeper and Pokémon below (click to enlarge) so you can muster your own opinions.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, the developers of the game have addressed them slightly on social media when asked by fans about the comparisons to Pokémon. BGS Studios doesn’t hide the fact that it takes inspiration from the classic franchise, but maintains that there will be enough differences between the titles to avoid any potential legal claims.</p>



<p>“Pokémon was a huge ref and the idea was for it to feel nostalgic, but me and the team are working on a lot of unique features that Pokémon games never had,” <a href="https://x.com/FayKeeper/status/1861816033549443480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one post reads</a>.</p>



<p>In another response to a question regarding copyright, <a href="https://x.com/FayKeeper/status/1861906032097718607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BGS Studios said</a>, “Although we took inspiration from a very nostalgic reference, every single pixel and line of code is being made from scratch by us. We’ll also have mechanics that were never in the original ref, so it will hit close while also being a different thing.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming did reach out to BGS Studios for further comment on the similarities, and to talk about any potential worries or concerns. Those attempts, however, have gone unanswered as of publishing.</p>



<p>What do you think of the similarities between Fay Keeper and Pokémon? Do you think this could lead to problems down the road?
