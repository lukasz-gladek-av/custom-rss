            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been suggested on social media that Battlefield 2042, the most recent game in the series to hit the open market, will get a ‘surprisingly big’ content update soon. It was theorized that this could be the final update to hit the Battlefield 2042 platform before Battlefield 6 is released worldwide on October 10.</p>



<p>The claimed update that comes from ‘Temporyal’ on social media includes a new map, three new weapons, and two new vehicles being broken out of the Battlefield Vault.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2042-s-final-content-update">Battlefield 2042’s Final Content Update</h2>



<p>With Battlefield 6 sitting tantalizingly close on that horizon, Battlefield 2042 is preparing to become a forgotten thing of the past. In a new post on social media, prolific dataminer ‘Temporyal’ claimed that a ‘surprisingly big’ update is headed to Battlefield 2042, and that it might be <strong>the final update</strong> for the game, content-wise.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Battlefield 2042 may be getting a surprisingly big (maybe final?) content update soon.</p><p>New Map:<br>🇯🇵 Iwo Jima</p><p>New Weapons:<br>🤫 The Prototype (“Riverdweller”)<br>🔫 KFS2000 (FN F2000)<br>🎯 GM6 Lynx</p><p>New Vault Vehicles:<br>🇺🇸 A-10 Warthog<br>🇷🇺 SU-25TM Frogfoot</p><p>🪖 Pax Armata-themed cosmetics <a href="https://t.co/vvZ3P4uhUl">pic.twitter.com/vvZ3P4uhUl</a></p></div>— temporyal (@temporyal) <a href="https://twitter.com/temporyal/status/1955701622660591897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Iwo Jima is a setting we’ve seen before in the Battlefield world, even if it seems a little out of left field for Battlefield 2042 (and Battlefield 6, for that matter).</p>



<p>The suggestion that this update includes Pax Armata is interesting. It almost guarantees it’ll drop soon, as Pax Armata is the antagonist faction in Battlefield 6, and this would be Electronic Arts fuelling the hype for the next game by bleeding it into Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>I’m personally more interested in the return of the SU-25TM and the A-10. They’re timeless classics in the Battlefield space, and raking the ground with fire from the Warthog’s auto-cannon never gets old.</p>



<p><strong>BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT</strong>.</p>



<p>Temporyal explained a little more about the Pax Armata cosmetics by offering a description from a datamined bundle:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A new way of warfare has been born, and that requires soldiers trained for the task. Pax Armata intends to change the world – will you join their ranks or become one of the conquered?”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Are you eager to see the back of Battlefield 2042, or are you intent on enjoying this potentially final content update? Let me know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

<p>Black Ops 7 is fighting to stay relevant as the worldwide reveal approaches. On August 19, during the Opening Night Live showcase, Activision’s studios will unveil Black Ops 7 beyond what they’ve already shown, hopefully contending for their slice of the FPS pie and wrangling attention away from Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>In a series of new leaks that have emerged on social media, prominent Call of Duty insider TheGhostofHope has revealed a slew of information about the upcoming shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-maps-are-coming-back-in-black-ops-7">What Maps Are Coming Back in Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p>According to TheGhostofHope, Black Ops 7 will launch with three remastered maps pulled from 2012’s Black Ops II:</p>



<ul>
<li>Raid</li>



<li>Express</li>



<li>Hijacked</li>
</ul>



<p>The post containing the remastered maps tidbit came after a claim that Specialist abilities will return for Black Ops 7. This mechanic hasn’t been seen since Black Ops 4, and it simply allows players to pick from characters or classes that have a unique ability. As GhostofHope puts it, this could be ‘active camo, grapple hook, and more.’</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Thanks to the Black Ops 7 title reveal at the Xbox Game Showcase in June, we already knew that active camo is a thing in this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>GhostofHope went on to explain that Black Ops 7’s larger-than-life multiplayer mode, which will be akin to the recent outings of ‘Ground War’ is apparently ‘<strong>trash</strong>‘. They also mentioned that a wingsuit appears in this mode, given that it will unfold over much larger maps than those seen in traditional multiplayer playlists.</p>



<p>What do you think of these latest Black Ops 7 leaks? Are you excited about remastered maps and perhaps want more? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you’re thinking.</p>
