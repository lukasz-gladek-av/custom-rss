<p>PlayStation Wrapped 2025 is the chance to see your full gaming stats for the year. Sony PlayStation users can see a bunch of PS4, PS5, and PS VR 2 stats racked up over the course of 12 months, and it’s all brought to you in one neat wrapped PlayStation Wrapped present.</p>



<p>Forget about wrapping presents; it’s time to unpack a year’s worth of media consumption. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-spotify-wrapped-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify Wrapped</a> has become hugely popular at the end of every year, and even YouTube has gotten in on the act. But for gamers, PlayStation Wrapped is where it’s at. </p>



<p>It’s a full self-assessment of how little time you’ve spent touching grass. PlayStation Wrapped 2025 is coming, so here’s the latest on your next big social media boast (or confession).</p>

<p><strong>Based on recent years, Insider Gaming expects PlayStation Wrapped 2025 to go live on Tuesday, December 9.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation Wrapped 2021 came out on January 20 and really was a reflection of the full year of gaming prior. However, Sony and PlayStation started to follow the trend by releasing it toward the end of the year, and this started when PlayStation Wrapped 2022 launched on <strong>Tuesday, December 13</strong>, 2022.</p>



<p>Next up was 2023’s edition of Wrapped, beginning on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, <strong>December 12</strong>, and 2024’s iteration arrived on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, <strong>December 10</strong>.</p>



<p>There’s a clear theme here, as you can see—it arrives on the second Tuesday of the month. </p>



<p>While there’s no guarantee Sony will do the same again for PlayStation owners in 2025, don’t be shocked to see PlayStation Wrapped become available on Tuesday, December 9.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-playstation-wrapped-2025">What is PlayStation Wrapped 2025?</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation Wrapped gives you an in-depth stat pack detailing your PlayStation playtime, such as most-played games, how many hours you spent on your console, and more.</strong></p>



<p>Wrapped tells you almost everything about your PlayStation year: Games played, Trophies accumulated, multiplayer hours, hours in general, etc.</p>



<p>It’s a comprehensive encyclopedia of your 2025 PlayStation gaming year. Get ready to be wowed and woken up by surprising stats, and be shocked at how many hours you’ve spent dropping into Fortnite and realizing how much Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has sapped your time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Postal: Bullet Paradise Developer Flip-Flops on AI Use Before Shutting Down]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/postal-bullet-paradise-developer-ai-use-shutting-down/</link>
            <guid>1376362</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The developers of Postal: Bullet Paradise have shut down, but not before flip-flopping on claims against it regarding use of generative AI.</p>



<p>On Friday, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-within-a-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported that Running With Scissors</a> had canceled Postal: Bullet Paradise a day after it was first revealed. That cancellation came after being “overwhelmed with negative responses” regarding the game relying heavily on AI-generated assets. Because of that, the studio ended development on the game, and cut ties with developer Goonswarm Games.</p>







<p>After the news broke, Goonswarm Games didn’t stay quiet for long. The studio <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1996984553257279918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted a statement</a> on social media saying that it was “mistakenly accused” of using AI-generated art in the game and that  “every attempt to clarify our work only escalated the situation.”</p>



<p>The studio added that they were “truly sorry” to artists who “put their soul into this” only to be hit with “false AI accusations”. </p>



<p>“It’s tough to pour so much energy into a game and end up caught in the middle of an AI war by accident,” they said. “We’ve decided to shut down the studio and end all future activities.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Being faced with accusations of using AI in your games is nothing new in today’s climate, but shutting down a studio for what they claimed were false allegations seemed like a jump to a lot of onlookers. </p>



<p>Turns out, there was more smoke to the fire.</p>



<p>A day after denying use of generative AI in the Postal: Bullet Paradise, Goonswarm Games put out another lengthy <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1997357931436663056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media message</a> stating that there was, in fact, AI-generated assets used.</p>



<p><strong>“The promo art does appear to include or be influenced by AI-generated material,”</strong> they said. <strong>“We collaborated with external artists for years and never saw any signs of this. The layered PSDs always looked legitimate within our internal pipeline, which is why our initial reaction was to protect our team and defend our innocence.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We understand now that your concerns were valid. And we take responsibility for not catching this earlier.”</strong></p>







<p>The studio then said that the only art they claim was AI generated was promo art, and it <strong>“does not concern the real artists who worked on gameplay visuals, assets, and other content.”</strong></p>



<p>In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi said that they wished them the best as both parties move forward in separate ways.</p>



<p><strong>“Running With Scissors has always operated with an unwavering commitment to the truth and transparency,”</strong> he added. <strong>“We look forward to continuing to support our fans and expand on the&nbsp;Postal universe played by millions.”</strong></p>

<p>A new report reveals that Netflix considered acquiring Electronic Arts, Disney, and Fox, but none of those deals came to fruition. </p>



<p>Netflix is the new big dog in town, ever since it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the company would acquire Warner Bros. for $82.7 billion in 2026, likely giving it access to studios like NetherRealm, Rocksteady, TT Games, and Avalanche. New details reveal they have considered buying other major companies, including EA and Disney. </p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-debated-pursuing-ea-disney-and-fox">Netflix ‘Debated Pursuing’ EA, Disney, and Fox</h2>



<p>A new Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-07/netflix-co-ceo-ted-sarandos-wooed-trump-personally-ahead-of-warner-bid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> about Netflix CEO wooing Trump ahead of Warner Bros.’ bid says the company considered acquisitions of EA, Disney, and Fox. It first talks about how Netflix is an “unlikely bidder”, as co-founder and chairman, Reed Hastings, avoids major deals to build things “from scratch”. The company’s management “debated pursuing just about every major asset put up for sale, including&nbsp;Electronic Arts Inc.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Fox.” They also considered acquiring Disney at one point. </p>



<p>However, the “executives could never coalesce behind a deal.” Additionally, the execs didn’t want to “hurt their stock price by overpaying for an asset that traded at a much lower multiple.” Netflix’s co-CEO Greg Peters also stated, ahead of the acquisition of Warner Bros., that “One should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers, they don’t have an amazing track record,” which led people to think Netflix was not interested in the deal. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here is every studio</a> that was affected by the Warner Bros &amp; Netflix merger. Additionally, Paramount has made a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hostile offer</a> to acquire Warner Bros.
