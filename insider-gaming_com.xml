<p>Arknights: Endfield has plenty for players to sink their teeth into, and a bunch of codes are available to redeem for handy bonuses to help your progression.</p>



<p>With so much to explore, it always helps to get everything you possibly can in your possession, and Insider Gaming has all the active codes to redeem in Arknights: Endfield.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-active-arknights-enfield-codes">All Active Arknights: Enfield Codes</h2>

<p><strong>There are several codes available to redeem in Arknights: Enfield, providing a boost of rewards, including various forms of currency.</strong></p>



<p>The majority are available for players across all platforms, though there is one additional PC-exclusive code. While some of the codes appear to be available permanently, others are limited-time and must be redeemed before the expiration date.</p>



<p>Once redeemed, all rewards must be claimed from the in-game mailbox within 30 days, or they will disappear, so it’s a good habit to claim the rewards immediately after redemption.</p>



<p>The table below shows all the active codes in Arknights: Enfield and the rewards earned for redemption.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-arknights-endfield-codes">How to Redeem Arknights: Endfield Codes</h2>



<p><strong>Code redemption in Arknights: Endfield is completed through a specific menu in the game, though it won’t be unlocked immediately.</strong></p>



<p>Early progression must be ticked off before the feature to redeem codes is made available, and more playtime is required to unlock the Mail feature, where bonuses can be claimed.</p>



<p>Here’s the step-by-step process to redeem codes in Arknights: Endfield.</p>



<ol>
<li>Play through the main story in Arknights Endfield until you complete the Valley Reboot mission.</li>



<li>In the menu, select the settings cog in the top-left of the screen.</li>



<li>Select the ‘Platform &amp; Account’ section.</li>



<li>Choose the ‘Exchange Code’ option.</li>



<li>Input the desired code.</li>



<li>Claim the rewards from your mailbox.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you’re yet to unlock the Mail feature, don’t worry, as any redeemed rewards will be waiting for you when you reach that stage in progression.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-fans-dismay-reunion-ashly-burch/</link>
            <guid>1411642</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Yesterday, Life is Strange: Reunion was unveiled in full, with Deck Nine and Square Enix revealing the next game in the decade-old franchise. It follows directly on from 2024’s Life is Strange: Double Exposure, and for the first time since 2017, it brings back Chloe Price, the other half of the ‘Pricefield’ ship.</p>



<p>She’ll join Max Caulfield in a race against time to once again save the world (or at least their little bit of it) from certain cataclysmic catastrophes. However, following the reveal, much of the Life is Strange community has shared a wave of disappointment about Ashly Burch, the original voice actor for Chloe Price, <strong>not </strong>reprising her role.</p>







<h2 id="h-chloe-price-will-not-be-played-by-ashly-burch">Chloe Price Will Not Be Played by Ashly Burch</h2>



<p>Ashly Burch brought Chloe Price to life in the original Life is Strange title, released in 2015. However, she was unable to reprise that role in 2017’s Life is Strange: Before the Storm, a prequel, because of an embroilment in a voice actor’s strike at the time. This meant that Rhianna DeVries stepped in and fulfilled the role, doing a fairly decent job overall.</p>



<p>Yesterday, when Deck Nine unveiled Life is Strange: Reunion, it went with the announcement that DeVries would be returning alongside Hannah Telle (Max Caulfield) to play Chloe Price.</p>



<p>Fans took to social media to stress their concerns about this decision, with many suggesting that it’s not a ‘true reunion’ if the original voice actor isn’t involved.</p>







<p>One distressed user wrote, ‘My expectations could not be lower for Life is Strange: Reunion. It’s hard to be excited after the last game, and now we know it’s not even Ashly Burch as Chloe… Like what the f*** are you guys doing?’</p>



<p>Another offered a lengthy explanation to cover the community’s dismay:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Life is strange bringing back Chloe due to fan backlash but still not giving enough of a s*** to fork up enough cash to hire her original voice actor whenever <strong>Ashly</strong> <strong>Burch</strong>’s performance was half the reason anyone even liked that character in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an attempt to dig deeper, one user raised a fair point:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Something definitely off with this game when Deck Nine brought back Rhianna DeVries for Chloe instead of <strong>Ashly</strong> <strong>Burch</strong> while there’s no SAG-AFTRA strike currently happening like during Before the Storm’s development.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For the diehard fans of Life is Strange, Reunion will be more or less a guaranteed purchase, even if it’s a reluctant one. The wrapping of Max and Chloe’s story is too much of a dramatic pull to be ignored, and it’s a sequence that’s almost a decade in the making (and wanting).</p>







<p>Will you still be buying Life is Strange: Reunion this March, even though Ashly Burch isn’t in it? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bizarre Marathon Bug Auto-Installs Destiny 2 When You Pre-Order]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-destiny-bug-auto-install/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bungie recently uncovered Marathon’s release date, and shortly after, the ability to pre-order the game went live on platforms like Steam. However, a strange backend bug caused <strong>Destiny 2 </strong>(also developed by Bungie to <strong>install </strong>on Steam when you pre-ordered Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter.</p>



<p>The strange bug was lauded on social media by fans and critics alike, with one user writing that preordering Marathon triggers a ‘virus called Destiny 2’ to install on your machine.</p>







<h2 id="h-bungie-fixes-marathon-bug">Bungie Fixes Marathon Bug</h2>



<p>Hours after the Steam bug went live, <strong>Bungie resolved the issue</strong>, also taking the time to address a concern where Collector’s Edition owners <strong>could not </strong>redeem their game code on Steam.</p>



<p>The team wrote on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector’s Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If there was one entertaining thing to come from the debacle, it was the slew of comments poking fun at the situation.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘Marathon’s development was so cursed it created a malevolent spirit in the code. If it catches you, it will force you to install Destiny 2.’</p>



<p>Another said, ‘Bungie trying to revive Destiny 2 by any means possible.’</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a pretty bizarre bug, especially given that, aside from the developer link, Destiny 2 and Marathon are totally separate from one another.</p>



<p>Recently, Bungie shared a new trailer for Marathon, also uncovering the game’s impending release date as March 5. To celebrate the game’s launch, PlayStation has created an exclusive line of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/limited-edition-marathon-dualsense-and-headset-revealed/">limited-edition peripherals</a>, which will be available to pre-order from January 29.</p>



<p>Let’s just hope that pre-ordering the limited edition controller won’t trigger the automatic purchase of a PlayStation Portal, or something.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-recommended-pc-specs-surprisingly-forgiving/</link>
            <guid>1411606</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, Bungie unveiled the release date for Marathon, the studio’s stab at an extraction shooter, along with a brand-new trailer. Shortly after, the game’s Steam page was updated with a full spread of system requirements for PC players, and they’re remarkably forgiving.</p>



<p>One of the leading elements that’s driving prospective fans to Marathon is the game’s art style and visual palette, which apparently needs very little in the way of tech specs to run.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-pc-specs-confirmed-as-low-entry">Marathon PC Specs Confirmed as Low Entry</h2>



<p>On Steam, you can check out the full recommended PC specs for Marathon, noting that they’re extremely accessible. This continues a trend where new games are coming out with more forgiving minimum and recommended specification requirements, a fact that pleases gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>



<p><strong>Minimum Spec:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li>



<li>8 GB RAM</li>



<li>GTX 1050 Ti (4 GB) / RX 5500 XT (4 GB)</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>Recommended Spec:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Intel Core i5-10400 / Ryzen 5 3500</li>



<li>16 GB RAM</li>



<li>GTX 2060 (6 GB) / RX 5700 XT (8 GB)</li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/">recommended specs for Marathon</a> are centered around a CPU range that was released almost six years ago, and a GPU spread that dropped as far back as January 2019. That lowers the barrier massively for PC players wanting to get into Marathon, one of the most (tentatively) anticipated first-person extraction shooters coming out this year.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders, the extraction adventure title released by Embark Studios in October 2025, followed a similar pattern. For the recommended PC specs, ARC Raiders requests almost the same components.</p>



<p>By comparison, Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter that launched as a 1.0 game in November, has <strong>sky-high recommended specs</strong>. To run Escape from Tarkov at the optimum level, you need a 2024 CPU, an RTX 4070 ‘or better’, and a whopping 64 GB of RAM.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Insists You ‘Profit Way More’ When You Join ARC Raiders Games Late]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-late-join-embark-insists-more-profit/</link>
            <guid>1411459</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve played ARC Raiders at all since the game dropped at the end of October 2025, you likely know about the ‘late joining’ issue that has plagued players since the beginning. It’s not <strong>an issue </strong>with the game, as it’s by design, but it’s a problem for players who appreciate full raids and lengthy sessions.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Embark Studios confirmed that they’re aware of the concerns players have with joining raids late, but they’re trying to make amends and set minds at ease. They’ve said that ‘players who join late economically profit way more than people who aren’t.’</p>



<p>Really?</p>







<h2 id="h-why-do-you-join-late-in-arc-raiders">Why Do You Join Late in ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p>If it wasn’t already obvious enough, you can join late in ARC Raiders, often by ten or fifteen minutes, because Embark Studios wants to prevent lobbies from running stale. If you start with 30 minutes on the clock, the raid would be flat empty by the 15 or 10-minute mark, so feeding in more players later on ensures there’s almost always someone else to fight or meet.</p>



<p>However, players who load in late are almost always disappointed, as it feels like there isn’t enough time to do anything in the game.</p>



<p>If you spawn in late on a map like Spaceport, you’re basically writing off the raid, as it can take several minutes just to cross to the other side of the map, if that’s where your objective or goal is.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/that-really-sucks-arc-raiders-lead-responds-to-complaints-about-late-spawns-says-late-joiners-are-important-and-profit-way-more-but-embark-knows-its-annoying-to-have-no-time-for-objectives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>, design lead Virgil Watkins explained that the team at Embark Studios <strong>is aware </strong>of this concern and actively tracking it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That’s also another topic we’ve been discussing a lot, and it’s another one of those interesting things of data versus perception. We 100% acknowledge the whole thing of, ‘Man, I came in to do that trial and now I clearly don’t have enough time to do that, and that sucks, so I’m just going to leave,’ or whatever. That aspect is definitely not great.</p>



<p>But similar to the perception of free kits versus what they do, the perception around late joining and what it affords you has been quite interesting. Players are like, ‘The loot’s all gone,’ or whatever else. But players who <strong>join late economically profit way more</strong> than people who aren’t.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Watkins insists that joining late in ARC Raiders <strong>is not </strong>a bad thing. It means you can pick up the ‘remnants of fights’, picking apart dead bodies, fallen ARC, and scooping up any loot that might have been left behind. He suggested you’ll be loading into a quieter raid that has run mostly out of steam, leaving you to be left alone a little more when it comes to looting.</p>



<p>He stressed that everything is by design and that there are good intentions behind the decision to run ARC Raiders like this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Okay, well my plan A isn’t possible. I’m gonna do my plan B or C now instead. </p>



<p>The amount of loot we spawn, where it’s spawned, where the spawn points are – it’s all set up in a way that there should be plenty of stuff for players to do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Embark acknowledges it’s a <strong>pain point</strong>, and Watkins said they’re looking at that and ‘trying to do more on that side of things’, reducing the suffering brought on by joining late with an exclusive objective in mind that you now <strong>can’t accomplish</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[StarCraft II Won’t Be At EWC 2026, Nor Will Any Other RTS Title]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starcraft-ii-wont-be-at-ewc-2026-nor-any-rts/</link>
            <guid>1411426</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The recent announcement of the full Esports World Cup 2026 lineup has rattled RTS fans worldwide. The team at the Esports World Cup Foundation recently unveiled the <strong>last game </strong>in the roster, <strong>Trackmania</strong>, which is set to appear at the event in Riyadh for the first time.</p>



<p>However, this reveal means that StarCraft II, the beloved RTS game, <strong>will not </strong>surface at this year’s Esports World Cup, despite being present for the first two. It gets worse, as with the full lineup having been published, we know that <strong>no other RTS game </strong>will be there to replace it.</p>











<p>For the first time since the inaugural Esports World Cup in 2023, no RTS title will take to any stage at the event this year. The EWCF uncovered Trackmania as an unexpected final addition to the star-studded spread of titles gracing the Esports World Cup, and in that moment, RTS fans worldwide fell to their knees (metaphorically, of course).</p>



<p>Across social media, fans have voiced their displeasure at the snub. Kaelaris, a popular commentator and host with a penchant for StarCraft II, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was already having a rough day but no StarCraft at EWC hurts.</p>



<p>I suspect that also means I won’t be doing any SC2 in 2026 since that was the only place nowadays that fancies taking a desk host for the game.</p>



<p>Despite getting to do it at EWC last year, effectively to me it feels like a part of my life perished and I feel like I’m almost in mourning for that aspect of my world. It’s not been easy for my brain to get over it. That’s as best I can describe it at least.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another post, creator and commentator Simon ‘Lowko’ Heijnen wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Very sad to not have StarCraft 2 or any other RTS game at the EWC this year. Especially considering views and interest has been up noticeably compared to a few years ago.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many were quick to point out that the Esports World Cup helped keep the competitive system afloat after waning interest and some tournament shutdowns. This is another major, international stage to be stripped from the RTS audience, and it’s a huge blow.</p>



<p>The Esports World Cup 2026 is shaping up to be the largest esports event ever held. But for many, it might be remembered as the year that the oldest competitive genre in esports was forgotten, pushed aside for an arcade racing game.</p>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was undoubtedly the hottest game of 2025, and now, thanks to the tracking of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/2025-video-game-awards-season-tracking-and-discussion-thread.1348411/">Rese</a><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/2025-video-game-awards-season-tracking-and-discussion-thread.1348411/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">t</a><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/2025-video-game-awards-season-tracking-and-discussion-thread.1348411/">Era, </a>it has been uncovered that the Sandfall Interactive-developed title has surpassed Elden Ring as the top game in history to win the most Game of the Year Awards. 436 outlets have awarded the title game of the year. Elden Ring previously had the record at 429 Game of the Year award wins.</p>



<p>Game of the Year Awards have been awarded to Expedition 33 by outlets such as Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards, Famitsu, GameSpot, IGN, Game Rant, GamesRadar+, and Esquire. Additionally, they were awarded Reader’s Choice Game of the Year awards by the readers here <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-insider-gaming-community-2025-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">at Insider Gaming</a>, Destructoid, Game Informer, and more.</p>

<p>As the awards keep rolling in for the game, the creative director behind the game, Guillaume Broche, said in a recent interview with Edge Magazine that the success of the game was a surprise to everyone on their team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“What really surprised us the most is how much the narrative and cinematics and story resonated with people. This is the thing that’s hardest to quantify, because it’s always something very personal. So the fact that this worked so well, pretty much instantly, this was the thing where we were like ‘Ok, this is one hundred times what we were expecting’,” he said <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-says-the-french-rpgs-success-was-completely-unexpected-from-pretty-much-everybody-at-the-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">(via GamesRadar+)</a></p>
</blockquote>







<p>It hasn’t been all smooth sailing for RPG, however. The Indie Game Awards recently had to disqualify the game after discovering its use of generative AI.
