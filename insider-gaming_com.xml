<p>Black Ops 6 Ranked Play has been added to the game in record time, and to the chagrin of competitive players worldwide, it’s already packed full of cheaters. On social media, clips have surfaced from pro players and streamers revealing them being matched against stacked hackers disrupting the game for everyone else – as always.</p>



<p>It took one day for cheaters to throw Black Ops 6 Ranked Play off the rails.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-time">Every Time</h2>



<p>Every time Activision’s studios release a ranked mode in a Call of Duty game, it’s infested with hackers.</p>



<p>For those not in the know, Ranked Play is a competitive ecosystem with more restrictions, a tighter map and mode rotation, and more rewards than regular, non-ranked multiplayer playlists. Players relish the opportunity to dive into Ranked Play as it allows them to unlock exclusive operator skins, calling cards, and more.</p>



<p>It’s also a breeding ground for cheaters, for some reason. Typically, the highest echelons of the Ranked Play leaderboard are reserved exclusively for cheaters, who year in, year out fly under the radar of Team RICOCHET’s anti-cheat mechanics.</p>



<p>It’s getting better, but it’s <strong>far </strong>from being perfect.</p>



<p>Chris ‘Parasite’ Duarte, one of Call of Duty’s first world champions, posted on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS</strong> EVERY GAME WHERE IS THE ANTI CHEAT TREYARCH</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last season’s CDL world champion, Dashy, posted a video of him slamming teams full of cheaters in Ranked Play, and Simp, one of the best Call of Duty players in the world, was sharing comments on Twitter about the trademarks of BO6 cheaters.</p>



<p>It seems like Ranked Play in Black Ops 6 is already cooked, and it’s another year back-to-back that cheaters have completely ruined the mode.</p>

<p>With the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro here, players have been eagerly awaiting details on what games will be getting PS5 Pro improvements, and how they’ll be implemented. One game that won’t be getting any sort of PS5 Pro upgrade, however, is Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>In a response to a <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fan on social media</a>, the game’s official account confirmed that players shouldn’t expect an update for the game.</p>



<p>“We currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch,” the post reads. </p>

<p>The reveal shouldn’t come as a surprise as CD Projekt Red has moved on to work on the next installment in The Witcher franchise as well as a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. Still, the news wasn’t met without its fair share of disappointment.</p>



<p>“Please reconsider this decision,” <a href="https://x.com/ThatGuyNamedTre/status/1859264991620206790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one fan said</a>. “The demand for a Pro patch is high and would give everyone an excuse to do another playthrough.”</p>



<p>Said <a href="https://x.com/RightChandMan/status/1859315618752741738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another</a>: “Really hope this gets reconsidered! It’s one of the best modern games and it deserves a pro patch.”</p>
