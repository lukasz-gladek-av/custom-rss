<p>Everyone’s gaming journey varies, and we all reach different places at different times. You might only now be playing a hack-and-slash game for the first time with Ninja Gaiden 4, and it’s not a bad way to start. There will come a point where you feel the need to move on, and this is why we’ve picked out some of the best hack-and-slash games in a similar vein to Ninja Gaiden; you should play now or at some point.</p>



<p>Some of them are oldies, but they’re all goldies in one way or another. We love the hack ‘n’ slash genre as it’s fast-paced, usually brutal, and demands a higher skill level to master these games. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-preload-guide-file-size-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> is a continuation of everything the genre has established to this point.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve completed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4 trophy list</a> (seriously impressive!) or you’re ready for a new challenge, there’s something on this list for everyone.</p>



<h2 id="h-games-like-ninja-gaiden-4-you-should-play">Games Like Ninja Gaiden 4 You Should Play</h2>



<h3 id="h-devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</h3>

<p>With some of these entries, it’s hard to isolate a single game, and the Devil May Cry series is the perfect example. Apart from the much-maligned Devil May Cry 2, which didn’t resemble a DMC game and was a travesty, let’s face it, every other release is incredible in its own right. </p>



<p><strong>This even includes the controversial 2013 reboot</strong>—where Ninja Theory took a break from Ninja Gaiden to give Dante a midlife crisis makeover. The action is slick, the combo and score system gives you incentive to keep replaying levels, and the franchise is a thematic treat.</p>



<h3 id="h-god-of-war">God of War</h3>

<p>Again, we won’t be picky here, but let’s take the modern-day God of War reboots out of the equation. Ignore them and go back in history to revisit Kratos’ humble and horrible beginnings. Learn how the God of War got his title, why he looks the way he does, and why the recent incarnation of Kratos seems tired and devoid of anger and conflict wherever possible.</p>



<p>God of War is the best hack and slash series (in this writer’s opinion), and <strong>God of War 3 is the pinnacle of the action</strong>. Like DMC, every entry is special in its own right, but God of War 3 is the culmination of an epic trilogy. It features some of the series’ most iconic set-piece battles ever, and the action and gameplay look and play beautifully.</p>



<h3 id="h-bayonetta">Bayonetta</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sultry yet skillful. Credit to PlatinumGames</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.platinumgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlatinumGames</a> really knows its shizzle, doesn’t it? The company appears multiple times on this list in both development and publisher roles. Here, it’s as a developer, and you can choose any of the three mainline Bayonetta games for your hack-and-slash fix. <strong>Bayonetta is a wicked witch, and oozes charisma and personality</strong>. With guns for shoes and a penchant for using her whole outfit as part of her arsenal, Bayonetta has combos and chaos coursing through her veins.</p>



<p>Intricate combat systems are supported by the usual slew of magic and special abilities, and it all weaves together to make Bayonetta a joy to behold. It’s a series you should definitely consider, and you should play each game after playing Ninja Gaiden 4.</p>



<h3 id="h-nier-automata">Nier: Automata</h3>

<p>Developer? PlatinumGames. Unbelievable fast-paced action and engaging story? Check. <strong>PlatinumGames generally doesn’t miss</strong>: From Vanquish to Astral Chain, they know what players want. They know how to make immersive action games, and there’s a reason why Nier: Automata was in the running for Game of the Year in 2017.</p>



<p>Playful parkour and pleasant platforming sections intertwine frenetic action-heavy sequences. Blink, and you’ll miss a building being destroyed and 2B (the main character) being swarmed by hostile robots and threats. One of Automata’s pulls is the story, which requires multiple playthroughs to fully experience and realize the game’s ambitious vision.</p>



<h3 id="h-metal-gear-rising-revengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Not a proper MGS game, but it’s still pretty good. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Copy and paste everything about PlatinumGames again. Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was a different kind of game. Having Raiden—the cyborg ninja—as the protagonist meant Konami pivoted toward a more hack-and-slash approach. <strong>It’s an MGS spin-off</strong>, for sure, but it doesn’t make it any less fun.</p>



<p>Outside of the typical action cadence Platinum delivers, there’s a terrific story here with the usual Kojima-inspired narrative licks and splashes of Metal Gear Solid nuance. This is a short but sizzling sweet ride.</p>



<h3 id="h-dante-s-inferno">Dante’s Inferno</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s get the major and obvious negative out of the way: <strong>Dante’s Inferno is a blatant reskin of God of War</strong>, and doesn’t deliver the same compelling experience. On the other hand, if you enjoy hack-and-slash games and love God of War, there’s a lot to relish about Dante’s Inferno.</p>



<p>You guide Dante through the Nine Circles of Hell before confronting Lucifer himself. You have to fight your way through a LOT of enemies and bosses to get there. Each of the Seven Sins is explored, with environments and enemies designed to match up with the current area’s theme. The game is actually badass, and had this come out before the first God of War game, the annals of history might look quite different.</p>



<h3 id="h-ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Why not. Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p>We come full circle with Ninja Gaiden. Logically, if you enjoy Ninja Gaiden 4, why not go back and play any other NG release? News Flash: There are quite a few of them. 2025 has seen the release of two other launches alone: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-complete-list-of-ninja-gaiden-2-black-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> (A complete remaster of the second game) and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-ninja-gaiden-ragebound-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>.</p>



<p>You’ve got NES and SNES releases from the 80s and 90s, and <strong>2004 onwards is seen as the real start of Ninja Gaiden</strong>. You can’t go wrong with most of them, to be honest, and you know what you’re going to get!</p>



<p>We’ve tried to pick the absolute must-play hack-and-slash games and franchises. However, you’re more than welcome to disagree. So let us know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a> which hack ‘n’ slash titles or series you think NG4 fans have to play next.</p>
