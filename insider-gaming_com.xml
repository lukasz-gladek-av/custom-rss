<p>The Black Ops 6 Season 5 update introduces three new multiplayer maps, three new weapons, and adds the final Zombies map for this game. </p>



<p>The star of the show in BO6 Season 5 is the sixth and final Zombies map, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-come-out-everything-we-know-about-reckoning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reckoning</a>. Set in the project Janus headquarters, the towers’ systems are on the verge of total failure, and it’s up to the team to stabilize the Aethor Reactors before the Aetherium leak gets out of hand. </p>



<p>Reckoning features a new Wonder Weapon that alters gravity, a new elite enemy, and adds several other surprises. Let’s jump right into what fans can expect. <br></p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-6-season-5-update-patch-notes">All Black Ops 6 Season 5 Update Patch Notes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Boxing gloves are a new melee weapon in BO6 Season 5. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Here are the complete Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-05-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Season 5 Patch Notes</a>. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-multiplayer-maps">New Multiplayer Maps</h3>



<p><strong>Runway (6v6)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>A Pantheon mole attempts their escape via the Arzak Provincial Airport. All hell breaks loose as the Rogue Black Ops team pursues one of their final targets. Wreckage and luggage litter the tarmac, flames licking the sides of the terminal and black smoke rising from the fire in the airport control tower.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Exchange (6v6, 2v2)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Rogue Black Ops pursues a mole attempting to strike a deal in a vibrant Avalon marketplace. Crash the party and unleash havoc on this small-sized three-lane map centered around the Deli, its roof adorned with a marble statue of a mythic sea god.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>World Motor Dynasty (W.M.D.) (6v6)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>From its inception as a Nova 6 processing laboratory first introduced in the original Call of Duty: Black Ops, W.M.D. returns in a reimagined form as an Italian luxury car manufacturer in Avalon. Trade the snow of the original map for an overcast day around the Autofiorno plant, using your memories of the prior map to help navigate the larger area of operations.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-multiplayer-mode">New Multiplayer Mode</h3>



<p><strong>Aim High</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Aim high to survive across a variety of game modes — including Team Deathmatch, Domination, Hardpoint, and Kill Confirmed — where headshots land instant eliminations while full body armor minimizes damage dealt anywhere below the neck. As a bonus, this headshot training is likely to hone your talents when unlocking Weapon Camos.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-weapons">New Weapons</h3>



<p><strong>PML 5.5 – LMG (Battle Pass)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Full-auto light machine gun. Fast rate of fire and high lethality offset by low mobility and hefty recoil.</li>



<li>When a rival Operator is holding the trigger down on the PML 5.56, you’ll know, mainly due to the damage and huge ammunition reserves, mitigated somewhat by a lengthy reload.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>ABR A1 – Assault Rifle (Battle Pass)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Three-round burst assault rifle. Good handling and power. Moderate recoil and range. Configurable to full auto.</li>



<li>The iconic Assault Rifle returns! With a similar weapon being a fan-favorite staple of the Black Ops series, the ABR A1 combines a high damage output that can drop enemies in tight three-round bursts with a brief pause in-between, almost fast enough to be called automatic.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Boxing Gloves – Melee (In-Season, Event Reward)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Moderate damage. Fast attack speed. Long range.</li>



<li>Slip on the Boxing Gloves and knock out foes with a swift barrage of jabs and uppercuts.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-attachments">New Attachments</h3>



<p><strong>9mm PM Skull Splitter (Two Attachments, Battle Pass)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Bring the power and precision of a marksman rifle to your favorite pistol with the 9mm PM Skull Splitter Barrel. The Barrel greatly increases damage, especially to the head, reducing rate of fire. Pair with an extended magazine that gives the Operator additional ammo for this weapon at the expense of handling.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>PPSh-41 Helical Magazine (In-Season, Event Reward)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fire to the beat of your own drum with this SMG attachment that puts other magazines to shame. Manage heat on this high-ammo count magazine that excels at spraying bullets in close and medium ranges.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-5-zombies-update-patch-notes">Black Ops 6 Season 5 Zombies Update Patch Notes</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-map-reckoning">New Map: Reckoning</h3>



<p>Looming over the once-sleepy settlement of Liberty Falls, the Project Janus Headquarters—three edifices known locally as Janus Towers— now teeters on the verge of collapse.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-enemies">New Enemies</h3>



<p><strong>Uber Klaus + Uber Klaus Core</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The secret Research and Development program of Project Janus appears to have been more evolved than originally thought, developing many more robots in the Klaus Assembly Lab than first anticipated. The greatest of these threats is the Uber Klaus – a murderous automaton encased in a toughened, bulky exoskeleton – that maintains a cocky attitude, lethal efficiency, and super strength, all directed at newly-programmed threats.</li>



<li>Enemy takedown tactics are unknown at this point, though combat is likely to be focused on disrupting the Uber Klaus form’s heavy shielding and avoiding its melee attacks. Once the exoskeleton is broken, the Uber Klaus Core will eject, revealing its second deadly form.</li>



<li>The Uber Klaus Core increases in agility, sacrificing defenses for less lumbering locomotion and flying capabilities thanks to rocket-powered hover boots. It continues to employ energy-based, arm-mounted launchers, while its defensive shield can prevent your incoming attacks.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Kommando Klaus</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Preceded by a strange red mist, these automated enemies have had their higher functions disconnected and self-destruct sequences activated.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-wonder-weapon-gorgofex">New Wonder Weapon: Gorgofex</h3>



<p>Latest intel all but confirms Janus Towers may be hiding a new and grotesquely potent Wonder Weapon known as the Gorgofex. Partly charred experimentation notes discovered on microfiche indicate the existence of a “bio-aetheric” armament.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combining fungal, floral, and insectile traits to deliver precise impact damage and gravity-defying disruption in close quarters, glowing membranes on the weapon show hints of motion and circulation under the surface. The weapon seems to pulse and breathe, with a beating central heart-like organ that “pumps” energy through the weapon. Due to the saturation of Dark Aether and other unknown energies, the weapon is said to emit faint psychic vibrations.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-field-upgrade-mister-peeks">New Field Upgrade: Mister Peeks </h3>



<p>Summon Mister Peeks to our reality to create chaos, as the deadly and distracting bunny busts out the moves and bashes undead brains to a raving disco beat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once Mister Peeks arrives in your hands, throw this hairy helper into the fray, and he gleefully attracts normal and Special enemies and attacks any undead within his wandering radius, savaging foes until they explode in a shower of bright confetti.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Mister Peeks: Major Augments</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dance Party
<ul>
<li>Mister Peeks becomes the life of the party, attracting nearby zombies to him, before he detonates an Aether Pulse to thin out the crowd considerably.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Arcane Fury
<ul>
<li>Mister Peeks has become a master of the elements, enhancing his regular damage with a random Ammo Mod (with an Augment from that Ammo Mod).</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Apex Hunter
<ul>
<li>Mister Peeks focuses all attacks on the strongest nearby enemy other than bosses. For example, Uber Klaus would be targeted over regular foes, with increased damage inflicted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Mister Peeks: Minor Augments&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Social Butterfly
<ul>
<li>Increase Mister Peeks’ attraction radius.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Peeks’ Favor
<ul>
<li>Mister Peeks is good to have around Mystery Box locations. Get a free box spin if you’re near one during activation!</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Party Animal
<ul>
<li>Increase Mister Peeks dance duration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Activision announced that PC users will have to enable Secure Boot to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>Secure Boot is a Windows 10 and Windows 11 security feature that ensures a PC only loads safe software during startup. Secure Boot enables Activision to detect and remove users of banned third-party devices or other cheating software. </p>



<p>EA also uses the security measure for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-secureboot-not-enabled-error/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, and players experienced difficulties because they couldn’t play the game without enabling it. Enabling Secure Boot varies depending on the manufacturer of your PC, which can make it a confusing process. Black Ops 6 players are about to experience the same confusion. </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-introduces-secure-boot-ahead-of-black-ops-7">Black Ops 6 Introduces Secure Boot Ahead of Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Black Ops 7 players on PC must enable Secure Boot. Image via Activision </figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting in Black Ops 6 Season 5, which begins on August 7, PC users must have Secure Boot enabled. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a> explained, “Secure Boot makes cheating at a hardware level much more difficult, ensuring cleaner PCs at start and allowing for more trusted environments for RICOCHET Anti-Cheat to operate in.” </p>



<p>If you need more information on how to enable Secure Boot, Activision provided a <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/trusted-platform-module-and-secure-boot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">manual</a> on how to do so. You won’t be able to play BO6 without having the security measure enabled, and that also applies to Black Ops 7, when the upcoming game releases later this year. </p>



<p>In addition, the devs encouraged you to secure your account with email verification and two-factor authentication. Activision also introduced new detection tools targeted at rooting out boosting and teaming in BO6 multiplayer and Warzone Ranked Play, and confirmed that 22 additional individuals responsible for developing and selling cheats were cut off.  </p>



<p>Is Secure Boot enough to cut down on cheating? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/black-ops-7-will-require-secure-boot-to-play.3211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Activision Leadership Isn’t Worried About Battlefield 6 Because Call of Duty is “Too Big to Fail”]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-activision-leadership-isn%E2%80%99t-worried-about-battlefield-6-because-call-of-duty-is-%E2%80%9Ctoo-big-to-fail%E2%80%9D.1263753/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Activision leadership has been taking note of Battlefield 6’s recent hype, but is not worried that the franchise will surpass Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorised to talk about Activision’s internal conversations, it’s been said that although Activision is keeping a close eye on Battlefield, they are not worried about the game outcompeting its flagship franchise.</p>



<p>It’s said that Activision leadership believes that Call of Duty is “too big to fail” and will remain a profitable, annually released franchise for many years to come. At the time of writing, an annual Call of Duty title is penciled in for the next four years at least.</p>



<p>This year’s Call of Duty title, dubbed ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-revealed-during-xbox-games-showcase-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>‘, is said to be a “strong” title according to those familiar with the game’s plans, despite initial problems in development. </p>



<p>Interestingly enough, this year’s Call of Duty will take place in a slightly futuristic setting similar to Battlefield 6, with both games targeting a similar audience. Whether or not that direct competition will impact Call of Duty is unclear, but at the time of writing, Activision doesn’t think it will.</p>



<p>There’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s Battle Royale</a> to consider, which is believed to be a free-to-play component to the premium game. If EA can take a considerable chunk out of Call of Duty: Warzone’s playerbase, which has been depleting for the last couple of years, it could have a detrimental impact on Call of Duty’s long-term playerbase.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-black-ops-7-reveal-event-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 is set to get a full reveal</a> at this year’s Opening Night Live on August 19th.</p>



<p>What do you think of Activision not being worried about Battlefield outcompeting Call of Duty? Should they be? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>
