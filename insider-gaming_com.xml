<p>Arrowhead’s CCO has stated that they have a prototype of a rogue-lite mode for Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 has been receiving a whole lot of updates recently, focusing on performance and optimisation. Most recently, the developers made significant progress in reducing the PC file size, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-pc-file-size-reduced-by-85-slim-version-now-available-in-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing it down by 85%</a>. Now, it seems they might have something big cooking towards the content side as well. </p>

To everyone’s surprise, Pilestedt responded on <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1998824312401187274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that they already have a prototype of a rogue-lite mode that will fundamentally change the game. No other details about this game mode were revealed. </p>



<p>Pilestedt has been providing a lot of Helldivers 2 details on X recently. His recent <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1998864084197073309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a> had an image of four directors having dinner at a restaurant with the caption, “with the directors, talking about Helldivers 2 next 4 arcs. Any hot takes? When asked where it will take 3 years to deliver these arcs, Pilestedt responded, stating they will “deliver a bit more often than that” moreso now as they are “in a better technical space”. </p>

<p>A new 007 First Light leak has revealed that Grammy-winning musician Lenny Kravitz will be playing a villain called Bawma in the upcoming game. </p>
