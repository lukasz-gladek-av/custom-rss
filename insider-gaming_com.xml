<p>Terminator Survivors hasn’t had the best journey into the market. In the closing days of 2025, Nacon Studio Milan has emerged on social media to share a major development update about the upcoming open-world survival game set in the iconic sci-fi universe. The game’s creative director addressed fans directly in what amounts to an open letter, but it’s <strong>not </strong>good news.</p>



<p>Marco Ponte, the leader of the game’s creative angle, thanked fans for their patience and reaffirmed the studio’s commitment to delivering an honest representation of the Terminator universe, but things are not looking encouraging.</p>



<h2 id="h-terminator-survivors-delayed-with-no-new-date-in-sight">Terminator Survivors Delayed With No New Date in Sight</h2>



<p>According to Ponte, the team at Nacon Studio Milan has made ‘significant progress’ this year across multiple areas. He referenced world design, combat systems, and narrative depth as key. The goal remains clear: to envelop players in a bleak, post-apocalyptic environment where Skynet’s machines dominate humanity.</p>



<p>Players are set to step into the role of survivors rising from the rubble, fighting Skynet’s earlier prototypes, and helping to spark the resistance we all know too well from the movie franchise.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, some of the changes Ponte references might come as a shock to those awaiting delivery of Terminator Survivors.</p>



<p>The game will now be a single-player title, with Nacon Studio Milan having stripped multiplayer mechanics clean from the title.</p>



<p>It was said that this was the result of extensive testing and discussion with fans, and the developers concluded that focusing on a single-player experience would better capture the uncompromising vision of the Terminator world. While this decision might come as a disappointment to some, Ponte suggests it’s how they can ‘deliver the most authentic gameplay possible.’</p>



<p>Additionally, the studio has decided <strong>against </strong>an early-access release, and instead, Terminator Survivors will launch as a complete, polished (hopefully) product.</p>



<p>The bad news is that the game’s release has been delayed indefinitely, and there’s no indication whatsoever of when it might surface.</p>



<p>Nacon Studio Milan has promised to arrange closed playtests under NDA as the launch window hopefully draws closer. In the recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2617340/view/624439505179377725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on Steam</a>, Ponte invited fans to sign up to contribute to the effort.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dota 2 Patch 7.40 Introduces Largo, the ‘Frog Bard’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dota-2-largo-introduced-valve/</link>
            <guid>1385602</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The wait is over—Valve has finally released Dota 2 patch 7.40, ending one of the longest gaps between updates in the game’s history. Alongside sweeping balance changes and hero reworks, Valve has added new items and even a new hero – <strong>Largo</strong>. This larger-than-life character is a whimsical frog bard (really), and he joins the game as the 127th hero to date.</p>



<p>His melee support build enables allies and disrupts enemies quite nicely, by all accounts.</p>







<h2 id="h-largo-enters-dota-2-in-patch-7-40">Largo Enters Dota 2 in Patch 7.40</h2>



<p>Largo’s kit is interesting and, as you could probably imagine, themed entirely around his existence as a <strong>frog</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Catchy Lick</strong>: A tongue pull that dispels and damages, granting Largo regeneration when cleansing effects</li>



<li><strong>Frogstomp</strong>: Summoned froglings stomp the ground, dealing damage, mini‑stunning, and slowing foes.</li>



<li><strong>Croak of Genius</strong>: Cast on allies to reduce mana costs and echo their damage over time.</li>



<li><strong>Amphibian Rhapsody</strong>: A musical ultimate where Largo strums songs—<strong>Bullbelly Blitz</strong> for spell amplification, <strong>Hotfeet Hustle</strong> for speed and resistance, and <strong>Island Elixir</strong> for healing. Successful strums build “Groovin’” stacks, boosting armor and reducing mana costs.</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s an interesting lineup.</p>



<p>Largo uses Aghanim’s upgrades to expand his toolkit. For instance, the <strong>Shard </strong>mirrors buffs onto Largo himself, while the Scepter lets him play two songs per beat and deal bonus magic damage.</p>



<p>Here’s a bit of background on Largo:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Originating from the Murkroot Forest, Largo’s people fled after the Talga‑Ruun’s invasion. His sacred music revived the dying island of Valu’Mar, cementing him as a bard of salvation. Now he travels beyond his homeland, spreading inspiration with his frogling companions and enchanted lute.</p>
</blockquote>

It refreshes the neutral item pool and introduces terrain adjustments that will have an impact on the competitive landscape.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to scoop rewards, you can also lean on Patch 7.40 to secure riches in the Winter Treasure 2025 LTE. There are sixteen new sets across the hero lineup to secure.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ll be using Largo in Dota 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Mobile Releasing Worldwide on February 23, 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-mobile-releasing-february/</link>
            <guid>1385593</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The mobile esports world is about to get a considerable amount more impressive, as Ubisoft has just announced the impending release date for Rainbow Six Mobile. The long-awaited launch of the game comes more than three years after it was revealed, and it’s set to arrive on February 23, 2026.</p>



<p>It won’t be a staggered deployment, either. The game will be released globally on that day. Reportedly, the delay in producing this game comes from years of testing and preparation, so that Ubisoft can launch a game that’s as stable and ‘esports-ready’ as possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-mobile-coming-soon">Rainbow Six Mobile Coming Soon</h2>



<p>In a short trailer uploaded hours ago, Ubisoft unveiled the release date for Rainbow Six Mobile, the eagerly anticipated handheld version of the company’s flagship first-person shooter.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has dominated the market for a decade, standing firm as one of the top esports games around. It’ll now expand on that notion with a handheld version.</p>



<p>In November 2024, Ubisoft held a soft launch for Rainbow Six Mobile, kick-starting a series of technical tests in specific territories to start bedding in the game. Now that the game is fleshed out with new operators and some fresh content, they’ve decided to blast off with a global launch next February.</p>



<p>If you live in Canada, France, Poland, and the LATAM regions, you can download and play Rainbow Six Mobile now, but it’ll be a bit of a test product. It has proven to be a hit in those territories, so it’s only fair that Ubisoft now pushes the game out to a much wider audience.</p>



<p>This free-to-play mobile game has been turning heads in those regions, and now it’s time to go global. Will you be playing? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-rotten-tomatoes-score-season-1/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The second season of Prime Video’s Fallout got its reviews today, and they are quite favorable. Even more so, the Bethesda series’ sophomore season has beaten the first season’s Rotten Tomatoes score by a good bit.</p>



<p>Despite the ‘video game adaptation curse’, Prime Video’s Fallout beat the odds seemingly out of nowhere. Based on the post-apocalyptic worlds from Bethesda, the show captured what made the games special with a delightful mix of comedy and action. Released in 2024, it became a smash hit, even earning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-won-emmy-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Primetime Emmy nominations</a> like Best Drama and Best Drama Actor for Walton Goggins. It was clear a new season was in order, and, as of writing, the first episode is available to watch. Critics have already seen most of what the show has to offer and, if what Rotten Tomatoes rates is true, it outdoes the first season in a big way. </p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-season-2-certified-fresh-at-97-on-rotten-tomatoes-4-higher-than-first">Fallout Season 2 Certified Fresh at 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, 4% Higher than First</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout Season Two Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECI3eCAxRGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/fallout/s02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, which collects all available reviews for media, Fallout Season 2 received a 97% rating. With 39 reviews, it is now Certified Fresh. While the score can change as more reviews come in, the second season outperformed the first by 4%. Fallout Season 1 scored an impressive 93% with over 133 reviews. </p>



<p>The better score does bode well for the series’ second outing. Fallout Season 2 continues the story of Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus as the world expands to New Vegas. Its impressive accolades and numbers for Prime Video have already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-3-possibly-filming-summer-2026-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greenlit it for a third season</a>, which aims to film in Summer 2026. It is quite rare for a game adaptation to get another shot, much less be better than the first. Fortunately, Prime Video’s Fallout has done just that, ensuring fans will have some treats in store for the series.</p>
