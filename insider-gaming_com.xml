<p>Later in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll be tasked with getting a treasury key before a big raid can take place. It’s one of the most important steps in the run-up to one of the game’s most major missions, so it cannot be avoided. It’s simple – <strong>you need that key</strong>.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to trying to find Vavak’s key, you’ll most likely have a hard time given the size of the search area and the lack of direction towards where it might be. In this guide, I’ll tell you where and how to find Vavak’s key in Oratores, the all-important mission in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-vavak-s-key">How to Find Vavak’s Key</h2>



<p>Despite chatting with Christian in the guarded building in Kuttenberg, you’ll likely be searching the place for ages trying to find Vavak’s key. He doesn’t know where it is, either – it’s up to you to track it down.</p>



<p>Now, you could spend the next few minutes probing the building and the search area in a desperate attempt to find the critical key, or you could follow this guide and find it in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>Firstly, you’ll need to get past the guards at the front of the building. If you have a high enough charisma level (and other skills are assigned), you can pass a skill check and you’ll simply be granted access to the site. It’ll surprise Christian, who is already inside, but if you did his earlier missions and aligned amicably with him, it won’t be a concern.</p>



<p>Otherwise, expect trouble – and more speech checks.</p>



<p>Now that you’re in the building, you’ll learn that Vavak has fled, but there’s a chance that the key might have been left behind. However, this building has several floors and rooms, along with plenty of chests and hidden nooks and crannies – it’ll take <strong>forever</strong> to search everything – and not everyone knows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/">how to pick locks</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t</strong> do that.</p>



<p>Instead, head to the ground floor and out the back door, making a beeline for the toilet that sits in the rear courtyard of the building. Inside the toilet (yes, <strong>inside</strong>) you’ll find a key sticking out of a pile of waste. That’s where Vavak’s key is in Oratores – simple.</p>



<p>Once you’ve got the key, you’ll need to wash up in a trough, otherwise people will notice your stink. But that’s it – that’s how to find Vavak’s key in Oratores. Have fun!</p>

<p>In December, MachineGames and Bethesda released Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a critically acclaimed epic featuring the titular adventurer front and centre. For this spin around the whip, Indiana Jones was played by Troy Baker, one of the most instantly recognisable names in gaming.</p>



<p>Harrison Ford has made it clear that he’s more than happy to pass the torch to Baker, and in the past, he has praised the actor for his replication of the character. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, the legendary actor once again showered Baker with adoration for his portrayal of Indiana Jones.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-nothing-but-good-things">Nothing But Good Things</h2>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle received positive reviews across the board when it was released on December 9. It looks great, plays better, and features the iconic tropes of the Indiana Jones series that are intensely familiar to fans of the franchise.</p>



<p>In an interview that took place before the game was released, Bethesda Game Studios’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-troy-baker-indiana-jones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd Howard revealed</a> that he <strong>didn’t want Troy Baker </strong>to play Indiana Jones. He explained that the team cast a wide net when fielding auditions, but time and again, those vetting the ‘blind taste tests’ picked Troy Baker.</p>



<p>Recently, Harrison Ford sat down to speak to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/harrison-ford-shrinking-1923-captain-america-7b1f9b3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Wall Street Journal</a> about his acting career – which is still going strong despite the performer being 82 years of age.</p>



<p>Amid a deep conversation about the Indy franchise and Ford’s most recent work, including the upcoming Captain America: Brave New World, the topic turned to Baker’s performance of Indiana Jones in the December release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul. You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent.</p>



<p>He did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With the mention of AI, Harrison Ford was talking about using ‘synthetic versions of famous actors’ to apply them to roles after they’ve passed on. This is something that, quite understandably, actors are wary of pursuing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-warning-buying-abandoned-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-will-now-warn-you-before-you-buy-an-%E2%80%98abandoned%E2%80%99-game.1101378/</guid>

<p>Valve has released a new update to the Steam interface that’ll offer users a prompt detailing how long it has been since an early-access game was last updated. This new feature is designed to prevent gamers from investing in a game that might be abandoned, or from buying one that might not be accurately represented by what’s detailed on the store page.</p>



<p>It’s not immediately obvious what the ‘cut-off point’ is for this label to appear, as not every early-access game has it. Most of them just have the typical breakdown that features an explanation from the developers as to why the game has been released in an early-access state.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-transparency-update">Transparency Update</h2>



<p>One of the most heartbreaking revelations you can have as a gamer is investing in an early-access game that has you excited, only to find that the developer hasn’t touched it in years. That’s the case with some early-access games on Steam that remain in that state for <strong>a very long time </strong>after hitting the digital storefront.</p>



<p>Valve’s latest update challenges that notion, letting users know if it has been several months (or more) since the last major update to the game. This change was noticed and publicised on social media <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1887107461879832746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>For instance, Heartbound, which was released in 2018 and remains in early access, was last updated ‘over 13 months ago’. The game was once taken positively by the PC gaming community, but the recent review rating has dropped to Mostly Negative because of the lack of updates.</p>



<p>Another example is a game called ATLAS, which sees players take on an ambitious pirating adventure across the high seas. It looks good enough at first blush, but it has mixed reviews overall – some 36,000 in total. It too was released in 2018 but hasn’t been updated in more than 20 months:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many early-access games ‘graduate’ from that state, becoming a full-release title that launches with a 1.0 version that’s often bursting with improvements and features. One great example is Sons of the Forest, which was released in early access in February 2023, graduating to a full release one year later and succeeding all over again.</p>



<p>This is a nice move by Valve – but what do you think? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>2K has shaken things up at the top of one of its developers. A new report has surfaced claiming that 2K Games has fired 31st Union president Michael Condrey after the poor response to Project Ethos.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, 2K made the move after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-games-project-ethos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s reveal</a> left players and critics, alike, underwhelmed. One preview from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-ethos-first-hands-on-impressions-of-2ks-new-roguelike-hero-shooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> last year stated, “It seems to fall short of delivering anything that’s truly genre-defying in either the roguelike or extraction shooter departments.”</p>



<p>In a statement to Kotaku, 2K says that Condrey is “transitioning” from the project and that the company is still “committed” to the game.</p>



<p>“We are grateful to Michael Condrey for the dedication, passion and work ethic it took to build an incredible team and shape the vision of 31st Union,” a 2K spokesperson told the outlet. “Michael will be transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of Project ETHOS. We remain very committed to the forward path for Project ETHOS and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio.”</p>

<p>Condrey joined 31st Union in 2019 after leaving Sledgehammer Games, a studio he helped found in 2009. He has yet to make any statement on the change, or what’s next for his career. </p>



<p>Take-Two Interactive is scheduled to report its Q3 FY2025 earnings on Thursday, February 6 at 430pm ET.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-game-size-revealed-on-mac-app-store.1101303/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-size/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is confirmed as the largest game in the franchise’s history, at a whopping 123.2 GB in size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows game size was revealed through its listing on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/assassins-creed-shadows/id6497794841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mac App Store</a>. The title can be pre-ordered now for $69.99. Players will need macOS 14.0 or later and a Mac with an Apple M1 chip or later to play the game. The 123.2 GB file size is the largest in the franchise’s history, more than double that of recent instalments like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla or Odyssey, which needed around 50 GB and 45 GB only, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With such a massive file size for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players will expect Ubisoft to go all out on the game. The visual fidelity and attention to detail should be second to no past Assassin’s Creed title if the game size exceeds the previous instalments by that much. If you are wondering about Assassin’s Creed Shadows PC system requirements, check out the details <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Players should note that SSD storage with 123.2 GB of free space is mandatory for any preset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is an upcoming historical, open-world action-adventure by Ubisoft set in Feudal Japan. Players will experience this adventure through the eyes of 2 characters: Naoe, a shinobi Assassin and Yasuke, a legendary samurai. Both characters feature distinct playstyles. Naoe is more stealthy and agile, whereas Yasuke is the tank responsible for dealing the heavy blows. If you are interested in the game, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Mac on March 20, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ art book recently leaked online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-artwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on an 18+ website</a>, showcasing new art for the game. Also, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shaodws-censored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graphic content will be censored in Japan</a>. What are your thoughts on Assassin’s Creed Shadows Game size?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
