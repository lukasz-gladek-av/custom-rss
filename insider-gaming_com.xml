<p>Japan’s government recently convened to discuss a series of topics in a Diet, one of which was the recent controversy surrounding Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The game’s more scandalous scenes have showcased Yasuke, an African samurai, destroying shrines, sequences which have naturally prompted concerns in the Japanese government.</p>



<p>In a recent discussion, Japan’s Prime Minister voiced a strict response to these concerns, answering points raised by other party members suggesting that ‘imitation attacks’ could occur in real life.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-absolutely-unacceptable">‘Absolutely Unacceptable’</h2>



<p>Hiroyuki Kata, a Lib Dem party member, brought up the topic of shrine destruction in Assassin’s Creed Shadows at a recent Diet, putting questions to the nation’s Prime Minister.</p>



<p>He explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to ask about the Assassin’s Creed issue. </p>



<p>In the game, the samurai protagonist smashes drums, sacred mirrors, and altars inside the worship hall of a shrine that appears under its real name. He slashes at people who appear to be priests, shoots arrows, and engages in other violent mayhem. When I asked the chief priest, he said that the game company had not contacted the shrine to ask for permission to use the name.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The politician floated the suggestion that imitation attacks might take place at real shrines across Japan and that other concerns, like ‘tourist pollution’, were also being considered. These details were reported by <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2503/19/news167.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ITMedia</a> (picked up by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/japanese-government-addresses-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy-as-ban-rumors-spread-3165590/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>).</p>



<p>By way of a response, the nation’s Prime Minister, Ishiba Shigeru, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is absolutely unacceptable to graffiti a shrine. It is nothing but an insult to the country.</p>



<p>It is natural to have respect for the culture and religion of a country, and I think it is important to send out the message that we will not tolerate any behavior that does not respect the culture and religion of a country and will not tolerate it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was suggested that such wanton destruction of culturally significant facilities wasn’t replicated in any other Assassin’s Creed title, prompting further worries from the Japanese government. The comments made by the Prime Minister and other party members are not indicative of any further action.</p>

<p>Inzoi is under the stewardship of Inzoi Studio—published by Krafton—and its release date can’t come soon enough for fans of life-sim titles. We’ve got the key details you’re looking for, including its cost and platforms.</p>



<p>Attention Inzoi fans, the wait is nearly over. Whether the life simulator has only recently caught your eye or since its announcement a couple of years ago, you don’t have to imagine what your idyllic world looks like for much longer.</p>



<p>Inzoi’s release date is getting closer, and we’re ticking days off the calendar quicker than we can count!</p>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-release-date">Inzoi Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ve got the whole world in your hands. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>March 28 is the official Early Access release date for Inzoi.</strong></p>



<p>To reiterate, this signals the full-scale, playable debut of Inzoi, but this isn’t its official launch. If you don’t know, Early Access lets players get hands-on with a title, and it’s a far more sophisticated beta test in many ways. </p>



<p>You get access to most of the content that will be available at launch, but it’s a chance to refine the product and iron out flaws before launch. You still purchase Inzoi, own it, and get a ton of content, but it’s your chance to help refine it before its full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-inzoi-platforms">All Inzoi Platforms</h2>



<p><strong><strong><strong>PC players get first access to Inzoi, and a PlayStation and Xbox release is only happening once the title completes its Early Access run.</strong></strong></strong></p>



<p>You can check out everything we know about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-inzoi-platforms-is-it-coming-to-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi’s platforms and console availability</a> here. The quick details are that PC Early Access is up first—although we don’t know how long it will last. Furthermore, future console ports should arrive for the full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-inzoi-cost">How Much Does Inzoi Cost?</h2>



<p><strong><strong>Inzoi will cost $39.99 when it launches in Early Access.</strong></strong></p>



<p>We’ve also dove into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-inzoi-cost-inzoi-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi’s cost</a> in greater detail. But I can tell you it’s definitely going to be <strong>$39.99 in Early Access</strong>, and we’re theorizing a <strong>potential £34.99 price tag elsewhere</strong>. This isn’t a low-key, low-effort project: Inzoi is looking to be the real deal in 2025—hence the retail price.</p>



<p>There are no special Editions to consider for the time being. Early Access isn’t known for having Deluxe Editions or anything like that, but this might be a question once Inzoi is looking to release in its entirety.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows hits the open market tomorrow, and Japan’s government is eagerly discussing whether to address certain scenes in the game on a legal level. The most controversial scenes in Assassin’s Creed Shadows were revealed as Yasuke, an African samurai, desecrating and destroying shines, which drew intense blowback from the Japanese people.</p>



<p>In a Diet discussion today, the Japanese government – including Prime Minister, Ishiba Shigeru – brought up the question of what to do about Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ scandalous sequences.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-assassin-s-creed-issue">‘The Assassin’s Creed Issue’</h2>



<p>A report from <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2503/19/news167.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ITMedia</a> (circulated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/japanese-government-addresses-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy-as-ban-rumors-spread-3165590/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>) breaks down the discussion in the Diet, which was centred around the legality of Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Hiroyuki Kata, a Lib Dem party member, raised concerns about ‘the Assassin’s Creed issue’, highlighting sequences that see Yasuke devastate a revered shrine in the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to ask about the Assassin’s Creed issue. </p>



<p>In the game, the samurai protagonist smashes drums, sacred mirrors, and altars inside the worship hall of a shrine that appears under its real name. He slashes at people who appear to be priests, shoots arrows, and engages in other violent mayhem. When I asked the chief priest, he said that the game company had not contacted the shrine to ask for permission to use the name.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stressed that the necessary bodies in Japan are ‘keeping an eye’ on the situation, as they’re intently concerned about possible copycat attacks on shrines across the country. The government is also concerned about tourist pollution, worried that the eventual success of Assassin’s Creed Shadows could see these shrines flooded with visitors.</p>



<p>Ishiba Shigeru, Japan’s Prime Minister, had some tough words on the matter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is absolutely unacceptable to graffiti a shrine. It is nothing but an insult to the country.</p>



<p>It is natural to have respect for the culture and religion of a country, and I think it is important to send out the message that we will not tolerate any behavior that does not respect the culture and religion of a country and will not tolerate it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lobby found a clear issue with the destruction of Japanese culture and facilities in this game, claiming that it wasn’t possible to replicate such acts in previous games. It’s not clear what their plans are beyond monitoring the situation, but it was noted that the Prime Minister’s comments, however strict, aren’t indicative of further action.</p>



<p>Before this, the existence of Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows was also subject to intense speculation and scrutiny, with many highlighting his dubious and unclear historical position and the accuracy of his character. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-continued-to-fall-in-february/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The state of video game hardware continues to be somewhat bleak across the board. After falling 45% year-over-year in January, video game hardware sales fell 25% year-over-year for February 2025.</p>



<p>The drop from $341 million to $256 million is the “lowest February total for video game hardware sales spending since the $184 million reached in February 2020”. That, according to Circana and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqaie744m2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">analyst Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>



<p>When looking into specifics, the PlayStation 5 (PS5) was the best-selling console in terms of both units sold and dollar amount. The Xbox Series systems came in second in both metrics.</p>



<p>Moving on to accessories, that also saw a fall of 8% from $248M to $228M year-over-year. After two months of sales data, accessory spending is 18% behind 2024’s pace. A big reason for that, according to Circana’s data, is that controller spending has fallen 17% and headset spending has dropped off 25%.</p>



<p>As far as what remains a top seller, the PlayStation Portal’s base model was February’s best-selling accessory in terms of dollars spent.</p>



<p>Seeing the continued trend of falling hardware sales shouldn’t be surprising to many in, and around, the industry. It seems pretty clear that players either already have the system they want or there’s simply a desire to spend their money elsewhere as a result of increased cost of living. </p>



<p>It should be expected that hardware sales will get an uptick during the year when Nintendo releases its highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 system in the coming months.</p>
