<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-ranked-play-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Ranked Play</a> allows players to test their might against similarly skilled players for rewards and bragging rights. To even out the playing field, only certain weapons, attachments, Equipment, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-perk-wildcard-in-warzone-x-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perks</a> are available.</p>



<p>You can only pick from a pool of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-assault-rifles-in-black-ops-6-ranked-best-ar-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assault Rifles</a>, SMGs, and Sniper Rifles, so many are wondering what the best loadout is for each category. To help you dominate every <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">map and mode</a> in BO6 Ranked Play, here are the best loadouts to build.</p>

<p>The <strong>Model L</strong> is a top performer in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a>, mainly thanks to its low recoil and high damage. This makes it our pick for the best Assault Rifle in Ranked Play, especially with the attachments that aim to increase the handling and damage profile.</p>



<p>We’ve gone with Perks that protect you against enemy Tactical Equipment and give you more mobility, while also utilizing the Perk Greed Wildcard for Ninja. You’ll find this same Wildcard and Perk 4 combination throughout our best Ranked Play loadouts, as being able to move around the map freely without worrying about your footsteps is extremely strong.</p>

<p>Starting December 1, the price of the Fortnite Battle Royale Battle Pass will increase to 1,000 V-Bucks, up from 950 V-Bucks. However, the real money cost of V-Bucks will stay the same. Players can still earn V-Bucks by progressing through the Battle Pass tiers. In addition, the price of the 25 Battle Pass Reward Bundle has been reduced from 1,850 V-Bucks to 1,800 V-Bucks.</p>



<p>Fortnite is making <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-crew-will-include-the-battle-pass-lego-pass-music-pass-and-more-starting-in-december" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several changes</a> to its Crew Subscription, along with increasing the Battle Pass price. Starting December 1, the Fortnite Crew will include the Music Pass and LEGO Pass at no additional cost, along with the existing benefits (Battle Royale Battle Pass, 1,000 V-Bucks, monthly Crew Pack outfits, and the bonus benefits of Crew Pack outfit styles, Rocket League’s Rocket Pass Premium). New Passes like the Fortnite OG Pass will also be added to the Crew Subscription.</p>



<p>Players who cancel their Fortnite Crew subscription can still claim premium rewards from the Battle Pass until the end of their billing cycle, but not for the remainder of the Battle Pass duration. Those who remain actively subscribed will not notice any changes in the system. Additionally, players who purchase the Battle Pass, LEGO Pass, or Music Pass separately from Fortnite Crew will still have the opportunity to unlock and claim premium rewards.</p>
