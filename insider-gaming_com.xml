<p>In a new video, industry analyst Michael Pachter claims that the General Manager of the Battlefield franchise, Byron Beede, has told him that EA wants Battlefield to be an annual title.</p>



<p>According to Pachter, he has spoken to Beede, who said that EA’s goal is to have three studios working on the Battlefield franchise on a three-year cycle, so that they can release annually.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, this is identical to Call of Duty’s annual release model, but Pachter claims that the franchise is still 5-6 years away from back-to-back annual releases.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out directly to Byron Beede for comment, but as of yet has not heard a response.</p>



<p>You can watch Pachter’s claims below:</p>

<p>Personally, though, I find this hard to believe. Battlefield 6, which has been developed by four individual studios — DICE, Motive, Ripple Effect, and Criterion — appears to be on the path to success. However, I believe that an annual Battlefield release could significantly harm the franchise and its quality.</p>

<p>Could I see Battlefield releasing a new experience annually? Possibly, but not a new, fully-fledged game. Then and again, what a new experience after a Battle Royale looks like is anyone’s guess. Perhaps they’ll finally give us that dinosaur mode that everyone has talked about for years.</p>



<p>What do you think of Pachter’s claims? Do you think Battlefield should adopt an annual release cycle? Let me know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
