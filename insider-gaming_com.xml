<p>Arrowhead Game Studios, the developers of the widely acclaimed Helldivers 2, are working on a brand new game and are looking for a new system designer to help with it. </p>



<p>According to a job listing on the company’s website, Arrowhead Studios is searching for a Senior System Designer for a new co-op Action game. </p>



<p><strong>“We’re looking for a talented Senior Systems Designer to join our growing design department and help shape the foundation of a brand-new, unannounced project,” </strong>the <a href="https://jobs.arrowheadgamestudios.com/jobs/6618789-senior-system-designer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">description reads</a>. <strong>“This is your chance to be part of an co-op action game from the start. You’ll be at the heart of building and tuning the core systems, progression loops, and combat feel like an Arrowhead Game.”</strong></p>



<p>Not much else is known about what this new action game will feature, but, based on what’s said later on, it will be for a completely new IP and built in Unreal Engine. </p>



<p>One thing that’s for sure, this new title isn’t going to be in partnership with Sony. In the spring, CEO Shams Jorjani said that Arrowhead’s next game will be “100% funded” by the studio.</p>



<p>A new IP coming from the studio shouldn’t be seen as a surprise by anyone. In September, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-developers-have-no-plans-for-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jorjani said that the goal</a> is to make Helldivers 2 a “forever game” and that there were no plans to make another sequel. Instead, they want to expand the current game even further as the months and years pass.</p>



<p>What do you hope to see Arrowhead Game Studios build with this new game after the success of Helldivers 2?

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov’s Long-Awaited Console Version is Coming]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-console-version-coming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-long-awaited-console-version-is-coming.1328161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recap video recorded from Tokyo Game Fest, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov spoke about the imminent future of Escape from Tarkov. The game is set to hit a 1.0 release on November 15, dropping on Steam and welcoming an entirely new audience into the scene.</p>



<p>Within that summing-up video, Nikita dropped a juicy tidbit and confirmed that the console version of Escape from Tarkov <strong>is being worked on</strong>, along with new games set in the Tarkov universe <strong>and </strong>DLC for EFT’s post-launch window.</p>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-is-finally-coming-to-console-but-when">Tarkov is Finally Coming to Console, But When?</h2>



<p>It’s impossible to say when Escape from Tarkov will arrive on console platforms, and when it does, we can’t predict what it’ll look like. Many have long believed that Escape from Tarkov will take a ‘lite’ form for console users, with Battlestate Games stripping back some of the complexity, which is better handled using a keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video, uploaded by Battlestate Games earlier today:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlestate Games at Tokyo Games Show 2025 | Aftermovie" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3oWbSqk5WY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s only a snapshot reference, but at 02:10, Nikita says (while talking about what BSG is working on):</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Also, the console version, by the way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s it—the truth of the matter from the horse’s mouth.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has been going for almost ten years, and for the last <strong>eight </strong>of those, it has sat in a beta state, with Battlestate making many tweaks and issuing content drops every six months or so. It’s all coming to a head next month when Escape from Tarkov <strong>finally </strong>hits 1.0, becoming established as a ‘fully released’ game.</p>



<p>That immense update will usher in a new map, fresh factions, and even a linear story that will see players finally escape from Tarkov, securing one of <strong>four endings</strong>.</p>



<p>How do you feel about a possible release of Escape from Tarkov on consoles? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Are you a fan of horror stories set in a post-apocalyptic world where survival through the night is considered a luxury? If so, then Radiant Residents in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jump-and-splash-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> is a game you should check out immediately. Players are given 60 seconds to search a house for any important resources they can find, after which they are moved into a nuclear bunker. The main objective of the game is to survive for as long as possible in the bunker using the resources you recovered from the house. As easy as that sounds, there are some external factors that will almost definitely affect how long you survive. Players are required to manage hunger, thirst, and overall sanity, while also facing the constant threat of monsters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have plenty of Sanity Points to expend during your stay in the bunker, then buying the required resources and keeping everyone in the bunker will be a cakewalk. However, acquiring Sanity Points in the game is not a simple task. Moreover, some additional money never hurt anybody, and that’s where the magic of the Radiant Residents codes comes into the picture. Radiant Residents codes can be used to get extra Sanity Points, which in a post-apocalyptic world could be the difference between life and death.</p>

<p>There’s currently only one expired Radiant Residents code in the game, which is:</p>



<ul>
<li>1YEAR</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-radiant-residents-codes">How To Redeem Radiant Residents Codes</h2>



<p>Unlike many Roblox games nowadays, which force players to perform specific tasks before they’re given access to the code redemption feature, Radiant Residents gives its players the freedom to redeem codes without hassle. It’s as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes into the correct text box. When done right, the entire process takes less than two minutes. If you’re new to the game, here’s a step-by-step guide that you can follow to redeem Radiant Residents codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Radiant Residents</li>



<li>Click the purple ‘Open Shop’ button on the right side</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box that pops up&nbsp;</li>



<li>Hit the ‘Enter’ key to redeem your rewards</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-radiant-residents-codes">How to get more Radiant Residents Codes</h2>



<p>New Radiant Residents codes are released by the developers during events and updates, so it’s likely not too long before more codes drop. These Radiant Residents codes are often released to players through either the game’s Discord server or the developers’ social media accounts. As useful as these codes can be, having to go and manually find the latest codes can be a bit of a hassle, so bookmarking this page might be a good idea. We update the article as soon as any new codes drop, so it can be your one-stop shop for all the latest Radiant Residents codes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you don’t have too much social anxiety and enjoy engaging with strangers while making new friends, all of this while looking your best, then Berry Avenue might be worth checking out. Berry Avenue is a role-playing game on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jump-and-splash-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> platform that places a significant emphasis on fashion. The game lets players get creative with their outfits, in that there are extensive clothing options. Although plenty of items are unlockable by simply playing the game and collecting resources, some free stuff to bolster players’ wardrobes certainly wouldn’t go amiss. Berry Avenue has a large open world map for players to explore, including detailed buildings and services like hospitals, schools, shops, and more. Berry Avenue even allows players to drive cars around the map, making it essentially a life simulator game, albeit on the Roblox platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mexico’s government has moved another step closer to putting a tax on video games it deems to be violent. On Friday, Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies approved a financial package that includes an 8% tax on violent video games.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://www.finanzaspublicas.hacienda.gob.mx/work/models/Finanzas_Publicas/docs/paquete_economico/cgpe/cgpe_2026.pdf">to the proposal</a>, the tax would apply to games rated “C” and “D” under the Mexican System of Equivalences of Video Game Content Classification. When comparing to the ESRB, a “C” rating is for players 18+ while a “D” rating is for games rated for “Adults Only”.</p>



<p>Back when it was first proposed in early September, the claim was that <strong>“recent studies have found a relationship between the use of violent video games and higher levels of aggression among adolescents, as well as negative social and psychological effects such as isolation and anxiety.” </strong>This was said without providing any examples of those studies.</p>



<p>This new tax would apply to all games, both physical and digital. For free-to-play titles, the 8% tax would apply to in-game purchases and microtransactions.</p>



<p>The bill hasn’t become law in the country yet, as it will now head to the Mexican Senate for debate. Should it continue to move forward and become law, games from popular series like Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat, and others will be subject to this new tax.</p>

<p>A recent interview with Sucker Punch reveals that Ghost of Yotei DLC is possible, but only if necessary.</p>



<p>Released earlier this October, Ghost of Yotei serves as a spiritual sequel to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima. Following mercenary Atsu, she travels around Edo to get revenge on those who killed her family. The game, a PlayStation 5 exclusive, is one of 2025’s best-reviewed titles alongside Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. Now, with the game all wrapped up, Game Informer chatted with key members of the development team about what may be next for Atsu, if anything.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/10/17/ghost-of-yoteis-creators-on-atsu-i-see-it-as-a-chapter-is-done" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, Ghost of Yotei co-director Jason Connell and lead writer Ian Miles talked about the game’s success and story. While the article itself is full of spoilers, it did come with some good news for fans. When asked about possible DLC, Connell remarked,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I think for us, we are at the spot in the project where we just get to put it out there and see what’s resonating with people and what people love and what people feel like they wish they maybe knew more about Atsu,” says Connell to Game Informer. “And I think for us, this is like the most important part of the project, in terms of making decisions like these, because same thing with Tsushima. You can listen, you can be like, ‘Oh, okay. People seem to want to know a little bit more about that relationship or what happened to the dad.’ </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Connell, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/10/17/ghost-of-yoteis-creators-on-atsu-i-see-it-as-a-chapter-is-done" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the quote</a>, refers to Ghost of Tsushima’s Iki Island DLC, which launched with the game’s Director’s Cut in 2021. The story in the expansion revolved around Jin’s father, someone who wasn’t explored much in the main game. He continues,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“How do you further that character?” states Connell. “And you get this rare opportunity to actually listen to millions of people about what resonated within a story versus maybe what didn’t or what are the holes. And I think that’s the mode that you want to be in. And that’s sort of the gift. Certainly we love Atsu, and we think it’s a great character. And just like with Jin, <strong>if there’s rooms to improve it or to bring some new elements to life or clarity for the narrative’s sake and it falls within what is best for Sucker Punch, then we’ll certainly take a hard look at that for sure</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Without going into spoilers for Yotei, there are sure to be some paths that potential DLC can take. While the developers do state that they view Atsu’s story as complete, it’s not out of the picture yet. Given the success the title has had this year, perhaps we may return to Edo in the near future.</p>
