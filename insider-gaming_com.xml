<p>Escape from Tarkov has been dominating the extraction shooter space for many years, and midway through November, it hit the long-awaited 1.0 release window that pushed it out as a ‘finished’ game. In the weeks that followed, the game’s best players have busied themselves with completing the game’s all-new story-driven campaign, seen as the ultimate challenge for Tarkov fans.</p>



<p>The first completion came earlier this week, with streamer ‘Tigz’ being dubbed the first in the world to see Tarkov through to the end. Other streamers and players followed, but recently, a Chinese streamer proved to be the first to capture unlocking the game’s best, and reportedly <strong>hardest</strong>, ending – <strong>Savior</strong>.</p>



<p>This was the first <strong>PvP </strong>unlock, while the first PvE unlock, recognized as the world’s first <a href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/1996179962685178266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Battlestate Games</a>, was by a player named Tsukinogi.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-s-best-ending-has-been-secured">Escape from Tarkov’s Best Ending Has Been Secured</h2>



<p>On BiliBili, <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nE2YBGEWr">an hour-long VOD</a> was posted from the perspective of a Chinese streamer, Youmoxiangche, who goes by the in-game username ‘NeverPlayScav’.</p>



<p>In this video, we saw a tense battle through Terminal rage as the player pushed towards what’s widely believed to be the <strong>best </strong>of Escape from Tarkov’s four endings: Survivor, Fallen, Debtor, and Savior.</p>



<p>The worst endings are <strong>Debtor </strong>and <strong>Fallen</strong>, while <strong>Survivor </strong>is seen as being a middle-of-the-road victory, and <strong>Savior </strong>sits atop the pile as the best outcome. In the Savior ending, the player character is welcomed onto the ZUBR Boat after extracting through Terminal, fighting through Scavs, RUAF, and Black Faction enemies in a PvE environment.</p>



<p>As they’re ushered onto the boat, the vessel’s captain tries to assassinate them, but is caught and killed by a friendly RUAF soldier who assures the player that nobody is left on the boat but allies. As they head topside for a smoke, more bodies are seen being dumped into the river through Tarkov.</p>



<p>At that moment, jets fly overhead and drop what appears to be a <strong>nuclear warhead </strong>on the city of Tarkov, and the soldier quips that they managed to escape just in time. As the image fades to black, the player character receives a unique ring, and the RUAF soldier utters the words that it’s up to them to decide their own fate now.</p>



<p>It almost suggests a sequel of sorts could be coming. The RUAF squad, along with the PMC protagonist, zip off into the sunset, and the soldier says:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What matters is we’re alive, and now we’ll take down those bastards from TerraGroup. The whole world will know the truth.</p>



<p>From here on, we decide our own fate.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We know that Battlestate Games is working on ‘other games’ in the Escape from Tarkov universe, and that DLC will be delivered now that the 1.0 version of the game is out, but is this our first indicator as to what that might look like?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Starladder Budapest Major Stage 3 Predictions Are Running Wild]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Starladder Budapest Major is unravelling as we speak, and the third stage is set to kick off <strong>today</strong>. The predictions for the third stage of this $1.25 million Counter-Strike 2 tournament are getting too close to call, but there are some frontrunners. It’s shaping up to be a brutal proving ground for the game’s heaviest hitters, but how might the tournament’s underdogs fare?</p>



<p>This final Swiss Stage will decide the eight playoff contenders, and the earliest signs we have point to the likes of NAVI, FaZe, and Vitality as frontrunners, which many might have predicted, but the likes of Passion UA and 3DMAX still have the potential for an underdog upset.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-will-make-it-to-the-playoffs-in-budapest">Who Will Make It To The Playoffs in Budapest?</h2>



<p>Stage two of the Budapest Major was a pretty dramatic affair. The squads lined up needing three wins to proceed to the third stage, and the likes of NAVI and FaZe Clan both produced perfect records, effortlessly walking into the next phase.</p>



<p>The three ‘underdog’ sides in this event, Team Liquid, Passion UA, and 3DMAX, all produced decisive last-minute wins, eliminating Astralis, M80, and NiP in a sweep that few saw coming.</p>



<p>As we go into the third stage, these are the teams lined up to compete:</p>



<p><strong>Invited</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vitality</li>



<li>G2</li>



<li>Spirit</li>



<li>MOUZ</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Falcons</li>



<li>PaiN</li>



<li>MongolZ</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Stage Two:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>NAVI</li>



<li>FaZe</li>



<li>Liquid</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>



<li>3DMAX</li>



<li>Imperial</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Parivision</li>
</ul>



<p>The matches lined up for stage three are already looking tasty, but all eyes will be on Vitality vs FaZe as the pick of the bunch. This is FaZe’s resurgence versus Vitality’s consistency, following a year of incredible results with ZywOo at the helm.</p>



<p>In terms of predictions, it’s easy to see NAVI, FaZe Clan, Vitality, and G2 Esports in the playoffs, with Liquid, UA, and 3DMAX coming in as dark horses.</p>



<p>The predictions don’t end with this article, though.
