<p>Rayman is getting a 30th Anniversary game, and it has been rated in Australia.</p>



<p>Rayman was Ubisoft’s mascot at one time, and while the series may be best known today for introducing the Rabbids, Rayman was one of the premier adventure-platforming titles. The original game was released in 1995 for PC, Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and Atari Jaguar, and now a 30th-anniversary edition is coming to modern consoles.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson recently stated on <a href="https://youtu.be/8rRejJWM3jg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Insider Gaming Weekly podcast</a> that two Rayman projects were in the works at Ubisoft, and while one, codenamed “Steamboat,” is believed to be a remake of Rayman Legends, Insider Gaming understands that this project is currently under the codename “Iceman.”</p>

<h2 id="h-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-s-rating-in-australia">Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition’s Rating in Australia</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Australian classification </a>has rated the currently unannounced title as G, safe for the General Public, with very mild content and minimal impact. Specifically, this game is noted as having very mild violence. The classification date is listed as Thursday, January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>The game is listed for release on both the Nintendo Switch and the Sony PlayStation 5. Atari is listed as both the publisher and developer. Atari also handles the remakes and new releases in the once-popular Bubsy franchise.</p>







<p>Even though Rayman is no longer the face of the Ubisoft franchise, this remake comes at a time when Ubisoft is undergoing a massive restructuring in its own right. Recently, the planned remake for Prince of Persia: Sands of Time was shelved as the company moves forward in a new direction.

<p>As Nintendo continues to celebrate Milestones like the 40th anniversaries of the Super Mario and Legend of Zelda franchises, key developers from Nintendo’s history are entering the next phases of their lives as well.</p>



<p>Legendary producer Kensuke Tanabe recently announced that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be his final game at Nintendo. The news was shared in an interview with the Japanese magazine<a href="https://www.ndw.jp/category/news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Nintendo Dream</a>, which was later posted on<a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Weibo.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-kensuke-tanabe-confirms-he-s-worked-on-his-last-title-at-nintendo">Kensuke Tanabe Confirms He’s Worked On His Last Title at Nintendo</h2>



<p>As <span>reported by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><span>Vi</span>deo Games Chronicle</a>, Tanabe confirmed that he will no longer be involved in the studio’s production, but trusts that Risa Tabata and the team at Retro Studios will be able to continue moving forward should that be what Nintendo requests.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Completing this game took far longer than anticipated… Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward. Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, Ms Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close.</p>



<p>It’s been 40 years since I joined Nintendo. Metroid Prime 4 will be my final title developed at Nintendo.</p>



<p>However, we didn’t set out to create anything ‘special’ because of this. Instead, we worked closely with Retro Studios, just as we always have with Nintendo projects, aiming to deliver a fun and unique experience for players of all ages and playstyles.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Following news about Tanabe, it was also confirmed that Hideki Konno, known for launching the Mario Kart franchise, left the studio in July 2025. </p>



<p>The news was confirmed via his private Facebook account. He received a special thanks credit in the recent Mario Kart World release and last worked on the Mario Kart 8: Deluxe DLC for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>







<p>Shigeru Miyamoto, the man behind the Mario and Zelda franchises, remains on board at Nintendo. Currently, he has been working closely with Universal on the release of the Super Mario Bros. movies. The forthcoming Super Mario Galaxy movie is due to release in April 2026. A Nintendo Direct will reveal new information about the movie on January 25.

<p>The head of Xbox Games Studio has commented on the mindset and strategy behind XGS-produced games landing on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles.</p>



<p>The days of the console wars of the 2000s, pitting Xbox, Nintendo, and Sony consoles against each other, have come and gone. These days, the Xbox team wants players to get behind the idea that everything is an Xbox. As part of the strategy, Xbox’s first-party games are beginning to release on PlayStation 5 and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>



<p>Recently, Xbox announced that the forthcoming Fable reboot and Forza Horizon 6 would both be coming to PlayStation 5, with Fable releasing across all consoles on the same day and Forza coming to Xbox platforms in May with a later release on PlayStation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/were-going-to-try-and-be-more-consistent-with-what-we-do-the-head-of-xbox-game-studios-on-the-developer-direct-reveals-multiplatform-strategy-and-hard-lessons-learned-from-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During the recent interview with Games Radar+,</a> Craig Duncan of XGS stated that his main focus is to ensure as many players as possible get to experience Xbox-produced titles. </p>



<p>When questioned about the consistency of titles across different platforms, Duncan admitted that, while strategies and realities change, they’re aiming to be more consistent with multiplatform releases in the near future.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s always development realities about when these projects start – how big a team is, and what plans we have at the start of development. Like you said, when a strategy changes, maybe you’ve got a plan that exists with a game and maybe you can adopt that, maybe you can’t. So that’s why. And to be clear, this is totally fair feedback. Sometimes we are inconsistent. You see some games in one place, some games in multiple places. Just know that we’re going to work on that, and we’re going to try and be more consistent with what we do.</p>



<p>But you know, for our game makers, if you’re on the Fable team, you just want as many people who love Fable to appreciate the great work that the team’s doing. That’s always our goal. It’s rarely more complicated than that. It’s like, how can we get this game to as many players as we can?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ARC Raiders Headwinds season launches on Tuesday, January 27, 2026. The expansion brings several updates to the game, including new cosmetics, new quests, a new map condition, and a new matchmaking level option for those who have reached level 40 or higher. This is in addition to other items and general quality-of-life updates.</p>



<p>The ARC Raiders team announced the arrival on social media. This is only the first step in the roadmap, which outlines plans for the game through April 2026 and promises even more content for the popular extraction shooter.</p>

<p>Players will still have to wait until April for a new map, expected to be a waterborne map, to arrive in the game, something that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-fans-disappointed-new-map-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not all players are happy about.</a> However, the game has been an overall success, netting over 10 million sales since its release in the latter half of 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Crossover Teased with New Promo Code]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-crossover-teased-promo-code/</link>
            <guid>1415107</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has teased a potential crossover coming to Escape from Tarkov with a new promo code. This promo code and imagery to accompany it suggest that a ‘duck hunt’ themed event might be surfacing soon. This follows suggestions that Escape from Duckov and Escape from Tarkov will be hosting a crossover collaboration.</p>



<p>When you enter the Escape from Tarkov promo code, you’re greeted by a suite of items, including double-barreled shotguns, armor, vests, and ammunition, all of which you can use to <strong>hunt ducks</strong>.</p>











<p>When you load up the Escape from Tarkov launcher, be sure to enter the new bonus code, <strong>WILDHUNT</strong>. This will unlock the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>2 x MP-43-1C double-barreled shotguns</li>



<li>2 x Korund-VM body armor</li>



<li>2 x 6Sh112 S-S vests</li>



<li>2 x Ushanka hats</li>



<li>40 x AP-20 shotgun slugs</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many believe this promo code is teasing an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-tarkov-collaboration-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Duckov collaboration event</a>, which first hit the airwaves a couple of weeks ago. The team behind Escape from Duckov posted cryptic images suggesting that Tarkov’s big bosses, Killa and Tagilla, have made their way into the duck-themed extraction universe.</p>



<p>The image that was posted by Battlestate Games to share the new promo code features targets hammered by birdshot, and on those targets are quite clearly <strong>duck </strong>silhouettes.</p>



<p>The player character in the foreground is simply wearing the items offered in the new promo code.</p>



<p>Recently, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov suggested that collaborations are incoming and asked the community for some guidance on what kind of topics should be included in that. There’s a whole world out there, but players mostly wanted realistic, grounded collaborations, and not ‘Fortnite-like’ crossovers with gaudy skins and in-game takeovers.</p>







<p>Let us know if you’ve figured out what this new Tarkov promo code is teasing on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
