<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket and a Ranked Mode would go hand in hand. Players can already battle the computer—and each other—and there are a ton of cards to choose from. A ton of features have already made their way into Pokémon TCG Pocket, and Ranked Mode needs to be one of them.</p>



<p>It’s amazing to see how Pokémon TCG Pocket has gone from strength to strength since launch. New sets have continually been added from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-space-time-smackdown-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space-Time Smackdown</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-officially-announced-ranked-battles-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a>. But the community is always asking for new content and modes to be welcomed. It was a big day when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading</a> was finally integrated into Pocket.</p>



<p>Another core gameplay mechanic Pokémon TCG Pocket is missing is Ranked Battles. Are the player’s cries being heard? Or will the wait go on?</p>

<p><strong>Ranked Mode finally debuts in Pokémon TCG Pocket at the end of March 2025.</strong></p>



<p>The long-awaited news came during the exciting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Pokemon Presents</a> affair. The special presentation celebrated all things Pokémon and included breaking news and ended with a groundbreaking gameplay trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-release-window-extended-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>. Amidst the reveals and content drops, we were informed of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-officially-announced-ranked-battles-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a>—a new Pokémon TCG Pocket booster set.</p>



<p>This was cool, but what was even cooler was the set’s trailer also mentioned Ranked Matches at the very end of it. Even though a specific date wasn’t given, we know for sure it’s coming at the end of March 2025. A delay could happen between now and then, so be prepared for the worst, if not, you can use your best decks to conquer opponents in Ranked Mode.</p>



<p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Official Pokémon YouTube channel</a>‘s full Triumphant Light trailer below—featuring the Ranked Battles mention for the finale.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-ranked-mode-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">What is Ranked Mode in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s not confirmed, but we believe Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Ranked Mode is a conventional ranked system whereby players are matched up into divisions or leagues appropriate to their skill level, and wins and losses determine if you rise or fall through the ranks.</strong></p>



<p>Let’s say there are 10 ranked divisions for Ranked Mode. if you’re in Rank 5, winning matches in a row may end up with you <strong>being promoted</strong> to Rank 4, then 3, and so forth. Consecutive losses could very well see you <strong>drop down the rankings</strong>.</p>



<p>Many Pokémon TCG Pocket decks revolve around coin flips, the cards you draw, and a lot of luck overall. So it will be interesting to see if any rules and regulations are established for Ranked Mode.</p>



<hr>



<p>Could the addition of Ranked Mode be a game-changing feature for Pokémon TCG Pocket? Have you already got a deck in mind to frustrate and defeat opponents?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/4a-games-rebrand-reburn-la-quimera/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>4A Games Ukraine, one of the studios behind the Metro franchise, has revealed a rebrand and an all-new IP. It’s called ‘La Quimera’, which is Spanish for ‘The Chimera’. The game and the studio’s foundation were leaked recently, but today, a full and official announcement has taken place, with the game’s first trailer debuting online.</p>



<p>La Quimera is a futuristic sci-fi shooter set in Latin America, and it boasts a narrative-driven campaign that can be played either solo or with friends. The game has been written by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, The Neon Demon), and it features a combination of Latin American folklore and ‘advanced weaponry and technology.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-introducing-reburn">Introducing Reburn</h2>



<p>Reburn is a rebranding of 4A Games Ukraine, and it’s an independent studio with around 110 employees. Many of these developers have worked on the Metro franchise, and some have experience going back to the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game. The studio is being led by Dmytro Lymar, a twenty-year industry veteran.</p>



<p>It’s a little confusing, admittedly. The long and short of it is that in 2014, a split took place at 4A Games that left part of the company in the Ukraine while another branch opened up in Malta, but they both shared technology and teams and collaborated on games like Metro Exodus.</p>



<p>In 2020, Embracer acquired the 4A team in Malta, while the 4A Ukraine studio started working on La Quimera after landing fresh funding and becoming much more independent. While 4A Games (Malta) continues to work on Metro, Reburn is an entirely separate entity working on this all-new IP.</p>



<p>In a statement, Lymar said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series</em>. <em>We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>La Quimera is set in a Latin American megalopolis and ‘lush jungle’. Players will be able to adorn themselves in an advanced suit of armour as they battle rival factions across what looks like a gorgeous world. In a press release, it was stressed that the game has ‘tense gunplay and intimate storytelling’.</p>



<p>Here’s the announcement trailer for La Quimera:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="La Quimera - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It looks good, and it’s a wonder it has been kept under wraps for so long. The team at Reburn has been working on La Quimera for almost five years, and if the announcement trailer is anything to go by, it should be a banger of a title.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of the enemies that seem to resemble the Helghast from the Killzone franchise.</p>



<p>The game can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">wishlisted on Steam</a>, but no release window has been confirmed for the game.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is just getting into the hands of players, but Capcom has already revealed its plans for the game’s first title update.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, the developers gave a first look at what players can expect when Title Update 1 releases. </p>



<p>Right off the bat, Capcom says that the update will arrive sometime in early April and will be free for all players. The timing, they say, allows players to have “enough time to prepare for the new content, and challenges”.</p>



<p>Speaking of challenges, the update will introduce a new monster “at a level above Tempered”. There will also be a new place for players who’ve completed the game’s main story to gather with other hunters.</p>







<p>More information on what else is coming in the update will be revealed as its release gets closer.  That will include any other new features being added as well as any fixes or changes to the game.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is available for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>
