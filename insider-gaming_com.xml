<p>Three months before its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 27th, 2026</a> release, IO Interactive has delayed 007 First Light by two months. The James Bond game will now release on May 27th, 2026. </p>



<p>The upcoming action game from Hitman studio IO Interactive looks to be one of the biggest hits for next year. With an&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gemma-chan-announced-for-007-first-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-star cast</a>, including singer Lenny Kravitz, there’s a lot riding on the developer’s ambitious project. Set at the beginning of Bond’s career, fans will see the young agent earn the 007 moniker on a world-trekking adventure fit for the novels. Its upcoming March 27th, 2026 release made it a huge blockbuster for the Spring season. Now, it’s been moved to the summer for polishing.</p>

<p>In a statement on <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2003511022141817016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s official Twitter/X</a>, it was announced that 007 First Light would be delayed two months. Now, instead of coming out on March 27th, 2026, it will now launch on May 27th, 2026. As to why the decision was made, the team brings up the need for refinement and polishing the final build. However, IO Interactive did share that the game is fully playable from start to finish, so the two months will help make it that much better.</p>



<p>The initial reaction to 007 First Light’s gameplay from its State of Play was a bit lackluster. Constant frame rate issues and iffy textures did sour the game’s reputation a bit. However, it seems the version fans have been waiting for will come to light thanks to the new delay. While it won’t be meeting it’s March deadline, it does position the game to be a great start to the Summer season. </p>
