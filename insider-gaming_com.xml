<p>A small yet highly credible video clip of GTA 6 has surfaced online. While it is from an in-development build, it does give fans an interesting insight as to how the game will look, gameplay-wise.</p>



<p>As one of 2026’s biggest upcoming games, Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto 6 has a lot riding on it. Through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countless delays</a>, fans have been eagerly anticipating driving and robbing the state of Leonida for almost 10 years. Unfortunately, the trailers have seemingly only shown cutscenes, with raw gameplay yet to be put on display. That is, however, until now, as a former Rockstar employee’s demo reel has surfaced featuring a small video snippet of potential gameplay from GTA 6.</p>







<h2 id="h-former-rockstar-employee-s-video-portfolio-includes-gta-6-gameplay">Former Rockstar Employee’s Video Portfolio Includes GTA 6 Gameplay</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>An ACTUAL GTA 6 leak has surfaced:</p><p>A former Rockstar employee has included GTA 6 development footage in their demo reel, this shows off a few animations for exiting bicycles and Monster Trucks.</p><p>Ocean Drive is clearly visible in the second clip</p><p> <a href="https://t.co/tZNhtByYrC">pic.twitter.com/tZNhtByYrC</a></p></div>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1995220816527835469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1995220816527835469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SynthPotato</a> found the clip from a former Rockstar employee’s demo reel portfolio. The name of the employee was, of course, not disclosed. Still, the reel has several animations from other Rockstar games like Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2, furthering its validity. From the looks of it, it seems the employee worked on a bit of GTA 6 prior to leaving.</p>



<p>As for what the clip is, it’s not a lot. The video, <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1995220816527835469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available above</a>, simply shows a character (unsure if NPC or player) dismounting from vehicles. While the first half shows a bike, the second has a render of Vice City, alongside what appears to be Lucia, one of GTA 6’s playable characters. It looks like it showcases how many ways the player character can dismount from a car, which is a rather neat detail.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the video is all fans have to go off of for GTA 6’s gameplay. With the recent November 19th, 2026, delay, it may be some time before more is shown. However, if the level of detail for even the simplest of vehicle dismounts is any indication, it might be the most realistic entry yet.</p>

<p>A new Chapter has arrived in Fortnite with the launch of Chapter 7 Season 1, which brings the customary refresh of weapons and equipment found in the loot pool alongside it.</p>



<p>Fortnite Chapter 7 kicked off on the back of the huge Zero Point live event, attended by over 10 million players, which saw stars from the likes of Star Wars, Marvel, DC Comics, The Simpsons, and K-Pop Demon Hunters unite to fend off the Dark Presence.</p>



<p>Spring Break has now arrived in Fortnite as a result, and Insider Gaming has all the details on the new and unvaulted weapons in Chapter 7 Season 1.</p>

<p><strong>There are eight new weapons and pieces of equipment added in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, including a new mobility item—Wingsuits.</strong></p>



<p>The importance of Wingsuits early in the season is vital following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-the-battle-bus-fortnite-chapter-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destruction of the Battle Bus</a>, as surfing the waves onto the island provide limited landing spots. If you get your hands on a Wingsuit early, traversing the map becomes much easier and you can head to further locations to hunt for loot, where there’s likely to be less competition.</p>



<p>A full list of the new weapons and equipment found in Fortnite this season are below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Iron Pump Shotgun</li>



<li>Twin Hammer Shotguns</li>



<li>Deadeye Assault Rifle</li>



<li>Holo Rush SMG</li>



<li>Vengeful Sniper Rifle</li>



<li>Arc-Lightning Gun</li>



<li>Forsaken Vow Blade</li>



<li>Wingsuit</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-all-unvaulted-weapons-amp-equipment-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1">All Unvaulted Weapons &amp; Equipment in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<p><strong>Five weapons have been unvaulted for Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, alongside the return of the All Terrain Kart and a host of healing items.</strong></p>



<p>The likes of Chug Jugs, Shield Kegs, Med Kits, Bandages, and Shield Potions remain available, while players in Zero Build can continue to find Shield Bubble Jr and Port-a-Fort items to utilize.</p>



<p>On the weapon scene, the return of the Enforcer AR provides options from mid-to-long range, while there’s plenty of options for short-range combat with the Dual Micro SMGs and Tactical Pistol.</p>
