<p>Rockstar has yet to confirm a GTA 6 PC release date; however, Corsair’s CEO believes the game could arrive for the platform in early 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Corsair’s CEO, Andy Paul, recently mentioned GTA 6’s PC release window during the company’s <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757670-corsair-gaming-inc-crsr-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2024 Q4 earnings call</a>. The developer first spoke about how enthusiasts are “lining up” to purchase components to support the newly released Blackwell 50 series GPUs. Their “gaming business has never looked so strong”, with GTA 6, “the most anticipated and hardware-demanding game”, on the horizon.</p>



<p>Paul then discussed GTA 6’s PC release window, stating that, according to his understanding, “it’s going to come out in the fall for console, and then early ’26 for PC.”&nbsp;The CEO mentioned this release window when asked if GTA 6 would be a game that could “spur purchases of either peripherals or components.”</p>



<p>Take-Two’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke about</a> GTA 6 not coming to PC, stating that it will first be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S and then branch out to other platforms. However, Zelnick added that he’s observed the PC platform become a “more and more important part of what used to be a console business.” He understands how big the market is, stating that PC versions of games can “result in up to 40% of a game’s total sales.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, GTA 6’s release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-release-may-not-be-the-end-for-gta-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may not be the end</a> of GTA online. Also, the publisher is ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-publisher-is-not-worried-about-the-game-influencing-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not worried</a>’ about the upcoming game influencing violence in the real world. Do you think Corsair’s CEO is right about GTA 6 arriving for PC in early 2026?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>After hearing Take-Two CEO’s recent comments on supporting “legacy titles”, GTA Online may have a chance at survival even after GTA 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two’s CEO, was recently asked why players should keep investing in GTA Online in 2025 when an improved and enhanced version could arrive with GTA 6. Zelnick didn’t mention GTA Online or an online version of GTA 6 specifically; however, his answer provides some hope to the massive community.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Zelnick stated that his statements are theoretic, as he can’t mention a particular project (GTA 6 Online) “when an announcement hasn’t been made.” However, he added that Take-Two is known for its support properties if the community is still involved with the games.</p><p>&nbsp;As an example, he explained that 2K released NBA 2K Online in China in 2012, and soon after, a new version called NBA 2K Online 2 was released in China in 2017. However, even after the latest version arrived, the company didn’t sunset the first online game, and they are both still available in the market. The CEO concluded, stating, “We’ve shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>GTA Online is one of the most popular multiplayer games, bringing in over 150,000 players daily on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/271590/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam alone</a>. The online version of GTA 5 has been available for more than 10 years now, and players have gathered a considerable amount of wealth and assets in the game by investing a lot of time and sometimes a lot of real-world money. Take-Two and Rockstar have earned a lot through GTA Online, and with a community so big, there might be a chance that the game survives even after GTA 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the GTA 6 publisher is ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-publisher-is-not-worried-about-the-game-influencing-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not worried</a>’ about the game influencing violence in the real world. Also, Take-Two’s CEO recently spoke about GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not coming to PC at launch</a>.
