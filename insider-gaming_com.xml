<p>For the first time ever, a nomination has been revoked from The Game Awards. The game in question, Megabonk, was disqualified with permission from the creator after a misunderstanding.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Since 2014,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-most-watched-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>&nbsp;have become a big celebration for the best of gaming each year. Hosted by Geoff Keighley, it’s become home to several big reveals and moments, especially for Game of the Year. With a year as big as 2025 was for games, the competition is sure to be worthy of watching. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nominations for the awards</a> came out earlier this week and had some snubs and surprises. However, it seems there’s already been a shakeup with one of the nominated games.</p>

<p>The situation unraveled after The Game Awards nominations earlier this week. Megabonk, one of the games’ up for Best Debut Indie Game, was a pretty popular title when it released. However, the creator, who, <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the Tweets</a>, goes by John Megabonk, asked to be removed from the nominations. As for why, he said the following:</p>



<p>“<strong>I’m withdrawing from The Game Awards. It’s an honor and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately i don’t think it qualifies for the category ‘Debut Indie Game,’</strong>” the creator said. “<strong>I’ve made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game.</strong>“<a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603"></a></p>



<p>The category, Best Debut Indie Game, is reserved for those who’ve published their first-ever game as a studio, so those who have, even under a different name, shouldn’t count. Geoff Keighley <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990899068022005881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later posted on Twitter</a> that, after the creator’s comments, that <strong>Megabonk would be taken off the list</strong>. This now leaves&nbsp;Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, Despolete, and Dispatch as the sole nominees. While it is shocking to see, at least the creator was honest about the situation. Unfortunately, Megabonk was only nominated for the one category so, while they won’t be going home with anything this year, at least it was on a good note.</p>

<p>A third season of Peacock’s Twisted Metal, based on the PlayStation racing series, has been announced. However, the renewal does come with the news of a change in showrunners.</p>







<p>Debuting in 2023, Twisted Metal loosely adapts the games from the early PlayStation era. Featuring fan-favorite characters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sweet-tooth-is-a-violent-man-in-twisted-metal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweet Tooth</a>, the show was a surprise success for Peacock. It helped that the show sported massive talent like Captain America’s Anthony Mackie and Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s Stephanie Beatriz. A second season was quickly greenlit and released earlier this year to decent reviews. Now, Peacock has revealed that the action show is coming back for another season, but not without some creative changes.</p>

<p>Variety first covered the news that Twisted Metal is being <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/twisted-metal-renewed-season-3-david-reed-showrunner-1236584674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">renewed for a third season</a>. Apparently, the second season was a hit for Peacock, being the second returning original scripted season with 993 million minutes watched. However, it isn’t without changes, as show creator and showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith is exiting. The Cobra Kai creator’s reasons for leaving has not been discussed. In his stead, writer and director David Reed will join current showrunners Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. No other details, like casting or release, is available.</p>



<p>David’s resume is quite a good one, from a glance. His most notable project is as a writer for Prime Video’s The Boys, which is releasing its final season in 2026. Other titles he has worked on include Star Trek: Strange New Worlds and Supernatural, among others. While Michael Jonathan Smith’s departure is a sad one, Reed does seem like a great substitute. </p>
