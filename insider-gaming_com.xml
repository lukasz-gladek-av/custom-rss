            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/use-the-uchigatana-in-your-new-elden-ring-build-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If your <strong>Elden Ring</strong> build revolves around the Samurai class and move set, chances are you want to track down and equip a second Uchigatana. Even if you’re not playing Samura, knowing where to find the Uchigatana in Elden Ring proves worthwhile, as it is a durable, quick weapon that scales with Strength and Dexterity.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-the-uchigatana-in-elden-ring"><strong>Where is the Uchigatana in Elden Ring?</strong></h2>



<p>You can find the Uchigatana one of two ways, either as starting equipment for the Samurai class, as previously mentioned, or out in the world via a dungeon.</p>



<p>For the latter, <strong>you’ll find the Uchigatana in Deathtouched Catacombs</strong>, in Stormhill, Limgrave, where you’ll have to defeat a few skeletons and activate a lever to unlock the door leading into the hall.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Within the catacombs, fight through the undead until you discover a dead body handing over the edge of the floor. It’s here that you’ll find the Uchigatana.</p>







<h2><strong>How Good is the Uchigatana?</strong></h2>



<p>The Uchigatana in <em>Elden Ring</em> is one of the best early-game weapons, as it is viable for both Piercing and Slash Damage. Furthermore, its Weapon Skill, <strong>Unsheathe</strong>, can help you down most bosses with relative ease early on.</p>



<p>Thankfully, you can <strong>upgrade the Uchigatana using Smithing Stones</strong>, which makes it stronger overall. Over time, the blade will cause bleed buildup, which is ever-useful when dealing with bosses with an increased health pool.</p>



<p>And yes, you can infuse the Uchigatana with <strong>Ashes of War</strong>. These include the likes of Sword Dance, Vacuum Slice, Bloodhound’s Step, Raptor of the Mists, Lighting Slash, Flame of the Redmanes, Carian Grandeur, Bloody Slash, and Seppuku, among countless others.</p>

<p>SNK has announced the creation of a knew studio for its fighting games called KOF Studio. KOF Studios’ role will be to help “further evolve the SNK fighting game IP”.</p>



<p>The move comes alongside the 30th anniversary of the studio’s The King of Fighters franchise.</p>



<p>“Since their creation in the 1990s,&nbsp;fighting game series such as&nbsp;“Garou Densetsu”, “Samurai Shodown”, and “The King of Fighters”&nbsp;have been loved by fans around the world,” SNK <a href="https://www.snk-corp.co.jp/kofstudio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in its announcement</a> via translation.</p>



<p>Currently, SNK has a number of games in development within the aforementioned franchises. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is scheduled for release in April 2025, and will be the first release for the series since Fatal Fury: First Contact in 1999. There’s also a new action RPG Samurai Shodown game in early development.</p>



<p>The King of Fighters’ last game launched in 2022. There’s been no mention on when the next game in the series could be coming.</p>
