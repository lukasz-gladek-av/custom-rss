<p>Major Fortnite leaks for Chapter 7 content have begun to flood social media following a creator preview event in Los Angeles, with standout details including driveable reboot vans and a dedicated bots mode.</p>



<p>Epic Games is gearing up for the major <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Hour end-of-chapter event</a> next week, which will be followed by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start of Chapter 7</a>, Season 1, and big changes are on the cards that will impact various core mechanics of the game.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Big changes afoot. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to reliable leakers, including <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991464160996344068" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, some of the biggest gameplay changes coming to Fortnite in Chapter 7 include reboot vans being driveable, an overhaul to the gameplay UI, and a dedicated Solo vs Bots mode.</p>



<p>Bots are nothing new in Fortnite and are widely used to populate Battle Royale lobbies to reduce wait time, but introducing a dedicated mode where solo players go head-to-head with them is a big change. However, there is still plenty to be detailed about the game mode.</p>



<p>Driveable reboot vans align with previous hints towards a revamp of the reboot system in Fortnite, which will result in changes to gameplay tactically as reboot vans will be moveable, thus becoming a core resource later in games to revive fallen teammates, or prevent opponents from bringing back their squad.</p>



<p>Another big change, again leaked by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991290054728159308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, shows that storm sizes are being adjusted in Chapter 7 away from the standard circle closing in, instead having a ‘seven’ shape. However, it’s mentioned that the sizes and timings are not final.</p>



<p>Epic Games will reveal all the major changes to Fortnite in Chapter 7 closer to the release date, likely sharing the full details in a pre-launch blog ahead of the start of the new chapter on December 30.</p>

<p>Another year in Fortnite is drawing to a close, and a new chapter is on the horizon. Insider Gaming has all the details about when Chapter 7, Season 1 kicks off in the game.</p>



<p>The past year in Fortnite has been full of huge collabs, including the likes of The Simpsons, Star Wars, Godzilla, and Power Rangers, and Chapter 7 is likely to follow in a similar trend with other huge crossovers.</p>



<p>For all the details about the launch of Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1, take a look at the guide below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-release-date">What is The Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1 Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big updates. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Chapter 7, Season 1 in Fortnite is due to kick off on Sunday, November 30, as confirmed by Epic Games themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Epic Games has begun to tease the new chapter, including a big collab with Quentin Tarantino’s <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1991280378355806501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kill Bill</a>, which is set to be one of the first major collabs of Chapter 7 in Fortnite.</p>



<p>The tease confirmed the release date for Fortnite Chapter 7, which comes the day after the big <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Hour live event</a>, bringing an end to Chapter 6, which is expected to be followed by downtime soon in the early hours of the morning on November 30 ahead of the season launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-start-time">Do We Know The Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1 Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>No official start time for Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1 has been announced by Epic Games, nor is it expected that a precise time will be shared due to the maintenance length, but history provides an idea of how long downtime will be.</strong></p>



<p>Fortnite’s Zero Hour live event takes place at 2 PM ET on November 29, and server downtime is expected to follow soon after. While it’s unlikely to be immediate, downtime should take place at the usual start time of around 2 AM ET on November 30, and they will be out of action for a while.</p>







<p>In 2024, downtime before the launch of Chapter 6 was seven hours, but a year earlier, the Big Bang event was followed by 11 hours of downtime—with the longer spell likely due to the variety of new modes that were launched, including LEGO Fortnite and Fortnite Festival.</p>



<p>In 2022, end-of-chapter downtime was 9 hours, while 2021 downtime was a staggering 18 hours. However, nothing compares to The End event in October 2019, which was followed by 36 hours of downtime.</p>



<p>Based on this, don’t expect Fortnite Chapter 7, Season 1 to be live until 9 AM ET at the very earliest, and the wait could be many hours longer. As usual, social media is the best place to keep track.</p>
