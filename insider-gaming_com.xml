<p>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era is set to release in early access Summer 2025. The release window for the game was confirmed during Thursday’s Triple-i Initiative showcase.</p>



<p>Alongside the release window announcement, developer Unfrozen released a new cinematic story trailer to set the stage for what’s to come for players.</p>



<p>“Tensions rise yet again,” the description reads. “The would-be protectors of Jadame clash their arms against one another, engulfing the continent in chaos and conflict. Reason is forsaken in the name of conquest and bloodbath. In the shadows, a malevolent force emerges, seeking to use this opportunity to claim dominion in the name of their master.”</p>



<p>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era is the first new game in the franchise since 2015’s Might &amp; Magic Heroes 7. While it’s once again being published by Ubisoft, it’s the first in the series to be developed by Unfrozen. The game, though the eighth mainline title in the series, is a prequal that’s set before the events of the 1995’s original Heroes of Might and Magic.</p>



<p>The game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-announced-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first revealed</a> at Gamescom 2024 and will launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are two new adventures to sink your teeth into, each having 6 chapters to explore. For the base game, players can check out “To End an Ice Age”, and for the Tides of the Foscari DLC, they can play “Tides of the Foscari”.</p>

<p>It has been announced during the triple-i Initiative that ‘The Alters’ will be releasing in June 2025 and coming to Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>In an official press release about the announcement, 11-Bit said,</p>



<p>In The Alters, the upcoming science-fiction game from 11 bit studios (makers of This War of Mine and Frostpunk), where survival has never been so personal, the path to salvation begins with a question as old as humanity: What if I had chosen differently? </p>



<p>Stranded on a hostile planet and racing against a deadly sunrise, Jan Dolski’s only chance of survival is to create “alters”—alternate versions of himself shaped by roads not taken. Each Jan comes with unique skills, personalities, and memories tied to a different life choice. But they also come with conflict, doubt, and emotional baggage. </p>



<p>Managing the mission means managing yourself—literally. Players must maintain a mobile base, make time-critical decisions, build relationships with their Alters, and confront the consequences of their own past lives. </p>



<p>And as a new element the trailer leans into, The Alters reveals the hardships of exploring the planet’s unique biomes, where deadly anomalies stand in your way. Levitating rocks and eerie distortions of reality catch your attention immediately, while other singularities remain invisible to the naked eye and require special tools to uncover. In every case, without a careful approach, you risk instant death, radiation-induced injuries, or even the disintegration of time and space itself. And you may want to avoid exploring at night, as the heightened radioactivity can eat right through your suit. These dangers add yet another layer to the survival experience, turning every expedition into a high-stakes puzzle. </p>



<p>Blending survival, base-building, exploration, and emotional storytelling, The Alters is a deeply personal sci-fi experience where every decision matters—and every version of you has something to say about it.</p>



<p>You can watch the full trailer of the announcement below:</p>

<p>In October 2024, Surgent Studios unveiled Project Uso, an ambitious, choice-driven RPG with beat-’em-up vibes. That was before the studio announced a partnership with Pocketpair Publishing, with the team signing up to develop a horror game that’s yet to be revealed.</p>



<p>I bumped into Abubakar Salim, the founder of Surgent, at the BAFTA Games Awards in London. The recent news of the partnership got me thinking about Project Uso and whether the team was still working on it because it piqued my interest when it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-tales-of-kenzera-uso/">uncovered months ago</a>.</p>



<p>Check out the full video interview here:</p>

<p>Tales of Kenzera: Project Uso is an extension of Tales of Kenzera: Zau, which was released in February 2024 to a stunning reception. I was fortunate enough back then to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tales-of-kenzera-interview-abubakar-salim/">sit down with Abubakar</a> and talk about the inspiration behind this emotional, beautiful game.</p>



<p>I learned that Surgent Studios plans to create a thriving multimedia universe around Tales of Kenzera.</p>



<p>When I was chatting with Abubakar at the BAFTA Game Awards, I dropped a question about Project Uso, asking if it was still in the pipeline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Uso is still cooking. I think the way that I’m approaching the design and game dev process is we want to build things that all feed into the next game and then the next game and then the next game.</p>



<p>Uso is still cooking, man the universe is still alive, and that’s very exciting. There are other games as well. </p>



<p>I think one of the reasons we wanted to reveal Uso was, that was one of those games that we felt really passionate about and not many people do this, not many people share in the industry, something that they’re just cooking and seeing what happens.</p>



<p>There are still things that we need to work with and still need to conjure with that game. It’s a big game, it’s very ambitious, what we want to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tuesday night at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bafta-games-awards-astro-bot-scoops/">BAFTA Games Awards</a>, Abubakar Salim took to the stage to receive the award for Game Beyond Entertainment, a prestigious trophy that perfectly highlights what Tales of Kenzera: Zau is all about.</p>



<p>I’m very excited and eagerly awaiting more news from Surgent regarding Project Uso – watch this space.</p>
