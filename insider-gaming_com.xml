            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Earlier this year, reports surfaced suggesting that Just Cause 5 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/just-cause-5-reportedly-cancelled-mid-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was canceled</a> midway through development, putting a final nail in the coffin for the open-world action series. In a recent post on social media, Avalanche Studios’ founder, Christofer Sundberg, revealed that the current makeup of the company would prevent Just Cause 5 from ever resurfacing.</p>



<p>In his words, even the reappearance of Just Cause 5 wouldn’t be enough to ‘save’ Avalanche.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-might-never-see-another-just-cause-game">We Might Never See Another Just Cause Game</h2>



<p>Just Cause debuted in 2006, emerging as an open-world action title like never before. It was an enormous game that pushed the PlayStation 2 and Xbox to unforeseen limits, offering players a massive world to trek through while undertaking gun-blazing missions and death-defying stunts.</p>



<p>It was expanded on with a second, third, and fourth (and final) release, but the latter title proved to be the killing point for the franchise, which is something that Christofer Sundberg, founder of Avalanche Studios, shouldered some of the blame for:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The problems with JC4 was partly me (unwillingly) moving away from creative leadership to more corporate crap, publisher problems, team composition and roles and more. Sad, because looking at JC4 now, it shows SO much promise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sundberg <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1985261958044553563" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was speaking</a> to his followers about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-screenshots-canceled-xbox-avalanche/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent topic of Contraband</a>. Images of the canceled game surfaced recently online, prompting Sundberg to address his relation to the project:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Me and my team pitched Contraband back in 2017 to MSFT (and signed it). It’s changed quite a lot since then obviously, but it would have been fantastic to see it being released one day somehow. #JC5 <strong>would be a no-go </strong>since extremely few from the original team are there still.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments under his post, Sundberg became critical of Avalanche’s current operating model:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I doubt it. They need to find the fire again, take risks, piss people off and make games the rest said was impossible. I started Avalanche to break the mold, not to fit into one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Springfield map in the Fortnite mini-season themed around The Simpsons is packed full of easter eggs and iconic locations, including Homer’s House, the Simpsons family’s iconic home.</p>



<p>With a stacked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass</a> and limited time to get through it all, with the launch of Chapter 7 looming toward the end of the month, gathering XP quickly is crucial so that you don’t miss out on any rewards.</p>



<p>Whether you’re on the hunt for Homer’s House for a specific Fortnite quest or want to enjoy the environment and the easter eggs, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-homer-s-house-in-fortnite">Where is Homer’s House in Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Siiiimpsooooons…. House. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Homer’s house and the residence of the rest of the Simpsons family is found slap bang in the middle of the Evergreen Terrace POI in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re a fan of The Simpsons, the house will stand out like a sore thumb. If you’re not as well-versed in the iconic show, the giveaways are the brown roof and Homer’s iconic car outside. Next door is Ned Flanders house, which is easily spotted by the purple roof, and there’s a blue bungalow on the other side.</p>



<p>Visiting the location for the first time will reward you with an XP boost, with even more if it’s your first time in Evergreen Terrace, but there’s still a few more things you can do to stack up XP.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-do-in-the-simpsons-house-for-easy-fortnite-xp">What to do in The Simpsons House For Easy Fortnite XP</h2>



<p><strong>There are a bunch of quests you can complete in or near The Simpsons’ house, so it’s worth taking advantage of your time in the area.</strong></p>



<p>One of the easiest, if you haven’t done so already, is to head inside the house and interact with the couch in the living room, which provides 5,000 XP and is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-simpsons-fortnite-hidden-gag-quests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 Hidden Gag</a> quests there are to complete.</p>



<p>It’s worth looting the area too to find specific items, as there’s a chance you can get the Blinky Fish, which unlocks the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-point-dash-blinky-fish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Point Dash</a> for a limited time, and Steamed Ham—the latter being another Hidden Gag quest.</p>



<p>Once you’re done in Evergreen Terrace, head south to the Burning Tires and look around the area for a mound of dirt. Interact with it to dig up Mr. Sparky, ticking off another Hidden Gag quest in the process.</p>
