<p>Elden Ring is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, and it reportedly struggles to run on the latest Nintendo console?</p>



<p>According to Nintendo Life’s Felix Sanchez, who spent time with the game while in Cologne for Gamescom the game has serious performance issues on the Switch 2 when playing in handheld mode.</p>



<p><strong>“Performance wise, here at that big first fight, as soon as you step outside, the framerate drops quite substantially,”</strong> Sanchez said while mentioning that it’s always locked at 30 frames per second</p>



<p>He then continued: <strong>“You get to the outside world, and the framerate just tanks. It’s really bad, and I understand why they don’t want you to see this.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“It is terrible. Of course, you’re never going to see the light of this because—well, maybe it’ll release in that state, but I can’t imagine it will.”</strong></p>



<p>Sanchez said it felt like 20 frames per second and, sometimes, as low as 15. It would happen, he said, doing the “most simple stuff”.</p>



<p>As far as the positives, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hq3m8UwhGM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sanchez did say that</a> while it doesn’t look as good as PC or PlayStation—as should be expected—it did look “really good”. He also said the tutorial area of the game performed properly.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition is scheduled to release on Nintendo Switch 2 later this year. A firm release date, however, has yet to be announced. </p>

<p>Once Human’s next big update lands next week, it was announced at Gamescom, as the title continues to grow with more features and experiences.</p>



<p>First released in July 2024, Once Human has grown in the year since, including the launch of a PvP spin-off, RaidZone. Now, the base game itself is getting a big update.</p>



<p>Stellar Resonance is a new gameplay mode that lands in Once Human next week, introducing Gravity Integrators and a host of rewards.</p>

<p>In a press release sent to Insider Gaming, the Stellar Resonance update is said to “drastically change” gameplay and offer “all-new challenges” for players.</p>



<p>Further details were shared on the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20250821/40780_1255304.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, with the event period beginning August 28 and running to September 25. After the update is live, players will receive a Gravity Integrator blueprint when a Star Advent Loot Crate is opened for the first time, which can be used at an Intermediate or Advanced Supplies Workbench.</p>



<p>Once placed and activated, the Gravity Integrator will begin to ascend, constantly accumulating Stellar Core Gravity Samples and unlocking tiered rewards the higher it ascends. However, it will also attract Deviants and must be defended.</p>



<p>Global Research is also available in the update, with progress shared across all servers for the same region, unlocking new bonuses and additional reward claim chances. However, the mission is “extremely urgent”, and, if a new research phase is not within five days, bonuses will be lost and attacking Deviants will be stronger.</p>



<p>Additional optimizations were also deployed, including increased gliding and descending speed, improved airbone mechanics, and the ability to cancel aiming when performing a plunging melee attack.</p>
