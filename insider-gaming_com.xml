<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could be getting a major boost in games after it launches. According to a new claim from known leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NateTheHate</a>, Xbox exclusives Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection are coming to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The games are also reported to be coming to PlayStation 5 as well.</p>







<p>“Games that I have heard will be released multiplatform in 2025, beyond the obvious, include Flight Simulator—will come to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2—and Halo: The Master Chief Collection will be coming to PS5 and Switch 2 as well,” NateTheHate said.</p>



<p>While those two games were the main ones discussed, they don’t appear to be the only ones coming to the upcoming Nintendo console. In a reply to a <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1877737536048574891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on social media</a> about games coming to the system, Windows Central Executive Editor Jez Corden said the total would be “way more than that”. He then followed up with that the games would be “most older games/timed stuff”.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct Announced for January 23&nbsp;</a></h6>



<p>No other details about what older games could come to the system were mentioned. Aside from Xbox games, NateTheHate also suggested that Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth—both PlayStation 5 console exclusives—will come to the system. They’ll also be coming to Xbox starting with Remake in 2025 and Rebirth in 2026.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s selection of editions can’t come soon enough for long-time fans. It’s a chance to separate the casual audience from the hardcore players who adore the hardcore gameplay.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has provided a delectable selection of treats, depending on which Deliverance 2 edition you pick up. From a traditional Standard Edition to the pricey but prize-ridden Collector’s Edition, there’s something for everyone. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> has a lot of pressure to perform after the massive success of the debut title, but I’d argue that so do its launch-day editions.</p>



<p>Everyone has a Collector’s Edition nowadays, and it’s up to the team to make Deliverance 2’s special. Let’s find out if it is.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-edition">Every Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Edition</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re coming for at least one of those editions. Credit to Warhorse Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has three editions to choose from and pre-order: <strong>Collector’s Edition</strong>, <strong>Gold Edition</strong>, and <strong>Standard Edition</strong>.</p>



<p>I’m not shocked to see <a href="https://www.kingdomcomerpg.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deliverance 2</a> has three main editions. Occasionally, four editions might be seen for a new game, but a Standard Edition, a Collector’s Edition, and something in-between is the norm.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-collector-s-edition-explained">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2—Collector’s Edition Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>That’s a lot of goodies. Credit to Warhorse Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-collectors-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Collector’s Edition</a> is the ultimate bundle for fans as it comes with the game, a physical statue, digital bonuses, and a whole host of other smaller tangible tidbits.</p>



<p>It costs <strong>$199.99 </strong>or <strong>£189.99</strong>, and while this is expensive, I’ve seen much worse for Collector’s Editions. Its price tag can be ignored though as these super-duper editions always have enough demand to make their availability scarce. If you want your own, you better be quick.</p>



<p>Here’s the complete list of contents for the Collector’s Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>A copy of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</li>



<li>“The Lion’s Quest” Bonus Quest pre-order DLC.</li>



<li>Expansion Pass for post-launch DLC.</li>



<li>Henry &amp; Pebbles 30cm Statue.</li>



<li>Letter of Hope.</li>



<li>The King’s Rebels Collectable Cards.</li>



<li>Coats of Valor: Enamel Pin Set.</li>



<li>Alleys of Kuttenberg.</li>



<li>Gallant Huntman’s Kit (digital content).</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-gold-edition-explained">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2—Gold Edition Explained</h2>



<p>The Gold Edition is the middle ground, offering a slightly more lucrative package than the Standard Edition, but costing considerably less than the Collector’s Edition.</p>



<p>This is for users wanting to show their support for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and wanting some half-decent content in the process. The extra goodies here are digital-only though, so bear this in mind if you’re after physical memorabilia. You’re looking at <strong>$89.99</strong> or <strong>£79.99</strong> here for a purchase.</p>



<p>This is the full set of goodies in the Gold Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>A copy of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</li>



<li>“The Lion’s Quest” Bonus Quest pre-order DLC.</li>



<li>Expansion Pass for post-launch DLC.</li>



<li>Gallant Huntman’s Kit.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-standard-edition-explained">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2—Standard Edition Explained</h2>



<p>Finally, the Standard Edition is a routine copy of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 with no extra thrills or spills.</p>



<p>If you’re eager, you can secure the pre-order bonus if you order ahead of its launch. This at least secures you a bit of extra content you wouldn’t get otherwise—and it costs <strong>$69.99</strong> or <strong>£59.99</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s a smaller list, but this is the full inventory included:</p>



<ul>
<li>A copy of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</li>



<li>“The Lion’s Quest” Bonus Quest pre-order DLC (If you pre-order).</li>
</ul>
