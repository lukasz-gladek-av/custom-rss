            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-bongo-cat-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bongo Cat was released on Steam on March 5, and in the time it has been online, it has racked up a review rating of <strong>Overwhelmingly Positive</strong>. As I write this, 130,000 people are playing the game on Steam, but <strong>what even is it</strong>? The game’s description on Steam doesn’t give anything away, leaving many to wonder what Bongo Cat is and why it is going insane on Steam.</p>



<p>Here’s the description, which will make more sense once you’ve read through the explanation below:</p>



<p><em>‘Bongo cat needs your help. Bongo cat needz more hatz!!! Every time you press a key, Bongo Cat will punch your taskbar. Type, click, play, and work to collect more points. Which hats will you find?’</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-hatz">More Hatz</h2>



<p>If you remember the banana-themed game on Steam that was aptly named <strong>Banana</strong>, then you’ll understand some of the premise for Bongo Cat.</p>



<p>In Banana, players were presented with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/banana-steam-make-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a banana that they clicked on</a>. The more they clicked, the more banana skins (get it?) they earned, and the kicker was that they could take those skins and trade them on the Steam Marketplace. That’s how Banana managed to skyrocket to a peak concurrent player count of more than 900,000 Steam users.</p>



<p>What is Bongo Cat? Think of it as being <strong>Banana</strong>, but replace the fruit with a cat, and instead of doing nothing when you click on it, the cat slaps your taskbar. It sits over whatever you’re doing, and everything you do will earn another slap – clicking, typing, and so on. As you rack up points, you’ll earn new cats, hats, and other items, such as emotes and floating icons.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-point-of-bongo-cat">What’s the Point of Bongo Cat?</h2>



<p>It’s not enough to know what Bongo Cat is, you must also understand <strong>what the point of the game is</strong>.</p>



<p>It doesn’t really have much of a point, but the game’s <strong>feature list </strong>on Steam mentions that it will be ‘A friend while working hard.’</p>



<p>As you collect points, you can unlock items that range from Common to Legendary, and when you get them, you’re free to trade and sell them within the Steam Marketplace. </p>



<p>And now you understand why Bongo Cat is soaring in popularity – it’s because there’s a slight chance of making some money on the game.</p>



<p>If you want to give Bongo Cat a try, you get get it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419430/Bongo_Cat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for free now on Steam</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battle-royale-multiplayer-casual-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-gave-us-battle-royale-casual-but-where%E2%80%99s-multiplayer-casual.1163292/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battle-royale-multiplayer-casual-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When Verdansk came back on April 3, it brought ‘Battle Royale Casual’ with it, an all-new mode packed with bots to give players a much more forgiving experience. Given how I love Call of Duty’s multiplayer platforms but hate sweating against cracked players and the punishing SBMM mechanics, I’m wondering where my ‘Multiplayer Casual’ playlists are.</p>



<p>It’s not an unheard-of concept. In 2022 and 2023, Modern Warfare II and III featured a mode called ‘Invasion’, which was a large-scale multiplayer mode stacked with bots – and it was <strong>great</strong>.</p>



<p>Let’s get some simple playlists sorted out for the less talented player who just wants to chill out and shoot guns.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-struggle">No Struggle</h2>



<p>Before labelling me a crazy person, look at this. I was inspired to explore this topic thanks to a post on <a href="https://x.com/DETONATEDcom/status/1911230593662099703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter by DETONATED</a>, which held a poll that had some <strong>very </strong>telling results:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That post and the subsequent poll got me thinking…</p>



<p>Call of Duty’s skill-based matchmaking mechanics were broken down by their creator during a recent episode of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-creator-of-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast</a>. They’re not as nefarious as you might think, but they’re designed in a way that keeps you on your toes and in lobbies with players around your ‘calculated’ skill level.</p>



<p>It does mean that, at times, you’ll be lumped in with players that walk out of the lobby with a 4.0 K/D.</p>



<p>It was also confirmed a while ago that Call of Duty’s studios <strong>never </strong>inject bots into any multiplayer matches, which is something that other games have done historically. Sure, they’ve mostly been battle royale games with much higher player counts in a single game, but you can downsize the logic, surely.</p>



<p>Invasion was the perfect example of ‘Multiplayer Casual’. It put players in large, sweeping maps with hundreds of bots and a decent array of real players, making it feel like a full-fledged battlefield (no pun or reference intended). It meant that you’d likely end a match with hundreds of kills, and you never had to go looking for enemies.</p>



<p>Invasion was <strong>dropped </strong>coming into Black Ops 6, which left a gaping hole in my rotation.</p>



<p>Here’s my question:</p>



<p>If we can have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-launching-battle-royale-casual-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale Casual</a> packed with bots that allows you to experience the same game but earn fewer experience points, why can’t we have a Multiplayer Casual mode that serves the same purpose?</p>



<p>Folks can grind camos, learn the maps, play modes that they usually wouldn’t, experiment with non-meta weapons, and so on, all while avoiding cheaters, punishing SBMM mechanics, and potentially connection issues (if it was entirely a bot lobby, of course).</p>



<p>That poll says that I’m not alone, but I’m just wondering how the logistics of a Multiplayer Casual mode would work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-will-compete-with-other-extraction-shooters-by-not-competing-interview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon is set to be a game-changing extraction shooter, but it’s hard to break into a genre that’s so dominated by existing titles. For instance, Escape from Tarkov has held the top spot in that vertical for many years, and those that have tried to challenge the game have ultimately failed or fallen to the wayside.</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon will attempt to rival the likes of Escape from Tarkov by <strong>not </strong>rivalling Escape from Tarkov. That’s straight from the mouth of the game’s director, Joe Ziegler, who recently sat down with Gaming World Media’s Jake Lucky to discuss all aspects of the upcoming shooter.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-most-interesting-stories">‘The Most Interesting Stories’</h2>



<p>Joe Ziegler was transparent when talking to Jake Lucky about Marathon following a recent behind-closed-doors playtest. He suggested that the reason why extraction shooters fail is because they come in and worry about competing with other, existing titles – but it’s all about trying to be <strong>different enough </strong>to live alongside those top dogs.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon TELL ALL with Bungie's Joe Ziegler" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTSnXKDpQvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In another recent interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-boss-says-industry-doomed-to-unnecessarily-brutal-layoffs-while-chasing-after-the-battle-royales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arrowhead’s Johan Pilestedt</a> explained that trying to replicate the success of a game like Escape from Tarkov will always be fruitless because people don’t want to play the same game over and over again.</p>



<p>That’s what Ziegler alluded to in his interview with Jake Lucky:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I might be naive in saying this but I’ll be honest… To me, I don’t think of making games as like, directly competing and trying to eat a bunch of other people’s lunch. For me, whenever I think about it, it’s like, how do we offer something that’s interesting and cool and can live in its own space alongside other titles and be just as big and important as others.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that being said, Bungie has worked from a variety of perspectives to make Marathon as unique as possible.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We really do want to create some of the most interesting stories you’ve ever had, and we’re inputting a lot of dynamics to make that happen. At the end of a night of playing Marathon, we want you to tell a really cool story to somebody else, you know? To be excited.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team is also making Marathon the most accessible extraction shooter in the market, doing away with punishing mechanics and a steep learning curve to make something that everyone can play and enjoy. They’re hellbent on ‘breaking the already existing military space’ and making something much more adventurous in Marathon.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-doesnt-have-proximity-chat/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-%E2%80%98social-extraction-experience%E2%80%99-but-the-game-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-proximity-chat.1163091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-doesnt-have-proximity-chat/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been confirmed that Bungie’s Marathon will not have proximity chat despite the developers wanting the game to be a ‘social extraction experience’.</p>



<p>The news of no proximity chat came via a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/marathon-wont-have-proximity-chat-because-itd-be-way-too-toxic-i-dont-think-anyone-has-a-good-solution-to-that-just-yet/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>, game director Joe Ziegler told PC Gamer that they don’t “have a solution yet” when it comes to the toxicity that proximity chat brings to players.</p>



<p>“I don’t think anyone really has a good solution to that just yet. Because we’re so dedicated to making sure that we’re creating a safe space where we don’t have players just flaming each other or doing terrible things to one another, I think we’re not ready to invest in prox chat until we have a solution,” he said.</p>







<p>The comments come <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-wants-marathon-to-be-a-social-extraction-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">following an interview that we published in collaboration with Jake Lucky</a>, where in the same day of interviews Joe Ziegler told Lucky that they want the game to be “more of a social extraction experience”.</p>



<p>Ziegler explained, “The key thing for us was making Marathon a little bit more of a social extraction experience where there’s a lot value in playing with other people that you know or people that you want and you all feel like you can create that adventure together and we’re not trying to fragment you all the time, you know?”</p>



<p>In the interview, Ziegler gave the example of being able to be respawned instead of just watching your teammates complete the match, or another example of “data cards” where your entire team can cash them out together.</p>



<p>However, I think a <strong>big point</strong> is being missed here and the conflicting comments are a bit of a head scratcher. Proximity chat ADDS the much-needed social aspect to a game and while I understand Bungie’s stance on toxicity, surely players who don’t want to engage with proximity chat can just… you know… turn it off? Or better yet, just give players the ability to report others for toxicity. These are not new ideas and with the right infrastructure (moderation), they are the solution that Bungie is looking for.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, you’re never going to stop people from being toxic, no matter what you do.</p>



<p>Without proximity chat, Bungie is missing the mark entirely on not only what makes extraction shooters fun and exciting and to be honest… Makes the whole ‘social extractions shooter’ comment laughable.</p>



<p>Marathon is set to be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on September 23, 2025.</p>

    <div>
        
<p>A new list of characters that are supposedly coming to Fortnite in the near future have been leaked online.</p>



<p>The leak comes courtesy of ShpeshalNick of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnJBa4Q0JSw&amp;ab_channel=XboxEra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra podcast</a>, who has a tendency to be fairly accurate when it comes to Fortnite information. According to Nick, the following characters are coming to Fortnite sometime in the future:</p>



<ul>
<li>Jack Black (apparently its just Jack Black and not connected to the Minecraft release)</li>



<li>More Mortal Kombat Characters</li>



<li>Death Stranding Characters</li>



<li>Tony Hawk Pro Skater Characters</li>



<li>DOOM The Dark Ages Doom Slayer (a DOOM slayer version of The Dark Ages model)</li>



<li>Double Dragons Characters (Billy and Jimmy)</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Characters</li>



<li>Agent 47 (Hitman)</li>



<li>Marvel Characters (in a pixel art style)</li>



<li>A player from the NBA</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-tony-hawk-fortnite-event">Tony Hawk Fortnite Event</h2>



<p>Another surprising detail to come from the leak is that Nick also revealed that there is going to be some kind of Tony Hawk Pro Skater event, but what that looks like is currently unknown and which characters will be coming to Fortnite from the game is unclear (obviously we can assume Tony Hawk himself is one).</p>



<p>You can watch the full discussion of the leak below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 has already been confirmed to release on July 11</a>, 2025, so it’s entirely possible that the event will be take place around the release. But as Nick points out, Epic Games has been notorious in the past with not abiding by any key dates, so it could release before or after the games release.</p>



<p>Which characters are you most looking forward to seeing coming to Fortnite?&nbsp;Let me know what you think on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>, or post a comment below.</p>
