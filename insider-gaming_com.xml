<p>Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially announced</a> the Nintendo Switch 2 console on Thursday with it releasing some time in 2025. The reveal came in the form of a two-minute video that showed the new system from a number of angles. Players got a look at the handheld, the new Joy-Cons, and even the new dock.</p>



<p>While full specs weren’t announced—that’s likely coming during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Direct event</a> on April 2—Nintendo didn’t really hide any aspect of the exterior of the system. From the kickstand to the dock to the new USB-C port on top, there’s a lot to see. So, let’s check out the first pictures of the new Nintendo Switch (click on an image to enlarge it).</p>

<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-console-pictures">Nintendo Switch 2 Console Pictures</h2>



<p>As you can see in the pictures below, a number of rumored features were confirmed. The new Joy-Cons attach to the console via a magnet as opposed to a slide rail while the new dock is more rounded, much like the system itself. Sticking with the Joy-Cons, the base colors now match the system with the red and blue being accents on the connector and under the thumbstick. The new button that has been shown on past mockups is on the right controller, though Nintendo seems to have intentionally left it blank to hide its functionality.</p>



<p>Elsewhere there is the aforementioned second USB-C port on the top of the system. Lastly, the console’s kickstand also received an overhaul as it appears to allow the Switch 2 to lay nearly completely horizontal with support.</p>

<p>Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially announced the Nintendo Switch 2</a> on Thursday with a short video to reveal the system. Within the teaser, the company also showed what appeared to be Mario Kart 9 (name pending) running on the system. While there was nothing to really write home about regarding the look at Mario Kart 9, one shot seems to suggest that 24-player races could be a feature of the next game in the series.</p>



<p>A keen-eyed Twitter user (<a href="https://x.com/The_Rimea/status/1879881772852490287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@The_Rimea</a>) spotted the starting grid for a race in the new game, and with it came what appeared to be 24 spots for racers. </p>



<p>“Judging from the starting line, Mario Kart 9(???) seems to have 24 players per race, which is insane,” the post reads alongside the accompanying image that you can see below. For comparison’s sake, there’s also a couple images of the starting grid from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Nintendo hasn’t confirmed any details about games coming to the new Nintendo Switch 2 later this year. All that has been confirmed is that both physical and digital original Switch games will be compatible with the new system. In some instances, however, original Switch games “may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2”. </p>



<p>Nintendo is scheduled to hold a Nintendo Direct event fully dedicated to its new console on April 2. It’s expected that the company will announce full specs, a release date, price, and some launch games during the event. Insider Gaming will have full coverage leading up to and during the showcase.</p>
