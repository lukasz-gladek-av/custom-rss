<p>An insider has claimed that there are three playable characters in Resident Evil Requiem; however, we have only seen one in action till now. </p>



<p>Ahead of the new gameplay trailer at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Resident Evil Requiem has been receiving a series of leaks daily. Recently, we learned that the upcoming game will feature ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-last-of-us-combat-and-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last of Us</a>‘ combat and vehicles. We also learned other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story details</a> about RE9. Now, the latest leak says there are more playable characters. </p>

<p>The new leak about Resident Evil Requiem’s playable comes from none other than AestheticGame (Dusk Golem) on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955685571231445501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). In one of his previous posts, he stated that many diehard fans would feel that RE9 is “oddly like the Revelations games.” To which a fan asked whether the upcoming game will have four playable characters like Revelations did. Dusk Golem replied that players will be able to step into the shoes of Leon and Grace, and “a little Alyssa.” </p>

<p>As of now, players have only seen Grace Ashcroft as the playable character in Resident Evil Requiem, and we have yet to learn about any new ones. Dusk Golem has claimed and reiterated several times that Leon will be one of the main protagonists in the game, but Alyssa is a new name. For those who don’t know, Alyssa Ashcroft is Grace’s mother and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> also the giant woman monster following her in the trailer. </p>

<p>Battlefield 6 developers have already made changes to the Rush mode, which was introduced during the second Open Beta weekend. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s Open Beta weekend 2 is now live, and it has instantly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-huge-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought in a vast number of players</a>. Many players must be looking forward to the weekend, as they will have two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new modes and a new map</a> to try out. However, one of the modes released this weekend, Rush, has already received a fix from BF6 developers. </p>







<p>The latest post from Battlefield Comms on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956355268972867585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) states that new balancing changes have been made to Breakthrough and Rush. The defender respawn timers in both Breakthrough and Rush have been fixed to 12 seconds; previously, they were set within the 6-12 second range. Also, in Breakthrough, fewer players are needed to capture an objective. </p>

<p>A couple of hours ago, the Battlefield Comms account posted another update for Battlefield 6’s Rush mode. The Rush mode’s MCOM timer was reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to improve the balance between attacking and defending players. The developers will continue to monitor the game mode and make further balancing adjustments as needed. </p>

<p>Since open beta weekend 2 began, several players have raised concerns about Battlefield 6’s Rush Mode. Popular Battlefield content creator, Westie, has been voicing their opinions about BF6’s Rush mode on <a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1955978800648319332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. According to them, there are massive balancing problems across each map, and there is no space between MCOM locations. Players on the r/Battlefield subreddit also have issues with the game mode being locked to 12v12 games. </p>



<p>The new timer changes do help, but players are asking for more balancing improvements for BF6’s Rush mode, including adding “<a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1956262080064921803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sufficient space</a>“, among other things. However, players should keep in mind that Battlefield 6 is still in beta, and the beta was intended to identify problems like these, which could be addressed before the full launch. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield and Call of Duty ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-and-call-of-duty-complement-each-other-says-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complement each other</a>‘, according to BF6 developers. Additionally, many Battlefield 6 players have experienced issues with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-dlss-dlaa-not-working-issue-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLSS and DLAA</a>. What are your thoughts on Battlefield 6 developers already making changes to the Rush mode?
