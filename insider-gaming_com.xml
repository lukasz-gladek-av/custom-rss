<p>Bungie’s former chief legal officer, Don Mcgowan, recently revealed that the studio hired fans as they were okay with working for a smaller paycheck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKfUWDnsE2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IATSE</a> on YouTube (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/former-bungie-legal-exec-studio-hired-fans-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamePost</a>), McGowan, a former member of Bungie’s general counsel, discussed how gaming companies hire fans to “get away with lower pay” because they are working on a game they love. McGowan states that they “totally took advantage of that at Bungie,” adding, “We hired fans because fans would work for less.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>McGowan has also previously worked with companies like Pokemon and Microsoft Games. During the interview, he reveals how peers asked him, “How much of a pay cut are they making you take?” when he moved to Bungie. He explained that people in the industry would assume that the studio is making you take a pay cut, which is “a horrible reputation for you to have”. “But when you only hire fans, you can get away with that”, concluded McGowan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the first shot at Bungie by an ex-employee this week; the former Marathon game director has also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-marathon-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-denies-conduct-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued the studio and Sony recently</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumour-riot-games-to-allow-gambling-sponsors-for-league-and-valorant-teams-in-2025.1060788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-to-allow-gambling-sponsors-esports-rumour/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been claimed that Riot Games is preparing to make a major change to its sponsorship policies as we head into 2025. It was recently rumoured that the company will allow a limited number of gambling companies to sponsor esports teams in League of Legends and VALORANT, after spending many years standing firm against that very concept.</p>



<p>Most recently, in 2023, the gaming titan issued a statement confirming that there were no plans to change these policies <strong>but </strong>it would continue to ‘evaluate all opportunities’ in the sponsorship space. </p>



<p>Is a cultural shift on the horizon?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-the-money-is">Where The Money Is</h2>



<p>Esports betting makes up around half of the industry’s total revenue, while the other half is comprised of ticket sales, sponsorship deals, broadcast rights, merchandise sales, and other investments. It’s a money maker of a business, and that’s why so many esports organisations partner with gambling and betting brands.</p>



<p>On social media, the user ‘MonteCristo’ posted a claim that Riot will alter long-standing policies to allow betting sponsors to align with League of Legends and VALORANT teams going into 2025:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Riot will be allowing esports teams to have betting sponsors in League of Legends and VALORANT in 2025.

Gambling companies interested in sponsoring teams will have to be approved by Riot and will not be allowed to place logos on team uniforms.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Historically, some of the most prolific brands in esports betting have partnered with or sponsored organisations. The likes of GG.BET, Pinnacle, Betway, Parimatch, and 1xBet have all secured visible positions in the esports industry alongside some of the most valuable tournaments in the business.</p>



<p>It’s not too far-fetched to imagine that Riot Games wants in on that action, but it would come at the cost of some morality points.</p>



<p>For now, this is a rumour and should be treated accordingly, but I have reached out to representatives of Riot Games to try and grab a more concrete statement on the matter.</p>



<p>What do you think of this rumour? Can you see it materialising? Let us know in the comments.</p>
