<p>Star Citizen and Squadron 42 developer Cloud Imperium Games has undergone a significant shake-up to its upper management team to hit its deadlines.</p>



<p>Speaking to sources who wish to stay anonymous as they cannot publically talk about the company’s plans, several top-level executives have been laid off, and other top people at the company have been shifted to different roles.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the changes were starting to be implemented earlier this month, with head honcho Christ Roberts announcing the news to staff in an internal memo following the company’s annual “<a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/20371-Letter-From-The-Chairman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Letter from the Chairman</a>.” In late November 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-layoffs-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Imperium Games also let go of some of its staff</a>, prominently those in the QA department, as a part of its restructuring efforts.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Insider Gaming has heard of at least three executives with a combined experience of around 25 years at Cloud Imperium Games who have had their positions terminated. It’s said that announcements of their departures will be announced in due time.</p>



<p>In an internal announcement to employees, Chris Roberts said, To achieve this laser focus [of meeting the release of SQ42 and Star Citizen 1.0], it is more important than ever to ensure we have high-performing and efficient teams working throughout the company. In order to achieve this, I have had to make changes to the structure of our teams from the very top of the company and downwards to ensure we have the right people in the right roles, working in person as much as possible from our most critical year yet.”</p>



<p>Speaking with staff, some believe that the change is to save costs rather than to meet deadlines, with rumors around the office even suggesting that Sandi Gardiner, the wife of Chris Roberts, is to return to the company in a more prominent role. Sandi Gardiner left Cloud Imperium Games in May 2019 but remained on the board of directors.</p>



<p>Several months ago, Insider Gaming released an exclusive report on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what exactly is happening with Star Citizen’s 12 years of development</a>.</p>

<p>Fortnite has just announced the return of Renegade Raider and Aerial Assault Trooper skins, now available in the OG Season Shop.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-renegade-raider-returns-to-fortnite">Renegade Raider Returns to Fortnite</h2>



<p>After appearing in the original season, the Renegade Raider, the rarest skin, has made its way back to the Fortnite Item Shop. The skin costs 1,200 V-Bucks, but you must unlock it before purchasing it. The OG Season Shop now consists of 4 new cosmetics: the Aerial Assault One Glider, the Aerial Assault Trooper Skin, Renegade Raider Skin and Raider’s Revenge Pickaxe; each of them has to be unlocked by collecting a specific amount of XP before being able to purchase them.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Aerial Assault One Glider – 500 V-Bucks (unlocked by collecting 500,000 XP)</li>



<li>Aerial Assault Trooper Skin – 1,200 V-Bucks (unlocked by collecting 1,000,000 XP)</li>



<li>Renegade Raider Skin – 1,200 V-Bucks (unlocked by collecting 1,500,000 XP)</li>



<li>Raider’s Revenge Pickaxe – 1,500 V-Bucks (unlocked by collecting 1,500,000 XP)</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, the original owners of Renegade Raider and/or Aerial Assault Trooper from 2017 are receiving a token of appreciation from Fortnite. They will receive an exclusive style for both skins in the spring of 2025. All new cosmetics will be removed from the item store on January 31, 2025, so players have till then to gain the XP.&nbsp;</p>
