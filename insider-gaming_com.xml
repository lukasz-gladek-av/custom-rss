<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta was a huge success for EA and Battlefield Studios. A lot was learned about the next mainline BF game. If you think you can’t play Battlefield 6 again until October, think again—Battlefield Labs has returned.</p>



<p>Before the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-record-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta</a>, there was Battlefield Labs. EA’s new initiative is to incorporate player feedback more than ever before. We all complained vociferously about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-road-to-battlefield-6-pass-all-exclusive-bf6-rewards-how-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2042</a>‘s shortcomings, and it looks promising as EA clearly doesn’t want to make the same mistake twice.</p>

<p>The Battlefield Communications <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">page</a> announced on August 29 that “Battlefield Labs Resumes.”</p>



<p>The community update explained that you can register your interest again—and we have an in-depth guide on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> so you can play and test BF6.</p>



<p>It also explained: “The end of the Open Beta now provides us with the opportunity to return to Battlefield Labs play sessions. This time around, these sessions may occur at more varied intervals as we target finalizing the launch balance and features of Battlefield 6.”</p>



<p>A significant amount of new content is being added to Battlefield Labs that was previously unplayable. The Portal function is being added to Labs—albeit a basic and stripped-back version—and the announced Server Browser functionality is also included in the latest round of testing.</p>



<p>The development team is also using this test to “Determine the official setting for Hardcore mode, and we look forward to working with players to define it.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-seeking-rights/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/paramount-seeking-rights-to-make-a-call-of-duty-movie-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1283778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been reported that Paramount is seeking the rights to adapt Call of Duty into a movie, with the film reportedly being a ‘priority’ for the 110-year-old picture production firm. Nothing has been confirmed beyond this, and it’s not yet known in what form a potential Call of Duty movie would surface.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to criticize the news, with some stressing that it’s not the right time for a Call of Duty movie and others wondering if the film would include ‘Beavis and Butthead skins’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-a-call-of-duty-movie-being-made">Is a Call of Duty Movie Being Made?</h2>



<p>Before the Microsoft x Activision Blizzard acquisition, rumors regarding a Call of Duty movie were circulating. In a recent report from <a href="https://puck.news/author/matthew-belloni/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Puck News</a>, the claim surfaced along with a note that a Call of Duty film is a high priority for Paramount’s new leadership team.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The sentiment surrounding the news has been pretty tough, with fans suggesting it could be ‘another Borderlands movie’, which was released in 2024 to a woeful reception. Other Call of Duty fans have posted screenshots of the countless ‘war flicks’ we’ve received over the last few decades, stating that they’re <strong>all </strong>Call of Duty movies, in theory.</p>



<p>Paramount might go the route of creating something original, but for it to be a <strong>Call of Duty movie</strong>, it might need to follow a path already established by the game franchise. For instance, a movie-based replication of the Modern Warfare series might do well because it’s already so cinematic, but then it lacks originality.</p>



<p>What would you like to see from a Call of Duty movie? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
