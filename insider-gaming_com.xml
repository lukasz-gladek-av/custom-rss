<p>Team Vitality are the champions of IEM Katowice 2025, after upsetting top-ranked Team Spirit in a surprising 3-0 fashion in the grand final. Vitality claims their first big trophy since IEM Cologne 2024, and their first since signing former FaZe star Robin “ropz” Kool.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-spirit-fails-to-defend-katowice-title">Spirit Fails to Defend Katowice Title</h2>



<p>Vitality came out firing, stealing away Spirit’s first map pick of Dust2. Robin “ropz” Kool had easily his best map since joining the team, notching 26 kills against only 9 deaths, and dominating on the T-side in the second half. On Nuke, it was the legend Mathieu “ZywOo” Herbaut who stepped up, delivering 26 kills against only 6 deaths, while rarely using the AWP he was once synonymous with.</p>



<p>On Mirage, Vitality went into half-time with the lead for a third straight map. Spirit lost their sixth pistol round to kick off the second half, having failed to win a single pistol round all series. Trailing 11-4 and with their backs against the wall, Spirit finally showed some life in the second half, stringing together 7 straight rounds to tie it. Vitality finally got to 12 thanks to Shahar “flameZ” Shushan, and he opened the kills again in the pivotal final round of regulation to secure the map, <a href="https://www.hltv.org/matches/2378917/vitality-vs-spirit-iem-katowice-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the series</a>, and the trophy.</p>



<p>For Vitality, this represents the first time that the organization has lifted the trophy in Katowice in more than half a dozen tries. The team’s leader Dan “apEX” Madesclaire had never won in Katowice in the tournament’s 11 year history until today. ZywOo also ties the legendary Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev for most tournament MVP awards with 21.</p>



<p>Is Vitality the new favorite to lift the trophy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the next Major</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-should-battlefield-6-take-from-battlefield-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In February 2025, Electronic Arts divulged the future of the Battlefield franchise alongside a reveal of ‘Battlefield Labs’. This all-new testing initiative promised to invite fans into the fold to have them trial Battlefield products long before they are released to the open market.</p>



<p>It was also when we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-learned-from-the-new-battlefield-game-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our first look at Battlefield 6</a> – or whatever it’ll end up being named. It got me thinking about the games that came before, more particularly <strong>Battlefield 5, </strong>which I often consider to be the last <strong>good </strong>Battlefield game. </p>



<p>Don’t hate me.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s what I think Battlefield <strong>6 </strong>should take from Battlefield <strong>5</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-does-battlefield-6-need-to-have">What Does Battlefield 6 Need To Have?</h2>



<p>There are many features and mechanics unique to Battlefield 5 (or defined by Battlefield 5) that I feel would be right at home in Battlefield 6 – not that the title or numbering has been confirmed, of course.</p>



<p>Here they are.</p>



<h3 id="h-battle-royale">Battle Royale</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Let’s get that controversial one out of the way right off the bat. I think Firestorm was a fantastic addition to Battlefield 5 but it was underappreciated and poorly utilised. It dropped in May 2019, just months after Respawn Entertainment released Apex Legends and around a year before Call of Duty Warzone hit the market.</p>



<p>It was a tough time for the competition in the battle royale space, but Firestorm had potential – and guess who developed it? Criterion Games, in conjunction with EA’s DICE. Both of these studios are working on the next Battlefield game, and the rumours are that Battlefield 6 <strong>will feature </strong>a battle royale.</p>







<h3 id="h-destruction-mechanics">Destruction Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 5’s destruction mechanics were monumental, and through artillery, missiles, bombs, tanks, planes, and everything else in between, users could raze the entire map to the ground. Entire villages would fall under the weight of devastating explosions, tanks could crawl through buildings, and even now, the sound of a V2 bomb buzzing over fills me with impending dread.</p>



<p>There was a huge backstep in Battlefield 2042 that stripped almost every ounce of destruction from the game. It was a defining feature of the Battlefield franchise, and it was last done best in Battlefield 5. From what we saw in the first pre-alpha trailer for Battlefield 6, the game <strong>will feature </strong>intense destruction mechanics.</p>



<h3 id="h-con-struction-mechanics"><em>Con</em>struction Mechanics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s a fantastic ability written almost into the background of Battlefield 5, and it allows players to whip out a toolbox and start building defences around their objectives. It’s a neat little feature that adds extra immersion to an already immersive title, and it allows players to get a little more strategic when defending a flag or a building.</p>



<p>It’s a basic thing – players can click or hold a button to lay down sandbags, dig trenches, reinforce windows, set up tank traps, or roll out walls of razor wire. It can turn a simple farmhouse into a well-defended objective in just a few minutes, and I believe that if expanded upon, it could be a fantastic returning feature in Battlefield 6.</p>







<h3 id="h-multi-dimensional-campaign">Multi-Dimensional Campaign</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Battlefield 5 was the last game in the series to have a core campaign, which was built around the typical model – various theatres of war around the world during a major conflict. Battlefield 5’s campaign was cinematic and emotional, and it revealed some of the more ‘secret stories’ of the Second World War, much like Battlefield 1 exposed subtones present in World War I. </p>



<p>When Battlefield 2042 debuted without a campaign, many millions of players believed the game was nursing a gigantic hole front and centre. It has been promised that Battlefield 6 will have a solid campaign like the one of days gone by, but the proof will be in the pudding.</p>







<h3 id="h-another-realistic-theatre-of-war">Another Realistic Theatre of War</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It wasn’t just the campaign that was gritty and raw – it was the entire war itself. From map to map, players experienced the brutality and totality of the Second World War, travelling from Africa to France and from Norway to Japan. In Battlefield 2042, the lack of ‘realism’ was an issue, as up until that point, Battlefield had more or less become synonymous with the realistic portrayal of war.</p>



<p>With the introduction of robot dogs, fantastical wing suits, instant zip-lines, and all manner of futuristic technology, Battlefield 2042 – for a while – didn’t feel like Battlefield at all. If Battlefield 6 is going to succeed, I’d like to suggest that it’ll be because it’s rooted in realism, whether that be modern combat or another revisiting of an older conflict.</p>



<p>The early trailer released to showcase pre-alpha gameplay of Battlefield 6 led us to believe that it’ll be set in a present-day theatre of war, which is good.</p>







<h3 id="h-squads-soldiers-and-platoons">Squads, Soldiers, and Platoons</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Battlefield 5 was much better for the player who <strong>loved </strong>Battlefield. It allowed them to form ‘Platoons’, it encouraged better squad-based play and saw players fill leadership roles, and it didn’t need to rely on Specialists (all with unique abilities, like a ‘hero shooter’) to fill out the ranks.</p>



<p>Many of these elements didn’t port over to Battlefield 2042, and it felt for a while like EA had stripped the community aspects from the series.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I Wish Games Still Had Interesting Companion Apps]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wish-games-still-had-companion-apps/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-wish-games-still-had-interesting-companion-apps.1104405/</guid>

<p>I had a burst of nostalgia the other day. I was playing Dying Light to celebrate the game’s 10th anniversary and my mind flicked back to when the game was fresh on the market. One of my fondest memories of Dying Light is the game’s super helpful <strong>companion app</strong>, which allowed users to send scouts on virtual missions, which they’d claim rewards for later when they played the base game.</p>



<p>It had a few more features besides that, and it was a neat way to stay connected, still experience Dying Light’s universe on the go, and earn rewards without touching the game itself. It was discontinued a couple of years ago, but playing Dying Light got me thinking about the best companion apps for games that have long since disappeared.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-beyond-the-numbers">Beyond The Numbers</h2>



<p>I’m not just talking about <strong>stat trackers</strong>, by the way – they’re a dime a dozen. Everything from League of Legends to World of Warcraft, and from EA FC to Destiny has a companion app, most of which is focused on tracking events, managing minor inventory mechanics, accessing account information, and sending messages in-game.</p>



<p>I miss when the best companion apps felt like games themselves – miniature versions of a top-tier title that would allow you to truly stay connected long after you’d logged off.</p>



<p>Dying Light’s companion app was a perfect example of this.</p>



<p>Players could utilise the app to run missions, arrange scouts to travel to the most dangerous parts of the game’s world, and progress through a chain of missions with progressively better rewards. They’d need to make sure they were picking the right runner for the job, and the rewards they scavenged could be collected later in the game.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light had a brilliant companion app</figcaption></figure>







<p>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag had a similar mechanic.</p>



<p>The companion app for Black Flag was stellar, allowing users to control a full-fledged fleet of ships, sending them around the world on a multitude of missions. It was discontinued in 2015, but while it was online, it offered another angle to experience the pirating adventures found at the heart of this monumental Assassin’s Creed title.</p>



<p>It was inherently linked to the game, too. As you played Black Flag and added ships to your fleet, you could command those ships in real time through the companion app. Then, you could log into the game later on and reap the rewards of those missions.</p>



<p>GTA 5’s ‘iFruit’ app was also quite good. It featured mini-games that the player could use to train Chop, an in-game dog that belonged to Franklin Clinton, one of the game’s protagonists. It was entertaining enough, featuring three basic games and some additional features like car customisation and a stat tracker.</p>



<p>Sadly, it was discontinued in 2022, almost a decade after it surfaced alongside GTA 5. Will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> have another version, considering it’s very social media-heavy?</p>



<h2 id="h-run-of-the-mill">Run of the Mill</h2>



<p>Most games that have a companion app typically offer a no-frills experience that might feature a codex, an interactive map, or some kind of news feed mechanic. The best example of this is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-has-set-another-new-all-time-peak-record-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, which features just that. The map is nice enough, but it’s the most common thing for companion apps to feature.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Function over form, that’s for sure</figcaption></figure>







<p>How about if Red Dead Online had a companion app through which you could send bandits or buddies on missions while you were offline, allowing them to gather resources and cash for you to use when you next played? I mean, RDO is another microtransaction-packed game, so it’s unlikely that would happen – Rockstar wants you to purchase those gold bars.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, some companion apps without engaging features like this are still plenty helpful. There’s a nice <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape from Tarkov</a> companion app <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/treestn-tarkov_companion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Overwolf</a> with interactive maps, quest trackers, and guides for weapon presets and information on the latest updates. In a game that’s as complex as Tarkov, that’s a <strong>very welcome </strong>addition.</p>



<p>But imagine if you could use a companion app to ‘automatically’ run ‘Scav’ raids, having a timer count down at the end of which you’d see the loot secured by a Scav – if they were successful. It’d be a spin-wheel mechanic that would have a different result every time, and I could see Battlestate Games charging for ‘extra Scavs’, but I think it’d be a hit.</p>



<p>Nobody likes running Scavs <strong>really</strong>, so if you confine them to a companion app, allowing players to run them while in a regular PMC raid, everyone is happy.</p>



<p>I don’t know if I’m being hit with nostalgia or if there’s a genuine demand out there for better, more immersive companion apps.</p>



<p>It’s probably just me…</p>



<p>Let me know if there’s a particular app you enjoy using on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
