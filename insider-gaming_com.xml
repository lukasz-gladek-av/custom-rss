<p>XDefiant is preparing for the ultimate wind-down ahead of its inevitable closure in just a few months. It was recently confirmed by Ubisoft that XDefiant will be taken offline on June 3, 2025, but before then, the team has pushed out one final patch that includes a staggering amount of content.</p>



<p>Per the <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1869382398929965418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> and confirmed by Mark Rubin on Twitter, the season three update for XDefiant includes additional content from <strong>the next five seasons</strong>, which will otherwise never see the light of day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-a-farewell">What a Farewell</h2>



<p>In the post on Twitter, Mark Rubin explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft has not only allowed a small team to stay on and continue working to get our Season 3 content out the door, but we’ve also been able to add some extra content to this release from future seasons. </p>



<p>So, we have our Season 3 content plus some of the content from Season 4, 5, 6,7 and even Season 8. </p>



<p>We are adding 3 new factions this patch with the Assassin’s of course that was planned for Season 3 but also Wolves and Omega Force from Seasons 4 and 5 respectively.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Along with the new factions come six new ‘Arena’ maps and three new ‘Linear’ maps that were planned to be released further down the line. That’s a total of 13 new maps – but if you’ve never downloaded XDefiant, you’ll not be able to access them, which makes them somewhat rare.</p>



<p>This includes a new ‘Rayman map’ that was scheduled for a takeover event midway through season four.</p>



<p>Also, season three marks the arrival of a more esports-focused mode: Defuse. This is the traditional one-life bomb mode that serves as the foundation for games like Rainbow Six Siege and Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<p>Those still playing will also have access to ‘Lum Hunt’, ‘Tilt’, ‘Turbo XD’, and a vs-bots mode</p>



<p>This is all in addition to new weapons such as the G36K, M1A, and Diceros pistol. Everything that was added behind battle passes has been unlocked for the audience still able to access the game.</p>



<p>It’s one hell of an update, but it’s a farewell patch at best for XDefiant.</p>

<p>It has been claimed by Maksym Krippa, the owner of GSC Game World, that discussions are underway with Netflix regarding a TV adaptation of STALKER, the survival-based FPS franchise. Last month, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl was released to a mixed reception, but it was recently revealed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-profitable-one-month-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has already become profitable at GSC</a>.</p>



<p>Within just two days, Heart of Chornobyl had sold a million copies, despite being listed on day one on both PC and Xbox Game Pass. It would be the latest in a long line of games to get the television adaptation treatment, following in the footsteps of shows like The Last of Us and Fallout.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-never-say-never">Never Say Never</h2>



<p>Maksym Krippa, the enigmatic multi-millionaire owner of GSC Game World – and other entities like Natus Vincere – has admitted that the company is looking at a TV adaptation of STALKER with Netflix. In an interview with <a href="https://forbes.ua/news/gsc-game-prodali-dostatnyu-kilkist-kopiy-stalker-2-shchob-vivesti-proekt-u-pributok-investor-krippa-18122024-25653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes Ukraine</a>, the entrepreneur explained that he’d ‘love to see’ STALKER appear on screen through an alternate medium.</p>



<p>While nothing has been finalised, it likely wouldn’t take much for Netflix to hop on board with the idea.</p>



<p>In recent months and years, shows like Riot Games’ Arcane, Amazon’s Fallout, and HBO’s The Last of Us have skyrocketed up the charts, pulling in millions of viewers. With how successful STALKER 2 has been since dropping last month, it stands to reason that a well-made show set in the lore-rich universe of the game could do quite well.</p>
