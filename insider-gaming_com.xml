<p>Nintendo has finally acknowledged the slew of Nintendo Switch 2 leaks that have been hitting the internet.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s acknowledgment came following this week’s CES event in Las Vegas, where accessory manufacturer Genki revealed Nintendo’s Switch 2 models. Genki has revealed since the leaks that the images were created based on leaked information and not on seeing Switch 2.</p>



<p>However, the leaks have seemingly struck a nerve with Nintendo, who have acknowledged them in a rare occurrence. Speaking with Japanese website <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sankei</a>, Nintendo said that “these images and videos are not official.”</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2, however, has quickly become one of the biggest open secrets in the entire industry, with almost everything to do with the console, including accessories, logos, specifications, and more leaking online.</p>



<p>As for when Nintendo will reveal the Nintendo Switch 2, it remains to be seen, but the sheer amount of leaks surrounding the console should indicate that it will be sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>Regardless of its reveal and impending release, Nintendo will be hoping that the Switch’s successor is as successful as the original, which has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 146 million units</a> at the time of writing.</p>



<p>In comparison to other Nintendo consoles, the Wii U has sold 13.56 million units, the Wii has sold 101.63 million units, the DS with 154.02 million, the Game Boy Advance has sold 81.51 million units, the Game Boy has sold 118.69 million units, the GameCube sold 21.74 million units, Nintendo 64 sold 32.93 million units, the SNES sold 49.10 million units and the NES sold 61.91 million units.</p>



<p>What do you think about all of the information surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donnie Yen has taken to an interview with Polygon to confirm that the Sleeping Dogs movie that was announced in 2017 is officially dead in the water. Sleeping Dogs was released in 2012 as a spiritual successor to the True Crime games, and it allowed players to explore an open-world rendition of Hong Kong.</p>



<p>The game was universally praised and highly enjoyable, scoring great reviews before being ultimately overshadowed by GTA 5 just one year later. In the recent interview, Donnie Yen, who was set to star as protagonist Wei Shen, confirmed that it’s ‘an unfortunate thing’ that the project has failed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sleeping-dogs-lie">Sleeping Dogs Lie</h2>



<p>In the interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Donnie Yen explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights.</p>



<p>I waited for years. Years. And I really want to do it. I have all these visions in my head, and unfortunately… I don’t know, you know how Hollywood goes, right? I spent many, many years on it. It was an unfortunate thing.</p>



<p>Well, on to better things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since being ‘announced’ in 2017, almost nothing was mentioned about the live-action adaptation of Sleeping Dogs. It comes as a surprise that it was canned, and it’s likely someone, somewhere is kicking themselves. Right now, live-action representations of video games are going like gangbusters, soaring up the charts and winning awards worldwide.</p>



<p>The likes of Fallout and The Last of Us are testaments to that fact.</p>



<p>When the news dropped that Donnie Yen would be serving as the frontman in Sleeping Dogs, fans everywhere were slightly confused. After all, Wei Shen was originally played by Will Yun Lee, who served as the voice, face, and motion capture artist for the character – and Lee is also a renowned actor.</p>



<p>Regardless of those creative decisions, the Sleeping Dogs movie will never see the light of day.</p>

<p>It has been confirmed that The Last of Us Part II Remastered, scheduled to be released on PC in April, will require a PSN account to function, despite having no online features. This follows the trend established by many PlayStation-centric games that found their way to PC platforms in the last year or so, but it doesn’t make it any less irritating for players.</p>



<p>This disruptive inclusion means that The Last of Us Part II on PC won’t launch in the several countries where the PlayStation Network doesn’t operate, which is one of the chief issues at play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-backlash-continued">Backlash Continued</h2>



<p>Last year, a sudden change brought this requirement into the Helldivers 2 universe, with players being prompted to link a PSN account to continue playing the game. It caused a monumental downfall for the game, with tens of thousands of negative reviews being cast against the title.</p>



<p>That situation was rectified, but Sony would go on to make it a base requirement for further ports, such as God of War Ragnarok and Horizon: Forbidden West.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> discovered the requirement after wishlists went live. The Last of Us Part II Remastered will hit PC platforms – such as Steam and Epic Games Stores – on April 3. Instead of a Last of Us Part III, players are once again being forced to satisfy themselves with the iterations that have been re-released so many times over the years.</p>



<p>The game will arrive just as the second season of the popular HBO live-action adaption is set to drop. It was recently confirmed – along with a new trailer – that The Last of Us season two will hit screens worldwide in April. While a date wasn’t stressed, it’s expected to coincide with the PC release of The Last of Us Part II.</p>



<p>Tactics.</p>

<p>Recently, a job listing surfaced for a ‘Project Senior Producer’ in Los Angeles, working at a new PlayStation studio in Los Angeles. In the listing, it’s explained that the office is part of a ‘newly established AAA studio based in Los Angeles, driven by a team of seasoned industry leaders’.</p>



<p>It’s expected that this is Jason Blundell’s studio, the legendary developer who departed Deviation Games in September 2022. It was mentioned in December 2023 that Blundell was set to lead a PlayStation studio, and later rumours suggested that he would be partnering with Bungie to produce a new action game in a sci-fi universe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rumours-galore">Rumours Galore</h2>



<p>In the job listing discovered on the PlayStation site and shared by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-has-a-new-studio-in-los-angeles-working-on-a-new-ip.1078485/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">users on Restera</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are a newly established AAA studio based in Los Angeles, driven by a team of seasoned industry leaders and experienced game developers. </p>



<p>Our mission is to create the next groundbreaking AAA original IP while reimagining the development process with a lean and highly efficient approach.&nbsp;We’re&nbsp;seeking talented individuals who share our vision and are eager to join us on this journey.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5413216004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The listing</a> is all business and doesn’t mention anything to identify the game, nor does it confirm the name of the studio or who is leading it, but the strongest possibility is that it’s Jason Blundell’s studio.</p>



<p>Blundell boasts a stunning career that saw him march through high-profile roles at Treyarch during Call of Duty’s peak. He was instrumental in the success and popularity of the franchise’s Zombies ecosystem, but in February 2020, he departed the company to found Deviation Games.</p>



<p>Deviation would later be shut down before it could ship a single game.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-linkedin-ex-deviation-games-employees-set-up-a-new-studio-with-sony-led-by-jason-blundel-new-ip.868227/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rumoured a while ago</a> that former Deviation Games employees would be funnelled into a new Sony-backed studio with Jason Blundell at the helm, and this could be that claim brought to fruition.</p>

<p>It was just announced that HITMAN: World of Assassination has passed a unique threshold, securing 75 million players worldwide in just under a decade. In the words of IO Interactive, this has increased ‘its status as the most successful Hitman game of all time’. </p>



<p>In December 2024 alone, one million active players were recorded assuming control of Agent 47 and hunting down all manner of targets across a range of maps, missions, and modes. On December 12, Jean-Claude Van Damme was added to HITMAN: World of Assassination as a new and challenging elusive target.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-numbers">Huge Numbers</h2>



<p>HITMAN: World of Assassination is a live-service title firmly rooted in the universe that debuted way back in 2000 with Hitman: Codename 47.</p>



<p>This decades-old franchise has maintained a solid following over the years, transitioning through the various gaming generations and touching everything from mobile to VR. It’s an industry staple and features an instantly recognisable protagonist and concept.</p>



<p>In a recent press release, IO Interactive explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Since its release, HITMAN World of Assassination has continued to introduce a vast array of live content, including new locations, contracts, seasonal events, and collaborations, expanding HITMAN’s narrative. </p>



<p>With 1 million active players in December 2024, HITMAN World of Assassination remains as popular as ever thanks to its constant additions and a dedicated community. With more content planned to come to HITMAN World of Assassination in 2025, players can continue to look forward to more and more hours of HITMAN to enjoy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The report explained just how challenging the most recent update was, which is an element that most Hitman fans appreciate. In their attempt to hunt down Jean-Claude Van Damme’s character, only 40% of players have been successful, and it took one player a whopping seven hours to complete the mission.</p>



<p>Have you managed to eliminate the latest elusive target? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p>HITMAN: World of Assassination is available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>The Astralis organization holds the record for the most Major wins as an organization with four.

<p>Peter “dupreeh” Rasmussen has won the most Majors as an individual with five, having won four with Astralis and one with Vitality. Dupreeh is tied with Dan “apEX” Madesclaire and Finn “karrigan” Andersen in total Major appearances with 19. However, dupreeh has the sole distinction of having attended all 19 of the CS:GO Majors.</p>
