<p>Virtus.pro was just forcefully ejected from the Shanghai Major by Wildcard, the esports organisation co-owned by Amouranth. In a crushing defeat, Virtus.pro failed to gain traction against the underdog side that is also facing elimination. </p>



<p>It was a particularly sour loss for Virtus.pro, given that the team is made up of champion-grade players but failed to secure a meaningful win during the opening stage of the Shanghai Major.</p>

<h2 id="h-poor-show">Poor Show</h2>



<p>Virtus.pro will be heading home with just $10,000 in winnings, which won’t go a long way towards covering the costs of getting to Shanghai in the first place. It was a struggle from start to finish for Virtus.pro, with the team managing to secure just one win – and that was against Rare Atom, a bottom-table Chinese side with short legs in the game.</p>



<p>Rare Atom’s biggest claim to fame in this event is that the team sent Fnatic packing. The European organisation lost against Wildcard, Cloud9, and finally Rare Item, failing to secure a single point before being ejected from the tournament.</p>



<p>Virus.pro is the latest team to leave the competition in Shanghai, and the team is facing some ridicule on social media because the ultimate loss came at the hands of Wildcard, a team co-owned by Amouranth, the scandalous, controversial content creator. In June, Amouranth secured a significant ownership stake in the North American organisation.</p>



<p>The remaining matches in the opening stage of the Shanghai Major will wrap tomorrow, and then from December 5, the elimination stage will unravel. This round features some of the biggest names in CS2 esports, and it will end with just eight teams making it into the playoff stage, fighting for the $500,000 grand prize.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Season 1</a> is about to get a fresh mid-season update filled with new content. As with every major update for the free-to-play battle royale, the update will not only bring new weapons and events, but players can also expect huge buffs and nerfs to shuffle the meta.</p>



<p>The update comes during the Holiday season, so if you’re looking to dive into Warzone over the Christmas period, here’s when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1-reloaded-release-date-new-guns-codmas-event-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 Reloaded update</a> is expected to drop.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-release-date">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded release date</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-new-weapons-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">New weapons in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-ranked-play-arrives-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">Ranked Play arrives in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-expected-content">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded expected content</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-release-date">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded release date</h2>



<p>The Warzone Season 1 Reloaded update will arrive on <strong>December 5, 2024</strong>, at around <strong>10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT</strong>.</p>



<p>Although it has not yet been confirmed, we are confident in this date as Treyarch announced that the new Zombies map for Black Ops 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle des Morts</a>, would arrive on December 5. In the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Citadelle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, this new map was confirmed to be released with the mid-season update, so we expect it to coincide with the official Season 1 Reloaded patch.</p>

<h2 id="h-new-weapons-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">New weapons in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</h2>



<ul>
<li>Maelstrom</li>



<li>AMR Mod 4</li>



<li>Cleaver</li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-maelstorm-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maelstrom</a> is a new Shotgun arriving in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded, while the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-amr-mod-4-sniper-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMR Mod 4</a> is a semi-automatic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-quickscoping-sniper-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Rifle</a> that packs a mean punch. Players will also be able to get the Cleaver, a new Melee Weapon. </p>



<p>All three of these weapons will be available via an event, similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-power-drill-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Power Drill</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-sirin-9mm-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirin 9mm</a>. We don’t yet know what this event is, but considering the update is arriving in the Holiday season, perhaps it will be Christmas-themed. </p>



<p>We’ll have to wait and see exactly how players unlock these new weapons when the event rolls around in Season 1 Reloaded.</p>

<h2 id="h-ranked-play-arrives-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">Ranked Play arrives in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</h2>



<p>As promised by the devs, <strong>Ranked Play will return in Warzone with the Season 1 Reloaded update</strong>. It was removed after the Black Ops 6 integration in Season 1, but the devs are reintroducing it at the halfway point of the season.</p>



<p>The Ranked Play format will likely be very similar to what it was prior to the BO6 integration. Just like in multiplayer, players will earn Ranked Points by playing well and placing high. You will climb up Skill Divisions and earn exclusive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-ranked-play-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Play rewards</a> depending on the level you reach – Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson, Iridescent, and Top 250.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 players have been enjoying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-ranked-play-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Play in multiplayer</a>, but it’s time for battle royale players to have their own competitive fun.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-expected-content">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded expected content</h2>



<ul>
<li>New guns</li>



<li>New events</li>



<li>Ranked Play</li>



<li>Buffs and nerfs</li>
</ul>



<p>On top of new guns, events, and Ranked Play, we also expect Warzone Season 1 Reloaded to bring some hefty buffs and nerfs for the game’s weapons and equipment. Major updates often bring meta-shifting balance changes, but we won’t receive the official patch notes detailing these tweaks until closer to the update.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 30th Anniversary celebration is continuing with a fun little feature that will certainly scratch the nostalgia itch. For a limited time, PlayStation 5 (PS5) users can change various parts of the system’s startup from a selection of themes.</p>



<p>Options include the console’s bootup options, sound effects, background colors, and general look. There is a theme for the first four PlayStation consoles to choose from.</p>



<p>You can check out the examples below of the looks below:</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-classic-themes-for-ps5">How To Get The Classic Themes For PS5</h2>



<p>If you want to check them out for yourself, simple follow these steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Go to your PlayStation 5 Settings</li>



<li>Choose <strong>“PlayStation 30th Anniversary”</strong></li>



<li>Under <strong>“Appearance and Sound”</strong> choose which option you’d like: 30th Anniversary, PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, or PlayStation 4.</li>
</ul>



<p>And that’s it. There’s no mention of how long this feature will be available for players, so take advantage of it now if you want to enjoy some of PlayStation’s past in a different way.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that, no matter which you pick, the base bootup sequence animation will be the original PlayStation’s. You can check that out below.</p>
