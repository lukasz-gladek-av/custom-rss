<p>Intel is preparing to reveal its next generation of graphics cards, and it looks like some early specs have been leaked thanks to a, now removed, store listing.</p>



<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gxp8e0/amazon_has_leaked_a_few_intel_arc_b580_gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">accidently listed</a>, then removed, what appeared to be two Intel Battlemage GPUs from ASRock. According to the store listing, the Intel Arc B580 features 12GB of GDDR6 memory with a speed of 19Gbps. The card also features a 192-bit memory bus which would result in a 456 GB/s or so bandwidth.</p>







<p>A couple interesting bits from the listing were the cards being PCIe x8 only as opposed to x16. Regarding boost frequency, the listing suggested a 2.8 GHz boost frequency compared to a 2.0 GHz from the Arc A580.</p>



<p>When reached for comment in the past, Intel has declined to comment on any rumor or speculation. That said, a store listing adds credence to rumors that an announcement of their new graphics cards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was set to come in December</a>.</p>
