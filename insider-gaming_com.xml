<p>A third season of Peacock’s Twisted Metal, based on the PlayStation racing series, has been announced. However, the renewal does come with the news of a change in showrunners.</p>







<p>Debuting in 2023, Twisted Metal loosely adapts the games from the early PlayStation era. Featuring fan-favorite characters like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sweet-tooth-is-a-violent-man-in-twisted-metal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sweet Tooth</a>, the show was a surprise success for Peacock. It helped that the show sported massive talent like Captain America’s Anthony Mackie and Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s Stephanie Beatriz. A second season was quickly greenlit and released earlier this year to decent reviews. Now, Peacock has revealed that the action show is coming back for another season, but not without some creative changes.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Variety first covered the news that Twisted Metal is being <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/twisted-metal-renewed-season-3-david-reed-showrunner-1236584674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">renewed for a third season</a>. Apparently, the second season was a hit for Peacock, being the second returning original scripted season with 993 million minutes watched. However, it isn’t without changes, as show creator and showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith is exiting. The Cobra Kai creator’s reasons for leaving has not been discussed. In his stead, writer and director David Reed will join current showrunners Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. No other details, like casting or release, is available.</p>



<p>David’s resume is quite a good one, from a glance. His most notable project is as a writer for Prime Video’s The Boys, which is releasing its final season in 2026. Other titles he has worked on include Star Trek: Strange New Worlds and Supernatural, among others. While Michael Jonathan Smith’s departure is a sad one, Reed does seem like a great substitute. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Epic Games Store Now Allows Gifting]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/epic-games-store-gifting/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Just in time for the holidays, the Epic Games Store is now allowing gifting on the storefront. The feature has been a highly requested addition from fans and couldn’t come at a better time.</p>







<p>Epic Games Store is a fairly new service, only launching in 2018. As a competitor to Steam, the storefront houses many popular releases like Battlefield 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-maps-quests-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, and Epic Games’ own Fortnite. However, one factor that Steam had over Epic Games Store was gifting. On Steam, you can gift a code or a copy of a game to another user. Despite a large game selection, the Epic Games Store had yet to implement the system. Now, the joy of gifting has arrived and right before the Holiday season.</p>



<h2 id="h-gifting-now-available-to-users-on-epic-games-store">Gifting Now Available to Users on Epic Games Store</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gift games like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 on Epic Games Store!</figcaption></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/gifting-now-available-on-egs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> on the Epic Games Store, the company revealed that gifting has been added to the storefront. To do the process, pick a game you want to buy for someone and choose “Buy as a Gift”. From there, choose who you’ll gift the game to from your Epic friends list, and you can pick to schedule it or do it ASAP, then purchase. From there, the recipient has two weeks to accept the game. If not or rejected, you’ll get a refund. </p>



<p>The gifting service extends to paid games (including certain editions), add-ons, and bundles. However, in-game currency, subscriptions, free games, and pre-purchase offers are not allowed. A more step-by-step guide can be found <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/features/gifting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<p>Now, you can surprise your friends with new games without any hassle. While it seems like something that should’ve been there since the start, it couldn’t have come at a better time of the year. Plus, with so many great games in 2025 like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you can gift the best of the best to friends and finally convince them to play it. </p>







<p>Are you happy to see gifting come to the Epic Games Store? Will you be gifting games to your friends? What games? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>
