<p>Marvel Rivals is out <strong>tomorrow</strong>, and it’s set to introduce a cultural shift in the hero shooter space, challenging the dominant position held by Overwatch 2 and snatching the attention away from Deadlock. Recently, the team at NetEase have been discussing how the game will work, revealing more characters and mechanics, further stoking the hype train.</p>



<p>One tidbit of information about how the game’s battle pass is going to work turned heads more than anything else, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-more-fomo">No More FOMO</h2>



<p>Typically, live-service games have seasonal battle passes that expire at the end of a given window, and thereafter, you’re prevented from unlocking any content you’ve missed and you’ll need to move on to the next season.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals is <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20241205/40954_1198123.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">going to challenge that</a> typical behaviour with a new mechanic: timeless battle passes.</p>



<p>When you purchase the ‘Luxury Battle Pass’, which is the paid version of the free battle pass, you’ll unlock the ability to redeem awards in said pass event after the season has ended. If you don’t dedicate enough time to the game to unlock the rewards in one season, they’ll roll over into the next, but you’ll be free to <strong>also </strong>move on to the next season if you desire.</p>



<p>That means that you won’t miss out on unlocking something <strong>far </strong>into the Luxury Battle Pass in Marvel Rivals just because you might not have the time to grind for it.</p>



<p>Not only that, but NetEase has recognised that the first season (or pre-season) of Marvel Rivals is going to be a shorter one, so they’ve reduced the price of the Luxury Battle Pass by 50% at launch.</p>



<p>Other developers have had their ways of addressing this ‘missing out’ issue. For instance, Bethesda Game Studios often offers ‘catch-up’ bundles in the Fallout 76 store, giving users the ability to catch up on missed rewards, but that comes with a hefty cost.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a good tactic that other developers should mirror? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/crimsix-optic-return-five-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crimsix-has-returned-to-optic-after-five-years-away.1052505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/crimsix-optic-return-five-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter has returned home, gravitating back to OpTic Gaming after a five-year hiatus. His Call of Duty career ended in 2022, and since then, he has become a successful racecar driver and iRacing creator. Following his departure from OpTic Gaming in 2019, Crimsix floated with a couple of organisations in the Call of Duty League but ultimately retired in September 2022.</p>



<p>In a seven-minute video posted on social media, OpTic welcomed back Crimsix, explaining why it’s such a natural decision to make all these years later.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-where-he-belongs">Back Where He Belongs</h2>



<p>Crimsix is part of the Call of Duty ‘dynasty’ represented by Scump, FormaL, Karma, and of course, the man himself. He’s the winningest Call of Duty player in the business, and his profile and abilities helped to spearhead the growth of the COD esports scene.</p>



<p>In 2022, he officially retired from Call of Duty and spun off into something completely different: racecars. Those who know Porter recognise his love for cars, and in the video posted by OpTic, he revealed that most of his income was spent in some way on cars, whether it be buying, maintaining, or upgrading them.</p>



<p>Speaking in <a href="https://x.com/OpTic/status/1864461424904302688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the video uploaded on Twitter</a>, OpTic’s CEO, Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s back to normal. Throughout the years, we’ve always kept in touch, he’s of my favourite players of all time, what he did for OpTic – it put us in a position to win every time.</p>



<p>I’ll always be appreciative of the time he spent here, so it was only right that when the time came for him to come back, after years of butting heads with FormaL, butting heads with Scump… </p>



<p>Bringing him back as we are is inevitable, he’s part of the family and he’ll always be part of the family.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Crimsix has been streaming plenty of Black Ops 6 during his downtime, and many have stressed that the former pro player still has the thumbs needed to win big, prompting plenty of long-time fans to demand his return to Call of Duty esports.</p>



<p>That’s not going to happen, though – but he does have a place back under the OpTic umbrella, and that’s worth celebrating.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see Crimsix back in OpTic? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-path-of-exile-2-free-to-play.1052391/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If Path of Exile 2 is free to play, then not only does it follow in the footsteps of the original ARPG, but it also shows the community’s willingness and trust in supporting the eagerly awaited follow-up. Making PoE 2 free would be a huge decision, so let’s dissect Grinding Gear Games’ strategy.</p>



<p>Free to play has become the norm over the last decade. I remember PS4’s Warframe being free to play, and I couldn’t wrap my head around the decision to make a AAA title free. Now, everyone’s doing it, and it’s because the business model is highly sustainable—<em>sometimes</em>. </p>



<p>Path of Exile 1 was released in 2013, it was free to play, and it worked like a charm. Now, in 2024, it’s sequel time, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-path-of-exile-2-pre-download-guide-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Path of Exile 2</a>‘s free-to-play status is one of the biggest questions.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play">Will Path of Exile 2 be Free to Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Keep your money to yourself. Credit to Grinding Gear Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Path of Exile 2 is free to play</strong>, and like its predecessor, requires no money to play, and its main way of generating income is through <strong>optional microtransactions</strong>.</p>



<p>After years of supporting the first game, the developer decided it was time for a sequel. The acclaim and adulation PoE received meant it was entirely feasible for Grinding Gear Games to make PoE 2 a pay-to-play adventure. </p>



<p>Path of Exile continually gained in popularity after its release, and <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/238960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a> shows PoE has barely dipped below 10,000 players a day on Steam since Jan. 2017. The numbers have regularly dipped into the 60K and 70K region—achieving <strong>76,501 concurrent players in Aug. 2024</strong>!</p>



<p>The developer clearly trusts the PoE community, so this is presumably why Path of Exile 2 is once again free to play. If you do intend to support PoE 2, various Supporter Packs are available to buy with the cheapest one offering 300 Points and an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a> Key. </p>



<p>Conversely, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3349430/Path_of_Exile_2__King_of_the_Faridun_Supporter_Pack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">King of the Faridun Supporter Pack</a> includes the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>1000 Points.</li>



<li>A Hideout</li>



<li>A Portal Effect</li>



<li>Early Access to Path of Exile 2</li>



<li>Level-up Effect</li>



<li>Three Pets</li>



<li>Three Weapon Skins</li>



<li>Two Armour Sets</li>



<li>Two Back Attachments</li>



<li>Two Badges</li>



<li>Two Forum Titles</li>



<li>Two Hideout Decorations</li>



<li>Two Portrait Frames</li>
</ul>



<p>Path of Exile 2’s future doesn’t necessarily hinge on selling extras, but this surely goes a long way to helping its stability. I’ve no idea how PoE 2 is going to perform compared to the classic before it, but it’s going to be interesting to find out.</p>

<p>More Mortal Kombat insiders have corroborated last week’s claims that Mortal Kombat 1 future DLC has been cancelled.</p>



<p><span>Rumors began to swirl at the end of November when FateUnknown, a known Mortal Kombat 1 leaker, posted on Reddit that the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">future DLC for Mortal Kombat 1 had been cancelled </a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to poor expansion sales.</a> </p>



<p>Subsequently, two other Mortal Kombat insiders have since come forward to corroborate the rumor. One such insider is X user (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/thethiny/status/1704677366629310953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@thethiny</a>, who said, “The final insider has reached out and said that she also heard that there’s no more content after Terminator with a possibility of finishing what they originally had lined up since last year. Her KP3 list was also different. I have officially no hope left.”</p>



<p>KP3 refers to Kombat Pack 3, the next DLC to be released for the game. </p>



<p>As always, Ed Boon has refused to comment on the rumors, but Insider Gaming has contacted NetherRealm Studios for comment on the claims.</p>



<p>As previously pointed out by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mortalkombatleaks/comments/1h0c1lo/comment/lz2xyr9/?share_id=xUcvJ-sw8qJXVkTAM75be&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FateUnknown</a>, characters from Kombat Pack 2, such as Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2, are still to join the roster.</p>
