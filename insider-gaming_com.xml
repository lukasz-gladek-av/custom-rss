<p>It becomes apparent early on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and difficulty go hand in hand. I wouldn’t say it’s “Souls” levels of difficulty, but it’s easy to be caught out in KC2. If you’re reading this, you know what I mean, and I’m here to see if you can stop seeing the game over screen as regularly.</p>



<p>2018’s Kingdom Come Deliverance became a fan-favorite for its setting, characters, and immersive gameplay. Its mechanics included a lot of realism-based actions: Needing to hydrate, the necessity of eating and sleeping, and the punishing nature of its combat. KC wasn’t easy, and despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling 8 million copies</a>, the brutal nature of its combat wasn’t for everyone.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> has improved in almost every way. But one noticeable area that feels the same is the rugged and tough gameplay battle encounters. This is why players are already questioning if difficulty settings exist in KC2.</p>

<p><strong>I can confirm you can’t change the difficulty settings in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. It uses a default difficulty setting designed to accommodate all players—meaning you might struggle in moments.</strong></p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 hasn’t budged in the difficulty settings department (kind of, but more later) and you need to adapt. You learn early on you need to take the RPG seriously. If you don’t stock up on Bandages, you bleed to death. If you carry an assortment of rancid meat for days on end, you have no food, and you starve to death.</p>



<p>Additionally, you will die <em>repeatedly </em>if you don’t adhere to the nuances of KC2’s combat mechanics. Even I find it easy to become overwhelmed by a fight, and I end up mashing the main attack button. You know what happens? You already know it.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Oh good. Credit to “Kingdom Come: Deliverance II – Roadmap Trailer | PS5 Games” Trailer on YouTube</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is getting a Hardcore Mode as post-launch content.</strong></p>



<p>The forthcoming gameplay addition was announced during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DMCj5dtJLs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Roadmap Trailer</a> announcement. Along with a bunch of new content coming after KC2’s debut—including a Barber feature, Horse Racing, and new Quests—the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> includes Hardcore Mode.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios hasn’t confirmed what Hardcore Mode entails, but history tells us KC2 is about to become a lot tougher. If I use Bethesda’s Fallout series as a classic example, the franchise’s Hardcore Mode typically makes healing and all status conditions recover a lot slower, items weigh more, and fast travel affects player status too.</p>



<p>There are so many avenues the developer can go with KC2’s Hardcore Mode. The one thing I’m confident about is if you playthrough Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on Hardcore Mode, you’re going to have a heck of a challenge on your hands.</p>



<p>We don’t know when it’s coming yet, but stay tuned for updates on the Hardcore Mode content patch.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/metaverse-misadventure/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta%E2%80%99s-cto-says-the-metaverse-could-be-a-%E2%80%98legendary-misadventure%E2%80%99-as-total-loss-exceeds-60-billion.1100643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/metaverse-misadventure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new report has released an internal memo from META’s CTO saying that 2025 could be a make-or-break year for the Metaverse.</p>



<p>The memo, which was obtained by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-cto-metaverse-reality-labs-legendary-misadventure-memo-2025-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Business Insider</a> reportedly originates from November 2024, where META’s CTO, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth told staff that 2025 is its “most critical” year for the Metaverse.</p>



<p>In the memo Bosworth said, “”We need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR [Metaverse],” he said. </p>



<p>He continued, “And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance. If you don’t feel the weight of history on you then you aren’t paying attention. “This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.”</p>



<p>As reported by Business Insider, Meta’s Reality Labs reported a record $1.08 billion in revenue in Q4, however, it also had its biggest-ever quarterly loss of $4.97 billion. At the time of writing, the Meta Reality Labs division had accumulated a loss of $60 billion since 2020.</p>



<p>To put things into perspective, the <strong>ENTIRE</strong> US video game industry spent $58.7 billion on games and hardware in 2024, a 1% decrease from 2023.</p>



<p>The full memo to employee’s reads:</p>



<p><strong><em>2025: The Year of Greatness</em></strong></p>



<p><em>Next year is going to be the most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs. We have the best portfolio of products we’ve ever had in market and are pushing our advantage by launching half a dozen more AI powered wearables. We need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR. And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance. If you don’t feel the weight of history on you then you aren’t paying attention. This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.</em></p>



<p><em>I’ve been re-reading “Insanely Great,” Steven Levy’s history of the Macintosh computer. If you haven’t read it the book chronicles the incredible efforts of individuals working in teams of 1-3 to build a device that more than any other marked the consumer era of personal computing. What I find most fascinating about it is the way that even people who left the program on bad terms (it was not particularly well managed) speak about the work they did there with an immense sense of pride. There was a widespread cultural expectation, set by none other than a young Steve Jobs, that the work needed to be “insanely great.”</em></p>



<p><em>On paper 2024 was our most successful year to date but we aren’t sitting around celebrating because know it isn’t enough. We haven’t actually made a dent in the world yet. The prize for good work is the opportunity to do great work.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Greatness is our opportunity.&nbsp;</strong>We live in an incredible time of technological achievement and have placed ourselves at the center of it with our investments.&nbsp;There is a very good chance most of us will never get a chance like this again.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Greatness is a choice.</strong>&nbsp;Many people have been at the precipice of opportunity and failed to achieve. For the most part they failed to even challenge themselves.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>You should be doing the best work of your career right now.</strong>&nbsp;You should be pushing yourself to grow where needed and doubling down on your strengths. When you look back on this time I want you to feel like you did everything in your power to make the most of it.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>You don’t need big teams to do great work.&nbsp;</strong>In fact, it may make it harder. One trend I’ve observed the last couple of years is that our smaller teams often go faster and achieve better results than our more generously funded teams. Not only that, they are much happier! In small teams there is no risk of falling into bad habits like design by committee. You should be so focused on results that being in a bunch of docs or meetings is too frustrating to bear.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>The path is clear.&nbsp;</strong>You don’t need to come up with a bunch of new ideas to do this great work. Most people in the organization just need to execute on the work laid out before them to succeed. It is about operational excellence. It is about master craftsmanship. It is about filling our products with “Give A Damn”.&nbsp;This is about having pride in our work.</em></p>



<p><em>I will close with an Arnold Glasow quote: “Success isn’t a result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire.” 2025 is the year. Let’s be on fire.</em></p>



<p>What do you think of the Metaverse? Do you think it can succeed with a $60 billion loss? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>&nbsp;if you have any success.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-faze-gta-6-rp-crypto-server/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Grand Theft Auto’s RP scene is what has kept GTA 5 so popular for all these years. If you venture onto Twitch, you’ll often see that Grand Theft Auto 5 sits at the top of the charts at any given time, and that’s because of the success of ‘GTA RP’. These servers offer a more immersive experience, allowing players to have jobs, join gangs, and generally live out virtual lives on modded servers.</p>



<p>Big streamers have enjoyed the amount of viewers they’ve accrued while exploring the GTA RP world. Now, one of the most prolific creators of them all, Adin Ross, has joined forces with FaZe Banks, and the pair plan to create a GTA 6 RP server backed by cryptocurrency, which players will be able to ‘earn’ as they play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-probably-not">But Probably Not</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, Adin Ross and FaZe Banks outlined their GTA 6 RP vision, expressing their desire to create a server linked with a token or two that you can use to earn money while you play GTA 6 online.</p>



<p>Adin Ross explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When GTA 6 drops, me and Rick here are going to make the biggest server together. We’re going to do the best s*** ever and I promise you, it’s going to be completely crypto — everything pro-crypto about it.</p>



<p>It’s going to change the game because GTA 6 – I promise you guys – they already bought FiveM, it’s going to be all RP.</p>



<p>I’ll have the best and biggest server, I promise you I will.</p>



<p>We’re going to put a lot of money into it.</p>



<p>This is my passion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Currently, Rockstar Games supports the modding and RP communities that exist at the heart of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. However, the gaming titan <strong>does not </strong>allow cryptocurrencies to be integrated in any way with the slew of GTA RP servers out there. This will be a huge sticking point for Adin Ross and FaZe Banks’ plans.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Adin ross announces GTA 6 news</span></p></article></div>







<p>Historically, ventures linking games with the blockchain, NFTs, or cryptocurrencies have fallen flat on their faces. Ubisoft tried to set up an NFT marketplace tied to Ghost Recon, and it didn’t work at all. Recently, Midnight Society, the developer behind the NFT-backed DEADROP, announced a studio shutdown.</p>



<p>The most dedicated GTA RP players live out virtual lives on the platform. They’ll hold down a job, earn in-game cash, buy and customise houses, meet up with their friends, and even accept punishment from the police when they commit crimes. All of this is done in a world populated by other players.</p>



<p>It’ll be a big seller when GTA 6 is released, but if the track record represents anything, it’s that a solid RP ecosystem won’t exist until a few years after GTA 6 has hit the open market.</p>
