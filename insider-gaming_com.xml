            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on LinkedIn, the current creative director for Rainbow Six Siege, Alex Karpazis, revealed he’s stepping down from the role after the Six Invitational wraps later this month. He indicated that Josh Mills, a ten-year veteran of Ubisoft, will be filling his shoes as creative director going forward.</p>



<p>Last year, Karpazis dished on the future of Rainbow Six Siege as ‘Siege X’, the next generation of the popular tactical shooter, arrived. In 2024, he theorized that the game had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-director-siege-last-forever/">the potential to ‘last forever.’</a></p>







<h2 id="h-big-changes-at-rainbow-six-siege">Big Changes at Rainbow Six Siege</h2>



<p>Ubisoft has put a lot of stock in Rainbow Six Siege over the last few years. It’s one of the company’s flagship shooters, and it has enjoyed a ten-year stint in the sun, growing as Ubisoft’s most important esports title and one of the most valuable games in the industry.</p>



<p>Last year, it underwent an overhaul, taking on the form of ‘Siege X’ and staring down the barrel at some immense evolutions.</p>



<p>Now, in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7424497469817790464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on LinkedIn</a>, Alex Karpazis has revealed he’s pulling away from the series, stepping down from his role of creative director:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Siege is about to embark on Year 11 after celebrating a historic milestone with the 10th anniversary. I am excited to share with you what the team has been working on at the 2026 Six Invitationals this February and I also want to share with you that this Invitational will be my last as the Creative Director of Siege.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then named his replacement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is with great excitement to announce that Joshua Mills will be taking over as the new Creative Director on Siege! Joshua and I have worked together for many years. Not only is he a great friend, but he has proven himself to be a strong leader and a champion of Siege values. We have been working on this transition of responsibilities for over a year, and I am confident he will lead this game to even greater heights.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Karpazis didn’t indicate what he’s going to do next, and it’s not known yet if he’s leaving Ubisoft entirely.</p>



<p>Joshua Mills is a solid replacement for Karpazis. Last year, during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-y10s1-reveal-prep-phase/">reveal of Y10S1</a> of Rainbow Six Siege, Mills presented the future of the franchise on stage, alongside Karpazis, and got visibly emotional about all the team had accomplished with the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Union Reps Call For CEO Yves Guillemot’s Resignation]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-union-ceo-yves-guillemot-resignation/</link>
            <guid>1424326</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Two union representatives are calling for the resignation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> CEO Yves Guillemot.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling share prices</a> to game cancellations to a complete restructuring of the company, Ubisoft has found itself in a precarious situation when it comes to its future. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-union-representatives-call-for-resignation-of-ceo-yves-guillemot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Marc Rutschlé and Chakib Mataoui spoke about Ubisoft’s struggles and where the company can go from here.</p>







<p>In short, it starts at the top where a change has to be made.</p>



<p><strong>“It’s his company, at the end of the day,”</strong> Rutschlé said while adding that Guillemot has surrounded himself with “yes men”. <strong>“That was also the issue during the sexual [harassment] scandal in 2020.”</strong></p>



<p>Mataoui then spoke about about Guillemot <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-and-tencent-co-ceos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making his son, Charlie,</a> co-CEO of Vantage Studios. Mataoui believes that the lack of any diversity at the top is what’s keeping the company from making successful games.</p>



<p><strong>“If you just put your white male friends in [those jobs], then you don’t promote any diversity or get any new opinions or ideas,”</strong> Mataoui said. <strong>“We are in a creative job. We need new ideas to come in to [help us] make great new games. But we don’t have that. We don’t have this mindset for creativity.”&nbsp;</strong></p>







<p>Mataoui says it’s a matter of trust within the company. Right now, he says, they don’t trust those in charge to right the ship.</p>



<p>A lot of that, according to the pair, stems from how the company handled the allegations against it in 2020 and beyond. They say that they created <strong>“a workplace where abusers could thrive.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“I think Guillemot should move away at this point,”</strong> Rutschlé said. <strong>“I think the level of hate people have for him [means] he should move on. Then, we could build some sort of trust again.”</strong></p>



<p>Employees at Ubisoft have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-vote-to-strike-against-recent-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already voted to strike</a> against the proposed layoffs at the company. From February 10-12, the France-based unions along with their international counterparts plan to strike.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Fallout 3 Remastered Out Now? Shadowdrop Rumors Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-fallout-3-remastered-out-now-shadowdrop-rumors-explained/</link>
            <guid>1424323</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 3 Remastered is one of the most talked-about topics in the gaming space, and it has been ever since it first surfaced as a rumored release <strong>years ago</strong>. Bethesda Game Studios has kept a tight lid on things, and despite some insider claims and circulating whispers, <strong>almost nothing concrete </strong>has ever been confirmed about the game.</p>



<p>But several topics have emerged recently in the space that have us pondering when will Fallout 3 Remastered be released. It feels like it’s on the horizon, and as the release date of the <strong>final episode </strong>of Fallout’s second season drops, fans everywhere are anticipating a Fallout 3 Remastered shadowdrop.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-fallout-3-remastered-coming-out">When is Fallout 3 Remastered Coming Out?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, Fallout 3 Remastered <strong>did not </strong>have a release date, but one of the biggest points of debate regarding its seemingly inevitable arrival was drawing to a close.</p>



<p>On the Prime Video website, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-3-remake-not-linked-to-mysterious-countdown/">a countdown has been running</a> for weeks, and while it seems to point to the <strong>end </strong>of the second season of the popular post-apocalyptic television series, many have theorized that it’s actually counting down to the <strong>Fallout 3 Remastered shadowdrop</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s mostly conjecture, but then out came VIRTUOS, a studio that specializes in remasters, to stir the pot:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Welcome back to the Wasteland, vault dwellers! The finale of the second season of Fallout has arrived on Prime Video – catch it today, 3 February 2026 at 6pm PT/ 9pm ET.</p><p>Our team worked on environment art, creating photorealistic landscapes that viewers will encounter throughout… <a href="https://t.co/FHQW4Jxkhr">pic.twitter.com/FHQW4Jxkhr</a></p></div>— Virtuos (@virtuosgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/virtuosgames/status/2018683026184806813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>VIRTUOS worked on the Fallout show in some capacity, but the team is also known for the delivery of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which dropped early in 2025 and received global praise.</p>



<p>For now, it’s another arrow in the quiver of those claiming the Fallout 3 Remastered release is drawing extremely close.</p>



<p>Watch this space, because when that countdown expires, we’ll have more to share… Hopefully.</p>
