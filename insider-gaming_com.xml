<p>Research tasks are back with a vengeance in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, with Mable dishing out challenges to complete to improve your level and gain some exclusive rewards, and we’ve got a full list available to you.</p>



<p>While Legends: Arceus had you collecting data for the first Pokédex to be built, Legends: Z-A sees Mable researching why a large influx of wild Pokémon have made their way to Lumiose City, and she recruits your assistance to help her achieve her goals.</p>



<p>Mable’s Research in Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the only way to get your hands on extremely beneficial rewards, so it’s worth keeping a close eye on the requests.</p>

<p><strong>Mable’s Research provides a heap of rewards in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A, including a large variety of powerful TMs and Experience Candy to help level-up your party.</strong></p>



<p>Many of the rewards are required for exploration, like Rock Smash for removing boulders obstructing your path, while others serve as game-changing additions in battle with the ability to one-shot opponents or deal huge amounts of damage.</p>



<p>A full list of the rewards available and the required level are shown in the table below.</p>

<p><strong>Your level in Mable’s Research is completed by completing Research Requests issued by Mable, which unlock through story progression.</strong></p>



<p>Initial challenges include registering a set number of species of Pokémon in your Pokédex, catching Pokémon of a specific type, and winning battles. Completing these requests grants Points, which tally together to increase your rank.</p>



<p>Later down the line, however, more Points are required to increase your level, and the Research Requests will become harder to accomplish, thus serving as long-term goals to complete even after the main story of Legends: Z-A is boxed off.</p>

<p>Master Chief’s voice actor has stated that ‘big news’ is going to arrive during the Halo World Championships, scheduled for October 24. </p>



<p>Several new developments about Halo have surfaced recently. We recently saw a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-studios-veteran-leaves-company-with-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">17-year veteran leave the company</a> with an ominous message. We also saw reports that the Halo CE Remake is being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-developed by a Virtuos Studio</a>. Now, teasers about the Halo World Championship have surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-some-big-news-arriving-at-the-halo-world-championships-in-seattle">Some Big News Arriving at the Halo World Championships in Seattle</h2>



<p>Through a new post on <a href="https://x.com/SteveDownes117/status/1978153135890702578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Master Chief voice actor Steve Downes teased an announcement for Halo World Championships. He first informed fans that he will be present at the Halo World Championships in Seattle, which is scheduled for October 24 and 25. The juicy part came towards the end of the tweet, where Downes teased “PS: BIG NEWS A’COMIN!!” with eye ball emojis. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We already know that a Halo has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-studios-new-deep-dive-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive scheduled for October 24</a>, as announced on the Halo World Championship blog. We still do not know the timing of this main-stage event, but its live stream has been confirmed. The developers stated earlier that their new entry will be revealed this year —so is that what Steve Downes is teasing, or is it something even bigger? Players will have to wait and see to know for sure. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release is one month away, and the game’s Steam presence is building up energy as the date comes ever closer. It was revealed earlier today by Battlestate Games that Escape from Tarkov now has over 500,000 wishlist spots on Steam, which brings the game one step closer to hitting a successful launch window on the platform.</p>



<p>It marks the first time in history that the core Escape from Tarkov experience will be available on a platform <strong>outside </strong>Battlestate Games’ proprietary launcher and storefront. The post from BSG also confirmed that you can now link your Battlestate Games account to your Steam profile.</p>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-is-coming-to-steam-soon">Tarkov is Coming to Steam Soon</h2>



<p>It comes as no surprise to learn that Escape from Tarkov has managed to hit 500,000+ wishlists just a couple of weeks after going live on Steam. For a decade, it has been a spearhead extraction shooter that has risen to popularity and sat at the top of the table since 2020.</p>



<p>That’s when the game experienced a boom, attracting hundreds of thousands of players and becoming a staple shooter ever since.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Battlestate Games confirmed that users will need to <strong>own a copy of the game on Steam </strong>to be able to play Tarkov on Steam. That means that if you’ve already purchased a copy of Escape from Tarkov from Battlestate Games, you <strong>won’t </strong>automatically qualify for a copy on Steam when it launches.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Get ready — the release is coming! Mark your calendars for November 15!</p><p>Over 500,000 players have already added Escape from Tarkov to their wishlist: <a href="https://t.co/SgITbg3eGM">https://t.co/SgITbg3eGM</a><br>Thank you for your trust and support!</p><p>You can now link your existing Battlestate Games account to your… <a href="https://t.co/IgzTMnPRLJ">pic.twitter.com/IgzTMnPRLJ</a></p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/1978418639540777244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Many are sceptical about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">impending 1.0 release</a> of Escape from Tarkov, as some feel that the game ‘isn’t 1.0 ready’. The version of the game being played now <strong>is not </strong>the version we’ll have when that time comes next month.</p>



<p>Further, there’s quite a bit of negativity surrounding the Steam launch, with naysayers claiming that Battlestate will suffer under the weight of refunds when people buy the game through Steam and lean on the platform’s lenient refund policy to kick it back to Battlestate. </p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov will be released in full on November 15. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re picking it up on Steam.</p>

<h2>How To Play Wordle</h2>



<p>Wordle is a simple but addictive word puzzle. Each day, players have to <strong>guess a five-letter word answer</strong> in no more than six attempts. After each guess:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Green letters</strong> are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a trending topic online. </p>



<p>Wordle can only be played on the New York Times website. There currently isn’t an app for you to download the official game.</p>

<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game tasks players with guessing a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 is the culmination of years of work from several studios flying the Electronic Arts banner. It was seen as a potential resurgence for the series after the lacklustre delivery of 2021’s Battlefield 2042 (and the divisive launch of Battlefield 5 in 2018).</p>



<p>In the run-up to the release of Battlefield 6, players had their expectations stoked by an immensely successful beta period, bolstered by the introduction of Battlefield Labs. The full game is finally in the open, and millions of players are diving head over heels into what is a mixed offering: a magnificent multiplayer platform marred by a pretty catastrophic campaign portion.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full Battlefield 6 review.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-dire-campaign-is-carried-by-the-multiplayer-modes">Battlefield 6’s Dire Campaign is Carried by the Multiplayer Modes</h2>



<p>I said many a time before the launch of Battlefield 6 that I was hugely excited to get my hands on the new campaign, given that Battlefield 2042 <strong>didn’t have one</strong>. I love a Battlefield campaign, as in the last decade, they’ve been focused on authentic replications of emotional battles, telling a story beyond the run-and-gun traditions of games like Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Sadly, that’s not what we received in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 campaign is hindered by poor storytelling, a predictable theme, shallow objectives, and a lack of any entertaining depth. It’s a simple thing that can be completed in a few hours, and even hunting for collectables adds almost nothing to the game’s meatiness – or <em>lack of</em>.</p>



<p>It plunges players into the action and doesn’t ever slow down, but the only redeeming feature of the campaign is that there’s plenty to shoot at. It’s a mundane, thoughtless thing that almost always has you pushing through an extremely linear area, gunning down endless sorties of enemies, while heading to a simple objective.</p>



<figure><figcaption>They’re no Bad Company, that’s for sure</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best part of the campaign is a single mission that gives players a semi-open environment to traverse, allowing them a little choice and spreading them further than the linear missions do.</p>



<p>And my <strong>word</strong>, those linear missions <strong>are linear. </strong>If you deviate from your path by a few inches, you’ll be given a timer prompt and ordered back into the fight.</p>



<p>I ultimately found the visuals to be a bit dated, the AI to not have much of a clue, and the gameplay loop seemed like an afterthought. Pick up weapons, gun down enemies, and move to objectives. That’s it.</p>



<p>Look at last year’s Call of Duty offering, Black Ops 6. In that, players had a variety of missions that presented them with sabotage, subterfuge, exploration, and multiple perspectives. The most diversity you get in Battlefield 6 is when you’re thrust into the command of a tank for all of about five minutes.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-battlefield-6-multiplayer-redeems-the-entire-project">The Battlefield 6 Multiplayer Redeems The Entire Project</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is back in the multiplayer aspect, that’s for sure. I strayed from Battlefield with the launch of 2042, opting instead to stick with older titles like Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 5. What has been presented in Battlefield 6 is something phenomenal, and I’m having <strong>a blast</strong>.</p>



<p>From the ground up, Battlefield 6’s multiplayer is a return to form for the series. It’s a cry back to bygone days of the ‘peak’ era represented by Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, and everything from the maps on offer to the spread of classic and new modes has me thoroughly entertained.</p>



<p>There are a few gripes, sure. The TTK feels out of balance, there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-glitches-exploits-ea-working-overtime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than a few glitches</a>, and levelling up weapons is <strong>a grind</strong>, which is why so many XP farms have popped up across Battlefield Portal. But even with all that being said, I’m still having a great time in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Most of my gameplay loop has seen me occupy my time in Breakthrough. I’m a veteran Rush player, and Breakthrough gives me the same vibes while also offering better area control, rather than sitting next to a single MCOM station. I can’t complain about the game’s mechanics, and I haven’t had too many issues with the maps (except for Sobek…).</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>I’m loving the open class system, which allows me to level up my weapons across whatever role I want to play. That’s how I play; I adjust to the scenario presented to me and adapt on the fly. If I’m playing as a support gunner and want to switch to an engineer role to tackle vehicles that have shown up, I should be able to keep grinding the same primary weapon – <strong>and I can</strong>.</p>



<p>Even though I no longer have the reflexes or gunny to dominate at Battlefield, I’m having fun in Battlefield 6. It’s a satisfying multiplayer platform that accommodates all kinds of play styles, and it’s highly customizable and considerate. I’ve also played and installed Battlefield 6 on the new ROG Xbox Ally X, and it runs like a dream on there, too.</p>



<p>The only thing I’ve not ventured into is Portal, because I’m led to believe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-farm-xp-level-up-fast-in-battlefield-6/">it’s jam-packed with XP farms</a>, and that’s not my kind of thing.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion-don-t-buy-battlefield-6-for-the-campaign">Conclusion: Don’t Buy Battlefield 6 For The Campaign</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 isn’t at all worth it for just the single-player offering, but the multiplayer is enough of a redemption that you should consider picking it up. There’s plenty of juice in the tank where the multiplayer platform is concerned, and Electronic Arts’ studios will keep it plugged full of content for a while. The first season starts before the month is out.</p>



<p>Also, the free-to-play battle royale component is incoming, so if you don’t appreciate either the multiplayer <strong>or </strong>the campaign, you can give that a go and enjoy Battlefield 6 from some perspective without worrying about spending a penny.</p>



<p>I’m more inclined to give Battlefield 6 a higher score when looking at the project holistically, as I feel that multiplayer should have much more weighting than the campaign in a series like this. As Battlefield 6 has a stellar multiplayer platform, I’ll be generous.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-4-5-great">Verdict: 4/5 – ‘Great’</h2>
