As of <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/market-stock/0NVL/ubisoft-entertainment-sa/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">closing in the UK</a>, Ubisoft was trading for €11.19 compared to the €12.15 it opened at.

<p>ASUS is teasing something big for its Republic of Gamers (ROG) lineup on social media. In a short video teaser posted on Monday afternoon, ASUS teased what’s next for the ROG Ally. And what’s next is expected to be the rumored ASUS Xbox handheld currently known as Project Kennan.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-launching-partner-gaming-handheld-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors</a> and reports, this device isn’t going to be the standalone Xbox handheld that Microsoft is actively working on. Instead, it’s going to be a third-party device that will include Xbox branding.</p>







<p>Specifics on what the device will be remain scarce, including exact details on how it will fit as an Xbox device. A recent report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-is-partnering-with-asus-for-upcoming-gaming-handheld-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Central</a> seemed to make it clear that the system won’t play Xbox games as it will be a “tried-and-true Windows PC in essence”. Instead, it will be act like the current ROG Ally while featuring an Xbox Guide button and “more prominent grips”.</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s also unknown if it will feature any other spec updates over the original ROG Ally or will be similar to the anticipated ROG Ally 2.</p>



<p>What do you think the ASUS-Xbox Handheld known as Project Kennan will include? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>Fighting mobs is fun, but we’re after The First Berserker Khazan’s bosses for the tense, multi-hour fights that leave you wanting to pummel your controller. We’ve rounded up every main boss fight in the game and can tell you how many there are.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-trophy-list-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is one of the hardest Soulslikes I’ve ever played. I’m not sure how Neople managed it, but they’ve put together a collection of unique, challenging, and rewarding boss fights. Very rarely are they unfair, either—a rarity, as when I die in a Souls game, I blame anyone but myself.</p>



<p>The boss fights in Khazan are fantastic. If you’re just starting or wondering how many are left, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-bosses-are-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">How Many Bosses Are in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This guy… Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 16 main bosses and a further 10 optional side bosses in The First Berserker Khazan.</strong></p>



<p>If you want to beat <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The First Berserker Khazan</a>, you need to overcome 16 boss fights. Encounters can have several phases, and enemies have a large moveset of attacks they inevitably cycle through.</p>



<p>I had the pain of fighting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-nerfs-hardest-bosses-in-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-patch Viper before it was nerfed</a>, and I can tell you I spent <em>over 2 hours</em> on this fight alone! Your mileage will vary depending on your ability, your patience, and how adept you are at studying and memorizing attacks.</p>



<p>Also, there are ways to make particular boss fights easier. <strong>The Aratra fight—for example—requires you to target the enemy’s weak points</strong> to inflict massive damage. If you coordinate your attack well enough, you can lop off its limbs simultaneously and bring yourself very close to the finishing line.</p>

<p>“Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end,” the article reads. “It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.</p>



<p>“These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition.”</p>



<p>The studio closed its statement saying that it was “committed to deliver” the projects it has currently in development.</p>



<p>Currently, Eidos-Montreal is supporting Playground Games on the Fable reboot that is scheduled to launch in 2026. The game’s delay into 2026 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recently announced</a> by Playground Games.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Embracer Group about the layoffs at Eidos-Montreal and whether the Fable delay had anything to do with the decision. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article.</p>

<p>Building on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-arcane-more-league-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the success of the Arcane series on Netflix</a>, Riot Games is reportedly considering a live-action project for its next series. The developers of League of Legends are also reportedly close to finalizing a shoot locations that will bring one of the game’s iconic regions to life.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-pirate-haven-of-bilgewater-be-brought-to-life-in-vietnam">Will the Pirate Haven of Bilgewater Be Brought to Life in Vietnam?</h2>



<p>According to a post from an official Vietnamese government Facebook account, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thongtinchinhphu/posts/pfbid027nU7FnBtEjTDbTviX5q83PDB2i1ojhCNd6otx6uf4bLoYmoM7cD9YyKbsR21LawTl?rdid=LoxCDuRbRi6vVDxk&amp;checkpoint_src=any#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot is planning to film</a> a nine episode television series based on League of Legends later this year. Riot is reportedly very interested in the Cát Bà Archipelago in northern Vietnam as a filming location, and could start shooting by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Among the Riot representatives that met with Vietnam’s Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism was Rose Lam, a long-time executive producer for shows like The Last of Us and Altered Carbon. According to Lam, Riot Studios surveyed many other countries in Asia including Japan, Korea, and Thailand, but found Vietnam to be the most suitable.</p>



<p>Earlier today, esports and gaming news outlet Sheep Esports <a href="https://www.sheepesports.com/en/articles/lol-rumors-of-a-live-action-series-set-to-begin-filming-in-2025/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speculated</a> that the “rugged cliffs, deep blue waters, and maritime atmosphere of Cát Bà” point toward a series that could be set in the <a href="https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/region/bilgewater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">region of Bilgewater</a>. In League of Legends’ lore, Bilgewater is a port city and pirate haven, home to several nautical or sea-faring in-game champions like Gangplank, Tahm Kench, and Miss Fortune, among others. The first two seasons of Arcane took place in the glittering, progressive city of Piltover and the dark, industrial undercity of Zaun.</p>



<p>The success of both Arcane and other live-action video game series has evidently Riot to motivation to pursue a live-action show of its own. Arcane received massive critical acclaim, especially in its first season, leading to numerous awards in the field of animation. In the past two years, two different live action shows based on games, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-best-adaptation-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout</a> and The Last of Us, have been met with critical acclaim and commercial success.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-don%E2%80%99t-have-4k-output.1150071/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-dont-have-4k-output/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is set to get its full reveal on April 2, and there are plenty of rumors and speculation about what the latest console from Nintendo will feature. One such rumor is that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support 4K resolution in some fashion. </p>



<p>Past rumors suggest that the Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support 4K when docked</a>. When in handheld, however, it will have a 1080p resolution.</p>



<p>Despite the claims of 4K support, however, there is some question as to whether that’s accurate based on what was said during the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco earlier this month.</p>



<p>“I heard this from one developer at GDC and also heard it separately in an email but the dev kits, or some of the dev kits, don’t have a 4K output,” Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLUrxzSPZhU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-will-nintendo-switch-2-support-4k">Will Nintendo Switch 2 Support 4K?</h2>



<p>It should be emphasized that the lack of 4K output on a dev kit doesn’t automatically mean that the system won’t support it. Console development kits don’t often fully match the specs of the final system. For example, some dev kits could offer more memory to allow for better debugging and leave out features that don’t impact testing too much like, in this instance, a 4K output.</p>



<p>Sticking on the topic of dev kits, to follow up on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prior Insider Gaming report</a> on developers expecting them in June, it was clarified that it’s likely that some of the major third-party developers have them already. It’s the smaller studios that are still waiting on them to come in.</p>

<p>Jagex has officially revealed its new game in the RuneScape franchise called RuneScape: Dragonwilds. The game, set in the same universe as the traditional RuneScape titles is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to release</a> in early access this spring.</p>



<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds takes place on the continent of Ashenfall where up to four players work together to build camps, improve skills, and work to survive a land where “dragons have awoken”.</p>



<p>“Journey through the vast, vibrant regions of Ashenfall and unveil the ruins of forgotten civilisations to discover why&nbsp;wild, transformative magic&nbsp;spills from its fractured lands,” the game’s description reads. “Explode ore veins with a snap of your fingers. Conjure a spectral axe to chop down a line of trees in an instant. The Anima-rich landscape of Ashenfall offers you a power unlike any other.”</p>



<p>There will also be various quests to complete while level up your skills and even wield the runes the series is known for.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The continent itself will be made up of two regions with give biomes. Players of the franchise will be able to recognize various creatures from the series, however they will look a bit different due to the magic of Ashenfall. Some will be fused with thorns or other plant elements. </p>



<p>Ahead of the game’s early access release later this spring, Jagex will be holding a deep-dive for players on April 15 at Noon ET/9am PT. Though not confirmed, it’s expected that an early access release date will be announced at, our around, the deep dive event.</p>
