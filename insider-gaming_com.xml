<p>Xbox Game Pass will remove 9 games from their library on February 28, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-games-leaving-xbox-game-pass-in-february-nbsp">Games Leaving Xbox Game Pass in February&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Xbox recently revealed February’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wave 2</a> Game Pass titles, including the Day 1 game Avowed, Watch Dogs Legion, F1 22, and more. The same announcement indicated that 9 games will be removed from the subscription service at the end of February. The list includes the likes of F1 22, Warhammer 40,000: Bolton, Yakuza 3 Remastered, Yakuza 4 Remastered and more. Here is the complete list of the 9 games leaving Game Pass in February:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>F1 22 (Console and PC) EA Play</li>



<li>Gris (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Maneater (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>PAW Patrol World (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Space Engineers (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Wo Long Fallen Dynasty (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Yakuza 3 Remastered (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>



<li>Yakuza 4 Remastered (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you missed out on any of them or have been eyeing any of these games for some time, then this might be your last chance to try them out. Ten days are plenty of time for a decent play-through, but many might end up playing Obsidian’s new action RPG, Avowed, during this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another small patch for VALORANT has been deployed, with patch 10.03 giving the minimap a visual upgrade and updating the effect of slow abilities. The smaller patch size is due to the soon-to-start <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-masters-bangkok-2025-teams-schedule-prize-pool-where-to-watch/">Masters Bangkok event</a>, and the patch will deploy a day later than usual due to a Riot holiday.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-valorant-10-03-patch-notes">Full VALORANT 10.03 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>The slowing abilities of Chamber, Skye, and Harbor will now slow dash abilities. Dash abilities include Jett’s Tailwind and Neon’s Slide. Previously, agents like Jett and Neon could dash at full speed even if they were caught by a slow, but now <strong>slowing abilities will slow a dash by 50 percent</strong>. These abilities now all slow dashes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chamber’s Trademark</li>



<li>Skye’s Trailblazer</li>



<li>Harbor’s Cascade and High Tide</li>



<li><a href="https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Status_Effect#Concuss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concussive</a> abilities:
<ul>
<li>Astra’s Nova Pulse</li>



<li>Breach’s Fault Line and Rolling Thunder</li>



<li>Cypher’s Trapwire</li>



<li>Deadlock’s Sonic Sensor</li>



<li>Gekko’s Wingman</li>



<li>Harbor’s Reckoning</li>



<li>Neon’s Relay Bolt</li>



<li>Tejo’s Special Delivery</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The minimap visuals have been updated, providing “increased gameplay clarity and fidelity.” The minimap now uses shading to clearly show elevated spots across the whole map, as well as ziplines.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-valorant-patch-10-03-bug-fixes">VALORANT Patch 10.03 Bug Fixes</h2>



<ul>
<li>Fixed issues where explosive damaging utility could kill sentinel trap abilities like Vyse’s Arc Rose from vastly outside its intended radius.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where you could not move/use the buy menu while the remake vote screen is displayed. This new voting widget also color corrects the confirmation button to be green and the decline button to be red.</li>



<li><strong>(Console):</strong> You can now add and edit friend notes for your Riot friends.
<ul>
<li>You can use the friends list search field to filter your friends list by player name or tag.</li>



<li>When you have more than four party invites, the friends list will now hide them so you can still see your friends. You can click ‘Show More’ to display any hidden invites.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>(Console): </strong>Fixed an issue where Remake-ended matches in Competitive queue would display incorrect end-of-game screens after the game.</li>



<li><strong>(Console): </strong>Fixed an issue where navigating players on the Leaderboard would sometimes highlight multiple players.</li>



<li><strong>(PC): </strong>Fixed an issue on the Premier tournament bracket screen where match score was occasionally displayed in black.</li>



<li><strong>PC: </strong>Fixed an issue where the Premier tournament bracket was not properly centered on some ultrawide displays.</li>
</ul>
