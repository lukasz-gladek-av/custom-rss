<p>Ubisoft has announced that it has appointed a group of “leading advisors” to assist with exploring company options moving forward. The news comes as part of a special strategic update provided by the company on Thursday.</p>



<p>“Following the strategic and execution reviews initiated by the Executive Committee a few months ago, Ubisoft is taking decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation,” the company said via press release shortly before the call took place.</p>



<p>During the call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that this group of advisors will “review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders.” He didn’t give details as to who these advisors are, but did say that things will be overseen by the independent members of the Board of Directors.</p>



<p>Guillemot says that he’s confident that this decision will “position Ubisoft for a stronger future” in the years to come, and that he’s confident there are “several potential paths” forward for the company.</p>







<p>As far as more information into what these paths are, Guillemot wouldn’t divulge. He was asked multiple times for more clarification, but said that he couldn’t say more and wouldn’t comment on “specific rumors” that were circulating. He reiterated, however, different options were being explored.</p>



<p>“We are limited in what we can say today,” he said while stating that the process has already been started with the advisors.</p>



<p>One of those potential paths is rumored to be a buyout by Chinese company Tencent. Guillemot was asked specifically about that possibility as well as the company being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-chinese-military-blacklist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added to a “Chinese Military Blacklist”</a> by the United States government. Guillemot, once again, declined to comment on either front.</p>



<p>The update regarding the state of the company comes as Ubisoft announced another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay for Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. Guilletmot said that the delay was part of the company’s “renewed focus on gameplay quality and engaging Day-1 experiences”.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Ubisoft as a company in 2025? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s release date brings with it bloodshed and battles. Warhorse Studio’s brand of historical warfare and realism has proven to be successful, so we’re here to take a look at Deliverance 2’s launch window and available platforms.</p>



<p>The first visit to Kingdom Come wasn’t overly loved by critics, but fans loved it. Its developer revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance has sold 8 million copies</a> and counting. The 2018 RPG made its mark, and then some. Now, the eagerly awaited sequel is preparing to unsheath its blade and plunge it deep into any who have the gall to come back for a second helping.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-playstation-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest releases coming in early 2025</a>, and is set to wrap up the events of the original.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-s-release-date">When is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An epic war is coming. Credit to Warhorse Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is scheduled to launch on February 4</strong>.</p>



<p>It was announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-one-week-earlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deliverance 2 would be released a week earlier</a> than planned, and it’s set to expand on almost everything that made the original so popular.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has been hard at work on the sequel since the first game dropped. The studio has grown from 11 people to over 250, and Deliverance 2 is what the company wanted the original to be like—from the words of creative director Daniel Vávra in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R48DEEjyS5k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s Official Game Reveal Trailer</a>.</p>



<p>There’s improved NPC behavior, better real-world interactions, an emphasis again on sleep and food, and new weapons are included such as crossbows and firearms.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-time">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is likely to be released at midnight worldwide</strong>—unless Warhorse Studios says otherwise.</p>



<p>Most games have a universal midnight release schedule for each region. Deliverance 2 doesn’t seem to be any different, so, for the time being, presume Delliverance 2 is releasing at midnight in your time zone. If you’re in New Zealand, you’re laughing, anywhere else, and you’re playing catch up!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-platforms">All Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s day-one launch platforms.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor (for now), Deliverance 2 is restricted purely to next-gen consoles and formats. 2018’s first entry has versions on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Amazon Luna, and Nintendo Switch. The final format on this list was a newcomer—only debuting on Jun. 10, 2021—which means Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 could opt for extra platforms in the future as well.</p>



<hr>



<p>We’ve already described the newest Kingdom Come as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Purest Evolution of a Stellar RPG” in our preview</a>. Do you think it can live up to the original? Or is it going to be a King without a Kingdom?</p>



<p>Keep up to date with everything Deliverance 2 including its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC specs</a> and how <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhorse-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-immersive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immersive</a> the sequel is shaping up to be. </p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been delayed yet again. Ubisoft announced on Thursday that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is being delayed from its February 14 release date to March 20.</p>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1877400048314528126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on social media</a>, Marc-Alexis Côté says that the game needs “additional weeks” to implement changes based on feedback received from players during testing.</p>



<p>“Since November, we’ve been thrilled to share our progress through Gameplay Overviews, and the overwhelming excitement has truly inspired us,” he said. “Each week has brought valuable feedback from our community. While we’ve already made remarkable strides, we believe a few additional weeks are needed to implement that feedback and ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience.”</p>



<p>He continued: “We remain committed to delivering a high-quality, immersive experience—fostered by ongoing dialogue between our players and development teams. We know you’re eager to learn more about Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and we’re excited to share that more updates will be coming your way very soon!”</p>







<p>On top of Côté’s statement, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said in a press release that the decision to delay the game again was “part of the renewed focus on gameplay quality and engaging Day-1 experiences.”</p>



<p>Côté also thanked the studio’s “incredible fans and dedicated teams” for their support after first delaying Shadows from November  2024 to February 2025 back in September. You can read his full statement below.</p>

<p>The upcoming open-world action RPG Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is releasing on PC after all. </p>



<p>After first being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-mobile-game-is-launching-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed for iOS and Android</a> at The Game Awards 2024, developer Netmarble has confirmed the game will launch on Windows. The confirmation came via an announcement for <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en/cbt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">closed beta signups</a> that added PC to the available platforms. </p>



<p>Alongside the beta announcement came a list of minimum PC specs that players need. those include an Intel Core i7-9700 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500 CPU, 8GB of memory, 30GB of storage space, Windows 10/11, and at least an Nvidia GeForce RTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT graphics card.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is almost here. Scheduled for release in less than two months, the game’s promotional campaign is in full swing.</p>



<p>Aware of the huge hype for the game, IGN brought the title to its <a href="https://youtu.be/yp-28fhhOs4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN First</a> panel. The show is dedicated to revealing new information about highly anticipated games. In the videos released today, they provided details of two monsters: Ajakaran and Rompopolo.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 9 Minutes of Ajarakan Oilwell Basin Gameplay (4K)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aX0wxnX6WDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to the videos, the two monsters reside in the Oilwell Basin area. A volcanic ecosystem full of caves, tar pits, oil lakes and large thermal vents that spew out smoke and other gases. The region is home to the Azuz Tribe. They use the region’s characteristics to produce energy and weapons. The region’s Apex monster is called the Black Flame, however, no further details about the monster have been revealed yet.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>As we can see in the videos above, the Ajarakan resembles a Flaming Gorilla with a carapace and the Rompopolo resembles a mosquito fused with a mantis. Both monsters are new to Wilds. According to the game’s Wiki, they are very territorial and often fight each other.</p>



<p>The Rompopolo usually buries its tail in mud and oil to cause gas explosions, while the Ajarakan is strong and agile, using its aggression to unleash flaming attacks.</p>



<p>Scheduled for release on February 28th, the next game in the franchise is one of the most anticipated games of 2025. It will come as no surprise if it ends up being nominated for the best game of the year. Judging by all the materials released so far, the game looks spectacular. Of course, we’ll have to see it in action next month!</p>
