<p>It was recently reported that China has enjoyed a record-high year for revenue in the games industry. In new data, it was highlighted that numbers swelled by more than 7.5% in 2024, hitting highs of $44.8 <strong>billion</strong>. This makes the Chinese video games market the second-largest domestic market on the planet.</p>



<p>Most of the growth is being attributed to Black Myth: Wukong, which set staggering sales records this year and was regarded as China’s first AAA game. The mythical title was released in August 2024 and remains popular today.</p>

<h2 id="h-boosted-figures">Boosted Figures</h2>



<p>While it’s not the largest year-on-year increase China has seen of late, the figures speak for themselves – China’s video games industry is <strong>soaring</strong>. In 2023, a post-COVID boom introduced 14% growth in revenue, and while this year’s increase rate has been slashed in half, the total value is much higher overall.</p>



<p>This news was reported by the ‘China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association’ in Beijing and was circulated <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3290626/chinas-video-gaming-revenue-hits-new-high-2024-back-blockbuster-releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by SCMP.com</a>.</p>



<p>In a statement, the Chinese organisation said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The scale of the domestic market has been steadily increasing, with new mobile titles and single-player titles making outstanding contributions. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>China is also enjoying a boom in mobile gaming, with the data showing that up to three-quarters of the overall revenue accrued through 2024 is attributed to mobile games. Black Myth: Wukong may have turned millions of heads both in China and overseas, but mobile games are still king in the country.</p>



<p>It was further reported that the number of active gamers in China also grew this year, and now more than 670 million individuals across the country are engaging in video games in some way.</p>

<p>Last week, I covered a rumour suggesting that Riot Games was preparing to make a major policy change. It was said that the gaming titan was about to allow VALORANT and League esports teams to accept betting companies as sponsors for the first time.</p>



<p>Riot Games has confirmed to Insider Gaming that this is the case. In 2025, partnered League of Legends esports teams and VALORANT Champions Tour teams in the Americas and EMEA <strong>will be allowed </strong>to explore such partnerships.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cultural-shift">Cultural Shift</h2>



<p>For the longest time, Riot Games has been against gambling sponsors in the esports scene it upholds. It has also been against cryptocurrency-based sponsors.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://x.com/RiotMagus/status/1868476361884774487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a> that was issued by Riot Games Esports’ COO, it has been made clear that things are about to change:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>A few weeks ago, we told partnered LoL Esports and VCT teams in Americas and EMEA that starting in 2025, they’ll be allowed to explore partnerships with Riot-approved betting platforms. This decision wasn’t made lightly—it’s the result of careful study and planning to settle on a move that will unlock new revenue opportunities for teams while also protecting competitive integrity and the overall fan experience.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Here are two important things to know:&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>1. Riot-owned channels will stay betting-free. No betting brands will appear on our broadcasts, socials, or jerseys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>2. Riot will vet all potential betting partners to meet our standards for integrity, transparency, and fan engagement. All sports books partnering with teams will need to meet local regulatory and licensing requirements and match Riot requirements around content and promotion for this category.</em></p>



<p><em>This is a new sponsorship category for our esports, and we’ll approach it thoughtfully. We’ll learn a lot along the way, and we’ll make changes if at any point this compromises the integrity of the sport or impacts the high-quality experience our fans have today. Depending on how this initial implementation goes, we’ll evaluate opportunities to expand—or refine—our approach in the future.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Naturally, this announcement garnered blowback from the fans of the competitive scenes who are vehemently against gambling.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that esports betting makes up around 50% of the industry’s global revenue, but that doesn’t mean everyone agrees with the notion of it.</p>



<p>What do you think about this policy change? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
