<p>The MultiVersus open beta feels like a distant memory and a complete shift from its full release. Warner Bros. and Player First Games had a bonafide winner on their hands; one with a ton of popularity, players, and potential. Fast forward to 2024, and its future is looking bleaker than being knocked off a map at 200% damage. </p>



<p>The prospect of Bugs Bunny and Superman taking on the duplicitous duo of Rick Sanchez and The Joker sounds ridiculous. But this is one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus</a>‘ shining qualities—making the ridiculous and impossible seem normal and tangible. Tom &amp; Jerry versus LeBron James, Jake the Dog squaring off with The Iron Giant, and the list goes on.</p>



<p>MultiVersus has an incredibly diverse roster of fighters, and I’d argue it’s as spectacular as any other in the genre. I sank many hours into the open beta, and I closely followed MultiVersus game director—Tony Hyunh—on X to see how he addressed feedback. I felt confident in the full game’s launch, but a string of questionable decisions and design choices have left the live-service title fighting for its life.</p>



<h2 id="h-an-open-beta-to-remember">An Open Beta to Remember</h2>

<p>July 26, 2022, is the day MultiVersus burst onto the scene. It launched its open beta / Early Access period to test the waters. It had a few characters available at launch, a season pass (more on this later), and a handful of modes. There wasn’t much, but it was enough. I can proudly say Bugs Bunny became my main very quickly—before the burrowing bunny became the meta. I had a blast yeeting enemies to the top of the map with Bugs’ bat, and kicking safes to send foes careening to oblivion.</p>



<p>The gameplay was outstanding, but one thing I noticed early on was <strong>how slow progress was</strong>. You needed a <em>lot </em>of Gold to unlock characters, and it felt very intentional. The Battle Pass was extremely grindy too, you could already smell the stink of microtransactions being pushed. Regardless, I enjoyed the MultiVersus beta, but the lack of content couldn’t be ignored as the months wore on. </p>



<p>Incredibly strong player count numbers were dwindling, and by early 2023, it was reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-player-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus lost 99% of its players</a>. On Mar. 27, 2023, MultiVersus ended its beta period. This annoyed many players who were now unable to access the characters and cosmetics they had paid for.</p>



<p>Overall, <strong>I’d say the open beta was actually a success</strong>, and it more than adequately showcased MultiVersus’ frantic and focused fighting mechanics. A Super Smash Bros. clone it may be, it was an extremely good one. Myself, and the community waited patiently until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-release-date-announced-for-may-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 28, 2024, for the full launch</a>. Giving Player First Games plenty of time to right the wrongs.</p>



<p>The day came, MultiVersus was back, but it was quickly evident there was only one agenda for Warner Bros.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-launch-to-forget">A Launch to Forget</h2>



<p>MultiVersus’ relaunch was met with scratching criticism toward its predatory microtransactions, lack of content, and the paywall nature of existing content. Apparently, both <strong>developer and publisher learned nothing from the open beta</strong>—ironic, as that’s what it’s for.</p>



<p>Using <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a> to extrapolate basic data, we can see how quickly support for MultiVersus dissipated. For the fighter’s full release, <strong>114, 515 players</strong> hopped back into MultiVersus to try it out. This doesn’t quite hit its all-time peak of <strong>153,433</strong>, but it was a great starting point. Unfortunately, numbers dropped off faster than the Flash going for a light jog. </p>



<p>Within two weeks, the daily count was already down to about <strong>20,000 players</strong>. By mid-July, MultiVersus could barely scrape together 5,000 players, and if we zoom to December, the figures reached as low as <strong>363 players in a single day</strong>. As of writing, MultiVersus is quite dead, and worse still, <strong>it could soon be literally dead</strong>. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/multiversus-might-be-in-big-trouble-and-that-bums-me-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vice</a> reported that Warner Bros. lost hundreds of millions in 2024—thanks to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and MultiVersus. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-updates-will-end-with-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suicide Squad’s content is wrapping up after one year</a>, and MultiVersus might not be far behind on the chopping block.</p>



<p>Player First Games is attempting to make late changes such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-makes-changes-to-how-players-unlock-fighters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changing how to unlock fighters</a>. This is presumably a desperate act to make MultiVersus more accessible and rely less on microtransactions. Only time will tell if it can bounce back, but one thing’s for sure, MultiVersus squandered its potential because of the allure of microtransactions, and companies need to learn to remember its players are the heartbeat of a game, not exploitable cash cows. </p>



<hr>



<p>Were you a hardened MultiVersus player sucked by the addictiveness of the beta? Are you sad to see what’s become of the once-promising fighter? I am and thought it had a chance of competing with Nintendo’s long-time franchise. Let me know what you’re thinking below.</p>

<p>FaZe Clan’s representatives have taken to social media to reveal a rebrand that includes giving the organisation a new logo for the first time in years. It’s not a <strong>huge </strong>change, but it’s a reworking of one of the most recognisable images in content creation and competitive gaming.</p>



<p>Along with the new logo is a fresh ‘FaZe Camo’, a new stylisation of the name, and a fresh colour palette.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-year-new-faze">New Year, New FaZe</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/FaZeClan/status/1874532461608411160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On social media</a>, the FaZe team posted a series of images uncovering the new organisation’s iconography, including a gaudy ‘distorted’ camouflage that will be applied to everything from company branding to merchandise:</p>



<figure><figcaption>This isn’t a glitch, that’s the camo print created by FaZe Clan</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a short video uploaded by FaZe Banks, the organisation’s CEO, the reasoning behind the overhaul was explained. He showcased a transparent, behind-the-scenes look at group chats established to discuss and plan the rebrand, highlighting why certain creative decisions were made.</p>



<p>To ring in the new year, the organisation, which has been through many tribulations of late, posted a video looking back on the recent history of the brand, stating: ‘New Year, New FaZe. Bigger Than Ever.’</p>



<div><article><p><span>New Year, New FaZe. Bigger Than Ever.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Beyond the rebrand, nothing else has been confirmed for 2025. There are high expectations for the organisation, which has taken some huge leaps forward in the last few months since the control of the company was handed back to the ‘OGs’ that founded it.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-transition-bug-fixed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/latest-escape-from-tarkov-update-fixes-%E2%80%98transition%E2%80%99-bug.1072407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-transition-bug-fixed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has rolled out a sudden update in Escape from Tarkov, patching a few issues in the game. One of the most major changes is a fix for the bug that was causing players to ‘transition’ between maps with enemy players, understandably causing quite a stressful situation upon loading into the next raid.</p>



<p>To answer the issue, BSG temporarily switched off transitions, blocking a few tasks and longer raids from taking place. Now, in a snapshot update, the team has fixed this issue – and a dozen others.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-free-to-move">Free to Move</h2>



<p>The ability to transition in Escape from Tarkov is a relatively new feature. It was added a few months back, and it allows players to jump between maps almost seamlessly, logically continuing their raid and pushing into a new environment to keep up the action. It’s the foundation for many of the game’s newest tasks, too.</p>



<p>When the latest wipe hit Tarkov, transitions went awry, with many players encountering a bug that saw them transition with enemy players. The moment they loaded in, all hell broke loose and they started gunning each other down, prompting Battlestate Games to lock the feature down.</p>



<p>In a recent post <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1874583477141536818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a>, the team at BSG confirmed that the following fix has been applied to Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed all known issues where players transitioning between locations could enter a raid with players outside their group</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, the following adjustments have been made:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player has been teleporting in place without being able to move in any direction on various locations</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where kills from Aklys Defence Velociraptor .300 Blackout did not count towards progress of Punisher. Part 2 quest</li>



<li>Reduced the sales limit for 7.62x51mm BCP FMJ rounds to 100 (120 for owners of The Unheard Edition) per restock</li>



<li>Harris “S-BRM 6-9” bipods moved to Skier LL2</li>



<li>BT10 V8 Atlas Bipods moved to Mechanic LL2</li>



<li>NVG-57E night vision device added to Prapor LL1</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for barter items in the pockets on Scavs and player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates and conditions for armour and armoured rigs on Scavs and player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for ammunition on player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for backpacks on Scavs.</li>
</ul>



<p>The changes have been coming thick and fast since Escape from Tarkov wiped just under a week ago. Many have attributed this cadence to the Unity engine upgrade performed by Battlestate Games alongside the global reset event.</p>

<p>With 2025 finally here, one big question is on everybody’s mind: is 2025 the year we finally get a GTA 6 release? Outside of the wild fan conspiracies we saw in 2024, it’s been relatively quiet for GTA 6 since its initial reveal in December 2023, with no official announcements from GTA developer Rockstar Games. It’s led to many rumours and rumblings that GTA 6 has already been internally delayed, with a delay announcement rumour to be coming soon.</p>



<p>The biggest and latest rumor of a delay came in September 2024, with the lack of official announcements seemingly making the rumor more valid. It eventually prompted Take-Two Interactive to squash the rumor in its Q2 earnings call in November 2024, which was the most significant amount of information we received since the game’s initial announcement. At least at the time of the earnings call, the publisher confirmed that the game was still to launch in Fall 2025.</p>



<p>At face value, Take-Two’s comments are reassuring, but history has told us that Rockstar Games tends to postpone its games, and it won’t be the first time that Take-Two has had to adjust its financial forecasts due to such a delay.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-history-of-delays">A History of Delays</h2>



<p>Rockstar Games’ last two major title releases, GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 saw significant delays from their initial announcement to their final release date.</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2, Rockstar Games’ latest major title saw two delays from its announcement trailer to its final release. Announced on October 18, 2016, the game was initially planned to be released in the second half of 2017 but eventually released on October 26, 2018, with Rockstar Games saying that the game needed additional development time for polish.</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 saw a delay, too. From its planned Spring 2013 launch, the game would eventually launch in September 2013. Although it was a small delay, Rockstar Games asserted that it was needed due to polish. In fact, it’s been a recurring theme for Rockstar Games in the past 15 years, with almost every one of Rockstar Games titles, from GTA 4 to the original Red Dead Redemption, seeing delays. While GTA 6 has yet to meet the same fate, it isn’t difficult to imagine that Rockstar Games will continue its trend, especially in the games industry’s current climate. </p>



<h2 id="h-take-two-s-packed-lineup-in-2025">Take-Two’s Packed Lineup in 2025</h2>



<p>It’s already been widely discussed, but another point to consider is Take-Two’s already-packed lineup for 2025, even without a GTA 6 release. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, Civilization 7, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-mafia-the-old-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and annual releases like NBA 2K and WWE 2K make 2025 arguably one of Take-Two’s most stacked years of all time, and that’s without what will be the biggest game release in the past decade.</p>



<p>So why is having its most stacked game release lineup ever an issue for Take-Two? Well, unfortunately, it boils down to revenue and investor expectations year-over-year. Investors expect continuous growth, and piling so many big releases into one year could be an eyebrow-raising decision for investors, especially if Take-Two’s 2026 lineup is on the weaker side of big game releases. Of course, we all know that Take-Two’s money-maker will be GTA Online for GTA 6, but if that will come on launch or not is currently unclear.</p>



<p>But from a purely financial point of view, would Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country sell millions more copies if GTA 6 is delayed into 2026? It’s a question that investors will likely be pondering. While a GTA 6 delay will undoubtedly cause Take-Two’s share price to fall by a few percent, Take-Two’s financial year will still be strong, and with the prospect of GTA 6 having a cemented release date, its share price will continue to rise.</p>



<p>Although I think that Take-Two will ultimately let Rockstar decide if more polish is needed, it’s certainly a point to be raised that this is, at its core, a business, and GTA 6 is going to make the company billions over the years to come. An additional six-month delay isn’t the end of the world for Take-Two, and if the extra polish is needed, well, I don’t mind waiting a bit longer, either.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance is the newest free game on the Epic Store. The medieval RPG can be redeemed between today and tomorrow at 13:00 BRT.</p>

</ul>



<p>As the second game will serve as a sequel to the story of Henry, the protagonist, having prior knowledge of the story and gameplay systems are key aspects to getting the most out of Warhorse’s new game.</p>



<p>Check out the plot for the first game:</p>



<p><em>“Thrust into a raging civil war, you watch helplessly as invaders storm your village and slaughter your family. Narrowly escaping the brutal attack, you grab your sword to fight back. Avenge the death of your parents and help repel the invading forces!”</em></p>



<p>The game is widely regarded as the perfect game for anyone who loves the Middle Age. Unlike traditional RPGs, Kingdom Come provides a more immersive experience that comes slightly closer to a simulator, even though it’s not one.</p>

<p>The PS Plus Essential games for January (2025) <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have been revealed</a> and, well, there was certainly a better way to start the year. The three games awarded to subscribers in the lowest tier are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</li>



<li>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered</li>



<li>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-the-games-from-ps-plus-essential-january-2025">The games from PS Plus Essential: January 2025</h2>



<p>The list certainly isn’t going to fill anyone’s eyes, after all, we’re talking about one of the biggest flops of 2024 and two old games. The games will be available starting January 7th.</p>



<h3 id="h-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ps5-nbsp"><strong>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League | PS5&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Take down The Justice League yourself in single-player or team up with friends in multiplayer co-op in this genre-defying, action-adventure third-person shooter from Rocksteady Studios, creators of the critically acclaimed Batman: Arkham series. Featuring an original narrative set within an expansive open-world city of Metropolis, the game puts the four DC Super-Villains on a collision course with an invading alien force and DC Super Heroes who are now laser-focused on destroying the city they once vowed to protect.</p>



<h3><strong>Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered | PS4&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Feel the thrill of the chase and the rush of escape in Need for Speed Hot Pursuit. Unleash a savage sense of speed both as an outlaw and a cop in the world’s hottest high-performance cars. Outsmart the heat or take down lawbreakers with the tactical weaponry at your disposal in a heart-pumping, socially competitive racing experience. Updated with enhanced visuals, cross-platform multiplayer – including the asynchronous competition powered by Autolog – plus all additional DLC content, this is the ultimate edition of Criterion Games’ critically acclaimed Need for Speed debut. It’s time to reignite the pursuit.</p>



<h3><strong>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is an expanded re-imagining of the critically acclaimed, award winning indie game The Stanley Parable from 2013. Everything that was in the original Stanley Parable is here, preserved just like it was back in 2013. But The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe also dramatically expands the world of the original game with new content, new choices, and new secrets to uncover. The labyrinth has just gotten bigger. In addition, the game has been visually upgraded to reflect modern technology while faithfully preserving the tone of the original game. Accessibility features have also been added to the game, including localization of in-world text, colorblind options, and content warnings. And just as before, the impeccable voicework of Kevan Brighting will accompany you every step of the way.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gray Zone Warfare Has Hit One Million Sales in Early Access]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-has-hit-one-million-sales-in-early-access.1072116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-early-access-one-million-sales/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Gray Zone Warfare, the realistic tactical shooter (with extraction elements), continues to turn heads since entering early access in April 2024. It launched to a boom that saw the game sell 500,000 copies in just four days, with many players familiar with games like Escape from Tarkov getting in on the action.</p>



<p>Since being released in early access, Gray Zone Warfare has maintained a steady course, with developer MADFINGER Games working to polish the product and push out a major update, Night Ops. Recently, the team confirmed that the game has sold one million copies – and a further 500,000 ‘edition upgrades’ have been secured.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>MADFINGER transitioned into the tactical shooter space a while ago, producing Gray Zone Warfare in April 2024 as the fruit of its labour. The game is years in the making, and it offers an unparalleled open-world tactical shooter experience, casting players into the dangerous, fictional world of Lamang and forcing them to survive against all odds.</p>



<p>It was one of the best-selling games on Steam in 2024, where it’s exclusively available. The ongoing performance of the title allowed it to hit the one million sales milestone relatively quickly, notching up the number just eight months after launch. That’s not bad going for a game with no pre-existing fanbase made by a company new to the genre.</p>



<p>I sat down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with MADFINGER’s CEO at Gamescom</a>, learning about what’s next for the game. He has preached multiple times that the game is ‘only 20% finished’ and that there’s plenty on the horizon, and being privy to some of those plans, I can say for sure that there’s a lot in the pipeline for this tactical shooter.</p>



<p>If you’re not enjoying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-flea-market-locked-for-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Tarkov wipe</a> or if you want a more unique extraction experience mixed in with a persistent world, unbound by timers, then check out Gray Zone Warfare – you won’t regret it.</p>

<p>Robin ‘ropz’ Kool has officially left FaZe Clan after three years on the organisation’s Counter-Strike roster. On social media, the superstar competitor penned an emotional message to fans and followers as he departed on amicable terms from FaZe Clan.</p>



<p>The Counter-Strike pro player’s next steps are undefined at present – or at least, they’re unconfirmed to the wider public. Most recently, the 25-year-old player found a second-place finish at the Perfect World Shanghai Major, falling in the grand final against Team Spirit in an emotional series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-moving-on">Moving On</h2>



<p>Ropz <a href="https://x.com/ropz/status/1874247750922977693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to social media</a> to post an emotional message, prompting responses from hundreds of his peers across the industry:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a 12 year old boy who dreamt of being in FaZe. That boy was me. Fast forward a decade, I am proud for not only reaching that dream, but also creating history within it. </p>



<p>Today I am officially leaving FaZe to start another journey. It was an absolute joy and pleasure to represent this team alongside all the amazing people, who became like family to me. Memories for a lifetime, one of the best 3 years of my life. </p>



<p>No words will do justice to how much this meant for me and how special everything was, this was a decision I made against my heart and a part of me will always love this team and organisation. </p>



<p>Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a relatively short time, ropz became one of Counter-Strike’s winningest players, racking up approximately $1.5 million in winnings since entering the scene in earnest with mousesports in 2017. His first big win was at the ESG Tour in Mykonos, Greece in 2017, where he netted a $120,000 prize with mousesports after defeating Team Liquid in a close GF.</p>



<p>Following that win, the player was instrumental in both mousesports and FaZe Clan’s success, storming to victory in the likes of:</p>



<ul>
<li>Intel Grand Slam</li>



<li>PGL Major Antwerp</li>



<li>IEM Cologne/Katowice</li>



<li>Thunderpick World Championship</li>



<li>ESL Pro League</li>



<li>CS Asia Championship</li>
</ul>



<p>Except for a BLAST Premier event, ropz has claimed almost every prize possible in the Counter-Strike space. He has ranked in the HLTV Top 20 Players seven times and has picked up half a dozen MVP awards for his efforts. </p>



<p>And it all began when ropz kickstarted a career as a Call of Duty content creator.</p>

<p>As 2024 came to a close, one final awards ceremony concluded – The 2024 Steam Awards, hosted by Valve. The community-picked winners were awarded their trophies after several days of voting, but for the most part, the awards handed out were mostly predictable.</p>



<p>For instance, Black Myth Wukong secured Game of the Year, after soaring to lofty heights and shattering player count records on the platform earlier this year. It couldn’t be Astro Bot, so why not have Black Myth Wukong pick up the prize?</p>



<p>Read on to see all the winners from The 2024 Steam Awards.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-the-winners-from-the-2024-steam-awards">All The Winners From The 2024 Steam Awards</h2>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown you’re looking for:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Game of the</strong> <strong>Year: </strong>Black Myth Wukong</li>



<li><strong>VR Game of the Year: </strong>Metro Awakening</li>



<li><strong>Labor of Love Award: </strong>Elden Ring</li>



<li><strong>Best Game on Steam Deck: </strong>God of War Ragnarok</li>



<li><strong>Better with Friends Award: </strong>Helldivers II</li>



<li><strong>Outstanding Visual Style: </strong>Silent Hill 2</li>



<li><strong>Most Innovative Gameplay: </strong>Liar’s Bar</li>



<li><strong>Best Game You Suck At Award: </strong>Black Myth Wukong</li>



<li><strong>Best Soundtrack: </strong>Red Dead Redemption</li>



<li><strong>Outstanding Story-Rich Game: </strong>Black Myth Wukong</li>



<li><strong>Sit Back and Relax Award: </strong>Farming Simulator 25</li>
</ul>



<p>Black Myth Wukong cleaned up at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards/2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The 2024 Steam Awards</a>, continuing an award spree that was most recently fuelled by two wins at The Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley early in December. It beat Space Marine II, STALKER 2, Balatro, and Helldivers II to the ultimate prize.</p>



<p>There were some deserving wins here, though. Metro Awakening winning the VR Game of the Year award is a solid shout – it might not be the ‘next game’ in the series that fans were hoping for, but as a standalone VR title, it’s nothing short of stellar and deeply authentic.</p>



<p>Elden Ring’s Labor of Love award was handed out mostly because of Shadow of the Erdtree, which was so popular upon release earlier this year that it became a contender for Game of the Year awards at The Game Awards (and other showcases). </p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption’s Best Soundtrack trophy seems strange when compared to the competition, but it’s a popularity vote at best. It wasn’t a good year for gaming OSTs, it looks like.</p>
