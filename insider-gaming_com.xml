<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach’s release date announcement could be around the corner, as details about several physical editions and pre-orders have surfaced online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coming from reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/death-stranding-2-louverture-des-precommandes-est-imminente-60048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a> (Dealabs), Kojima Productions seemingly has multiple physical editions for Death Stranding 2 in the works. Pre-orders for the game could also be opening soon. The Standard Edition of DS2 will have a physical copy, and the game is said to receive a Collector’s Edition in Europe and North America, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report also tells us that Death Stranding 2: On the Beach—Collector’s Edition will cost USD 229.99. However, the contents of the collector’s edition are unknown. Death Stranding 2 pre-orders are expected to begin by March 2025. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Last month, we heard that Hideo Kojima would attend <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-to-share-new-death-stranding-2-details-at-sxsw-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SXSW 2025 in Austin, Texas</a>, and it was confirmed that he would “discuss and share new details” about DS2. The festival will be hosted this Sunday, March 9, and there’s a chance Kojima could reveal details about Death Stranding 2’s physical editions and pre-orders at the event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have yet to hear anything concrete about Death Stranding 2 from Kojima since the official gameplay trailer from last year. Kojima has provided subtle teases on his social media platforms since then, but that’s about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Death Stranding 2 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-only-30-40-complete-says-hideo-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still planned for 2025</a>.

<p>Developer Tripwire Interactive has announced that Killing Floor 3 has been delayed until later this year. The delay comes just weeks before the game’s planned March 25 release date.</p>



<p>In a length post on <a href="https://x.com/KillingFloor/status/1898029813773836551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the studio says that the game is being “postponed to an undecided date later in 2025”. They say it comes after “taking the time to gather and discuss feedback” from the recent beta.</p>



<p>“[We’ve] realized that we missed the mark,” the developers said. “Our goal isn’t just to make Killing Floor 3 an ambitious step forward for the franchise, but also to maintain the core experience that you’ve come to know and love.”</p>

<p>They continued: “With the full support of our parent company Embracer Group, we’re working together on a timeline to address many of the common issues players had during the beta, including performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel. While it’s too early to say which fixes will be implemented by launch, we can confirm that an update allowing you to independently select your perk class and character is planned for post-release.”</p>



<p>The studio closed its statement thanking its community for patience and understanding while saying it looks forward to “another opportunity to show you a more polished version of Killing Floor 3.”</p>



<p>No information on when a new release date announcement will come was given.  When it does launch, Killing Floor 3 will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

<p>2K has a habit of rewarding its player base for simply playing. WWE 2K25 follows suit and provides regular Locker Codes to enter. If you do so, you get bonuses ranging from in-game currency to gameplay modifiers. Let’s see what March 2025 Codes we can dig up for WWE 2K25.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> lets you be whatever you want: The Face That Runs The Place, The American Nightmare, The Apex Predator, or any other gimmick-infringement-worthy monikers. It has as much content as a WWE game has ever had—plus the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wwe-2k25-ratings-roster-confirmed-so-far-every-superstar-legend-dlc-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest roster to date</a>!</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter which feature pulls you in providing it gets the job done. To ensure you don’t become a jobber though, keep up with the latest Locker Codes.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-active-wwe-2k25-locker-code-amp-reward-march-2025">Every Active WWE 2K25 Locker Code &amp; Reward (March 2025)</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How much longer will the American Nightmare rule? Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Below are the current Active Locker Codes for WWE 2K25 in March 2025. We’ve also been kind enough to provide the exact characters you need to enter as well. </strong></p>



<p>Double-check what you’ve typed if you get an error, these systems can be finicky. If you get it right, you get a nice <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25</a> reward.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-wwe-2k25-locker-codes">How to Redeem WWE 2K25 Locker Codes</h2>



<p><strong>You must venture into the WWE 2K25 Settings screen to find the Locker Codes option. Here, input the codes and redeem your free content.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s some more precise instructions if you’re unsure of what to do:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up WWE 2K25.</li>



<li>Go to <strong>MyFaction</strong>.</li>



<li>Head to the <strong>Live </strong>option on the left when the game mode has loaded up.</li>



<li>Go to the bottom and press on <strong>Locker Codes</strong>.</li>



<li>Enter an Active Locker Code.</li>



<li>If entered correctly, a prompt appears confirming it’s worked and you receive the item!</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-expired-locker-codes">WWE 2K25 Expired Locker Codes</h2>



<p><strong>There are no expired WWE 2K25 Locker Codes at the time of writing.</strong></p>



<p>The above statement is true for now, but the ever-changing nature of Locker Codes ensures it won’t be accurate forever. If you try an Active Code and it doesn’t work, there’s every chance 2K has decided to take it offline.</p>



<p>Remember to always be quick and stay on top of the newest Locker Codes!</p>



<hr>



<p>2K’s Locker Codes scheme is a great incentive for keeping on top of WWE 2K social media. Goodies and boosts at no extra cost are always welcome. If you think we’ve missed any codes, be sure to post them below.</p>
