<p>Nintendo has confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 will have backwards compatibility, meaning players will be able to play their original Nintendo Switch games on its successor. </p>



<p>The new information game from Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa on X (formerly Twitter), where he said, “This is Furukawa. At today’s Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about the successor to Nintendo Switch, including its compatibility with Nintendo Switch, will be announced at a later date.”</p>



<p>Furuwaka’s announcement confirms, at the very least, that its games will be backward compatible digitally, but as of yet, there’s no word on if this applies to Nintendo Switch cartridges. </p>



<p>Yesterday, Nintendo announced that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 is still planned to be announced before April 2025</a>, with analysts predicting that the console may be released in mid-2025. At the time of writing though, Nintendo has only confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 will release after April 2025.</p>



<p>Earlier this year,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-prototype-designs-seemingly-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prototype designs of the Nintendo Switch 2</a>&nbsp;leaked online, including specifications for the new console, which will feature 12GB of RAM, HDMI 2.1 support, and even 256GB of internal storage. The latest rumors on the system claim that it will&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be backwards compatible and support 4K</a>&nbsp;resolution.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/slavicpunk-oldtimer-review-playstation-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Imagine you’ve taken John Wick and thrown him into the universe of Cyberpunk 2077 (that’s not too hard if you know what I mean). Now you’ve armed him with phenomenal weapons and put him up against cutthroat forces while exploring a world that’s a brutal reminder of where we might all end up one day in the future.</p>



<p>That’s essentially SlavicPunk: Oldtimer. This dystopian, isometric shooter sees you assume control of Yanus, a grizzled PI with a penchant for combat and a vast array of one-liners at his disposal. With a deadly arsenal of modular weapons, you’ll utilise Yanus’ expert combat abilities to explore what has been dubbed an ‘inherently Slavic take on the cyberpunk world’.</p>



<p>This new shooter comes from Red Square Games, and despite being available on PC for more than a year, it’s only just coming to Xbox and PlayStation – hence the SlavicPunk: Oldtimer review.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-looks-great-feels-better">Looks Great, Feels Better</h2>



<p>I was fortunate enough to get an early-access copy of SlavicPunk on PlayStation 5, and despite it not being from the perspective that I usually enjoy games, I was eager enough to dive straight in. Within the first hour of the game, I became a convert, falling in love with the game’s art style and isometric angle.</p>



<p>Like many dystopian titles, SlavicPunk will have you feeling fairly depressed about the squalid, impoverished setting you’re exploring, but that mood will be eradicated when you’re in the thick of a desperate gunfight with enemies approaching you from all angles. </p>



<p>It becomes a classic twin-stick shooter, and your eyes flick across the screen as you use every weapon, movement mechanic, and power-up to stay alive. It’s challenging, even on the lowest difficulty level, it’s brutal, and it’s damned good fun.</p>



<p>Everything from the freedom to kill <strong>everyone </strong>to the hard-hitting, synthy cyberpunk soundtrack (which is available as a separate purchase on some platforms) kept me switched on.</p>



<h2 id="h-action-packed-adventure">Action-Packed Adventure</h2>



<p>SlavicPunk: Oldtimer has a relatively immersive story wrapped up at its core. While the voice acting was sketchy at best (Yanus is a stand-out character among a somewhat amateur crowd), the steps of the story are engaging enough to keep you guessing about what might come next.</p>



<p>It’s a mostly linear title with a few wider areas to explore, but you’ll benefit from digging through every corner of the world presented to you. As this is a multi-faceted title, you’re free to deal with enemies how you see fit. If you want to go in guns blazing, that’s fine – but if you want to use a knife and create a more stealthy adventure, that’s also okay.</p>



<p>As this is a cyberpunk-styled title, there are a few ‘techie’ interactions. Users can slow down time and utilise a ‘battlehacking’ mechanic to disrupt enemies on the fly. It’s a useful feature that is pivotal in some circumstances, and it makes for a dynamic pacing that gives you a little breathing space in a dire fight.</p>



<p>It’s only a few hours long from end to end, but there’s plenty packed into that window. It also boasts remarkable replayability, as I found that fights rarely went the same way twice. It’s also one of the few games that I’ve been motivated to play on multiple difficulty settings, just to see how advanced the challenge became.</p>



<p>Spoiler alert: It gets pretty damn tough.</p>



<p>With the way this game unravelled before me, I ended up hoping for some form of expansion or follow-up title to emerge in the future. I’d happily explore more of the universe created by Red Square, and the introductory chapter isn’t priced too high to get started.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<p>SlavicPunk: Oldtimer is an easy-to-learn isometric shooter with plenty of meat when it comes to multi-faceted combat scenarios. It doesn’t hit hard in the voice acting department and it’s quite short, but it offers a punchy adventure that could serve as a perfect introduction to a wider cyberpunk universe.</p>



<p><em>SlavicPunk: Oldtimer is available now on PC, Xbox Series XS, and PlayStation 5</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite OG Will Return Permanently in December, It’s Claimed]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-og-will-return-permanently-in-december-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1028400/</guid>

<p>It has been claimed by reputable insiders on social media that in December, Fortnite OG will return <strong>permanently</strong>. It’s expected that this will be announced during the upcoming Final event or The Game Awards in the first week of December. It gets better, though – it has also been suggested that every Chapter One season will return on a month-by-month rotation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-back-to-og">Going Back to OG</h2>



<p>Fortnite returned to OG a year ago and it was the most popular move Epic Games has ever made. In an instant, tens of millions of players poured into the game across all platforms, and records were broken worldwide. It was such a success that other developers have since leant on the idea of bringing back an original map as fan service.</p>



<p>Most recently, it was revealed that Apex Legends will be taking players back to their original map.</p>



<p>On social media, HYPEX and ShiinaBR, two reputable Fortnite leakers, corroborated claims that Fortnite OG is returning in December, but this time, it’ll be here to stay.</p>



<p>Per the claims:</p>



<ul>
<li>All Chapter One seasons (1 – 10) will return, with each one lasting a month</li>



<li>Only OG loot will be available and the map will support both Build and Zero Build</li>
</ul>



<p>This could be huge – but will it have the draw that OG Fortnite had last year when it was reintroduced for the first time? It’s possible. </p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that Epic is partnering with footwear brands like Jordans to produce new, in-game cosmetics called Kicks. Also, several hip-hop artists including Eminem and Snoop Dogg were added to the game as playable skins and boss characters.</p>
