<p>Following Phil Spencer’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-sarah-bond-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retirement announcement</a>, Matt Booty has been named EVP and Chief Content Officer of Microsoft Gaming. Below is his full <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">internal memo.</a></p>



<p>“I read Phil’s note with much gratitude. He has been a steady champion for game creators and our studio teams, and I’ve learned so much from his leadership over the years. All our games have benefited from his foundational support. I’m also grateful to Satya for his ongoing commitment to gaming and holding a vision of how it can connect back to the larger company.</p>



<p>Looking forward, I’m excited to partner with Asha as our next CEO. Our first conversations centered on her commitment to making great games and the role that plays in our overall success. She asks questions, pushes for clarity, and wants our choices grounded in player and developer needs. That mindset matters as the industry around us is changing quickly: how players engage, how games are made, and how business models and platforms evolve.</p>



<p>We have good reasons to believe in what’s ahead. This organization and its franchises have navigated change for decades, and our strength comes from teams who know how to adapt and keep delivering. That confidence is grounded in a strong pipeline of established franchises, new bets we believe in, and clear player demand for what we are building.</p>



<p>My focus is on supporting the teams and leaders we have in place and creating the conditions for them to do their best work. To be clear, there are no organizational changes underway for our studios.</p>



<p>Thanks for everything you do for players and for each other.</p>



<p>Matt”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following Phil Spencer’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-sarah-bond-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retirement announcement</a>, Asha Sharma has been named EVP and CEO of Microsoft Gaming. Below is her full <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">internal memo.</a></p>



<p>“Dear team,</p>



<p>Today I begin my role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p>



<p>I feel two things at once: humility and urgency.</p>



<p>Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.</p>



<p>I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players. The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connects people and pushes the industry forward.</p>



<p>Thank you to Phil for his leadership, and to every studio, platform, and operations team that built this foundation. We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways.</p>



<p>My first job is simple: understand what makes this work and protect it.</p>



<p>That starts with three commitments.</p>



<p>First, great games.</p>



<p>Everything begins here. We must have great games beloved by players before we do anything. Unforgettable characters, stories that make us feel, innovative game play, and creative excellence. We will empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas. We will take risks. We will enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most.</p>



<p>I promoted Matt Booty in honor of this commitment. He understands the craft and the challenges of building great games, has led teams that deliver award-winning work, and has earned the trust of game developers across the industry.</p>



<p>Second, the return of Xbox.</p>



<p>We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world.</p>



<p>We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are. It connects us to the players and fans who invest in Xbox, and to the developers who build ambitious experiences for it.</p>



<p>Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise.</p>



<p>Third, future of play.</p>



<p>We are witnessing the reinvention of play.</p>



<p>To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love. But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</p>



<p>As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.</p>



<p>The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through. We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not.</p>



<p>Thank you for welcoming me into this journey.</p>



<p>Asha”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In major breaking news on Friday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has announced that Micorosft Gaming CEO and head of Xbox Phil Spencer is retiring from the company. </p>



<p>In addition, Xbox President Sarah Bond has resigned.</p>







<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Spencer’s retirement will be effective as of Monday, February 23.  He leaves after spending 38 years with the company.</p>



<p><strong>“I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership,”</strong> Nadella said via email to Microsoft and Xbox staff. <strong>“Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it. He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms.”</strong></p>







<p>Spencer, in his memo to staff, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-retiring-from-xbox-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said that he made</a> it known last year that he was <strong>“thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we’ve built,”</strong> he said. <strong>“Xbox has always been more than a business. It’s a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.”</strong></p>



<p>Taking over as head of gaming for Microsoft is Asha Sharma. Sharma had previously been the head of CoreAI at Microsoft after joining the company in 2024. Matt Booty, who will remain with Xbox, is moving up to chief content officer.</p>



<p>In his first message to Xbox staff, Sharma said that they won’t flood the market with “soulless AI slop”.</p>



<p><strong>“To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters, and worlds that people love,” </strong>he wrote. <strong>“But we will not treat those worlds as static IP to milk and monetize. We will build a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.”</strong></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bioshock-movie-could-tie-into-new-game-production-may-start-in-2027/</link>
            <guid>1442251</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Roy Lee, the producer of the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bioshock/" id="1100">BioShock </a>movie, has provided an update on the forthcoming Netflix film and hopes that it will tie into an upcoming game release.</p>



<p>The announcement of Netflix taking on a BioShock adaptation first came in 2022. 4 years later, there is an explanation for why the project has been dormant and when things could actually start progressing toward production.</p>







<h2 id="h-other-projects-took-precedence-over-bioshock">Other Projects Took Precedence Over BioShock</h2>



<p><a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview with Collider’s</a> Steve Weintraub, Lee stated that production would have begun sooner, but other projects, including The Long Walk and a Hunger Games prequel, got in the way. However, he says the project could tentatively be next up for him, and that both Netflix and Take-Two are hopeful the movie will come out and tie into a future game release.</p>



<p>“I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bioshock-4/" id="702">fourth BioShock game</a> was announced in 2019. Last year, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick promised the game would release.</p>



<p>Lee didn’t want to fully commit to a date for when production could begin. Still, he says he’s hopeful things will get started in 2027.</p>



<p>“I know that the intent is to hopefully get in production next year,” he said.</p>







<h2>Video Game Adaptations Are Plentiful on Streaming Platforms</h2>



<p>Netflix saw success with video game series related to Sonic the Hedgehog, Tomb Raider, Castlevania, Devil May Cry, and more. Over on Amazon Prime Video, the Fallout television series has been successful. They are currently working on a God of War series, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ryan-hurst-comments-on-playing-kratos-in-prime-videos-god-of-war/" id="170361">with Ryan Hurst tapped to play Kratos.</a></p>



<p>Netflix is also the exclusive streaming partner of the upcoming Legend of Zelda film, following its theatrical release next year. Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-will-stream-exclusively-on-netflix-after-theatrical-release/" id="170419">this link.</a></p>
