<p>Bobby Kotick, the infamous former CEO of Activision Blizzard, has revealed on a podcast which studio acquisition taught him ‘an expensive lesson’ almost twenty years ago. While sitting down with Bing Gordon, former Chief Creative Officer at Electronic Arts, Kotick took a stroll down memory lane, looking back over the last forty years of the gaming industry.</p>



<p>When it was mentioned by Gordon that Kotick and his team had a ‘flawless’ mergers and acquisitions record, Kotick set the story straight by mentioning one studio buyout that was less than ideal. In his words, it was an $80 million lesson.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-wrote-it-off">‘We Wrote it Off’</h2>



<p>In a recent<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> episode of the ‘Grit’ podcast</a>, which at the time of publishing is unlisted on YouTube, Kotick took a quick dive into an awful acquisition that Activision made before merging with Blizzard in 2008.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s not true, we actually had a bad acquisition.</p>



<p>We bought the company that was in Manchester that did the driving game for Xbox, and it was called… (blanks)</p>



<p>They had a good guy who was running the day-to-day, but he was like… A brilliant guy who — like a ‘McKenzie guy’, and he was in strat planning.</p>



<p>It was $80 million and we wrote it off two years later. It was everything — everything about it violated all our principles.</p>



<p>That guy was an expensive lesson.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In this segment, Kotick is referring to Bizarre Creations, the developer behind Project Gotham Racing, a series of titles that were exclusive to the Xbox platform. While the acquisition <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/activision-buys-studio-behind-project-gotham-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">left Microsoft with the PGR label</a>, Activision would lean on Bizarre Creations to piece together ‘Blur’, which was released in 2010, three years after the 2007 buy-out occurred.</p>



<p>Blur was intended to be released in 2009, but it was <a href="https://investor.activision.com/static-files/f2927482-7047-46da-b069-cfd2cc95acd5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">delayed by Activision</a> to allow Bizarre to further polish the game.</p>



<p>Less than a year later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bizarre-says-goodbye-with-farewell-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision closed Bizarre Creations</a>, dissolving the studio (which was based in Liverpool and not Manchester, as Kotick suggested) and releasing around 200 employees.</p>



<p>To this day, the Project Gotham Racing series stands abandoned</p>



<p>Kotick went on to walk Gordon through Activision’s former acquisition processes, which were centred mostly around retaining the identity of studios and allowing them to keep doing what they were <strong>already </strong>doing. By contrast, he explained how Electronic Arts – Gordon’s former company – would ‘take over’ acquired studios and rebrand them, stripping out their image somewhat.</p>



<p>In the same discussion on the Grit podcast (props to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a> for the link), both Gordon and Kotick explained that, once upon a time, Electronic Arts <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-almost-owned-cod-blizzard/">almost purchased Activision and Blizzard</a>, which would have left franchises like Call of Duty under the EA umbrella.</p>

<p>In a recent interview as part of an episode of the ‘Grit’ podcast, Bobby Kotick sat down with Bing Gordon, former Chief Creative Officer at Electronic Arts. It was revealed in the earlier minutes of the episode – which spans a whopping two hours – that Electronic Arts once passed up opportunities to acquire Blizzard, Call of Duty, and Guitar Hero, among other brands.</p>



<p>Eventually, Activision Blizzard, which was formerly led by Bobby Kotick as CEO, was purchased in its entirety by Microsoft, with the tech titan acquiring all aforementioned labels.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-might-have-been">What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grit podcast episode</a> opened with Bobby Kotick suggesting that Bing Gordon would have been one of the toughest CEOs in gaming to deal with as a competitor and that he and his team would have <strong>paid </strong>to keep the then-CEO in place at Electronic Arts. It was all in jest and talk turned to mergers and acquisitions, with Gordon gushing over Kotick’s notorious success in the space.</p>



<p>That’s not entirely true, though – Kotick explained some of the rougher patches of the M&amp;A streak:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We actually had a bad acquisition.</p>



<p>The company that was in Manchester that did the driving game for Xbox… We had a good guy who was running the day-to-day but he was like a brilliant guy, who — he was in strat planning.</p>



<p>It was $80 million and like, we wrote it off two years later. Everything about it violated all our principles.</p>



<p>That guy was an expensive lesson.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I can assume Kotick is referring to Bizarre Creations, the developer behind Project Gotham Racing – but the studio was based in Liverpool, not Manchester.</p>



<p>Kotick then explained how Electronic Arts tried acquiring Activision and Blizzard (assumedly pre- the 2008 merger):</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They tried to buy us a bunch of times, we had merger conversations a bunch of times.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gordon then expanded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While you were doing Blizzard, <strong>that EA passed on</strong>, and you were doing King, EA did PopCap — just stupid things.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These revelations were in the first ten minutes of the two-hour podcast episode. It’s a plethora of gaming history that sees Gordon and Kotick walk down memory lane while discussing the origin stories of some of the biggest franchises in the business.</p>



<p>In one segment of the podcast (thanks to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameSpot</a> for the link), Kotick explained how Overwatch was created at Blizzard. He stressed that it went against the Blizzard ‘aesthetic’ and mentioned it was ‘unbelievable’ that the team pieced it together after focusing on ‘dark’ games for so long.</p>



<p>Do you think Electronic Arts would have tanked the Call of Duty brand as it did with Medal of Honor and (arguably) Battlefield? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass is set to add a classic Call of Duty game to its library as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is heading to the subscription service. And that’s 2009’s Modern Warfare 2, not the game of the same name released in 2022.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/12/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-heading-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Era</a>, Modern Warfare 2 will be coming to the service either in March or April this year. Insider Gaming sources can corroborate this report. </p>







<p>As of writing, it remains unclear if it’s the full game coming to the service or just the campaign. It’s also unknown if it’s the original version of the game or the remastered campaign. When it does release on the service, Modern Warfare 2 will become the first classic Call of Duty game to be available for Game Pass members. It will join recent titles Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare 3 (2023) as the only games in the series to be available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inside-adamas-cod-league-next-level/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty League has been the pinnacle of COD esports for the last five years. It’s the top-most tier of the competitive ecosystem, a multi-million-dollar league backed by the biggest names in modern gaming such as FaZe, OpTic, Cloud9, and 100 Thieves. Behind the scenes, one company has worked tirelessly to bring several teams to the next level in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Enter Adamas, a performance, leadership, and development coaching organisation that has supported more than half the teams in the Call of Duty League. This effective, invaluable group has been a secret power for many of today’s CDL squads, including those that have gone on to claim the most lucrative prizes in the competitive space.</p>



<p>I was recently fortunate enough to catch up with Adamas at the CDL Madrid Major, and I took the opportunity to question some of the COD League’s players about the impact this organisation has on their performance.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-power-of-adamas">The Power of Adamas</h2>



<p>I’ve been connected with <a href="https://www.adamasesports.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Adamas</a> for more than two years, taking a special interest in the organisation around the time that the New York Subliners went on a phenomenal run through the 2023 CDL season. The squad managed to secure two Major trophies and then won COD Champs, all while under the guidance and gravity of Adamas Esports.</p>



<p>In the last three years, Adamas has directly influenced the performances of the teams that have claimed seven out of 13 possible major tournaments, including the Call of Duty League Championship and the inaugural Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>At the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overactive-media-cdl-major-in-madrid-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDL Major in Madrid</a>, Atlanta FaZe stormed to victory just weeks after winning the first CDL Minor, all while being closely aligned with Adamas and singing the company’s praises. I connected with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-faze-abezy-cellium-madrid-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlanta FaZe’s superstar players</a> at the Major in Spain, catching up on their impressions of Adamas.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>(They have) <strong>helped us tremendously</strong>. I feel like with everything — every aspect of our team, when it comes to trusting each other, being more of a team in all those ways, I feel like (they’ve) been just insane.</em></p>



<p><em>They’ve done so much for us already.</em></p>



<p>– Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tyler went on to note that Adamas has made the team’s mentality ‘<em>tenfold better</em>‘.</p>



<p>Even those who don’t ‘believe’ in the practices that Adamas preaches eventually see the benefit in what the company offers. I caught up with Cellium, one of the best Call of Duty players in the world, to get his two cents on Adamas:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Yeah, I was going to say I’ve never really been a believer in that whole ‘thing’. (They have) <strong>definitely proved me wrong with that</strong>, because (they’ve) helped me and the team a lot.</em></p>



<p>– McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I also had a chance to chat <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lat-scrap-and-ghosty-interview-cdl-super-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the LA Thieves</a>, sitting down with Scrap and Ghosty, two of the team’s more prolific players. They shared similar sentiments about Adamas, which also acts as a performance and development resource for the 100 Thieves-backed CDL team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>I feel like <strong>it helps a lot with the team cameraderie</strong>, just being comfortable with each other, fully trusting each other, calming yourself down if you need to. Mostly the team cameraderie aspect.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re a brand-new team, only been playing with each other two, three months total, and speedening up the process, (they’ve) helped quite a bit with that.</em></p>



<p>– Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We’re all just a fun team to be around, we be hanging out outside of the game as well, I think we’re super comfortable on stage together. I think (they’ve) <strong>made it even better for us</strong>.</em></p>



<p>– Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-from-the-source">From the Source</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Matt Fisher has worked with the biggest names in Call of Duty esports</figcaption></figure>







<p>I had an extended chat with Matt ‘Fish’ Fisher, the Director of Performance at Adamas Esports and one of the nicest and most confident people I’ve ever met. He started his CDL journey with the New York Subliners, aligning himself with the industry greats like James ‘Clayster’ Eubanks and working to instil an ‘identity of athlete’ where the concept had never before surfaced.</p>



<p>He gave me the secret recipe for the company’s work inside the Call of Duty League:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>One of our core philosophies at Adamas is that we take a human-centered approach. Regardless of the game you play, the happier and healthier you are as a human being, the better you will perform both in game and in life. </em></p>



<p><em>We haven’t taught a single COD player or coach how to improve their strategies or technical skills, but we have helped them recognise how optimising other aspects of their lives will have a carry-over effect to in-game.</em></p>



<p><em>Much of our work is in helping to establish and maintain a team culture and environment that is conducive to both wellness and performance. Our goal is to set these organisations up with a foundation that will lead to consistent performance year after year, and allow their talent to perform to their full potential.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>And the results are certainly front and centre for all to see. Fish gave me critical insights into the end-to-end process, from the team-building exercises to pre-match traditions and preparations. He noted that while we were talking, the Atlanta FaZe team was ‘meditating’ backstage, suggesting that it’s a practice that might seem unorthodox or invalid to some players.</p>



<p>That was shortly before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/drazah-shots-fired-lat-madrid-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FaZe went on to win</a> the first CDL Major of the 2025 season.</p>



<p>Last season, the Adamas folks teamed up with the LA Guerrillas, a squad that almost went dark for a while as it tussled with internal issues and a lack of funding.</p>



<p>The roster was made up mostly of untested talent, but as Fish put it,<em> ‘We feel like they were able to prove that a ‘bare bones’ team with minimum investment in player salaries and staff, supported by Adamas’ expertise, could lead to results that many considered a huge ‘overachievement’.’</em></p>



<p>From the top to the bottom, Adamas supports the Call of Duty League. The organisation helps the players immeasurably, but there’s also plenty of time spent with organisation owners and general managers, with the company promoting a growth mindset that allows the key decision-makers to <strong>make the <em>right</em> decisions</strong>, which at the end of the day, benefits <strong>everyone</strong>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-major-iv-dreamhack-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty League’s 2025 season</a> continues to unravel. From this Friday, the qualifiers are back for Major II, and beyond that, there are another five months of competitive coverage lined up.</p>

<p>The competitive Rainbow Six Siege community has come to the support of a Team Secret player after the CEO of his team released him and criticized him for showing emotion after a loss. Numerous players and personalities are now calling out the CEO for their behavior.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-team-secret-ceo-s-actions-uncover-the-need-to-talk-about-mental-health">Team Secret CEO’s Actions Uncover the Need to Talk About Mental Health</h2>



<p>After being released by Team Secret following a group stage elimination at The Six Invitational, Australian player Jake “Virtue” Grannan posted on X that the move caught him by surprise. “Didn’t see this coming at all, after all the energy and work that I’ve been putting in,” he <a href="https://x.com/Virtue_R6/status/1889005812346941812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>. “One bad tournament has now lead me to be LFT [looking for team].”</p>



<p>However, a day later, Virtue and almost the entire Siege community were stunned by <a href="https://x.com/zypher84/status/1889338159739347427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a reply</a> to this post made by Secret CEO John Yao. Yao shared a screenshot of the team after they were eliminated, showing Virtue facing away from the group. The caption reads: “I am also very surprised.”</p>



<p>This reply, which appears to disparage Virtue, has drawn the ire of several members of the Siege community. Virtue confirmed that he was very emotional, that he was “almost crying,” and that he “couldn’t look at anyone” after a bad series. Some of the game’s biggest stars came to Virtue’s defense, including M80’s Leonardo “Kyno” Figueiredo and DarkZero’s Jason “Beaulo” Doty. The replies and quote reposts are littered with players, casters, coaches, and others criticizing Yao and defending Virtue.</p>



<p>While many are clearly upset about Yao’s comments, they have at least opened the door for a greater conversation about men’s mental health. It’s okay to cry, and it’s okay to cry in front of others.</p>



<p>Did the Team Secret CEO cross the line? Should mental health become a bigger talking point in esports? Let us know down below and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
