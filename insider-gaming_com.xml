<p>Goat Simulator developers Coffee Stain North has announced the debut of its inaugural Goat Direct showcase on April 1, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-goat-direct-arrives-on-april-1">Goat Direct Arrives on April 1</h2>



<p>The highly anticipated Goat Direct is being hosted on April Fool’s Day, and many fans are wondering if this is all just an elaborate prank. However, the developers have explicitly stated that they “promise the ‘Goat Direct’ is real. The showcase is indeed happening, and all the announcements we see during the presentation “are legitimate. “&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Goat Direct will be hosted on April 1, the original Goat Simulator’s launch anniversary. During the event, fans should expect world premiere reveals for Goat Simulator 3 and some announcements from Coffee Stain North’s partner. The devs will also feature an update on the recently revealed Goat Simulator: The Card Game and more “top secret news.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-and-where-to-watch-goat-direct">How and Where to Watch Goat Direct?</h2>



<p>The Goat Direct will be hosted through a virtual live stream on the Goat Simulator YouTube channel. Interested players should tune in on April 1 at 15:00 BST / 16:00 CEST / 07:00 PDT / 10:00 EDT to hear all the new announcements first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Santiago Ferrero, Creative Director at Coffee Stain North, has stated, “We do realise that announcing lots of new things on April Fool’s Day isn’t always the best of ideas, but we think we’ve truly outdone ourselves this year, so please believe us and tune in to ‘Goat Direct’!”</p>



<p>In other news, a recent claim states that a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-direct-expected-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Direct is expected this week</a>.

<p>Capcom has revealed that Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1 will launch on Thursday April 3/Friday April 4, depending on your time zone. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/update/ver_01_0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal came as part</a> of a 15-minute video on Tuesday that went into details on what players can expect to see in the game’s first major update. </p>



<p>First thing’s first, the title update will be free to all players. It will include a new monster called Mizutsune alongside a new Zoh Shia quest. There is also a new Grand Hub gathering place that players who’ve completed the game’s main story can get together and hangout as well as play a new game called Barrel Bowling. If you want a different type of entertainment, The Diva will be there to perform at night.</p>

<p>All eyes in the video game industry are watching to see when Grand Theft Auto 6 will release. The potential impact on the industry is expected to be very large, but several publishers planning to release games around the same time are ready to delay just to get out of its way.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-don-t-want-to-be-anywhere-near-that">“We Don’t Want to Be Anywhere Near That”</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Christopher Dring</a> of the recently launched outlet The Game Business, “three major video game publishers” are ready to delay their games to avoid GTA 6. Dring says that the boss “of one of the world’s biggest game publishers” told him: “Rockstar games always suck a lot of money and, more importantly, time out of the market. We don’t want to be anywhere near that. We are working up multiple different plans for our titles.”</p>



<p>This past weekend at the Game Developer’s Conference in San Francisco, Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson was told by a few developers that they’re “waiting to see what GTA 6 does.” Back in December, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported that competing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishers are “waiting as long as possible to commit to their release date.”</a></p>



<p>The launch of GTA 6, tentatively scheduled for October 2025, reportedly isn’t just scaring off major new releases. According to Dring, two developers of “top 10 live-service games” are not planning any significant updates during the GTA 6 launch window. One studio boss reportedly said that they would “nudge” their releases ahead or backwards three weeks just to avoid GTA 6. The studio heads that spoke to Dring spoke of other potential issues, like a crowded schedule of other games trying to avoid GTA 6, but those problems seem preferable than trying to compete with a potentially industry-altering release. However, as one industry consultant noted at GDC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/if-gta-6-delayed-tank-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waiting on GTA 6 only for it to delay could “tank” those developers</a>.</p>



<p>Are game developers perhaps being too cautious of the GTA 6 release, or are they wise to get out of the way? Let us know down in the comments below!
