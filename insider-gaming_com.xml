<p><strong>Update: </strong>Square Enix has released a statement to the media regarding the layoffs. However, they didn’t clarify the number of people being let go, and Insider Gaming has asked for more clarification. </p>



<p>The full statement is as follows:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are reorganizing our operations in North America and Europe to strengthen our development structure and to drive a globally integrated marketing strategy. This was an extremely difficult decision, made following careful consideration and analysis by our leadership, in order to best position the Group’s long-term growth.</p>



<p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the talented team members who will be departing the company for their significant contributions to Square Enix. During this period of transition, we remain committed to treating each individual with the utmost respect and providing extensive support throughout this process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Original Story:</em></strong> Square Enix is letting go more than 100 employees in a global mass layoff.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN’s Rebekah Valentine</a>, Square Enix is letting go up to 137 people in the United Kingdom (UK) along with an unknown number of people in the United States (US).</p>



<p>The layoffs were announced in a video call with staff located outside of Japan. These cuts will impact those working in marketing, publishing, business planning, QA, IT, and more. Staff being let go will start being notified on Thursday. Full details on what Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu called a <strong>“fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization” </strong>will be given in the future.</p>



<p><strong>“In the current fiscal year, a fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization is being implemented with the aim of further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency,”</strong> a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">presentation shown</a> first to staff before being made public said.</p>



<p>It has also been reported that those not let go from the company will be required to work more often in office. </p>



<p>They also come the same day the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/square-enix-wants-ai-to-handle-70-of-qa-within-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said it wants to have 70%</a> of its QA and debugging handled by AI by the end of 2027. It’s unclear, however, if this plan attributed to the current round of job cuts.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Square Enix for comment on the layoffs. Should a response be received or a statement be made public, it will be added to this story.</p>
