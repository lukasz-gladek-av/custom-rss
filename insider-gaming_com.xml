<p>Crimson Desert is the long-awaited successor to Black Desert Online, and if you played the first one, it’s only natural that you want to know if Crimson Desert is a sequel, a prequel, or something else entirely.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-desert-online/" id="1332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Desert Online</a> was an immediate hit, selling several hundred thousand copies. Now, in 2026, millions of players have registered, and the MMO has grossed billions. There’s a lot of love for Black Desert Online, which is why its direct connections to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/crimson-desert/" id="888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crimson Desert</a> are fascinating for both old and new players.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-crimson-desert-a-prequel-to-black-desert-online">Is Crimson Desert A Prequel To Black Desert Online?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New world. Credit to Pearl Abyss</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, despite being initially conceived as a prequel to Black Desert Online, Crimson Desert has dropped any notion of this idea.</strong></p>



<p>There’s your first big question about this story answered: Crimson Desert is not a prequel. Pearl Abyss has mentioned in interviews that the goal was to have Crimson Desert be another MMO, serving as a precursor to Black Desert Online.</p>

</ul>



<p>Abyss’ vision and scope for the project quickly expanded, which is why Crimson Desert is not a prequel.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-crimson-desert-a-sequel-to-black-desert-online">Is Crimson Desert A Sequel To Black Desert Online?</h2>



<p><strong>Crimson Desert is also not a direct sequel to Black Desert Online, and it’s closer to a spiritual successor than having any direct ties to the original game.</strong></p>



<p>There are many key differences between Crimson Desert and Black Desert Online—including its single-player and multiplayer focus—but the world itself is another big one.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>Crimson Desert is set in Pywel, whereas Black Desert Online was separated into several key and distinct regions. Aside from the setting being new, there are also new characters and a fresh narrative—underlining that while the game remains grounded in the same universe, this is a whole new game, and isn’t a sequel or prequel!</p>



<p>The main positive about this creative decision is that if you haven’t played Black Desert Online, you won’t need to play catch-up and can jump right in.</p>



<p>But if you have played Black Desert Online at any point, share your thoughts on the game and what you’re hoping for in Crimson Desert.

<p>If you’re worried about delays or anything similar, you should be reassured by the news that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crimson-desert-goes-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crimson Desert went Gold two months before release</a>.</p>

<p>Space Marine 2’s update 12.0 is live now, introducing the new Techmarine class, more PvE content, a weapon, a new map, and so much more. </p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is on schedule with their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-year-2-roadmap-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 2 roadmap</a>, with the new class, missions, and cosmetics arriving with Patch 12 in Q1 2026 as announced. Many details of this update were revealed in the PTS (public test server) patch notes, and it is now officially live. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-the-space-marine-2-techmarine-update-12-0">What’s New in the Space Marine 2 Techmarine Update 12.0? </h2>



<p>Space Marine 2 update 12.0’s highlight is the new playable class, Techmarine. This class features a technician with expertise in crowd control and defense. A lot of changes have been made to the class as part of the PTS update, including fixes and balancing adjustments. The Techmarine class also features a new weapon, the Omnissian Axe, which can deal damage to single enemies as well as surrounding crowds. </p>



<p>Then players can look forward to the Tarantula Sentry Gun as part of PvE content in this update, with Techmarines able to activate Sentry Turrets in PvE missions. The new PvE Map is called Disruption, and it takes the Space Marines to the Hive City of Avarax, where they have to “reinforce the overwhelmed Cadian defenses against a massive Tyranid swarm.”</p>



<p>The latest update for Space Marine 2 introduces several new features for players. These include new PvE equipment, Restorative Stims, and Shared Heads for both PvE and PvP characters, enhancing customization options. Additionally, a new Tech feature, Siege Host Migration, has been added, along with a VO Selector. </p>



<p>The update brings 21 new battlefield conditions, a Custom Stratagems Mode for PvE, and Heroic Items. Players can also look forward to fresh DLC content from the Raven Guard Champion Pack, gameplay and balancing tweaks, new custom armor set pieces, and various fixes.

<p><strong>NEW FEATURES</strong></p>



<h3>New Class: Techmarine</h3>



<p><em>We are introducing a new playable class: the Techmarine! This mighty technician specialises in crowd control and area defense, handling multiple combat tasks simultaneously. This is primarily possible with his Servo-Gun ability. When activated, it locks onto enemies in a line of sight and automatically fires at them while the Techmarine continues fighting in melee or range. Furthermore, the Servo-Gun allows executing Gun Strikes without interrupting other actions.</em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
