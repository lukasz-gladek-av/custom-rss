<p>In February 2023, Microsoft inked a 10-year deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms. The deal was signed amidst Microsoft’s landmark acquisition of Activision Blizzard, but fast-forward to today, and the Nintendo space is still without a Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>According to one insider, that might be about to change. In a recent claim posted to social media, it was suggested that Call of Duty is ‘a few months’ away from launching on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-call-of-duty-coming-to-switch">When is Call of Duty Coming to Switch?</h2>



<p>According to Windows Central’s Jez Corden, the first Call of Duty ‘Switch version’ is set to land on the platform in ‘a few months’. Corden explained that the spanner in the works concerned the lack of developer kits for the Nintendo Switch 2, which has been a pretty public issue since <strong>before </strong>the console launched in June.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first CoD Switch version is nearly done and launching in a few months</p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Corden didn’t explain which Call of Duty title is being ported to Nintendo Switch 2, leaving it up to fans to surmise what’s on the way. There’s a lengthy line-up to pick from. It could be Call of Duty Warzone, which would promote the fastest adoption on Nintendo Switch 2, or it could be a recent release like Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Fans aren’t too sure about Black Ops 7 being released on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>If we were betting people, I think the safest wager would be in the Warzone stakes.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-call-of-duty-switch/">Sledgehammer Games started hiring</a> for developers with ‘AAA mobile or Nintendo Switch’ experience, which was telling enough.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Company Shareholders Approve $55 Billion Sale]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-shareholders-approve-sale-saudi-arabia-pif/</link>
            <guid>1390621</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The sale of EA to the Saudi Arabian-owned Public Investment Fund has been approved by shareholders. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the purchase</a> still needs government approval before it can go through.</p>



<p>Earlier in the year, EA announced that PIF would be purchasing a majority stake in the gaming company. The deal, set for $55 billion, would lead to PIF acquiring 93.4% of EA. While the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-it-will-keep-creative-control-if-saudi-arabia-sale-goes-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would still run things</a> as it would in the United States, it would be mainly owned by Saudi Arabia. Pushback from fans and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/electronic-arts-sale-facing-resistance-us-politicians/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even US government officials</a> have arose since the announcement, but nothing has been amended. Now, the company’s shareholders have moved forward with the deal, further solidifying it.</p>











<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>As of 2:03pm PT, EA's shareholders have officially approved EA's $55 billion sale to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. </p><p>The deal will next need to receive approval from government regulators</p></div>— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/2003225658982576557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/2003225658982576557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweet from journalist Stephen Totilo</a>, EA shareholders have approved the deal of the company being sold to Saudi Arabia’s PIF. The only thing truly left is for government regulators to approve the deal. No word as to when that deal will come in has been said as of yet. </p>



<p>Despite the buyout, EA will maintain creative control of the company. It’s not fully known what PIF will play within the company. EA did extremely well in 2025, with Battlefield 6 topping the charts in sales and it’s sports titles doing great, as well. Still, given the many warnings from government and fans, as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-bioware-employees-worried-about-more-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studios at EA like Bioware</a>, the direction the company can go is up in the air.</p>



<p>What do you think of shareholders at EA approving the sale? Do you think it will pass government regulators? Have thoughts on the whole sale, in general?
