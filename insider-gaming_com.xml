<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is bringing the neglected franchise back to life after a few years of dormancy, and we‚Äôve got all the details on whether the title is available through Game Pass.</p>



<p>Releasing on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 28</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trophy-list-all-achievement-trophy-differences-in-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full achievement list for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> shows details of the adventure that lies ahead of Solid Snake, though confirmation that<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-multiplayer-mode-doesnt-have-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the title doesn‚Äôt feature crossplay is a blow</a>.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôre on the fence about purchasing Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and are wondering if it will be included in a Game Pass subscription, we‚Äôve got all the details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Almost time. Image via Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will not be available through an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on August 28th.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/eu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is not a first-party Xbox title, which would result in automatic inclusion in the service, and there has not been any announcement of it landing on the service. As such, it won‚Äôt be included.</p>



<p>Microsoft has already announced the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-august-2025-wave-2-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second wave of August titles coming to Game Pass,</a> covering until the end of the month, and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater did not feature. If it was, it would‚Äôve been one of the highlights of the service, receiving a lot of attention.</p>







<p><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is unlikely to come to the Xbox Game Pass catalog in the future, and any inclusion would surely be quite far away.</strong></p>



<p>Virtuos, co-developer of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater alongside Konami, has released several titles on the Game Pass service in the past, though the final decision with this title will more than likely fall upon Konami.</p>



<p>Konami‚Äôs publishing on Xbox is much more limited, and their titles barely ever feature in the Game Pass catalog, so it seems unlikely that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will make an appearance in the library anytime soon. However, stranger things have happened.</p>



<p>If you do want to play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater on Xbox, the best approach is to purchase the game for launch.</p>

<p>EA‚Äôs long-awaited Skate sequel is in the works. We know it‚Äôs progressing well, and confirmation of this comes courtesy of the game‚Äôs X account, which has not only showcased its awesome cover art but also gone one step further and teased us with a tricky early access release date notice.</p>



<p>15 years‚Äîyes, FIFTEEN‚Äîyears have come and gone since Skate 3. EA released one of the most popular skating games in history. Then capitalized on this by‚Ä¶doing nothing. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eas-skate-does-not-have-an-offline-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skate</a> fans have had to wait a long time for a new game, and even then, development on the new Skate title has taken several years. However, the updates are coming thick and fast, including news on its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skate-promises-big-update-next-week-as-early-access-looms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early access release date</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-skate-early-access-release-date-coming-very-soon">Skate Early Access Release Date Coming Very Soon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We‚Äôre ready for the grind. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The official EA Skate <a href="https://x.com/skate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X page</a> has shown off the stunning new Skate art. The vibrant and almost pastel-like cover is a clean and smooth image, and is all the game cover needed to be. It‚Äôs a win-win in my books.</p>



<p>But even more eye-catching is the news of Skate‚Äôs early access release date. While the X account hasn‚Äôt let the info slip just yet, we know it‚Äôs arriving imminently: <strong>August 26</strong>, to be exact.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre stoked to reveal the official skate. cover art! Come back on Tuesday 8/26‚Ä¶we‚Äôre giving you the Early Access release date. See ya then,‚Äù said a post on Skate‚Äôs social media page.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is nearly upon us, and all eyes are cast towards the review scores, and we‚Äôve got the details on when the review embargo lifts.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases Sep</a>tember 4, and is included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription, with anticipation for the title reaching fever-pitch levels following the long-awaited release date announcement.</p>



<p>Whether you‚Äôre on the fence about playing or want to see how hyped everyone is for the launch of Hollow Knight: Silksong, here are all the review embargo details.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-review-embargo-date-explained">Hollow Knight: Silksong Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Almost here. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Hollow Knight: Silksong review embargo is expected to be September 4, when the game releases, with Team Cherry reportedly not distributing early codes.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg‚Äôs Jason Schreier</a> stated that Team Cherry is not planning on sending out early codes for Hollow Knight: Silksong, so players should not expect to see any reviews until after the September 4 launch.</p>



<p>This is because the developers ‚Äúfelt like it‚Äôd be unfair for critics to be playing before Kickstarter backers and other players,‚Äù though they are also a small team and it would take a lot of time to get codes and distribute them, particularly given the amount of work that lies ahead before the release.</p>



<p>Therefore, players shouldn‚Äôt expect to see any reviews published until the September 4 release, and, even then, the first drop may not be a full reflection of the game and may be an in-progress review as journalists, like everyone else, push through to complete the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-hollow-knight-silksong-scores-can-we-expect">What Hollow Knight: Silksong Scores Can we Expect?</h2>



<p><strong>Hype for Hollow Knight: Silksong has been in overdrive for a while, and, given the success of the first game, expect to see the sequel rate very highly.</strong></p>



<p>Our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a> resulted in a verdict that the title is well worth the wait, with no suggestion that Hollow Knight: Silksong will score poorly. In fact, it could end up being one of the most successful launches of the year, score-wise.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/hollow-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a> for the original Hollow Knight is impressively high, with an average of 90 from critic reviews, while the user score, based on 4,321 reviews, puts the game at 9.1.</p>



<p>Though the first game set a very high bar, we expect Silksong to follow suit with some equally impressive numbers to establish itself as one of the must-play titles of the year.</p>



<p>How highly rated are you expecting Hollow Knight: Silksong to be? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Years of waiting for Hollow Knight: Silksong are finally coming to a close with a release date announced, which may have alarmed those unsure of what platforms the title will release on, but we have all the details.</p>



<p>Set to land on September 4, our hands-on preview with Hollow Knight: Silksong showed it was well worth the wait, with years of development paying off.</p>



<p>With a release now on the horizon, here are all the details you need on the platforms that Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-ps5">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Almost here. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PlayStation 5 at launch.</strong></p>



<p>Silksong has one of the widest releases in recent years, touching almost every platform imaginable, and PS5 is set to take an important role. This is despite the fact that a lot of the marketing attention has been from Microsoft and Nintendo, which may have confused you into thinking it was platform-exclusive for the pair.</p>



<p>That isn‚Äôt the case, however, and Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PS5.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on Xbox Series X|S, with Microsoft having played a big role in marketing for the title.</strong></p>



<p>Not only will Silksong be available on the platform, but those with an active <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Pass subscription will be able to play Hollow Knight: Silksong on release</a> without paying an additional fee‚Äîperhaps giving Xbox an edge over other titles.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-pc">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on PC?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PC through various storefronts, so you can choose your favorite.</strong></p>



<p>Those with a PC Game Pass subscription will be able to play Hollow Knight: Silksong for no additional fee through the Xbox App, and you can add the title to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> launcher through this service, if you‚Äôd prefer.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-nintendo-switch">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on both the original Nintendo Switch console and Nintendo Switch 2 at launch.</strong></p>



<p>In fact, the Nintendo family of consoles will be the first to receive physical editions early in 2026, for those who want to add to their physical games library, before later releasing a physical version of Hollow Knight: Silksong on other platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hollow-knight-silksong-on-ps4-and-xbox-one">Can You Play Hollow Knight: Silksong on PS4 and Xbox One?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PS4 and Xbox One, meaning those yet to upgrade to current-gen consoles won‚Äôt miss out.</strong></p>



<p>Though it may come as a surprise that a huge title like Hollow Knight: Silksong is releasing on last-gen platforms, remember that the game has been in development for seven years. Therefore, development would have begun on these consoles before switching over to new-gen models.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 4 </a>release date has been announced, bringing an end to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">years of waiting</a>, and our hands-on preview showed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong is well worth the wait</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Yes, Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available with an Xbox Game Pass subscription immediately when it launches on September 4.</strong></p>



<p>Available on both Xbox Series X|S and PC, Hollow Knight: Silksong will undoubtedly be one of the biggest highlights in the Game Pass catalog in September, following on from an already impressive Wave 2 in August.</p>



<p>As it‚Äôs available at launch, it‚Äôs expected that Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on the Game Pass service indefinitely, although precise details have not been stated.

<p>I like to consider myself an avid gamer, and then I come across someone like ‚Äòtimpurnat‚Äô, who has just celebrated unlocking his 15,000th <strong>Platinum Trophy </strong>on the PlayStation Network. I don‚Äôt even dwindle in comparison; I‚Äôm a mere speck in timpurnat‚Äôs overwhelming universe of completion.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, timpurnat, self-proclaimed Trophy Hunter, revealed that he‚Äôd 100% completed 15,000 PlayStation games, hitting level 999 on PSN and securing a total of 387,000 individual Trophies in his bid to become the most completed PlayStation gamer in the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-one-from-top">One From Top</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/timpurnat/levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSN Profiles</a>, timpurnat sits in second place behind dav1d_123, <strong>but not by much</strong>. The number-one PlayStation gamer has 21,228,060 points on the platform with 15,489 Platinum Trophies, while timpurnat is in second place with 20,422,230 points and 15,020 Platinum Trophies.</p>



<p>Dav1d_123 boasts a <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/447928-most-playstation-platinum-trophies-won" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Guinness World Record</a> for the most verified Platinum Trophies, which he received in December 2023.</p>



<p>In timpurnat‚Äôs fight for the top spot, the gamer has completed 16,300 games with a completion rate of 99.23%, and has earned an average of 112.2 Trophies <strong>every day</strong>.</p>



<p>I don‚Äôt think I unlock 112.2 PlayStation Trophies <strong>a month</strong>.</p>



<p>These attributes have landed timpurnat with the number-one rank in his country, and the number-two rank <strong>in the world</strong>.</p>



<p>On social media, timpurnat can frequently be seen discussing his Platinum awards in sequence, offering a tidbit about the games that he uses to climb further up the leaderboard. Most recently, he wrote about his 14,929th Platinum, unlocked for Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nice music and easy platinum, I was surprised to see they made this one so much easier than previous entries. Even if you fail a song, you‚Äôre still progressing towards the platinum.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Timpurnat‚Äôs efforts enabled him to move up the charts on PSN Profiles, overtaking the gamer now in third place, ginko765.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-preview-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-duckov-preview-i-plucked-this-beak-biting-eggstraction-shooter-and-it%E2%80%99s-no-yolk.1279377/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you‚Äôd told me that one of the gems of my Gamescom experience would be a parody extraction shooter themed around <strong>birds</strong>, I‚Äôd probably have believed you, because I <strong>gel </strong>with games like Escape from Duckov. This title wins points for the name alone, but there‚Äôs <strong>a surprising </strong>amount of meat on this bird, even if it has a few glaring and somewhat fowl flaws.</p>



<p>I promise I‚Äôll stop the bird-related puns now.</p>



<p>Join me and we‚Äôll take flight (sorry) with a full Escape from Duckov preview, pecking away (sorry) at the layers of this developing game that might just hatch (sorry) into something beautiful.</p>



<h2 id="h-extreme-bird-bashing-action">Extreme Bird Bashing Action</h2>



<p>Following my week at Gamescom, I sat down with a demo of Escape from Duckov and took a deep dive into everything this satirical extraction shooter has to offer. What I wasn‚Äôt expecting was a thoroughly enjoyable game that‚Äôs a little rough around the edges but stacked with hilarious potential.</p>



<p>In Escape from Duckov, you control <strong>a bird</strong>. When you start playing the game, you‚Äôre able to customise your bird, opting to pick a pre-designed all-yellow chick or create something utterly bizarre. The sliders give you full freedom to flex your imagination, and the resulting build can see you becoming <strong>a walking beak</strong>.</p>



<p>I mean‚Ä¶</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>When you‚Äôre ready to go, you‚Äôre plunged into the world of Escape from Duckov, which is, of course, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-release-date-revealed-game-is-not-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently received a full release date</a> after eight years in beta.</p>



<p>In Escape from Duckov, you follow a simple gameplay loop:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enter the world</li>



<li>Loot, shoot, and survive</li>



<li>Extract again</li>



<li>Rinse and repeat</li>
</ul>



<p>As you explore the small, cartoony, and charming maps, you‚Äôll find a vast variety of items that you can use to build stations and creature comforts in your hideout, sell to traders, or use to complete quests. There are stacks of side missions to complete, which are represented by a relatively diverse selection of objectives.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="It‚Äôs a perfect day for an adventure! | ESCAPE FROM DUCKOV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-VqL4FBFrY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I was genuinely surprised by how <strong>violent </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-competitor-duckov-new-trailer/">Escape from Duckov</a> is. Taking a bat or a gun and attacking enemies (dogs and other birds) results in an explosion of blood and gore, which dissipates to reveal something that resembles a cooked chicken on a plate, which is the ‚Äòloot box‚Äô of defeated enemies.</p>



<p>If you die at any point, the typical extraction shooter formula kicks in and you‚Äôre booted back to your hideout, which in this case is a bunker. You‚Äôll have lost everything you took with you and picked up, but you‚Äôve got a chance to run back to where you died and collect your dropped gear.</p>



<h2 id="h-similarities-run-deep">Similarities Run Deep</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Escape from Duckov is a carbon copy of Escape from Tarkov in <strong>many ways</strong>. First, there‚Äôs the name ‚Äì that‚Äôs pretty obvious. As I played, I noticed themes, iconography, mechanics, and even <strong>map names </strong>that mimicked Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>The opening map is named Ground Zero, which is one of the ‚Äòstarter maps‚Äô in Escape from Tarkov. Many of the weapons, such as the PM Pistol, AKS74, and TOZ shotgun, are mainstays in Escape from Tarkov, and Duckov players escape their raid by finding a green flare and standing in a zone for a few seconds, which is <strong>identical </strong>to most Tarkov extractions.</p>



<p>Even the trader, stash, and mission systems are reminiscent of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Because of all this, it‚Äôs impossible to take Escape from Duckov seriously, no matter how entertaining the gameplay loop is or how genuinely satisfying the combat is.</p>



<p>There are differences, of course.</p>



<p>Escape from Duckov utilizes a ‚Äòtop-down‚Äô kind of perspective, while Tarkov is a first-person shooter. Duckov also has a ‚Äòfog of war‚Äô mechanic on higher difficulty levels, which means you can only see in the direction your character is facing. On that note, it‚Äôs important to stress that Duckov has several difficulty tiers to suit the individual playing the game.</p>



<p>Also, Escape from Duckov is (for now) entirely single-player.</p>



<h2 id="h-imperfection">Imperfection</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Escape from Duckov shines in some areas, such as the charming visual palette, the combat mechanics, and the customization elements, plus you get to run around with a puppy dog companion, which is fantastic. The hideout building system shows great promise, and there are plenty of tasks to complete, even at a demo level.</p>



<p>I also know that expansions, including new maps, are already planned.</p>



<p>However, the demo was riddled with issues related to the UI, menus, and accessibility elements like subtitles. Many tasks and conversations had their subtitles replaced with placeholder text, which is pretty tough considering the game isn‚Äôt voiced. The difficulty balancing is also a little skewed at times.</p>



<p>There are a few elements in Escape from Duckov that don‚Äôt make much sense. For instance, you can find teleportation points around the map that shoot you across the way to another site for no real reason. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs <strong>something </strong>in there to explain why these exist, but I‚Äôve not noticed anything yet.</p>



<p>I can‚Äôt see anyone sinking more than a few hours into Escape from Duckov, but it would do much better if it had PvP features woven into it. Perhaps that‚Äôs a deliverable further down the line after basic considerations like subtitles and a clean UI.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-preview-witcher-coded-vampirism/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blood-of-dawnwalker-preview-witcher-coded-but-laced-with-stunning-vampirism.1279344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I was ushered into a replication of Svartrau Cathedral at Gamescom and sat down before a screen to experience half an hour of live gameplay from The Blood of Dawnwalker. This vampiric debut title from Rebel Wolves has sat firmly on my radar since the studio was opened, and I was beyond excited to finally see it unfold before my eyes.</p>



<p>In a guided segment, I saw combat, exploration, puzzle-solving, and cinematic sequences unravel, with the Rebel Wolves team showcasing as much of The Blood of Dawnwalker as possible in a relatively short window.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs my full preview based on that presentation.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-will-rival-the-witcher">The Blood of Dawnwalker Will Rival The Witcher</h2>



<p>Rebel Wolves took me deep into a reimagination of 14th-century Europe, complete with Gothic architecture aplenty, dark and foreboding streets, and mythical themes of monsters lurking in the shadows. I quickly learned that our hero, Coen, is one of those monsters, cursed with vampiric powers and a bloodthirsty mission to save his family before a ticking clock runs out.</p>



<p>The demo started some ways into the game, with Coen already boasting many upgrades and being around a third through his ‚Äòtime limit‚Äô to rescue his family before the worst could happen.</p>



<p>Instantly, I could see how ‚ÄòWitcher-coded‚Äô The Blood of Dawnwalker is. This game comes from Rebel Wolves, an all-new studio made up of a mix of talent, much of which has worked extensively on CDPR‚Äôs The Witcher franchise in recent years.</p>



<p>It was almost inevitable, but much of the UI, the combat mechanics, menus, and even music are deeply reminiscent of The Witcher. That‚Äôs not a bad thing, but it <strong>might </strong>harm Dawnwalker down the line when it‚Äôs trying to stand apart from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-witcher-4-trailer-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games like The Witcher 4</a>.</p>



<p>I can honestly say that, if nothing else, Dawnwalker will be <strong>a strong rival </strong>to The Witcher. The hybrid action-RPG flow of the game promotes skill paths and brutal combat sequences unfolding in real-time, and the addition of vampirism only makes the game more visceral and visually incredible.</p>



<p>As I watched the Blood of Dawnwalker preview, I saw Coen walk up walls as though they were floors, dart between rooftops as a cloud of smoke, and dispatch enemies with gnashing teeth and slashing claws. This is his <strong>night form</strong>, and it‚Äôs remarkable to behold.</p>



<p>In the daytime, Coen is much more human and relies more readily on swords, daggers, and traditional approaches to navigate the game‚Äôs open world environment.</p>



<p>I was pleased to note that very few bugs were present in the demo, despite Rebel Wolves offering a disclaimer warning us of the possibility. I noticed <strong>one </strong>issue, and that was when Coen chopped off an enemy‚Äôs head, and it proceeded to float away like a balloon.</p>



<h2 id="h-coen-is-already-memorable">Coen is Already Memorable</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>I found myself pulled in by Coen‚Äôs story, aided by the reiteration of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-first-trailer-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cinematic trailer</a> that was used to unveil Rebel Wolves‚Äô The Blood of Dawnwalker in the first place. I‚Äôve always been a fan of vampire-themed tales, and Blood of Dawnwalker hits the nail on the head in that respect.</p>



<p>As the minutes ticked by, I watched a Rebel Wolves representative explore Svartrau, hunting for a powerful sword that would be a key tool in the fight against the vampiric overlords who had claimed Coen‚Äôs family. The journey took me from a gorgeous and thriving cityscape to catacombs and tombs beneath the bustling streets.</p>



<p>I was informed that while players have a ‚Äòtime limit‚Äô, Rebel Wolves have cleverly employed control tactics to make sure users can still enjoy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-devs-quality-not-quantity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything on offer in Blood of Dawnwalker</a>. The clock will only tick down when certain tasks are completed, and you can see ahead of time how much a certain action will cost you. It‚Äôs a very transparent system, and I like it already.</p>



<p>As the Blood of Dawnwalker preview came to an end, I watched a tense boss fight unfold, with Coen battling Mihai, a long-forgotten soul trapped by betrayers hundreds of years before. He uses similar techniques to Coen, which makes the fight a relatively matched battle.</p>



<p>This is where we learn more about the Dawnwalker lore, understanding how important a character Coen is and how unique his condition is to the world around him.</p>



<p>I can already promise you that Blood of Dawnwalker is now one of my most highly anticipated titles. It might remind everyone who plays it of The Witcher, but in many ways, it‚Äôs doing certain things <strong>better </strong>than CDPR, and both Dawnwalker and The Witcher 4 can exist happily in the same space.</p>



<p>Blood of Dawnwalker is slated for release in 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p>

<p>Are you hunting for Roblox Steal a Brainrot codes?</p>



<p>Steal a Brainrot is the most popular game on Roblox right now, tying in terms of player record with Grow a Garden. In Steal a Brainrot, players do exactly that ‚Äì <strong>they steal Brainrots</strong>. If you‚Äôre enjoying this insanely popular game and are hunting for all Steal a Brainrot codes and rewards that are active <strong>now</strong>, look no further than this guide.</p>



<p>Below, I‚Äôve captured every Steal a Brainrot code so you can unlock all the key benefits and rewards in a matter of seconds. If you‚Äôve been trying to figure out how to use Steal a Brainrot codes, I‚Äôve covered that too.</p>



<p>Read on to see all the latest Steal a Brainrot codes.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-steal-a-brainrot-code-in-roblox-august-2025">Every Steal a Brainrot Code in Roblox (August 2025)</h2>



<p><strong>It might sound bizarre, but there are no Steal a Brainrot codes in August 2025</strong>. Since the game was released, the developer ‚ÄòBrazilian Spyder‚Äô has neglected to provide a function for redeeming any reward codes in Steal a Brainrot.</p>



<p>The only way you can unlock Brainrots in this game is to steal them from other players, which is the core gameplay loop of Steal a Brainrot.</p>



<h3 id="h-will-steal-a-brainrot-ever-have-rewards">Will Steal a Brainrot Ever Have Rewards?</h3>



<p>It‚Äôs a good question, and I‚Äôd like to say for sure one way or another, but it‚Äôs entirely up to the developer.</p>



<p>Grow a Garden, one of the most popular games ever introduced to the Roblox platform, has <strong>plenty of codes </strong>for players to activate and soak up, but Steal a Brainrot just doesn‚Äôt follow suit. There are no codes in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/109983668079237/Steal-a-Brainrot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steal a Brainrot</a>, nor is there any way to redeem them.</p>



<p><strong>Yet.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-secrets-in-steal-a-brainrot">How to Get Secrets in Steal a Brainrot</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As there are no Steal a Brainrot codes, you‚Äôre restricted to two methods when it comes to getting secret characters in Steal a Brainrot:</p>



<ul>
<li>Purchasing them using earned cash</li>



<li>Stealing them from other players</li>
</ul>



<p>Most players follow a ‚Äòserver jump‚Äô tactic to enter a server, scan for valuable secrets, and then steal them when the owners aren‚Äôt looking. If there are no valuable secrets on a given server, players just complete a jump to another one.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôre going hard on stealing Brainrots from other players, you‚Äôll need to buy gear to help you trap them.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you can try using a private server combined with a conveyor belt to hopefully roll a valuable secret character.</p>



<h3 id="h-most-valuable-secret-brainrots-in-steal-a-brainrot">Most Valuable Secret Brainrots in Steal a Brainrot</h3>



<p>Here are some of the most valuable secret characters in Steal a Brainrot. Be aware that the values might have changed since this guide was published:</p>



<ul>
<li>Garama and Madundung (10 Billion)</li>



<li>Nuclearo Dinossauro (2.5 Billion)</li>



<li>La Grande Combinasion (1 Billion)</li>



<li>Chicleteira Bicicleteira (750 Million)</li>
</ul>



<p>Let me know below or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what your most valuable Brainrot is.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-steal-a-brainrot-rewards">Where to Find Steal a Brainrot Rewards</h2>



<p>The best way to find Steal a Brainrot codes is to keep this page bookmarked and check back regularly. Failing that, you can join the Brazilian Spyder Discord server for the game and hope that the developers announce the addition of a Steal a Brainrot codes function in Roblox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tens of millions of players have flocked to Roblox this weekend to participate in a special, limited-time event backed by the two biggest games in the Roblox ecosystem. Grow a Garden, joined by the more recently successful Steal a Brainrot, have linked forces in an ‚ÄòAdmin War‚Äô event that pushed Roblox‚Äôs concurrent player count to <strong>47 MILLION+</strong>.</p>



<p>This shatters the previous record set in June, originally spearheaded by <strong>just </strong>Grow a Garden. Steal a Brainrot is the latest monumental success in the Roblox space, and it continues to soar.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-admin-war-in-roblox">What is the Admin War in Roblox?</h2>



<p>On social media, Jandel (<em>Grow a Garden</em>) and SpyderSammy (<em>Steal a Brainrot</em>) have been engaged in a digital beef to promote an Admin War event in Roblox. This event has propelled Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot to the top of the charts and the history books alike, with more than <strong>30 million concurrent players </strong>enjoying these two games alone.</p>



<p>This has now cemented Roblox as boasting the record for the highest CCU in gaming history.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365329529675882496/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on LinkedIn</a>, Roblox Strategist James Purell noted that the recent PR issues that have set Roblox alight are doing nothing to slow the platform‚Äôs growth:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>Now Roblox is officially the largest gaming platform by concurrent users and also holds the record for highest CCU game in the world.</p><p>While Roblox corporate deals with PR issues, developers like Jandel and Sammy are building experiences that millions of kids can‚Äôt stop playing. They‚Äôre the ones pushing the platform forward with innovation and community building.</p><p>Yes, Roblox 100% needs to do better on safety, but these developers are creating the content that keeps 47M people engaged. They‚Äôre the real engine behind the numbers ‚Äì not Roblox corporate.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>In a similar sentiment, Atlas Creative‚Äôs CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaelherriger_roblox-hit-47-million-concurrent-users-this-activity-7365080265284567040-tD_J/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Michael Herriger</a>, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The future of gaming is happening right in front of us. Great job to all the devs and for Roblox for propping up great games.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>No game on the market can come close to Roblox right now, which is <strong>technically </strong>more of an ecosystem than a single title. It‚Äôs unfair to refer to Roblox as ‚Äòa game‚Äô when it‚Äôs the most diverse UGC-backed universe in the industry.</p>



<p>Those taking part in the Admin War between Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot are picking their side and soaking up the special event before the weekend is up and things return to normal.</p>



<p>Which side did you pick in the war between Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
