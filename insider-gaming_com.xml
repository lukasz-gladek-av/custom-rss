<p>The mobile esports world is about to get a considerable amount more impressive, as Ubisoft has just announced the impending release date for Rainbow Six Mobile. The long-awaited launch of the game comes more than three years after it was revealed, and it’s set to arrive on February 23, 2026.</p>



<p>It won’t be a staggered deployment, either. The game will be released globally on that day. Reportedly, the delay in producing this game comes from years of testing and preparation, so that Ubisoft can launch a game that’s as stable and ‘esports-ready’ as possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-mobile-coming-soon">Rainbow Six Mobile Coming Soon</h2>



<p>In a short trailer uploaded hours ago, Ubisoft unveiled the release date for Rainbow Six Mobile, the eagerly anticipated handheld version of the company’s flagship first-person shooter.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has dominated the market for a decade, standing firm as one of the top esports games around. It’ll now expand on that notion with a handheld version.</p>



<p>In November 2024, Ubisoft held a soft launch for Rainbow Six Mobile, kick-starting a series of technical tests in specific territories to start bedding in the game. Now that the game is fleshed out with new operators and some fresh content, they’ve decided to blast off with a global launch next February.</p>



<p>If you live in Canada, France, Poland, and the LATAM regions, you can download and play Rainbow Six Mobile now, but it’ll be a bit of a test product. It has proven to be a hit in those territories, so it’s only fair that Ubisoft now pushes the game out to a much wider audience.</p>



<p>This free-to-play mobile game has been turning heads in those regions, and now it’s time to go global. Will you be playing? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The second season of Prime Video’s Fallout got its reviews today, and they are quite favorable. Even more so, the Bethesda series’ sophomore season has beaten the first season’s Rotten Tomatoes score by a good bit.</p>



<p>Despite the ‘video game adaptation curse’, Prime Video’s Fallout beat the odds seemingly out of nowhere. Based on the post-apocalyptic worlds from Bethesda, the show captured what made the games special with a delightful mix of comedy and action. Released in 2024, it became a smash hit, even earning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-won-emmy-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Primetime Emmy nominations</a> like Best Drama and Best Drama Actor for Walton Goggins. It was clear a new season was in order, and, as of writing, the first episode is available to watch. Critics have already seen most of what the show has to offer and, if what Rotten Tomatoes rates is true, it outdoes the first season in a big way. </p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-season-2-certified-fresh-at-97-on-rotten-tomatoes-4-higher-than-first">Fallout Season 2 Certified Fresh at 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, 4% Higher than First</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/fallout/s02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, which collects all available reviews for media, Fallout Season 2 received a 97% rating. With 39 reviews, it is now Certified Fresh. While the score can change as more reviews come in, the second season outperformed the first by 4%. Fallout Season 1 scored an impressive 93% with over 133 reviews. </p>



<p>The better score does bode well for the series’ second outing. Fallout Season 2 continues the story of Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus as the world expands to New Vegas. Its impressive accolades and numbers for Prime Video have already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-3-possibly-filming-summer-2026-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greenlit it for a third season</a>, which aims to film in Summer 2026. It is quite rare for a game adaptation to get another shot, much less be better than the first. Fortunately, Prime Video’s Fallout has done just that, ensuring fans will have some treats in store for the series.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Expected To Reject Paramount’s Latest Offer, Sticking With Netflix]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-expected-to-reject-paramounts-latest-offer-sticking-with-netflix/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the latest development in the saga between Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix, and Paramount, it appears that WBD is sticking with its original agreement with Netflix.</p>



<p>According to a new report from Bloomberg, the WBD Board of Directors is planning on telling investors to reject Paramount’s latest bid for the company. The report states that the Board’s decision is based on what they believe to be a better offer from Netflix.</p>







<p>“After deliberating and reviewing the Paramount bid, the Warner Bros. board still views the company’s existing agreement with&nbsp;Netflix Inc.&nbsp;as offering greater value, certainty and terms than what Paramount has proposed,” the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/warner-bros-said-to-prep-paramount-rejection-on-funding-terms?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> (paywall) reads.</p>



<p>WBD and Netflix <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced a deal</a> that would see the Warner side of the company be acquired in a deal worth $82.7 billion in total enterprise value and $27.75 per share. The Paramount proposal, that came after the Netflix deal was announce, was for the entirety of the company for $30 per share. That offer seemingly put the value of the television networks and other aspects of the company at a value of just $2.25 per share, if you want to keep the same $27.75 value of the WBD Streaming &amp; Services side.</p>







<p>The news of the rejection shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Not long after receiving the “hostile” and “unsolicited” offer from Paramount, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-paramount-offer-warner-bros-wont-change-netflix-sale-recommendation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WBD release stated</a> that the board wouldn’t be “modifying its recommendation” of the Netflix deal.</p>



<p>It should be mentioned, however, that just because the Board recommends the Netflix deal be chosen, there is always the possibility that the investors vote otherwise. If the Netflix deal moves forward, however, the streaming giant’s acquisition of Warner Bros. is planned to close after WBD completes its split into two companies in 2026. Should that happen, Netflix would own all of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros. Games properties</a>, including Mortal Kombat, DC, Harry Potter, and more. </p>
