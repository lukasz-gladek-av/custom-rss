<p>Surgent Studios, the creator behind Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, has unveiled Project Uso, the next game in the multimedia universe pioneered by the creative mind of Abubakar Salim. In a release issued by Surgent today, it was confirmed that Project Uso will be ‚Äòdarker and more visceral than our debut game.‚Äô</p>



<p>It‚Äôs a return to Kenzera but in a completely alternate aesthetic. Project Uso will be centred around a ‚Äòvampiric android‚Äô that‚Äôs designed to house the spirits of the deceased. It‚Äôs set to be a crossover between a choice-driven RPG and an ‚Äòelectrifying‚Äô beat-em-up.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-next-chapter">The Next Chapter</h2>



<p>Recently, Surgent Studios was in the news following the revelation that the games branch of the firm had been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-studios-game-division-redundancies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put on notice of potential redundancy</a>. This news came amid financial struggles and a lack of funding for future projects ‚Äì including Project Uso.</p>



<p>The press release published by Surgent Studios to mark the announcement of Project Uso bore that message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Surgent Studios has developed a fully-functional prototype of PROJECT USO and is actively seeking a partner to bring it to life.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a statement attached to the press release, Surgent‚Äôs founder, Abubakar Salim, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Project Uso is set to be darker and more visceral than our debut game. Where ZAU is about dealing with death in a healthy way, USO is about letting your fear of death consume you. Inspiration struck following the birth of my daughter, when I grappled with a crisis of identity as I took on the role of parent for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Similarly, the concept for Tales of Kenzera: ZAU came about when Salim was wrestling with the untimely loss of his father and trying desperately to figure out how to cope with the grief that followed.</p>



<p>In Uso, players will assume control of a unique RPG system created by Surgent. They‚Äôll have ‚Äòthe powers of an android and a god at their disposal‚Äô, given that the protagonist houses the spirit of Eshu, ‚Äòthe god of chaos‚Äô. </p>



<p>At first blush, it sounds a little deeper than ZAU in terms of gameplay mechanics, and the choice-based features should add a little more variety and replayability, whereas ZAU was much more linear and one-track. Project Uso is also set ‚Äòdecades‚Äô after ZAU, so the world is much more advanced.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs hoping Surgent manages to find a partner to help produce Project Uso.</p>

<p>The VCT Spotlight Series has officially concluded, crowning GIANTX as the winner. The popular co-ed tournament series was developed to give fans competitive Valorant action during the off-season. With 14 teams participating and a decent-sized prize pool, the series ended with quite a bang.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-vct-spotlight-series-concludes-with-giantx-taking-first-place">VCT Spotlight Series Concludes With GIANTX Taking First Place</h2>



<p>The VCT Spotlight series began back on October 10, 2024, and concluded today, October 24. Held in Paris, the event featured 14 co-ed teams formed from some of the best organizations within the VCT.</p>



<p>From G2 Esports to Karmine Corp, the VCT Spotlight Series was stacked with Valorant talent, and fans were able to witness both women and male competitors face off against one another. </p>



<p>Each team had both women and male members from its roster team up to face off against other organizations with a $32,000 prize pool on the line. In the end, however, GIANTX was able to take home first place by beating G2 Esports in a 3-1 victory.</p>



<p>The organization took to Twitter earlier today to post: ‚ÄúWe have taken our revenge and made history by winning the first VCT EMEA mixed competition.‚Äù</p>

<p>History was in fact made, and it will be interesting to see how to organization performs next year. </p>

<h2 id="h-prize-pool-competing-teams-and-more">Prize Pool, Competing Teams and More</h2>



<p>The event marks a victorious era in competitive Valorant content, showing that normal tournaments are not the only types of tournaments here to stay. </p>



<p>With a $32,000 prize pool, GIANTX was able to walk away with $16,000. G2 Esports, who finished in second, left the tournament series with almost $11,000 in winnings. </p>



<h4 id="h-all-competing-teams">All Competing Teams:</h4>

<p>What‚Äôs even cooler is the fact that the event had 26 different nationalities represented by the players. These included Germany, the United States, Palestine and more.</p>



<p>With the event being extremely successful, it will be exciting to see if the prize pool rises for next year‚Äôs tournament.</p>
