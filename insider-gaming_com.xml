<p>It’s not just the original Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic that was getting the remake treatment. According to a new report, the game’s sequel, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords, also had a remake in development.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest edition of the GameFile newsletter</a>, Stephen Totillo dove into the game’s release on the Nintendo Switch. He writes about the fact that a planned console release for the Restored Content Mod was announced and planned, but never was released. That’s because, according to filings, Disney’s lawyers put a “blocker in place”.</p>







<p>That blocker was <strong>“a prohibition on releasing the Restored Content DLC for Switch without further clearances around who actually made the mod.”</strong> As Totillo wrote, it was an “insurmountable” roadblock that stopped it from ever coming with an official announcement on the matter happening in 2023. </p>



<p>As Totillo went further into what happened on the legal side that prevented it from releasing, he found that there was another project at developer Aspyr. Codenamed Juliet, it was a “full, modern remake” of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords. </p>



<p>This remake, it’s said, was in development as recently as March 2025. It was also set to have all of the cut content back in the game.</p>
