<p>Nintendo has recently updated its detachable dual-screen patent. </p>



<p>Nintendo and patents are two words that we have been listening to together constantly for the past couple of months, however, not for the reasons you would expect. The patents in question relate to the Palworld lawsuit, with Nintendo recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-modifies-patent-amid-ongoing-palworld-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modifying one</a> of them. However, the new update is for a hardware tech, rather than a game. </p>

<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/548389/article/nintendo-updated-their-detachable-dual-screen-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, Mike Odyssey on <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1956093315931365493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) informed players about the update on Nintendo’s detachable dual-screen patent. Their post reveals that the update was released yesterday, August 14, 2025, accompanied by new images. These images illustrate how the detachable screen connects to the primary device and also showcase the spring mechanism and various buttons that will be used on the device. </p>

<p>For those wondering, the patent regarding Nintendo’s detachable second screen was seen first in 2023. At that time, many players speculated that Nintendo could be returning to its roots with the Switch 2, introducing a DS-like second screen that could be detached when not in use. However, the Switch 2 has now been released, and we have yet to see any announcements for this detachable screen. </p>



<p>In other news, a new claim states that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-wont-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not be available</a> on the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch. Additionally, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-lookalike-appears-on-nintendo-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palworld lookalike</a> has been spotted on Nintendo’s store.
