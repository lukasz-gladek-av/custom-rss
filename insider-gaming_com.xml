<p>It’s a fact of the franchise that you don’t have to explore the wastelands of Fallout alone. There’s always the option of roaming the open, desolate world with a companion by your side, be that a human, robot, or animal companion. There are dozens of memorable partners stretched across the entire series, but in this list, we’re breaking down the 10 best Fallout companions <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>Does your favourite Fallout companion make the list? Let me know in the comments.</p>



<h2 id="h-greatest-fallout-companions-ever">Greatest Fallout Companions Ever</h2>



<p>It was tough to narrow this list down to just the 10 best Fallout companions, but we did it. If your all-time favourite companion didn’t make the list, let us know in the comments and perhaps we’ll see where they can fit into the line-up. It’s worth stressing that this list isn’t a ranking; it’s just collectively the 10 best Fallout companions ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-dogmeat-fallout-4">1. Dogmeat (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dogmeat is a Fallout staple, having been introduced to the series back in 1997, in the first-ever game. This lovable pup resurfaced in Fallout 3 (2008), and then again in Fallout 4 (2015) – but it’s that latter title in which this canine companion made the most lasting impression on the player. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-boone-fallout-new-vegas">2. Boone (Fallout: New Vegas)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Boone’s story is one of heartbreak, revenge, and devastation, and that’s why he’s one of the best Fallout companions ever. In Boone, you’re not just getting a crack-shot sniper, you’re getting an emotional sub-story that will stay with you long after you’ve decided who gets ownership of The Strip.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-paladin-danse-fallout-4">3. Paladin Danse (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Like Boone, Paladin Danse is a well-trained soldier with an emotional story wrapped around him, only you don’t know that when you first meet him in Fallout 4. While journeying with Danse, you’ll uncover a crushing secret that could devastate or inspire you to change how you think about the rest of the game. </p>



<h3 id="h-4-goris-fallout-2">4. Goris (Fallout 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s right, once upon a time, Fallout players could travel the Wasteland side-by-side with a sentient, intelligent Deathclaw by the name of Goris. From a band of Deathclaws turned hyper-intelligent comes Goris, a <strong>kind </strong>creature that attempts to hide his gruesome appearance by shrouding himself under a robe. Hint: it doesn’t work.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-strong-fallout-4">5. Strong (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Strong is iconic and one of the best Fallout companions for one reason – he bucks the trend. He’s a Super Mutant with a curious streak; a desire to seek out the ‘milk of human kindness’ and evaluate the human race at large. He’s not the first Super Mutant companion in Fallout, but he certainly is a memorable one.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-marcus-fallout-2">6. Marcus (Fallout 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>From one Super Mutant to another, we now come to Marcus, one of the few Fallout characters who has made an appearance in more than one game. In Fallout 2, the player can pair up with Marcus, an unusually intelligent and inspirational Super Mutant with a perfectly normal, reasonable personality. He resurfaces in Fallout: New Vegas, but cannot be recruited.</p>

<h3 id="h-7-maccready-fallout-4">7. MacCready (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Like Marcus, MacCready can be found in two different Fallout games – but he’s a less recognisable character. In Fallout 3, MacCready is the mayor of Little Lamplight, the cave in which a band of children survives the nuclear wastes. He reappears in Fallout 4, which is set around ten years later, as a well-honed marksman with a dark backstory.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-nick-valentine-fallout-4">8. Nick Valentine (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nick Valentine is crucial to progressing the core story of Fallout 4, and because of that, he’s vital to the player’s presence in the game. He’s also one of the most interesting characters in Fallout and easily one of the best Fallout companions ever. He’s a synth that’s accepted by the survivors of the Commonwealth, which is no easy feat, and his psyche is that of a classic private eye – an old-school detective. </p>







<h3 id="h-9-charon-fallout-3">9. Charon (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Charon is a super-effective, hyper-powerful Ghoul combatant with not much say but plenty of damage to dish out. He’s a machine, making use of a devastating shotgun to wreak havoc in a fight, but in true Fallout 3 fashion, he’s not invincible and can permanently die if you’re not careful. He’s one of the best companions in Fallout 3, without any doubt.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-ed-e-fallout-new-vegas">10. ED-E (Fallout: New Vegas)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>ED-E is a simple, charming robot with barely any personality whatsoever, and despite being a relatively passive companion, ED-E boasts some great boosts and one of the most curious and subtly complex side quests in New Vegas. ED-E is a permanent companion, cannot be killed, and can repair things at the press of a button – that’s not bad for a broken robot discarded in the town of Primm.</p>
