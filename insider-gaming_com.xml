<p>Amongst all the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-settings-and-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous settings you can tinker with in Counter-Strike 2</a>, there’s arguably none more important than your crosshair. Crosshairs in CS2 can take on different forms, shapes, or sizes, and finding the right one for you is of the utmost importance.</p>



<p>Of course, what can be considered the “best” CS2 crosshair may not be the best for you, as it comes down to personal preference. But if you look at some of the most popular crosshairs in CS2, amongst long-time competitive players and pros, you’ll see some similar traits.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-cs2-crosshair">What is The Best CS2 Crosshair?</h2>



<p><strong>A small, static, compact crosshair that’s green and/or blue in color</strong> is very popular amongst pro players. Some pros use subtle variations like a yellow or white color, a center dot, or a larger gap between the lines. Very few players use a dynamic crosshair that shows movement and firing accuracy, but that accuracy indicator could be good for newer players.</p>



<p>This kind of crosshair is popular because the green/blue color often doesn’t blend in with any background you come across. The smaller, more compact design makes it so it doesn’t block your view, and makes it easier to hit headshot.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The best place to look and tryout different crosshairs a Steam Workshop mod called <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3070193546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">crashz’ Crosshair Generator</a>. This mod features a full wall of 80 crosshairs from pro players from the best teams in the world, plus some used by popular content creators. Additionally, there’s a crosshair editor tool that lets you tweak crosshair length, thickness, spacing, color, and opacity until you get it just right.</p>



<p>To try out a crosshair in crashz’ Crosshair Generator, just shoot it on the wall. If you don’t like it, you can shoot the Restore Crosshair button the manager window next to it. You can also exit the room to practice against bots or watermelons. Once you’ve settled on a crosshair.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-crosshair-codes">Best CS2 Crosshair Codes</h2>



<p>If you’d rather just borrow a crosshair directly from one of the best CS2 players in the world, you can do that too. CS2 lets you paste a code that transfers a complete crosshair into your game. To upload a crosshair code in CS2, go to Settings, then to Game, and then Crosshair. Click Share or Import on the crosshair display banner, then copy the code in and click Import.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Please note that some pro players change or alter their crosshairs regularly, so these may not be completely current:</p>



<h3 id="h-donk-s-crosshair-code">Donk’s Crosshair Code</h3>



<ul>
<li>CSGO-KTaY3-rXci2-9DTXB-aPuKV-MDr7C</li>



<li>Small, compact, and perfect for headshots. Used by the consensus best CS2 player of 2024 and reigning Major winner</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-zywoo-s-crosshair-code">ZywOo’s Crosshair Code</h3>



<ul>
<li>CSGO-t3F8R-3M9vV-qVikH-JF3PV-9mUCP</li>



<li>Slightly longer and thinner crosshair lines</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-m0nesy-s-crosshair-code">m0NESY’s Crosshair Code</h3>



<ul>
<li>CSGO-8nb3d-Et6WE-QsF6B-V3E7j-WphrM</li>



<li>Similar to donk’s </li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-s1mple-s-crosshair-code">s1mple’s Crosshair Code</h3>



<ul>
<li>CSGO-eoS6N-bA6zC-xUAQn-s3RfJ-zPFuA</li>



<li>Also small and compact, but uses yellow color</li>
</ul>



<p>As a reminder, just because some of the best players in the world use a CS2 crosshair, it doesn’t mean it’s the best for you. It will take some getting used to any crosshair before you finally settle on one, and even then you should be open to tweaking it over time.</p>

<p>The last couple of years in the games industry have been rocky, to say the least. From thousands of layoffs to studio closures and from the cancellation of dozens of projects to controversies left, right, and centre, it has been a tumultuous time for gamers and industry workers worldwide.</p>



<p>One organisation that’s thinking positively about the immediate future is G2A, the <strong>world’s largest marketplace for digital gaming products</strong>. Recently, I had the opportunity to catch up again with the company’s CEO and Co-founder, Bartosz Skwarczek, to talk about his optimism for the year ahead.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-gearing-up-for-a-breakthrough">‘Gearing Up For a Breakthrough’</h2>



<p>Following the struggles of the last 24 months or so, I was eager to see what Bartosz thought about the state of play for the games industry in 2025. This could be one of the most lucrative years on record, with some new hardware and <strong>massive </strong>titles set to hit the shelves.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>After the challenges of the past few years, 2025 holds significant growth potential, with innovation driving us forward. <strong>The reset button has been hit</strong>, and the industry is <strong>gearing up for a breakthrough</strong>. I believe we’re about to see a rebound in the gaming industry. </em></p>



<p><em>With exciting new hardware like the Nintendo Switch 2, game releases such as Death Stranding 2, Ghost of Yotei, Monster Hunter Wilds, Last Sentinel, and the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI on the horizon, the gaming sector is on the brink of a major breakthrough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>One area that’s expected to shine and continue to grow over the next twelve months is <strong>AI in gaming</strong>. It’s no big secret that plenty of developers have integrated AI-driven processes and protocols into their operating models, but Bartosz believes this is only the beginning.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>While there is much anticipation for upcoming game releases, an equally significant development is <strong>the growing integration of AI</strong> in game creation. A recent report from CVL Economics highlights that the gaming industry has embraced generative AI more extensively than other creative sectors, such as television, film, or music.</em></p>



<p><em>This technology offers transformative opportunities, enabling faster asset creation, dynamic content and story generation, and improved financial stability for developers. However, <strong>it also presents challenges</strong>, particularly concerning employees’ roles in the gaming industry, as automation reshapes traditional workflows and raises questions about the future of creative jobs. Balancing innovation with workforce sustainability will be key as the industry evolves.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I was also keen to get Bartosz’s thoughts about the layoffs that have been commonplace and widespread across the industry over the last couple of years. It feels as though nobody is safe these days, and the impact that these vast waves of redundancies have had on the wider industry has marred the face of the market.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>The layoffs we’ve seen <strong>have left a sense of uncertainty</strong> that won’t fade overnight—and while confidence may take time to rebuild, this reset is creating opportunities to rethink how we develop, play, and connect through games.</em></p>
</blockquote>
