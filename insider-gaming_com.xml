            <title><![CDATA[Team Cherry is Thinking of Making a New Game Instead of Hollow Knight 3]]></title>

<p>In a new interview, Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson sat down with Jason Schreier to discuss the studio’s success and what could be next for Team Cherry, and it might not be Hollow Knight 3.</p>



<p>During the interview (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>), Schreier asked Gibson what’s next for Team Cherry after they complete Silksong: Hollow Knight’s DLC content, to which Gibson said that “we do have other games that we plan to make”, citing that their only concern is the time that it now takes to make games.</p>







<p>“The only time concern really is — and we’ve talked about this before — death. It’s not that far off if you spend seven years per project, and potentially add another two. So it’d be nice to do a few more games,” he said.</p>



<p>Schreier immediately jumped on the comment, asking if Team Cherry intends to create more games within the same universe or go somewhere else entirely. </p>



<p>Gibson replied, “We have said we’ll go elsewhere as well. Although we’ve also said those experiences will still be about exploring big worlds full of weird characters and giant bosses and whatnot. So there would be a through line there that people will be familiar with. That’s not to say we won’t return to these&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>&nbsp;worlds. We do have ideas around what forms those would take. But we also don’t want to be exclusively people that make&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>.”</p>



<p>Gibson then said that it doesn’t mean he would necessarily be annoyed at making another Silksong, and that he just thinks it will be ”&nbsp;interesting for us to explore the same things we’re interested in but maybe in a slightly different genre, slightly different theme, and how that affects the stories we come up with.”</p>







<p>As for now, though, it seems like Team Cherry doesn’t really have something concretely set up for their next project, and if anything, it’ll probably be another 4-5 years until we find out what they are working on.</p>



<p>What do you think Team Cherry should do next? Would you welcome a Hollow Knight 3? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
