<p>Maximum Football, the independent football game from Maximum Entertainment, has announced the official release date for its long-awaited Franchise Mode. </p>



<p>In a deep dive video release on Monday, it was confirmed that Maximum Football’s Franchise Mode will launch on December 9 for all platforms.</p>



<p>The mode, which is included in the $40 Legend Pass version of the game, was originally planned for 1.0 release before being delayed for polish and further feature implementation. </p>



<p>You can check out full details of the mode below, courtesy of Maximum Entertainment. Maximum Football is available for free on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. Included in the free version is Exhibition mode, Maximum Pro League (Card Collecting Mode), a limited version of Dynasty Mode, and more. </p>



<p>Access to unlimited Dynasty Mode is included in the $20 “Dynasty Premium Access” version of the game. Both Franchise and Dynasty are available in the aforementioned Legend Pass edition.</p>

<h3><strong>College and Pro Football in One Game</strong></h3>



<p>This is the defining feature for Maximum Football. You can&nbsp;link a Dynasty team to Franchise mode, uniting the college and professional worlds seamlessly.</p>



<p>During setup, choose one of your existing Dynasties to connect. Every&nbsp;graduating senior&nbsp;from that Dynasty automatically becomes a&nbsp;draft-eligible prospect&nbsp;in your Franchise. Even if you play your Dynasty years into the future, your Franchise will always reference the correct graduating class for the draft.</p>



<p><em>Note: Each Dynasty can only be connected to one Franchise.</em></p>



<h3><strong>Franchise League Setup</strong></h3>



<p>Franchise mode is all about freedom and customization. It starts with your&nbsp;<strong>League Setup</strong>, where you’ll find more options than any other franchise experience in football gaming.</p>



<p><strong>Choose your league size:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>32 teams</strong>: The classic pro setup.</li>



<li><strong>8 teams</strong>: A compact league inspired by spring football.</li>



<li><strong>12 teams</strong>: A nod to the 80s pro football.</li>



<li><strong>16 or 24 teams</strong>: Fully fictional formats for players who want to get creative.</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you’ve chosen your league size, you can customize&nbsp;<strong>conferences and divisions&nbsp;</strong>to create your perfect ecosystem.</p>



<p>You’ll also have full control over game and rule settings, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Overtime format</li>



<li>Kickoff type</li>



<li>Hashmark width</li>



<li>Number of feet required for a catch</li>



<li>Ball type (Line or No Line)</li>



<li>2-point conversion yard line</li>



<li>Down-by-contact rules</li>



<li>PAT distance</li>



<li>Scoring values for touchdowns and safeties</li>



<li>Two-minute warning behavior</li>



<li>Quarter length, play clock, and acceleration rates</li>



<li>Fair catch&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>After finalizing your setup, you can import your&nbsp;<strong>custom teams</strong>, organize your league, and hire your coaching staff to begin your journey.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3><strong>Stadium Management</strong></h3>



<p>Franchise mode brings a new layer of depth to stadium management.</p>



<p>Each team begins with its own home stadium, which you’ll upgrade over time instead of replacing entirely. As your facilities improve, you’ll unlock&nbsp;<strong>new items and amenities</strong>&nbsp;to sell inside the venue, boosting your revenue and fan satisfaction.</p>



<p>You’ll also control&nbsp;<strong>tiered-ticket pricing</strong>, setting values for general seating, premium sections, and luxury suites. The more desirable the seat, the higher the price you can charge. Balancing pricing with attendance will be key to maximizing profits.</p>



<h3><strong>New Staff Roles</strong></h3>



<p>Franchise mode introduces several new front-office roles that directly impact your success both on and off the field:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing Director</strong>&nbsp;– Secures sponsorships and promotional deals. Each sponsor offers unique contracts based on your performance and fit. A skilled marketing director unlocks the most profitable opportunities.</li>



<li><strong>Team Doctor</strong>&nbsp;– Manages player health and recovery. The higher your doctor’s expertise, the more accurate your weekly injury reports and recovery timelines will be.</li>



<li><strong>Accountant</strong>&nbsp;– Oversees budgets, upgrades, and the salary cap. A top-tier accountant helps you find cheaper facility upgrades and keeps your team financially healthy throughout the season.</li>
</ul>



<p>Together, these roles bring authenticity and depth to the business side of running a team.</p>



<h3><strong>Coaching Staff</strong></h3>



<p>Coaching is expanding in Franchise mode. Each team will feature a&nbsp;<strong>Head Coach</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Offensive Coordinator</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Defensive Coordinator</strong>, each with their own attributes, philosophies, and impact on gameplay.</p>



<p>Every week, your staff delivers:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Offensive and defensive scouting reports</strong>&nbsp;on your upcoming opponent.</li>



<li><strong>Preparation bonuses</strong>&nbsp;that temporarily boost player attributes.</li>



<li><strong>Weekly development summaries</strong>&nbsp;highlighting which players improved.</li>
</ul>



<p>Building a staff with strong synergy and complementary schemes will help your team reach its potential faster.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3><strong>Roster Management</strong></h3>



<p>In Franchise mode, there are three primary ways to strengthen your roster:&nbsp;<strong>Free Agency</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Trading</strong>, and the&nbsp;<strong>Draft</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Free Agency</strong></p>



<p>Every free agent in Maximum Football assigns themselves a&nbsp;<strong>desired contract value</strong>&nbsp;based on performance, age, and reputation. Your job is to find the balance between meeting a player’s expectations and protecting your cap space.</p>



<p>Players evaluate offers based on:</p>



<ul>
<li>Total contract value</li>



<li>Length and guaranteed money</li>



<li>Team prestige and culture</li>



<li>Competing offers</li>



<li>Market demand</li>
</ul>



<p>During the offseason, you’ll receive immediate feedback on offers. During the season, negotiations may extend week-to-week as players weigh their options.</p>



<p><strong>Trading</strong></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>trade system</strong>&nbsp;introduces strategy and realism. You can trade players or draft picks, but the AI carefully evaluates each offer. Considerations include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Player overall and age</li>



<li>Contract length and morale</li>



<li>Team depth at that position</li>



<li>Injury history</li>



<li>Whether teams share a division (in 16–32 team leagues)</li>
</ul>



<p>Repeated failed offers can cause trade partners to lose patience, locking you out of negotiations temporarily. Teams remember how you treat them, so play the long game wisely.</p>



<p><strong>Drafting</strong></p>



<p>At the end of every offseason, you’ll conduct the&nbsp;<strong>Pro Draft</strong>.</p>



<p>If your Franchise is linked to a Dynasty, your draft class will consist of that year’s graduating seniors. If not, the game generates a class automatically. Any players who go undrafted will enter free agency as available prospects.</p>

<p>A new mode for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, called Endgame, has been revealed by Activision. The open-world mode, which will unlock after completing the campaign, furthers the multiplayer experience.</p>



<p>With Black Ops 7, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-trailer-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer is the main focus</a>. Its campaign, playable solo or co-op, does differ from previous entries, but it plans to expand on the narrative of Black Ops 2 and the Mason family. Despite returning to the somewhat-controversial futuristic settings of past games, it’s still poised to be one of 2025’s biggest titles. Ahead of its November 14th release, the team has revealed a new mode that plans to expand the narrative after the credits roll.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In a Dev Talk, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-endgame#PvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as well as a blog</a>, Activision has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-details-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally announced</a> that a new launch mode will be available for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Titled Endgame, it’s unlocked after players complete the 11 main missions in the base campaign. In the mode, you and up to three other players will be dropped onto an island called Avalon and take on various objectives. </p>



<p>The mode will allow for up to 32 players on one map and will be divided into four sections, each with various recommended levels. You get to choose between four Operator classes and customize your loadout before dropping. In addition, progress in the mode contributes to your overall ranking, unifying all modes for a more cohesive experience. More details about the mode can be found on the blog, linked here.</p>



<p>An open-world style of gameplay was tried before in Call of Duty with 2023’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/review-modern-warfare-3-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a> to little praise. Still, it seems like the team is committed to delivering a great new experience for fans. If anything, it does encourage players to try out the campaign and get a cool reward for doing so. It’ll be interesting to see how it fares against the usual Multiplayer and Zombies modes and, if successful, return for future games.</p>
