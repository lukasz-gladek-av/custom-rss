<p>A new 3D Mario and A Legend of Zelda remake are coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025. At least, that’s according to one store listing online.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">popular e-tailer Newegg</a>, the product description for a $50 Nintendo eShop Gift Card mentions a number of games coming in 2025. According to that description, which you can see below, 2025 will feature “Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, New 3D Mario, New Mario Kart, A Legend of Zelda Remake/Remaster, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, Pokemon Legends: Z-A”.</p>







<p>A new Mario Kart was already confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-9-could-feature-new-24-player-races/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the reveal trailer</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2. A new 3D Mario and A Legend of Zelda Remake have been rumored and expected, but there’s been nothing in the form of a confirmation from Nintendo. While this can’t be viewed as a confirmation, either, it’s still something from a major storefront.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to both Newegg and Nintendo regarding the store posting and its accuracy. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly as well as posted on Insider Gaming’s social media channels. </p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially revealed</a> on January 16. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full Nintendo Direct</a> on the new system is set to air on April 2, which is expected to reveal full specs, pricing, release date, and more. There are also rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-to-release-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major AAA games</a> coming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the system</a>, though it’s unknown if any will be announced during the Nintendo Direct.</p>

<p>Activision has released a new trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, confirming five new multiplayer maps and a returning mode during Season 2.</p>



<p>Starting January 28 when the new season launches, players will get access to three new maps with two additional ones coming mid-season. The three maps coming at the beginning of the season are Bounty, Dealership, and Lifeline while Bullet and Grind come midseason. As far as the location details, there’s not much to go on with the maps aside from what was shown in the short trailer.</p>



<p>Lifeline is a small map that’s set on a burning ship in the middle of the sea; dealership takes place in an area surrounding a car dealership of some sort; and bounty, while hard to fully decipher, appears to be at a mansion or museum. Again, however, that was the toughest to see the exact location.</p>







<p>In addition to the new maps, Black Ops 6 Season 2 sees the return of Gun Game along with new weapons such as swords. Lastly, the trailer gives a glimpse at the new Zombies map, The Tomb. According to Treyarch, The Tomb was designed with “tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability”.</p>



<p>Full details on everything coming in Season 2 is expected this week. One detail that’s been confirmed is that players will be able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/treyarch-disabling-crossplay-ranked-console-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turn off cross-play</a> in Ranked Mode moving forward.</p>

<p>Xbox is increasing the size of external storage the Xbox Series consoles will support. In a new update coming to the consoles—Xbox Insiders will get first access to the feature—external hard drives larger than 16TB will now be compatible with the systems.</p>



<p>“We are enabling support for external USB drives larger than 16TB, so you can be sure your favorite games are always ready to play,”  the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/hardware-network/xbox-insider-release-notes/console/alpha-skip-ahead/2025/01/alpha-skip-ahead-2502-250120-2200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company said</a>. “Newly formatted drives that are larger than 16TB will be formatted with multiple partitions to utilize all available space for games and apps. These will appear as multiple devices in the storage devices list.”</p>



<p>While the company says that the update adds support for “drives larger than 16TB”, it doesn’t set a new limit. Based on that, it could be inferred that the partition method allows as large of a external drive as you can afford. If you already have a larger drive, Microsoft says they may need to be reformatted.</p>







<p>“Drives greater than 16TB that have already been formatted will be unaffected by this change and would need to be reformatted to take advantage of the updated support for larger drives,” they said. </p>



<p>This isn’t going to be the only news from Xbox this week as the company airs their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual Developer Direct</a> on January 23. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of all the news that comes from the showcase.</p>
