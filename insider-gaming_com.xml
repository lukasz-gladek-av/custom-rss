<p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2015 and has been a stalwart figure in the first-person shooter space ever since. It’s a flagship title for Ubisoft, a live-service title with millions of fans and a booming esports ecosystem. It’s arguably one of the best games in the space that has proven time and again that it has the staying power to weather the ebbing and flowing of the wider industry.</p>



<p>This weekend, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-esports-eliminated-six-invitational-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Six Invitational</a>, a massive $3 million esports event, wraps up in Boston, Massachusetts. It’s expected that Ubisoft will make a grand reveal on the final day of the event – February 16 – outlining the future of Rainbow Six Siege.</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s Yves Guillemot has also alluded to big things being in store for the tactical shooter.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-consistency">Consistency</h2>



<p>Ubisoft might have struggled with other franchises in recent years, but Rainbow Six is going strong, thanks to Siege. This decade-old tactical shooter has solid player numbers and a pipeline of content updates that show no signs of ending.</p>



<p>I caught up with Ubisoft’s representatives a while back and it was suggested that the company has plans to carry Rainbow Six Siege to <strong>100 Operators </strong>in total before stopping. At the time of publishing, there are 74 Operators, and more are being added all the time.</p>



<p>Despite that note, people have claimed recently that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-reveal-si-2025-rumour/">Rainbow Six Siege 2</a> is on the horizon, but I feel that’s unlikely.</p>



<p>During a recent financial update, Ubisoft’s CEO, Yves Guillemot, touched on the future of Rainbow Six, suggesting that something mighty is in store for the franchise:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As you know, we are preparing a big launch for Assassin’s Creed Shadows in the short term. Next year, <strong>we’ll have big plans that will benefit Rainbow Six across all platforms, </strong>that’s focusing well, and that’s a key milestone in the gross plan for the company.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ubisoft has invested extensive time, effort, and money in Rainbow Six Siege. It’s not only a staple of the esports industry, but one of the most consistent shooters in the wider gaming market. It’s available on multiple platforms, has crossplay mechanics, stacks of maps, modes, and weapons, and it’s getting better with time.</p>



<p>Love it or hate it, Rainbow Six Siege is around for the long(er) haul, and more is coming.</p>

<p>Eclipse Glow Games has released an 11-minute gameplay walkthrough for Tides of Annihilation, which was unveiled this week at the State of Play showcase. Tides of Annihilation has been dubbed ‘Stellar Blade meets Elden Ring’, mostly by <strong>me</strong>. I was looped into the development of Tides of Annihilation last year and loved what I saw, and now it’s out there for everyone to admire.</p>



<p>It doesn’t have a release date, but when it drops, Tides of Annihilation will be available on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC platforms. </p>



<p>Check out the full gameplay walkthrough below.</p>

<h2 id="h-world-bending-battles">World-Bending Battles</h2>



<p>Tides of Annihilation is an innovative and impressive game that has a relatively unique story. It tells the tale of Gwendolyn, one of the last survivors of humanity and a warrior battling to push back dark, otherworldly forces. To do this, she’ll lean on the spectral powers of ancient knights of Arthurian mythology, fighting alongside them in clashes with immense bosses.</p>



<p>It’s set in an apocalyptic rendition of London, and all the landmarks are front and centre for all to see. In that respect, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-annihilation-revealed-by-eclipse-glow-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s quite like Stellar Blade</a>, and the female protagonist with her undeniable sword-based skills adds further credence to that comparison.</p>



<p>Here’s the 11-minute gameplay walkthrough from Tides of Annihilation:</p>

<p>Tides of Annihilation promises to be a challenging game, but when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tides-of-annihilation-interview-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I interviewed the developer</a>, I learned that there will be accessibility considerations made for gamers who want an easier experience. I also learned that there will be extensive customisation opportunities in the game, with players tweaking Gwendolyn’s hair, makeup, outfits, and skill loadouts.</p>
