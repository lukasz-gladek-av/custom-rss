<p>Nintendo has announced that the Nintendo Switch 2 is still scheduled to be announced during this fiscal year.</p>



<p>The news came following Nintendo’s latest earnings call. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa announced that the company will “make an announcement about the successor of the Nintendo Switch this fiscal year.” This means that the company still currently intends to make the announcement by March 31, 2025.</p>



<p>Signs of fatigue over the original Nintendo Switch are beginning to show, too. During the same <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investor call</a>, Nintendo announced that the company is lowering its hardware forecast after sales declined in Q1-Q2 year-on-year by 31%. Nintendo now expects the Nintendo Switch to sell 12.5 million units in its fiscal year, down from its initial 13.5 forecast; a 10% reduction.</p>



<p>As for exactly when the Nintendo Switch 2 will be released remains to be seen, but earlier this year, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa had already announced that the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-nintendo-switch-2-before-april-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">will not be released until Nintendo’s next fiscal year</a>, which starts April 1, 2025.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-prototype-designs-seemingly-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prototype designs of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> leaked online, including specifications for the new console, which will feature 12GB of RAM, HDMI 2.1 support, and even 256GB of internal storage. The latest rumors on the system claim that it will&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be backwards compatible and support 4K</a>&nbsp;resolution.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/study-shows-that-gamers-love-strong-and-sexy-female-characters.1027617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/study-gaming-strong-and-sexy-characters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Teresa Lynch, a professor at Ohio State University, has completed and published a study that examines how elements of sexualisation and <strong>strength </strong>impact our view of female video game characters. In a two-pronged study that put 677 participants to the test, Lynch and her team assembled a series of female characters and had users study and play as them for a set time.</p>



<p>These female characters were created with four categories in mind, all of which were centred around various levels of sexualisation and strength – for instance, a highly sexualised but weak character versus a low sexualised but very strong character.</p>



<p>The results of the study were intriguing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-mommy-theory">The Mommy Theory</h2>



<p>Think of all the users who fell in love with Resident Evil Village’s Alcina Dimitrescu despite her towering size and imposing, terrifying presence, and you’ll effectively arrive at the outcome of this study help by the Ohio State University.</p>



<p>Teresa Lynch’s team created four characters on Soulcalibur VI, focusing on their breast size, hip-to-waist ratio, clothing, weapons, and musculation. They were created to specifically fulfil four roles. Speaking on the reasons behind the study in the first place, Lynch said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s important to understand how gender socialisation and prejudice like sexism inform video game development and player experiences. </p>



<p>Sexism pervades gaming. For example, game content overwhelmingly features male characters to the exclusion of central female or gender minoritised characters. Games that do feature female or gender minoritised characters often unfavorably stereotype and objectify these groups.</p>



<p>I want to know more about why, when, and how these kinds of outcomes happen.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To that end, a two-pronged experiment was produced. First, the team had 239 students view and rate these four characters, indicating which they preferred based on appearance alone. Per expectations, users accurately rated the characters based on their level of sexualisation, while noting that the ‘tougher-looking’ characters appeared more formidable.</p>



<p>Simple.</p>



<p>That’s where things took a turn, though. The participants in the study, most of whom were female, determined that a character with high sexualisation and high strength was <strong>more sexualised </strong>than characters just designed as ‘eye candy’. It was concluded that strength in a sexualised female character only serves to accentuate their attractiveness, rather than degrading it.</p>



<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00936502241279625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The study</a> also showed that female participants were less favourable to the strictly sexualised characters and preferred those with a combination of good looks and a strong build.</p>



<p>Mommy? Sorry.</p>



<h2 id="h-part-two">Part Two</h2>



<p>In the second part of the study (which was picked up first <a href="https://www.psypost.org/new-research-on-female-video-game-characters-uncovers-a-surprising-twist/#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by PsyPost</a>), 438 students were put to the test, playing as one of the four characters for ten minutes on Soulcalibur VI.</p>



<p>The participants fed back that playing as a strong female lead aligned them less with ‘stereotypical femininity’, and it also made them feel as though the character was more competent. In the gender split, female participants gravitated more towards the sexualised characters, while male participants leant more into the ‘strong but less sexualised’ creations.</p>



<p>One of the most damning findings from the study was that while females bagged on sexy female characters, they were more likely to prefer playing as them when it came down to the live test session. </p>



<p>In a parting statement, Lynch said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re also very interested in understanding the positive impact of female characters on players, not just the drawbacks or negative side. People play video games because they like them and find the experiences entertaining, but also because they have meaningful experiences. We’re exploring that side of things because it’s all part of the same question.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What do you think? Do you lean more towards sexualised female characters like Stellar Blade’s Project Eve, or are you more inclined to pick a physically imposing female character like The Last of Us Part II’s Abby?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix Invests In Using AI To Build Games After Closing Down a Studio]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-invest-ai-gaming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix-invests-in-using-ai-to-build-games-after-closing-down-a-studio.1027614/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-invest-ai-gaming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In October, Netflix shut down ‘Blue’, an internal studio dedicated to developing games for the streaming platform. This studio was led by former Blizzard talent and was tasked with creating AAA games, but before producing anything and mere months after a recruitment spree, the studio was shuttered by Netflix.</p>



<p>In recent months, Netflix’s success in the gaming space has come from porting third-party games onto the platform – like the GTA Trilogy. Netflix said at the time that it’s not turning its back on gaming, but it has now been confirmed it’s going in a different direction entirely.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-transformational-technology">‘Transformational Technology’</h2>



<p>In a post on LinkedIn, Netflix’s new VP of GenAI for Games, Mike Verdu, revealed his fresh placement and explained why this is ‘the future of gaming’.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At long last, I am ready to talk about what I’m doing next: I am working on driving a “once in a generation” inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI. This transformational technology will accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Verdu explained that GenAI ‘is the next challenge’ on the road to unlocking the ‘unlimited potential and rapid pace of innovation’. He views generative AI as a wave that’s going to hit the gaming industry with an impressive force, despite many viewing ‘this technology with fear’.</p>



<p>He also offered a harsh line against those doubting Netflix’s presence in the gaming space:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media about the changes in Netflix Games. What you’ve seen over the last several months was actually a planned transition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately for Verdu, the comments <a href="http://linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on his post on LinkedIn</a> were rampant with those lashing out against this business decision. The justification for scrapping a studio and laying off workers to invest heavily in GenAI just isn’t there for some. It’s not the first time we’ve seen this in the last year or two, though – but it never gets any easier a pill to swallow.</p>



<p>One user wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>I appreciate your effort to quell speculation regarding Netflix’s changes in its gaming division, but recent events deserve a critical look.</p><p>The closure of Team Blue after only two years, without releasing a single game and with the departure of key figures like Chacko Sonny and Joseph Staten, suggests a lack of strategic consistency.</p><p>Additionally, while generative AI holds potential, many perceive its current use as more of a marketing tactic than genuine innovation.</p><p>In the context of layoffs and restructuring, the community expects tangible outcomes rather than just bold headlines. I trust that these challenges will lead to a more solid and demonstrable plan in the future.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>Other titanic developers, such as Electronic Arts, have spoken boldly about the future of AI in game development. There are some predictions among executives that AI will soon be responsible for an extremely high percentage of development activities, which paints a scary picture for those on the outside looking in.</p>

<p>Whether you believe it or not, COD Mobile actually has quite the competitive scene. With many large tournaments held across the world, the game has grown immensely in popularity, but what about its ranked system?</p>



<p>Here are all the COD Mobile ranks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-mobile-all-ranks-from-worst-to-best">COD Mobile: All Ranks from Worst to Best</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>



<li><strong>Grandmaster</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legendary</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>COD Mobile does not follow the traditional ranked system, such as the Bronze, Silver and Gold ranked system. However, it does split some of the ranks listed above into different levels.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-rookie">Rookie</h3>



<p>Rookie is the lowest rank in COD Mobile, where many gamers start out. Here is every Rookie rank:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-veteran">Veteran</h3>



<p>Following the Rookie rank is Veteran (which seems like it should be the name for the top rank). Here is every Veteran rank in COD Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Veteran I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-elite">Elite</h3>



<p>Elite is the next rank in COD Mobile, which also is split into multiple segments. Here is every Elite rank:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Elite I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-pro">Pro</h3>



<p>Considered the middle rank in COD Mobile, the Pro rank is filled with players who probably play the shooter game regularly, so if you make it this far, then consider yourself a COD gamer.</p>



<p>Here is every Pro rank in COD Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pro I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-master">Master</h3>



<p>Master is the next rank in COD Mobile and the first one without any split segments. Once you hit Master, you will not have to worry about progressing through the rank. </p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-grandmaster">Grandmaster</h3>



<p>Grandmaster is the second to last rank in COD Mobile, meaning you will need to be quite the gamer to make it this far. However, it is not the last and will be extremely difficult to rank up from here.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-legendary">Legendary</h3>



<p>Legendary is the rank all COD Mobile gamers strive for, but very few ever hit. It takes quite a few COD points to make it this far, so if you are ever good enough to hit Legendary, take yourself out for a nice steak dinner to celebrate.</p>



<p>Jump into COD Mobile now and start ranking up so you can hit Legendary.</p>

<p>Whenever you’re excited about an upcoming game, especially one as unique and eclectic as Slitterhead, you want to check out the game’s system requirements beforehand.

Do you think your system can handle the upcoming horror game?</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>

<h2 id="h-when-can-you-play-slitterhead">When Can You Play Slitterhead?</h2>



<p>If you’re eager to get your hands on the latest horror game from one of the minds behind the original Silent Hill, then you’re in luck because Slitterhead is nearly out in the world. The horror game officially launches on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on <strong>November 8</strong>.</p>



<p>Based on early critic reviews, it’s a mixed reception. Many believe the combat is relatively weak, with plenty of bugs and rough edges that mar the overall experience. Other critics, however, think Slitterhead is worthy of your collection, especially if you’re a horror gaming fan.</p>
