<p>Rumblings of The Division: Definitive Edition started a few weeks ago. While the wait for The Division 3 goes on, this could have served as the perfect means to tide fans over until then. Unfortunately, the very low-key release seems to be quite low-effort, with The Division: Definitive Edition shadow drop being a rehash of a previous version, with no PS5 or Xbox Series X|S upgrade.</p>



<p>Definitive Editions are usually released with the same content, but alongside a plethora of graphical updates to give a game a completely overhauled look. This is the bare minimum effort needed, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-division/" id="113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Division</a>: Definitive Edition hasn’t even done this.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-division-definitive-edition-has-no-ps5-upgrades">The Division: Definitive Edition Has No PS5 Upgrades</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A letdown. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-definitive-edition-could-be-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Division: Definitive Edition</a> banner surfaced online, and clearly hinted that Ubisoft was working on an upgraded version of the original looter shooter.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-shaping-up-to-be-monster-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Division 3 ‘Shaping up to be a monster,’</a> this is the perfect gateway for new fans into the series, and the chance to warm up the skills of existing players. But alarm bells started ringing when The Division: Definitive Edition was unceremoniously shadow-dropped onto the PlayStation and Xbox Stores on February 3.</p>



<p>Therein lies the reason as to why it hasn’t been promoted: There’s not much to promote.</p>



<p>‘Tom Clancy’s The Division – Definitive Edition’ doesn’t have an upgraded PS5 or XSX version. You can play it on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but the game clearly states that it includes “The base game, all three Season Pass expansions, and multiple cosmetic packs.” No graphical improvements or even gameplay tweaks are mentioned because there are none.</p>



<p>There will be some natural upscaling because of the power of the modern-day consoles, but make no mistake, this is the already-existing The Division Gold Edition, with a few extra outfits and no upgrades, for $50.</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake being canceled</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employee-who-was-suspended-for-criticising-the-company-has-now-been-fired/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft employee who was suspended for criticizing the company being fired</a>, it has not been a good few weeks for Ubisoft.</p>



<p>What do you think about this release? Is it a lazy rerelease? Could Ubisoft face even more flak after recent events?

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been a rip-roaring success since its historic June 5, 2025, launch. The sequel to the smash-hit Switch is more powerful and has more system-selling AAA exclusives, and people are gobbling up Switch 2 consoles faster than Yoshi does fruit.</p>



<p>You could argue the generational leap from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> hasn’t been as significant or as huge as in previous years, but this hasn’t stopped it from raking in millions for Nintendo across 2025 and up to FY2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-fy26-financial-results-show-huge-numbers-for-switch-2">Nintendo FY26 Financial Results Show Huge Numbers For Switch 2</h2>

<p>The February 3 <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_2e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo Financial Earnings Report</a> is out, and it’s hard to escape the Switch 2’s incredible first-year success.</p>







<p>Nintendo’s newest statistics reveal that the Switch 2 has sold 17.37 million units as of December 31, 2025. A cool graphic shows the correlation between the Switch and Switch 2’s respective sales journeys.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 still remains ahead of the original Switch’s sales curve, and this ensures the Nintendo Switch 2 is the “Fastest-selling dedicated video game platform released by Nintendo to date.”</p>



<p>First-party titles have clearly had a huge influence, with Nintendo reporting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mario-kart-world/" id="2527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> has crossed 14 million units, Donkey Kong Bananza has sold 4 million units, and the Switch 2 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A is also swiftly approaching 4 million.</p>



<p>With more Nintendo exclusives in the pipeline, from Mario Tennis Fever to Pokémon Pokopia, there are even more reasons to buy a Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026. You can bet your bottom dollar that the company is keeping some games a secret, and there’s still plenty of ammunition to keep the Switch 2 sales flowing.</p>



<p>Are you a Nintendo Switch 2 owner? What incentivized you to buy one? Conversely, if you like the brand but haven’t invested in a Switch 2 yet, why is this?

            <title><![CDATA[Console Gamers Can’t Escape Their Love For Sports Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/console-sports-games-cant-escape-pc-growth/</link>
            <guid>1423597</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent report published by Newzoo, the full-year game performance metrics for 2025 were revealed. The graphs and numbers told a telling tale about the state of play across both console and PC markets, revealing the biggest movers and shakers, and by contrast, the games that fell out of fortune with players worldwide last year.</p>



<p>Two slides in particular, one addressing the biggest money-makers on console and the other answering the same question on PC, offered a sort of axiomatic revelation. Year after year, console gamers can’t escape their sports games.</p>







<h2 id="h-sports-games-don-t-make-money-on-pc">Sports Games Don’t Make Money on PC</h2>



<p>Newzoo’s newest annual report breaks down the numbers across PC and console for a 12-month spread, uncovering the best-selling games, the titles with the highest revenue, and those with the most sizeable MAU counts.</p>



<p>On the PC front, the top ten games by <strong>revenue</strong> (in six major markets) were:</p>



<ol>
<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Schedule 1</li>



<li>Monster Hunter: Wilds</li>



<li>Borderlands 4</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>R.E.P.O.</li>



<li>Oblivion Remastered</li>



<li>Expedition 33</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li>
</ol>



<p>By contrast, the console market seemed laser-focused on <strong>sports games</strong> in 2025:</p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>NBA 2K26</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Madden NFL 26</li>



<li>MLB The Show 25</li>



<li>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</li>



<li>EA Sports College Football 26</li>



<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>ARC Raiders</li>
</ol>



<p>Those lists indicate that 50% of the best-selling games on console platforms in 2025 were <strong>all </strong>annual sports releases. These are the relatively safe, simple purchases that players often make out of habit rather than anything else. As the report indicates, this is suggestive of PC players being more ‘experimental’ in their gaming habits.</p>



<p>You get a lot of early access titles launching on PC, for instance. It gives players a more diverse repository to pull from, even if a lot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/keeping-game-early-access-nine-months-kill-it-data/">those games fall flat</a> because they remain in that state for too long.</p>



<p>The MAU stakes on console are drastically different, though. At the top of the table sits Fortnite, followed by Call of Duty, then GTA 5, Roblox, and Minecraft. You don’t get into a sports title until the sixth spot on the list, and even then, it’s EA Sports FC 25, which is followed swiftly enough by EA Sports FC 26.</p>



<p>Rocket League is arguably a sports title, and that sits in seventh place for console players, but it’s not an annual release.</p>



<p>The PC MAU trend is pretty similar to console. The number-one spot is secured by Counter-Strike 2, but Minecraft, Roblox, and Fortnite are all in the top five. Call of Duty finds a place in the top ten as well, but the other games are made up mostly of those that are unique to PC, like League of Legends and Dota 2.</p>



<p>In 2024, Newzoo revealed that PC gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-gaming-gained-more-players-than-console-in-2024/">gained <strong>more new players</strong></a><strong> </strong>than console platforms, which was an eye-opener. It was also revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/58-of-pc-gaming-revenue-came-from-microtransactions-in-2024/">58% of PC gaming revenue</a> came from <strong>microtransactions</strong>.</p>
