<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls got a new trailer during today’s State of Play Japan. In it, the second closed beta was announced, alongside who’ll be included.</p>







<p>Revealed in June, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-tokon-ps5-closed-beta-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fighter from ARC System Works</a>, creators of Guilty Gear, teams up with the superheroes of Marvel. Many have already gotten their hands on it with the closed beta and at EVO. Given ARC System Works’ track record, it’s safe to say it’ll be one to watch. Now, thanks to today’s State of Play, we have a bit more information on when the next chance to play will be.</p>

<p>The trailer, seen above, we get a look at some new gameplay of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. We see new stages, including the X-Mansion with some familiar faces. Most importantly, we see a new closed beta announced for PlayStation 5. The beta will occur from December 5th through December 7th and run all 72-hours. New characters not in the first beta include Spider-Man and Ghost Rider.</p>



<p>Via <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-closed-beta-2-arrives-dec-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the PlayStation Blog</a>, the beta will be open to all who participated in the first one. Furthermore, those who expressed interest but didn’t get in will now be considered for this one. As for the schedule, on&nbsp;December 5 and 6, CPU battles and online matches will be available, with&nbsp;December 7 being only online battles.</p>



<p>The roster, for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls includes Iron Man, Captain America, Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Storm, Ghost Rider, and Doctor Doom. More characters are expected to join before the game’s 2026 release. There are a ton of heroes to choose from, so the possibilities are somewhat infinite. Still, it’ll be exciting to see how ARC System Works approaches these characters and how they may differ from other Marvel fighting titles.</p>
