            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An analyst has claimed that Embark Studios made ARC Raiders on a $75 million budget, including marketing.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is easily one of the most popular titles from 2025, with Embark Studios hitting it out of the park with their new extraction adventure. The title also received a massive update recently, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-significantly-impacts-looting-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke some systems</a> but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-1-13-0-patch-notes-solo-vs-squads-bird-city-open-parties-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added a lot of new content</a>. However, today we aren’t talking about that; instead, we are talking about how much it costs to make the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-budget-reportedly-revealed">ARC Raiders Budget Reportedly Revealed</h2>



<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58P5sZJ3Vho" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SIFTD Games</a> video, industry analyst Michael Pachter revealed the budget for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a>. The new video explores whether Ubisoft will survive after the recent restructuring announcement, with Patcher sharing his insights on several topics. Towards the end of the video, Patcher discusses different game budgets and timelines, where the cost of making ARC Raiders was revealed. </p>



<p>Patcher states that Ubisoft taking 5 years to develop a game and selling only 5 million units is not sustainable; “3 years is plenty.” He then talks about people bringing Rockstar into comparison, which might be $1.5-2 billion on GTA 6, but don’t understand that “they are going to make that $2 billion back in the first week.” </p>



<p>The analyst adds that everybody shouldn’t be comparing themselves to “GTA, FIFA, or the former glory of Call of Duty,” instead, they should compare themselves to ARC Raiders. Patcher then drops a secret, stating, “ARC Raiders cost $75 million to make.” It was developed over 3 years, had a team of 70 developers, and included marketing in the budget. Patcher added that the game has already made $500 million from 12 million-plus units sold and will “probably” make close to a billion. </p>
