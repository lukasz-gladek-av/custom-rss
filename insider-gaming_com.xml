            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-alters-releases-in-june-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been announced during the triple-i Initiative that ‘The Alters’ will be releasing in June 2025 and coming to Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>In an official press release about the announcement, 11-Bit said,</p>



<p>In The Alters, the upcoming science-fiction game from 11 bit studios (makers of This War of Mine and Frostpunk), where survival has never been so personal, the path to salvation begins with a question as old as humanity: What if I had chosen differently? </p>



<p>Stranded on a hostile planet and racing against a deadly sunrise, Jan Dolski’s only chance of survival is to create “alters”—alternate versions of himself shaped by roads not taken. Each Jan comes with unique skills, personalities, and memories tied to a different life choice. But they also come with conflict, doubt, and emotional baggage. </p>



<p>Managing the mission means managing yourself—literally. Players must maintain a mobile base, make time-critical decisions, build relationships with their Alters, and confront the consequences of their own past lives. </p>



<p>And as a new element the trailer leans into, The Alters reveals the hardships of exploring the planet’s unique biomes, where deadly anomalies stand in your way. Levitating rocks and eerie distortions of reality catch your attention immediately, while other singularities remain invisible to the naked eye and require special tools to uncover. In every case, without a careful approach, you risk instant death, radiation-induced injuries, or even the disintegration of time and space itself. And you may want to avoid exploring at night, as the heightened radioactivity can eat right through your suit. These dangers add yet another layer to the survival experience, turning every expedition into a high-stakes puzzle. </p>



<p>Blending survival, base-building, exploration, and emotional storytelling, The Alters is a deeply personal sci-fi experience where every decision matters—and every version of you has something to say about it.</p>



<p>You can watch the full trailer of the announcement below:</p>

<p>In October 2024, Surgent Studios unveiled Project Uso, an ambitious, choice-driven RPG with beat-’em-up vibes. That was before the studio announced a partnership with Pocketpair Publishing, with the team signing up to develop a horror game that’s yet to be revealed.</p>



<p>I bumped into Abubakar Salim, the founder of Surgent, at the BAFTA Games Awards in London. The recent news of the partnership got me thinking about Project Uso and whether the team was still working on it because it piqued my interest when it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-tales-of-kenzera-uso/">uncovered months ago</a>.</p>



<p>Check out the full video interview here:</p>

<h2 id="h-the-universe-is-still-alive">‘The Universe is Still Alive’</h2>



<p>Tales of Kenzera: Project Uso is an extension of Tales of Kenzera: Zau, which was released in February 2024 to a stunning reception. I was fortunate enough back then to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tales-of-kenzera-interview-abubakar-salim/">sit down with Abubakar</a> and talk about the inspiration behind this emotional, beautiful game.</p>



<p>I learned that Surgent Studios plans to create a thriving multimedia universe around Tales of Kenzera.</p>



<p>When I was chatting with Abubakar at the BAFTA Game Awards, I dropped a question about Project Uso, asking if it was still in the pipeline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Uso is still cooking. I think the way that I’m approaching the design and game dev process is we want to build things that all feed into the next game and then the next game and then the next game.</p>



<p>Uso is still cooking, man the universe is still alive, and that’s very exciting. There are other games as well. </p>



<p>I think one of the reasons we wanted to reveal Uso was, that was one of those games that we felt really passionate about and not many people do this, not many people share in the industry, something that they’re just cooking and seeing what happens.</p>



<p>There are still things that we need to work with and still need to conjure with that game. It’s a big game, it’s very ambitious, what we want to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tuesday night at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bafta-games-awards-astro-bot-scoops/">BAFTA Games Awards</a>, Abubakar Salim took to the stage to receive the award for Game Beyond Entertainment, a prestigious trophy that perfectly highlights what Tales of Kenzera: Zau is all about.</p>



<p>I’m very excited and eagerly awaiting more news from Surgent regarding Project Uso – watch this space.</p>

<p>There’s a new game coming from the developer of The Axis Unseen, and it’s not what you’d likely expect. Just Purkey Games, the studio operated by developer Nate Purkeypile, has announced Deedlee Doo! Carkour!, a new “racing” game where you do parkour with a car using explosions.</p>



<p>The game is currently scheduled to launch on May 12, 2025 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3582590/Deedlee_Doo_Carkour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC via Steam</a>.</p>



<p>“Everything in the game is made out of clay in real life,” the game’s description reads. “The sound effects and music are all mouth sounds. If you screw up a jump, children laugh and make fun of you. (Just like real life!) Can you reach the top of the Meowtain?”</p>



<p>Regarding the clay art style, it was all sculpted in real life as the description reads. Some of the sculptures, however, were done by Purkeypile’s own children before they were scanned into the game. </p>



<p>In addition to the game’s announcement, a reveal trailer was also released.</p>
