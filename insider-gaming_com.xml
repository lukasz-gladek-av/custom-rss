            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A dataminer has discovered that PlayStation compatible Halo titles were listed in the API, suggesting that a release for the platform is imminent. </p>



<p>Recently, we received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-will-only-feature-a-campaign-mode-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several details</a> about upcoming Halo games, including the Combat Evolved remake, Project Ekur, and the next mainline instalment for the series. The same source has now returned with new datamined details, hinting that a Halo release for PlayStation could be on the cards. </p>



<h2 id="h-halo-datamine-suggests-a-playstation-release-is-on-the-way">Halo Datamine Suggests a PlayStation Release is On the Way</h2>



<p>The new information about Halo games coming to PlayStation comes from <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grunt.api</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1955012440032186804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RebsGaming</a>. Rebs Gaming is known for his scoops on Halo games and has used grunt.api as a source on several occasions. The dataminer has revealed unreleased information and images of upcoming content on multiple occasions in the past. In 2021, grunt.api was able to predict accurately when Halo Infinite’s multiplayer mode would be released. </p>



<p>The Halo Dataminer can access the Halo games’ API (application programming interface), which enables them to provide such details early. According to their latest findings, a “new Halo title with PlayStation compatibilty is listed in the API”. The same title was seen linked to PlayFab last Monday, a backend platform that helps with cross-platform progression, matchmaking, and unified online services. </p>

<h2 id="h-playstation-compatible-halo-title-could-be-project-ekur">PlayStation Compatible Halo Title Could be Project Ekur</h2>



<p>Moreover, a beta title and a second new Halo title with PlayStation compatibility were discovered in the API; however, the dataminer has limited information on these two. According to them, the new Halo title for PlayStation could be Certain Affinity’s upcoming multiplayer title, Project Ekur. The dataminer also speculates that the two listings could be for the same game, one for its beta and the other for the full release. </p>



<p>For those unaware, RebsGaming had stated that Project Tatanka, Halo Infinite’s cancelled battle royale mode, was handed over to Certain Affinity. It was then rebranded as a separate multiplayer game using Unreal Engine 5, which is currently codenamed Project Ekur. RebsGaming also stated that the “best case scenario” would be that players receive announcements for Halo CE Remake, Project Ekur and Project Ekur’s beta at the upcoming Halo World Championship 2025, scheduled for this October. </p>



<p>Halo Studios has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-halo-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that more details about the Halo franchise and its next game will be revealed later this year. RebsGaming concluded in their post that “at least one new Halo game is releasing on PlayStation and it could include a Beta.” Regardless, players should take all of this information with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In NHL 26, EA Sports is introducing updates to the ICE-Q gameplay feature that debuted a year ago. This year, however, in partnership with NHL Edge, NHL 26 will feature real-world puck and player tracking data for the first time.</p>



<p>Dubbed ICE-Q 2.0, EA says <strong>“players will notice significant differentiation between superstar athletes”</strong>. The data from real NHL teamss and players <strong>“directly influences player attributes and personal tendencies like skating speed, shot power, signature playstyles, and even goalie reactions.”</strong></p>



<h6 id="h-more-nhl-nhl-26-features-include-be-a-pro-and-gameplay-updates">MORE NHL: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-features-include-be-a-pro-and-gameplay-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NHL 26 Features Include Be A Pro And Gameplay Updates</a></h6>



<p>The studio says that the new integration will elevate the on-ice experience for players to increase authenticity and “strategic depth”.</p>



<p><strong>“The energy from the NHL is electric, with its diehard fans and the talent and physicality of the athletes. It’s our job to translate that energy from the ice to the screen and make it as realistic as possible,” </strong>EA Sports president Cam Weber said. <strong>“By harnessing the very same data points the NHL uses to inform all sorts of game-time strategies, EA SPORTS is doubling down on innovations and partnerships to make the most true-to-life reflection of hockey possible.”</strong></p>



<p>The ultimate goal, EA says, is to allow every player to move, think, and play like the stars they see on the ice.</p>



<p>NHL 26 launches on September 5 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S for players who purchase the Deluxe Edition. Those with the Standard Edition have to wait until September 12. The game is exclusively available on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Do you think real-world data with ICE-Q 2.0 will make a difference in gameplay for NHL 26? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for information on the next Battlefield 6 beta date, you’ve come to the right place. We’ve got its start date and information on potential start times, so you know when you can start trying to hog all the tanks.</p>



<p>I know you don’t want to think about this, but there’s going to come a time when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-impressions-battlefield-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta</a> won’t be live, and that will be <em>it</em> until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 officially releases</a>. You need to make the most of the BF6 beta while you’ve got a chance.</p>



<p>Let’s go through the next BF6 beta dates, what’s included, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-battlefield-6-beta-start-amp-end-date">Next Battlefield 6 Beta Start &amp; End Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More content beckons. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The next Battlefield 6 open beta start date is currently August 14, with the second full beta set to end on August 17.</strong></p>



<p>The first weekend of August broke ground in 2025. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/">The first open beta hit 500,000 concurrent players on Steam.</a> It’s an astonishing figure. It remains to be seen if week two can get close to that number, daresay surpass it.</p>



<p>We do know the second week of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-gets-new-map-and-modes-this-week/">Battlefield 6 open beta is getting a new map and extra game modes.</a> So, there’s plenty of incentive for you to lace up your combat boots and go hunting for enemies.</p>

<p><strong>The official start times haven’t been confirmed, but unless something changes, we expect a similar start time to week one—08:00 UTC.</strong></p>



<p>The week one <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-start-times-today-explained-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta start times</a> might not be the same as week two. We’ve seen nothing to say it’s going to be different, but as of writing, we also don’t know if any changes are happening.</p>



<p>If you want a handy breakdown of the expected <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a> week two start times for key regions, take a look at the table I’ve whipped up for you.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Battlefield 6 Open Beta Week Two Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Daylight Time (PDT)</td><td data-align="center">1:00 AM—August 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Daylight Time (CDT)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 AM—August 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 AM—August 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—August 14</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT)</td><td data-align="center">6:00 PM—August 14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Fortnite’s Shock N’ Awesome is giving a very Helldivers 2 vibe, and Arrowhead has finally addressed it. </p>



<p>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 ‘Shock N’ Awesome’ went live <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-shock-n-awesome-season-details-revealed-new-enemies-weapons-pois-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last week</a>, introducing new enemies, POIs, weapons, cosmetics and more. Talking about new enemies, Fortnite Island is now facing a bug invasion, with players teaming up to take down hordes of creepy crawlies. Many players feel that this type of bug invasion was already seen in Helldivers 2. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-devs-aren-t-worried-about-fortnite-s-new-season">Helldivers 2 Devs Aren’t Worried About Fortnite’s New Season</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/helldivers-2-dev-new-fortnite-season-feels-very-we-have-helldivers-at-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videogamer</a>, several players in the Helldivers 2 Discord are asking developers about their views on Fortnite’s new season. The Arrowhead CEO, Shams Jorjani, was the first to respond, stating that Fortnite’s latest season “feels very democratic”. Jorjani has also mentioned previously that he doesn’t play Fortnite as the building feature can be frustrating for him. Jorjani’s go-to shooters are Helldivers and Battlefield. </p>



<p>The community manager at Arrowhead, Katherine Baskin (aka Baskinator), also weighed in on Fortnite’s new season, stating, “it’s giving ‘we have helldivers at home”. When asked if this new season could impact their player numbers, Baskinator stated that she’s “not worried” as “Fortnite is Fortnite” and “Helldivers is Helldivers”. She also praised Fortnite, stating, If the kinds of video game drip think our drip is cool enough to… inspire them… then that’s super cool.” At same time, she adds that both game “couldn’t be more different from one another” and that there’s “room for us all at the king’s table.”</p>



<p>In other news, the new Helldivers 2 trailer features <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-new-helldivers-2-trailer-halo-3-odst-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Halo 3 ODST teaser</a>. Additionally, a new claim suggests that Fortnite is introducing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-proximity-chat-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proximity chat</a> to its battle royale mode.
