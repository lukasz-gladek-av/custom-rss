<p>Call of duty has released a brand-new trailer for Warzone, showing off the return of the original map ‚ÄòVerdansk‚Äô.</p>



<p>The near three-minute trailer shows off the return of the original map, weapons, vehicles and more in spectacular Call of Duty fashion, with the re-confirmation that the map will return with 150 players.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? ü•π

No escape from the fight now ‚Äî Drop into the map that started it all in Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3 </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VerdanskReturns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#VerdanskReturns</a><span> ü™Ç </span></p></article></div>



<p>According to sources, Verdansk comes at a crucial point for Call of Duty Warzone, with Activision hoping that the map will see a resurgence in players similar to how the original Fortnite map worked for Epic Games.</p>



<p>One source said that Verdansk could be ‚Äúdo or die‚Äù for the free-to-play Battle Royale, whereas another said it likely means Warzone support will dwindle down if its play numbers don‚Äôt increase.</p>



<p>Verdansk is set to return to Warzone not as ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù as some might have expected though. This time, the Battle Royale map will return with some movement adjustments, including keeping in omnimovement. The developers did outline that player movement speed has bee reduced though, to try and stay somewhat in line with how the game originally felt. </p>
