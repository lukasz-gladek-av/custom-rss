<p>During Gamescom, Techland unveiled Dying Light: The Beast, a full-sized, standalone title that brings Kyle Crane back into the post-apocalyptic action. It has been almost a decade since Crane first appeared on our screens in Dying Light, and in this new adventure, he’s making a bold return.</p>



<p>The Beast is a unique title set in a rural region away from the dense urban sprawls of Harran or Villedor. It’s set 13 years after the events of the first Dying Light game, with players getting to assume control of a twisted, grizzled version of Kyle Crane.</p>

<h2 id="h-everything-we-wanted">Everything We Wanted</h2>



<p>Fans of the original Dying Light were enthused to learn that Roger Craig Smith is returning to play Kyle Crane in Dying Light: The Beast. I got to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sit down with Smith at Gamescom</a> and talk to him about this upcoming game, which is shaping up to be nothing short of phenomenal.</p>



<p>The Beast offers plenty of opportunity to explore a decent-sized world, and Techland has brought back drivable vehicles to make traversal all that more diverse. In this game, Crane has beast-like powers, hence the name of the game, and players can unleash devastating abilities as a result.</p>



<p>Like other Dying Light titles, The Beast will be playable either as a solo player or with up to three friends.</p>



<p>Recently, Techland revealed that Dying Light: The Beast had hit one million wishlists in just 10 weeks, a figure that’s indicative of the hype building behind the game. The franchise director of Dying Light, Tymon Smektala, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Thank you for believing in us and for your enthusiasm for Kyle Crane’s next adventure. Your excitement fuels our passion, and we are committed to delivering an unforgettable experience</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That pre-order performance makes The Beast the fastest-wishlisted game in franchise history, which is nothing short of impressive.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to returning to Kyle Crane’s character when Dying Light: The Beast is released next year? Let us know in the comments.</p>
