<p>Ubisoft’s major financial update for FY24-25 is here, and it has made clear a few tantalising details about the company. One of the most interesting tidbits was the lifetime earnings of Ubisoft’s brands and live service titles. It was revealed that as a standalone game, Rainbow Six Siege has almost made more money than every other Ubisoft franchise.</p>



<p>That’s a <strong>lot </strong>of dollars.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impressive-performance">Impressive Performance</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2016 as Ubisoft’s flagship competitive shooter. It has since become one of the most beloved FPS games on the market, giving way to a thriving esports ecosystem, amongst other things. It is one of the best definitions of the live-service operating model in the gaming world – and it’s still expanding.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5kn4pUVx6Vtb1Hir4vpqvq/fe35b53a1514635b0257418d1409d9e1/Ubisoft_FY25_H1_Earnings_PR_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the recent financial report</a> published by Ubisoft, it was revealed that since 2016, Rainbow Six Siege has made a whopping €3.5 billion ($3.8 billion). It sits just behind <strong>the entire Assassin’s Creed series </strong>at €4 billion ($4.3 billion) and has beat the Far Cry series, which has made just €2 billion ($2.1 billion).</p>



<p>Elsewhere, several franchises have just topped €1 billion in consumer spending:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Division</li>



<li>Ghost Recon</li>



<li>Just Dance</li>
</ul>



<p>That means that if Rainbow Six Siege were to somehow secure €500 million in sales <strong>right now</strong>, it would single-handedly beat the consumer spending for every other Ubisoft franchise ever created, regardless of how long they’ve been on the market or how many games they’ve seen added to their lineup.</p>



<p>Ubisoft further confirmed that Rainbow Six Siege boasts a whopping 30 million unique active users, many of which will be contributing to the ongoing financial stability of the game.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has confirmed one of the reasons for the delay of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. In its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent earnings call</a> on Wednesday, the studio was asked about Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ delay, and whether there is a possibility of another one to later in 2025.</p>



<p>Chief Corporate Finance Officer Frédérick Duguet reiterated that the game has been feature complete, and that the delay was done to add more polish to the game as opposed to anything else.</p>

<p>“We wanted to make sure that the delivery of the experience is impeccable on day one, so that was the purpose of the decision,” he said. “So we have a good visibility for the game to be delivered with a great experience by mid-February, and with great quality.”</p>



<p>He again said that the company is confident in a February release with a “great experience” and “great quality”. </p>



<p>As far as any specific reasons for the delay, Duguet said that the response to Star Wars Outlaws played a part in delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>“On the back of what we saw with Star Wars Outlaws, we need to really make sure that we come with an impeccable player experience on day one,”  he said. “Of course there are always some bugs, but we’ve been focusing, and we’re continuing to focus on, making sure that the day one experience will be well optimized.”</p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws released on August 30, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-sales-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struggled to reach one million copies</a> sold in the time frame that Ubisoft had hoped. </p>



<p>Regarding the price for delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Ubisoft said that it added roughly $21.7 million to development costs. The company also announced in September that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-to-get-rid-of-traditional-season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abandoning the traditional Season Pass</a> model for the game.</p>
