<p>Riot Games continues to tout the growth of its VALORANT esports scene, now having completed two seasons of its international partnership league. Like it does with League of Legends, Riot has completely run VALORANT esports all by itself since the game launched in 2020.</p>



<p>Prior to the start of the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour season, Riot has announced the end-of-year results for its 2024 campaign, revealing yet another massive chunk of change brought in by player spending.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-here-comes-the-money">Here comes the money</h2>



<p>According to Riot, the company shared $44.3 million from digital goods with the partnered teams competing in VCT 2024, up from <a href="https://valorantesports.com/en-US/news/vct-2023-eoy-letter-to-the-community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$33 million in 2023</a>. With 44 teams competing across the four leagues last year, that averages out to just about $1 million per team. Since Riot takes 50 percent of the revenue from digital goods, that means that players spent roughly $88.6 million in total on VCT-themed digital goods.</p>



<p>The digital goods in question refer to two primary items: VCT partner team capsules and the Champions bundle. At the start of the year, Riot introduced VCT partner team capsules, which both teams and fans were highly anticipating. Each team had a bundle with a team-specific Classic pistol skin, a player card designed by the team itself, a logo gun buddy (charm), and a logo spray. New capsules are expected to be released near the start of the 2025 season.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The other main draw for digital goods is the yearly Champions bundle, which includes unique weapon skins and accessories celebrating the VALORANT world championship. This year, for the first time, all partnered teams received a share of Champions bundle revenue, not just the 16 teams that qualified for the event.</p>



<p>Between digital goods, stipends, and prize pool winnings, Riot claims to have given out $78.4 million across the 44 partnered teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is there a specific VALORANT team bundle you want to buy next year? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 has not been spared from the discourse about “dying” that surrounds multiplayer and live service games in recent years. Counter-Strike as a series has been around for decades, and the state of the game has been a constant discussion point since.</p>



<p>But is there any truth to the arguments that CS2 is dying?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-are-players-saying-that-cs2-is-dying">Why are players saying that CS2 is dying?</h2>



<p>There are a number of issues that the wider Counter-Strikes 2 player base has with the state of the game.</p>



<p>One of these issues has been Valve Anti-Cheat, the anti-cheat program that’s supposed to keep cheaters and hackers at bay. Many players claim that VAC hardly keeps cheaters out, and that they are constantly running into cheaters on a frequent basis.</p>



<p>Other issues plaguing the game include client performance, a lack of new content (seasonal operations), more frequent crashes, subtick issues, and various bugs.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-2-dying">Is Counter-Strike 2 dying?</h2>



<p>Despite the issues facing Counter-Strike 2 currently, the game is not dying. While the player numbers for CS2 have always fluctuated, there’s been no consistent dropoff. The <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peak player and average player numbers</a> as of December 2024 are lower now than they were in April or May, but higher than they were in January or February.</p>



<figure><figcaption>CS2 player peaks and averages, per SteamDB.</figcaption></figure>



<p>These numbers will typically spike after a large update, whether that be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a change to the map pool</a> or a return of the Major pass. While these larger updates feel more sparse when compared to other popular multiplayer titles, players are still logging back in to play. Valve is also still (slowly) releasing updates regarding some of the major issues.</p>



<p>CS2 is still the most played game on Steam at any given time, and likely will remain that way for a long time.</p>



<p>Thoughts on CS2 as whole? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
