<p>Capcom has revealed that Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1 will launch on Thursday April 3/Friday April 4, depending on your time zone. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/update/ver_01_0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal came as part</a> of a 15-minute video on Tuesday that went into details on what players can expect to see in the game’s first major update. </p>



<p>First thing’s first, the title update will be free to all players. It will include a new monster called Mizutsune alongside a new Zoh Shia quest. There is also a new Grand Hub gathering place that players who’ve completed the game’s main story can get together and hangout as well as play a new game called Barrel Bowling. If you want a different type of entertainment, The Diva will be there to perform at night.</p>

<p>All eyes in the video game industry are watching to see when Grand Theft Auto 6 will release. The potential impact on the industry is expected to be very large, but several publishers planning to release games around the same time are ready to delay just to get out of its way.</p>



<h2 id="h-we-don-t-want-to-be-anywhere-near-that">“We Don’t Want to Be Anywhere Near That”</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Christopher Dring</a> of the recently launched outlet The Game Business, “three major video game publishers” are ready to delay their games to avoid GTA 6. Dring says that the boss “of one of the world’s biggest game publishers” told him: “Rockstar games always suck a lot of money and, more importantly, time out of the market. We don’t want to be anywhere near that. We are working up multiple different plans for our titles.”</p>



<p>This past weekend at the Game Developer’s Conference in San Francisco, Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson was told by a few developers that they’re “waiting to see what GTA 6 does.” Back in December, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported that competing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishers are “waiting as long as possible to commit to their release date.”</a></p>



<p>The launch of GTA 6, tentatively scheduled for October 2025, reportedly isn’t just scaring off major new releases. According to Dring, two developers of “top 10 live-service games” are not planning any significant updates during the GTA 6 launch window. One studio boss reportedly said that they would “nudge” their releases ahead or backwards three weeks just to avoid GTA 6. The studio heads that spoke to Dring spoke of other potential issues, like a crowded schedule of other games trying to avoid GTA 6, but those problems seem preferable than trying to compete with a potentially industry-altering release. However, as one industry consultant noted at GDC, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/if-gta-6-delayed-tank-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waiting on GTA 6 only for it to delay could “tank” those developers</a>.</p>



<p>Are game developers perhaps being too cautious of the GTA 6 release, or are they wise to get out of the way? Let us know down in the comments below!

<p>With Nintendo Switch 2 just one week from its official full reveal, this year’s annual GDC was buzzing with talk around the future of the console. One such discussion was around the Nintendo Switch 2 launch date, which according to people that I spoke to at the event falls in June. </p>



<p>But that’s not all, according to various sources, the Nintendo Switch 2 will launch its games in a three-phase strategy, starting with primarily first-party games on launch. </p>



<p>According to sources, the second-stage will arrive in October-November for third-party studios, most of which are expecting the dev kits for the Switch 2 to be sent in June. Finally, it was said that the third phase for games will be in the holiday period.</p>



<p>In addition to the talk of the three-phase launch plan, Insider Gaming has also learned that select media and creators will be attending Nintendo Switch 2 hands-on next week, where they’ll get hands-on with the console and some of its launch games for a few hours.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is scheduled to be fully revealed on April 2nd, so we expect more in-depth hardware coverage and perhaps some of its launch games too. A launch price along with the official release date is also expected to be announced during the event.</p>



<p>According to various gaming insiders, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-direct-expected-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo is also planning a Nintendo Direct later this week</a>, but its contents is currently unknown.</p>

<p>Nintendo’s long-awaited Pokémon Legends Z-A sequel is reportedly playing it safe by adding no new Pokémon. This may come as both a shock and disappointment to fans waiting to see what new species were going to be added to the ever-growing Pokédex.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-platforms-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> is the next Pokémon title in the tall grass. It’s been a while since Scarlet and Violet, so it feels like the right time for fresh blood. It’s an ironic sentiment, as a leak has outed a lack of new Pokémon in the upcoming sequel to Pokémon Legends Arceus.</p>



<p>While nothing is official with leaks or rumors, the source is very reliable, and it’s looking like a quiet one on the incomings front.</p>







<figure><figcaption>The classics still work. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Reliable and regular Pokémon leaker <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Centro Leaks</a> is back at it again. In a March 25 message on their X page, they said: “<strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A will not introduce any new Pokémon species</strong>.”</p>



<p>With 1,025 Pokémon registered in the total Pokédex, everyone was waiting with bated breath to see who Z-A would add. The news feels out of left field, more so when you consider that Legends Arceus at least added seven fresh-faced Pokémon, with an additional two variations on top of these.</p>



<p>Alas, it isn’t to be for Pokémon Legends Z-A. It appears the RPG will use a mix of Mon from the previous several generations. There could always be a surprise or two, so we won’t count our chickens just yet.</p>

<p>Either way, it’s not all doom and Gloom, though. The return of Mega Evolutions is part of the recent Pokémon Legends Z-A leaks.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/killzone-remastered-trilogy-%E2%80%9Cwould-be-successful%E2%80%9D-says-series-composer.1144086/</guid>

<p>Could a Killzone remastered trilogy have success in the current era of gaming? If you ask series’ composer Joris de Man, that could be the case.</p>



<p>Killzone is one of the more beloved first-party franchises from PlayStation. But since 2014’s Killzone: Shadow Fall, the series as laid dormant as developer Guerrilla Games has since put full focus into the Horizon franchise. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/killzone-composer-would-love-a-remaster-trilogy-dont-know-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videogamer</a>, de Man talked about the franchise and bringing it to a new generation of players.</p>



<p>“I know that there have been petitions for it,” de Man said regarding bringing back Killzone. “I think it’s risky because, I can’t speak for Guirella or anything… I don’t know if it will ever happen. </p>



<p>“I hope it will because I think it is quite an iconic franchise, but also I think it kind of has to take into account kind of the sensitivities and the shift in, I guess, what people want because it is quite bleak in some ways.”</p>



<p>When asked about if that meant a new Killzone game or a remaster, de Man believes a remaster would perform better.</p>



<p>“I think it remastered one would be successful,” he said. “I don’t know if a new game would be as much. I don’t know if people have moved on from it and want something—I don’t know, sometimes I get the sense that people want something a bit more casual, a bit more quick.”</p>
