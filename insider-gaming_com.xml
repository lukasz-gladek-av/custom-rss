<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is celebrating its first anniversary this Friday with a surprise livestream and hinting at a mysterious special message.</p>



<p>Released last year, Atlus‚Äô Metaphor: ReFantazio is the newest IP from the minds behind Persona 5. Under Studio Zero, the JRPG took players to a medieval fantasy world with incredible turn-based combat. The game received multiple year-end accolades, winning three <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Awards</a> and IGN‚Äôs Game of the Year. With its success, it‚Äôs no wonder the team plans to celebrate its anniversary. However, it seems we may get some news there, as well.</p>







<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Celebrate Metaphor: ReFantazio‚Äôs birthday with us! ü•≥</p><p>Join us October 10th for our 1-Year Anniversary Special, airing on the ATLUS West YouTube page.</p><p>üìÖ October 10, 9pm PT/12am ET/5am BST <a href="https://t.co/EjouxPLZl9">pic.twitter.com/EjouxPLZl9</a></p></div>‚Äî Official ATLUS West (@Atlus_West) <a href="https://twitter.com/Atlus_West/status/1975608072748888546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post from <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1975608072748888546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Atlus West</a>, an anniversary livestream for Metaphor: ReFantazio will happen on October 10th, 2025. The event will stream on YouTube and start at 9am PT/12pm EST. To find your timezone, check out this time checker <a href="https://everytimezone.com/s/3a687b72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. As for what it will entail, it simply states that it wil be a celebration for the game‚Äôs one-year milestone. Luckily, the message does say that it will feature a ‚Äúspecial message‚Äù. No other details were given regarding the tease.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs been rumored for a bit that Metaphor: ReFantazio may be ported to the Nintendo Switch, so it could be that. Coincidentally, Atlus‚Äô <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atlus-may-discuss-persona-3-reload-switch-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Persona 3 R</a>eload, which launched in 2023, is coming to the Switch this month. On the other hand, given the incredible reception to the title, we could see DLC or an enhanced version be announced. It‚Äôs a bit too soon for a sequel, but it may not be entirely out of the question. In any case, the game is available on Xbox Game Pass, so those interested can check it out there. For those who have already ventured to the United Kingdom of Euchronia, we may be returning rather soon.</p>



<p>Will you be tuning in for the Metaphor: ReFantazio livestream? What do you hope is announced there? Let us know in the comments below, in the forums, and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/5f4cvU6G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-players-dont-give-a-damn-about-new-portal-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/only-12-of-battlefield-6-players-give-a-damn-about-the-new-portal-mode.1319143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When Battlefield 6 was revealed in full, Electronic Arts and the company‚Äôs associated studios spent a fair bit of time plugging the new Portal platform. It‚Äôs a full-fledged sandbox of sorts that allows players to create their own experiences, experimenting with Battlefield‚Äôs toolbox to manufacture all manner of fan-made functions.</p>



<p>In Battlefield 2042, Portal gave players a glimpse into the past, allowing them to play maps from previous games with all the weapons and vehicles that they fondly remember. In Battlefield 6, Portal is another thing entirely, but as it turns out, painfully few gamers actually give a damn about the mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-88-of-battlefield-players-don-t-care-about-portal">88% of Battlefield Players Don‚Äôt Care About Portal</h2>



<p>In an email circulated by Electronic Arts, a poll within revealed a range of four items that players had to vote on to determine which element of Battlefield 6 they‚Äôre most looking forward to.</p>



<p>By order of most popular to least popular, here are the results of that poll:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tactical Destruction ‚Äì 39%</li>



<li>Return of Campaign ‚Äì 30%</li>



<li>Maps, Modes, and Weapons ‚Äì 18%</li>



<li>Portal ‚Äì 12%</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>It‚Äôs surprising to see the Battlefield 6 campaign vote outpaces the maps, modes, and weapons vote by <strong>a mile</strong> ‚Äì almost <strong>double</strong>. The Battlefield 6 campaign is a welcome addition to this release, and from the trailer released to showcase the story, it looks like it‚Äôs going to be a banger, but it always plays second fiddle to multiplayer.</p>



<p>The tactical destruction being at the top of the table comes as no surprise. That was one of the most talked-about elements of Battlefield 6 in and around the game‚Äôs beta, with clips from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/">Battlefield Labs</a> showcasing some jaw-dropping destruction that is being fine-tuned all the time.</p>



<p>Portal sitting flat at the bottom shows that players either don‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs for this time around, or they simply don‚Äôt care. Why venture into Battlefield Portal in Battlefield 6 and play with the toolkit when you could 100% the campaign or grind multiplayer and rank up?</p>



<p>Portal will most likely become one of those things that is experimented with later, when players have gotten bored with the core offering. What‚Äôs bizarre is that DICE confirmed the Portal platform allows users to earn XP, no matter what they‚Äôre playing. That means that XP farms will be the only thing created on the platform in the early days</p>
