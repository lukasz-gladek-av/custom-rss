<p>Niantic Inc. is closing in on a deal to sell its games division, which includes Pokemon Go, to Saudia Arabia-backed Scopely Inc. for $3.5 billion. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg says</a> a deal on the sale could be announced “in coming weeks”, and would include Niantic’s video game business and gaming properties. In addition to Pokemon Go, Niantic games also include Ingress, Pikmin Bloom, and Monster Hunter Now, among others.</p>



<p>Despite talks being close, the report states that there’s “no assurance an agreement will be reached.”</p>

<p>Founded in 2011, Scopely was acquired by Savvy Games Group in 2023 for $4.9 billion. Savvy Games Group is a gaming subsidiary funded by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.</p>



<p>In August 2024, Niantic and Savvy Games Group <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/savvy-games-group-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-niantic-for-mena-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">signed a deal</a> for Niantic to help with planned expansion into Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and United Arab Emirates. </p>



<p>“Our collaboration with Niantic marks a significant milestone in our efforts to bring cutting-edge games and esports experiences to the MENA-3 region,” Savvy Games Group CEO Brian Ward said, at the time, via PocketGamer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither Scopely nor Niantic would comment on the potential sale when contacted by Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals, one of the more successful games of the last year, has seen its development staff hit with layoffs. According to multiple posts on social media, publisher NetEase has laid off an entire Marvel Rivals development team.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals’ game director Thaddeus Sasser <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297672154060361729/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to LinkedIn</a> to reveal the news on Tuesday afternoon. </p>



<p><strong>UPDATE 7:20PM ET: </strong>More details have come out to claim that none of the main development team in China has been part of the layoffs. The <a href="https://x.com/zhugeex/status/1891979082348257685?s=46&amp;t=hX1f8t9VMLBATttRMgQR3A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">only layoffs have happened</a> to the team in the United States</p>



<p>“This is such a weird industry…” Sasser wrote. “My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games…and were just laid off!”</p>



<p>Based on his wording, it’s unclear if Sasser was included in the layoffs or if it was just his team. Insider Gaming reached out for comment, but Sasser declined.</p>



<p>According to Sasser’s profile, his team—which is based in Seattle, Washington—focused on game and level design.</p>



<p>One member of his team, a level designer from the game, Jack Burrows, confirmed he was part of the layoffs. No reason was shared by either party for the cuts.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has also reached out to NetEase for comment on the layoffs and how many people are being let go. Should a response to any outstanding questions be received, they will be added to this story.</p>



<p>Since its release, Marvel Rivals has been at the top of the player count charts on Steam. The game peaked at 644,269 on the platform while it continues to average over 255,000 people per day on Steam alone.</p>
