<p>According to IO Interactive’s latest announcement, Hitman World of Assassination’s PS VR2 launch has been delayed to March 27, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hitman: World of Assassination was initially scheduled to launch for PS VR2 in December 2024. However, a recent <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/hitman-world-of-assassination-launches-on-ps-vr2-march-27-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from the developers indicates that they require additional time to enhance the game and ensure every aspect is “refined, immersive, and seamless.” The delay will also allow the developers to incorporate some new features for the PS VR2 version, including active reloading.</p>



<h2 id="h-hitman-woa-s-entire-campaign-is-playable-on-ps-vr2">Hitman WOA’s Entire Campaign is Playable on PS VR2</h2>



<p>PS VR2 players can experience the entire Hitman: World of Assassination (WOA) campaign. This includes free exploration across 20 unique locations such as Dubai, Paris, Miami, and more. Players will also have access to over 100 items and weapons while completing missions, adding depth to their approach in each task.</p>



<h2 id="h-hitman-woa-ps-vr2-features">Hitman WOA PS VR2 Features</h2>



<p>The most requested features for Hitman: World of Assassination on PS VR2 include dual-wielding and complete ambidexterity. The developers have confirmed that these features will be available at launch. Additionally, players can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as managing a guard while holding a weapon or picking up an essential item.</p>



<p>The new active reloading feature enables players to manually eject ammunition, grab a new magazine, and insert it back into their weapon, adding a layer of immersion to gear management. The PS VR2 version of the game offers a brand-new way to experience the franchise. Instead of pressing buttons to trigger events, players must physically mimic actions to complete tasks.</p>



<p>The developers are also taking “a more physics-based approach for disguising, where players can take an outfit using positional control, grabbing, and momentum, significantly enhancing the immersion and realism of the gameplay.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rebirth Island is arguably Warzone’s most classic, smaller battle-royale map. If you’re keen to be reunited and engage in heated Alcatraz action, the simultaneous nature of Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season One is ready to bring back Rebirth Island.</p>



<p>If you say “Rebirth Island” to any Warzone player from the last few years, chances are their eyes light up. Whereas Verdansk was—and is still is to many—peak performance where large-scale battle-royale contests are concerned, Rebirth Island is a necessary home away from home. Alcatraz isn’t the friendliest place on Earth, but it’s nice enough to let 40 or so players run amuck in rampant Resurgence fashion.</p>



<p>It’s a tighter map, but has just as many crawl spaces, and hideaway holes, and is a constant source of fun. Let’s find out when you can drop into Rebirth Island in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-rebirth-island-back-in-warzone-amp-black-ops-6">When is Rebirth Island Back in Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Where are we dropping? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Rebirth Island makes its debut in the Black Ops 6 and Warzone integration on <strong>Nov. 18</strong>.</p>



<p>The small-scale map didn’t launch with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season One</a>, but it was outlined in the roadmap that it would arrive in the “Launch Window.” This means barely a week after Season One starts, players are getting stuck into Urzikstan and the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/area-99-revealed-as-new-resurgence-map-in-warzone-at-codnext-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Area 99</a> map, and Rebirth Island is also making its way into regular playlist rotation.</p>



<p>Nostalgia is a unique feeling. Area 99’s legacy is yet to be determined, but for the time being, you can guarantee most Warzone players are licking their lips at the thought of dropping into Rebirth Island. With the addition of Omndirectional Movement and other Black Ops 6 features, this is going to be one of the most surreal Rebirth Island inclusions ever seen in Warzone.</p>



<p>Like in previous years, if you’re a fan of Rebirth Island, get your games in while you can. The playlists for Warzone change regularly: Meaning there are times when Rebirth Island misses a week, and it might be removed altogether in favor of another Resurgence map—I’m looking at you Fortune’s Keep.</p>

<p>You were probably elated to see your leftover MW3 Double XP Tokens reactivated in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 fans, and equally as dismayed to see them vanish again. There is a reason why Activision has done this, but there is good news on the horizon.</p>



<p>Many Modern Warfare 3 players held onto their Double XP Tokens toward the end of the shooter’s lifecycle. This was to use them at the beginning of Black Ops 6 and get a big boost toward <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faster leveling up</a>. However, Activision and Treyarch decided to not carry legacy tokens over, leaving everyone to start from scratch.</p>



<p>It seemed the companies reneged on the decision with the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season One</a>. All Double XP legacy tokens suddenly became active—and I can’t express my joy at seeing hours of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-double-xp-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Double XP</a> in my grasp. In the blink of an eye, they were gone again—but don’t worry, all is not as bad as it seems.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-have-my-black-ops-6-double-xp-tokens">Where Have my Black Ops 6 Double XP Tokens?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t tease me. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Your Black Ops 6 Double XP Tokens have gone because <strong>Treyarch has disabled them to due “potential risk to game stability.”</strong></p>



<p>It turns out you were not supposed to be able to access your Double XP legacy tokens in Black Ops 6, and this was an accident caused by a Season One launch “UI bug.” </p>



<p>Treyarch informed everyone of the situation via an <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1857856770804429277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X message on social media</a>, “With the start of Season 01, a UI bug allowed players to activate legacy XP tokens in Black Ops 6. Unfortunately, it also introduced some potential risk to game stability, which is why it was patched yesterday.”</p>



<p>In more positive news, the developer has acknowledged how important legacy Double XP Tokens are to the community: “We realize how much players appreciate being able to redeem legacy XP tokens in both BO6 and Warzone, so <strong>we are currently testing a way to implement this change correctly in a future update</strong>.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, like the arrival of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-prop-hunt-coming-to-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prop Hunt</a>, we don’t have an exact date this is scheduled to drop. All we can do is monitor Activision and Treyarch socials for the latest news on Double XP Tokens being usable in BLOPS 6 again.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-legacy-double-xp-tokens-in-black-ops-6">How to Use Legacy Double XP Tokens in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 legacy Double XP Tokens are usable if you <strong>activate them through the Warzone interface, and head on back over to the BLOPS 6</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, per Treyarch, “Players can activate any legacy XP tokens in Warzone. <strong>Any tokens applied in Warzone also apply to Black Ops 6</strong> should you switch titles or modes.”</p>



<p>So, if you’re looking to use carried-over Double XP Tokens, you need to have Warzone installed. It’s a cumbersome workaround—but a workaround nonetheless.</p>
