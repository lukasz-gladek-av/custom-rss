<p>You’d think love would be in the air with today’s NYT Connections puzzle, but alas, no. It’s just another challenge that will come and go without too much pomp – the folks over at the New York Times didn’t want to feed any romance into this puzzle. Regardless, I’m here to help you solve the challenge with today’s NYT Connections hints.</p>



<p>Read on to get the answers you need for today’s NYT Connections, then you can go about your day!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

<p>Head back to the spooky Nitemare Island and check out the Friday the 13th-themed skins that have returned to Fortnite for the weekend.</p>



<p>Fortnite announced on social media that Nitemare Island would return to Reload, the Battle Royale-themed mode that launched in 2024. Along with that, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers are back in the game, in skins for the time being.</p>



<p>Nitemare Island originally debuted in October 2025 and was the fifth Reload map. Epic says that you have until 9:00 a.m. ET on Monday, February 16, to jump back into the Halloween-themed map. What a great weekend for Valentine’s Day.</p>

<h2 id="h-news-on-future-fortnite-collabs">News on Future Fortnite Collabs</h2>



<p>Just like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, Fortnite has collaborated with numerous IPs to create a truly unique, if not outright bizarre, gaming experience. Right next to Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, you can also purchase SpongeBob SquarePants. Looking for a Jam track? There are plenty of choices from Chapell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter, but you can also choose Feel Good Inc. by The Gorillaz.</p>







<p>Recently, it was announced that Overwatch, which is undergoing a resurgence, would be part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-overwatch-crossover-brings-genji-tracer-d-va/" id="175954">a future Fortnite collaboration</a>. Kingdom Hearts is also planned for release on the popular free-to-play game.
