<p>Since releasing in February 2022, Valve’s Steam Deck has become the most popular gaming handheld on the market. One of the first accessible ways to play your PC games on the go, the Steam Deck is close to being a perfect device for many, but there are some ways it can improve. One way specifically that you can make your Steam Deck experience better is with some accessories and add-ons.</p>



<p>Whether you want to protect it, upgrade the comfort, or just get more out of the device, there are tons of great accessories available. Some are even on the more affordable side, as well. These are the best Steam Deck accessories available for the 2025 holidays.</p>



<p>Below, you’ll find a list of the best options available today, from protective shells and screen protectors to docking stations and thumb grips. Everything here is compatible with both the Steam Deck LCD and OLED models. If you want to get more out of your handheld, these are the accessories worth checking out this year.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-best-steam-deck-accessories-for-2025">The Best Steam Deck Accessories For 2025</h2>



<p><strong>JSAUX PC0104 Shell Case</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The first Steam Deck accessory to check out is one that brings durability to the handheld. This shell case from not only protects it when in use, but it comes with a full shell cover for transportation that protects the screen, joysticks and face buttons. There’s even a kickstand for those that want to plug it in simply via the USB-C port and a strap if you want to attach a power bank. It’s <strong>available for $23.99 for the holidays</strong>, and costs $30 throughout the year.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Syntech Soft Case</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>When shopping for a case, sometimes you want something practical. This case will cost you <strong>less than $25</strong>, and goes around the entire Steam Deck without adding too much bulk. It doesn’t interfere with any of the buttons and sits as snug as any chase you’ll find—it’s been used by senior editor Mike Straw for a few months now, actually. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Cooling Fan</strong></p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you feel like the Steam Deck runs a little too warm, there are options to keep it on the cooler side. One option comes from JSUAX. This cooling fan snaps right on and helps with overall circulation. It even has a kick stand, allowing you to set it up nicely on your table or desk. If it’s something you’re interested in, you can pick it up <strong>for $30 on sale</strong>, or <strong>$40 at regular price. </strong></p>











<hr>



<p><strong>Back Button Enhancements</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Feel like your fingers slip off the back panel buttons? These rubber grips come in two different sizes to make the buttons feel thicker on the fingers and avoid any possible slip or mis-click. Currently they are <strong>on sale for $12</strong>, but regularly run <strong>about $14.</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Thumb Grips</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sometimes the grip on the handheld isn’t what you want it. These Skull &amp; Co thumb grips come with three styles in a pack to help match your preference. They are <strong>available for $10</strong>.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>IVANKY Docking Station</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are a lot of docking stations for the Steam Deck, but this one might be one of the best. It features a USB-c connection that goes to the device while the dock itself has HDMI 2.1 output that supports up to 4K@144Hz, three USB-A 3.0 ports, a 1GB Ethernet port, and a rapid-charging USB-C port to keep your device fully juiced. It’s normally $39.99, but you can<strong> buy it now for $28.</strong></p>











<hr>



<p><strong>PlayVital Rubber Pads</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to add some style to your Steam Deck while improving functionality? These rubber pads come in different varieties and not only look great, but they give you added grip as well. <strong>For less than $15</strong> you can get designs ranging from basic black hexagons to waves and space. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong><strong>Sony INZONE E9 Wired In-Ear Monitor</strong></strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sony built these IEMs specifically for competitive gaming, so they’re all about clean, accurate sound and great positional audio. They’re lightweight, block out noise surprisingly well, and come with a small USB-C DAC that lets you tweak EQ and surround settings through the INZONE software. If you want gaming headset-level detail without wearing a bulky headset, these are a fantastic pick.</p>



<p>One underrated feature of the earbuds is just how good they are at blocking out the outside noise. It’s absolutely perfect when on a long flight that happens to have children on it that are a little bit upset. That alone is worth <strong>the $149.99</strong> price point.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Screen Protecto</strong>r</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With any portable device, the last thing you want to do is damage the screen. These tempered glass screen protectors cover the screen from edge to edge and protect both the LCD and OLED models. The best part is that you can still use the touch screen despite the thickness. Right now, a <strong>two-pack is $10</strong>, but you can often find it for <strong>as low as $8</strong>.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Samsung PRO Plus microSD</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those on the go that need more space in their Steam Deck or Xbox Ally X, the Samsung PRO Plus microSD is one of the best cards on the market without completely breaking the bank. This card offers read/write speeds up to around 180 MB/s for reading and 130 MB/s writing. The card starts at <strong>$26.99</strong> for 256GB but is also available in 512 GB for<strong> $49.99</strong> and <strong>$79.99</strong> for 1TB.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware are teaming up at least one more time to deliver Elden Ring Nightreign’s anticipated The Forsaken Hollows DLC. If you thought you were done beating the night, you can think again.</p>



<p>The Nightreign updates and content haven’t stopped since launch. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-even-harder-in-new-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got even harder</a>—which was brutal—and then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-expansion-dlc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first expansion was revealed.</a> The developer has no intention for you to go outside and see the light anytime soon.</p>



<p>If you want Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows DLC release information, Insider Gaming has the dates and details you seek.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-coming-out">When Is Elden Ring Nightreign DLC Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The night never ends. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign’s The Forspoken Hollows DLC is currently scheduled to release on December 4.</strong></p>



<p>This would be quite apt as it would be nearly one year on from Nightreign’s announcement at The Game Awards 2024. With no word on how much content Nightreign is expected to get—especially with FromSoftware resources being diverted to The Duskbloods—this could end up being the only major DLC expansion for Nightreign.</p>



<p>This guide will be updated if any late announcements indicate a delay to The Forspoken Hollows.</p>







<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc">Everything Included In Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows DLC</h2>



<p><strong>Nightreign’s The Forspoken Hollows DLC includes new playable characters, new bosses, a new Shifting Earth, and much more on top of this.</strong></p>



<p>FromSoftware is a master of its craft. It doesn’t short-change gamers and constantly provides value for money. These are the full details that have been provided for The Forspoken Hollows DLC so far:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This product is an additional&nbsp;DLC&nbsp;for&nbsp;ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN. It includes&nbsp;2 additional Nightfarers,&nbsp;2 new Bosses, and&nbsp;1 new Shifting Earth, and more.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The two new Nightfarers are <strong>Scholar </strong>and <strong>Undertaker</strong>. Here’s a brief explainer provided for each new character:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scholar:</strong> “An&nbsp;academic&nbsp;who walks the&nbsp;Lands Between.&nbsp;Boasting impressive arcane levels, he gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation.”</li>



<li><strong>Undertaker:</strong> “An&nbsp;abbess&nbsp;who was mandated to slay the&nbsp;Nightlord.&nbsp;Boasting impressive strength and faith, she sends enemies to the afterlife with ruthless efficiency.”</li>
</ul>



<p>Whereas the Shifting Earth brings about gorgeous crystals in an enchanting locale. The rest remains to be seen on December 4. As usual, the content is playable on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>You can see tidbits of new content and a snippet of what’s to come in the official gameplay reveal trailer for the DLC expansion.</p>
