<p>New details from an insider reveal that Sony PlayStation might stop releasing its single-player titles on PC. </p>



<p>Multi-platform releases have become increasingly common in recent years, with Xbox participating more actively in this strategy than PlayStation. However, many PlayStation exclusives have also made their way to PC. It appears that this may change in the future, as PlayStation seems to be leaning toward maintaining more exclusive titles.</p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-s-strategy-could-see-live-service-games-come-to-pc-while-single-player-exclusives-don-t">PlayStation’s Strategy Could See Live-Service Games Come to PC, While Single Player Exclusives Don’t</h2>



<p>During the latest episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/pl/podcast/why-phil-spencer-retired-and-whats-next-for-xbox/id1507834679?i=1000751690666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Triple Click Podcast</a> (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-the-sense-i%E2%80%99m-getting-is-that-sony-is-backing-away-from-putting-their-exclusive-console-traditional-single-player-stuff-on-pc.1447141/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>), Jason Schreier discussed PlayStation seemingly considering stopping its single-player games from coming to PC. Schreier stated that he thinks the strategy for them is “live service games are coming to PC,” while he’s getting “the sense” that they are “backing away from putting their exclusive console stuff like traditional single-player stuff on PC.”  </p>



<p>Schrier mentioned that it wouldn’t be surprising if Marvel’s Wolverine never comes to PC. Even if it eventually does, players would likely understand that a PlayStation is necessary to play the game, “at least for the indefinite future”. He also expressed uncertainty about how successful the PC releases have been.</p>



<p>When asked why PlayStation would revert to a strategy that seems to “put something back in a bottle,” along with the potential consequences of such a move, Schrier replied that they never release games on PC simultaneously with console launches. He pointed out that “PC releases were always just kind of late to the party.” He added that he doesn’t think it was successful in the first place and doesn’t think going back to the console-only strategy would be “that big of a blow”. </p>



<p>In the same ResetEra <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-the-sense-i%E2%80%99m-getting-is-that-sony-is-backing-away-from-putting-their-exclusive-console-traditional-single-player-stuff-on-pc.1447141/page-6#post-151851202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thread</a>, Schreier clarified that this is “not speculation.” He explained that certain topics may surface during a show before he has the chance to publish a story about them. He also mentioned that more information on this topic should be available soon.</p>

<p>Santa Monica has provided a code that players can use to access God of War: Sons of Sparta’s roguelike mode, The Pit of Agonies, early. </p>



<p>Santa Monica <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow-dropped</a> God of War: Sons of Sparta during the latest Sony State of Play event, and fans have fun in the 2D metroidvania adventure ever since then. The title has always had the Pit of Agonies roguelike mode, but players had to finish the game to access it; now, they can do it earlier. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-the-pit-unlock-code">God of War: Sons of Sparta The Pit Unlock Code</h2>



<p>As revealed in the new blog post, the only way previously to unlock God of War: Sons of Sparta’s Pit of Agonies roguelike mode was to beat the story. However, now players can unlock it early by entering a code in the starting menu. The code is a series of inputs on your DualSense controller that you can check out below: </p>



<p><strong>Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, L1, R1, Touchpad</strong></p>

<iframe title="God of War Sons of Sparta - The Pit | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5oqO5WuxoVE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>For those unaware about the Pit, it is a separate rougelike mode where players battle different enemies to access new reward pools. The game mode can be played solo or with another player through local co-op as Kratos and Deimos take on this challenge. </p>



<p>The game mode also features a difficulty modifier called Agony, which can be chosen at the start of a run. This introduces variety to gameplay and changes how players approach the game. For example, “the Agony of Torment will manifest healing vessels that must be destroyed to prevent enemies from regenerating health, while the Agony of Calamity will cause defeated enemies to burst into a fiery explosion.” </p>



<p>After finishing each run in God of War: Sons of Sparta’s The Pit mode, players will be rewarded with a Symbol of Suffering for their chosen Agonies. When players hit thresholds of Symbols, they unlock new agones, and completion provides them with Ashes of Agony, which allows them to get permanent upgrades that last between attempts.</p>
