            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is anything but a pushover. Team Ninja has once again concocted another brutal affair, sure to have you pulling out your hair for hours. If you’re wondering how many hours exactly, we can run through Ninja Gaiden 4’s game length and expected playtime for you.</p>



<p>Team Ninja finally returned to its legendary franchise after a few years away. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> carries on Ryu Hayabusa’s journey and brings back the PTSD instilled by over 30 years of almost hilariously difficult NG games. Don’t get it twisted, we welcome the challenge, and NG games offer a level of challenge not even some Souls games can match!</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 looks to be a violent return to form. If you’re curious as to how much content is in the game, we’ve got all the answers you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-ninja-gaiden-4">How Many Hours To Beat Ninja Gaiden 4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How long can you endure? Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Ninja Director Masakazu Hirayama has said an initial playthrough on normal difficulty should take you “15 to 20 hours.”</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, Ninja Gaiden 4 on a ‘normal’ difficulty is the equivalent of other games essentially being on hard—on steroids. Your mileage will vary when it comes to Hirayama’s window—through <a href="https://next-play.com.au/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-preview-and-development-team-interview-meeting-yakumo-ryus-return-new-weapons-dlc-plans-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NextPlay</a>. If you’re well-versed in hack ‘n’ slash games and used to the difficulty of every combat encounter, then this is a realistic timeframe.</p>



<p>If you’re unfamiliar with Ninja Gaiden and intense action games such as these, your runtime might lean toward the 20-hour window, and <em>beyond</em>. Whereas if you make use of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-disgusting-levels-of-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NG 4’s difficulty settings</a>, you might even clock in at just under 15 hours!</p>



<p>There’s plenty of choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-ninja-gaiden-4-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Ninja Gaiden 4 Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>A completionist run of Ninja Gaiden 4 could feasibly take you 50-100 hours-plus, and there’s a good chance that most people will never be able to complete Ninja Gaiden 4 at all!</strong></p>



<p>If we’re talking about doing everything in Nnja Gaiden 4, this means beating all the extra Missions, Challenges, achieving full weapon mastery, and beating all difficulty levels.</p>



<p>The reason this can take upwards of 100 hours—borderline until the end of time itself—is because of Master Ninja mode. If you go through the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4 trophy list</a>, you’ll see that “Way of the Master Ninja” requires you to “Complete the game on MASTER NINJA difficulty.”</p>



<p>If this is anything like previous games, expect enemies to kill you in barely any hits, insta-kill you with grab attacks, and attack you whilst you’re attacking other enemies—and even if you’re in the air! It’s beyond brutal. It’s sadistic, but a sickeningly good time for Ninja Gaiden enthusiasts.</p>



<p>Please, please let us know if you intend to do everything. Have you beaten any Ninja Gaiden games on Master Ninja difficulty (or the equivalent setting) in the past? Now’s the time to brag through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

<p>There are plenty of Pokémon to encounter in Pokémon Legends: Z-A across Lumiose City, with Wild Zones having different spawns for Pokémon. For all the details on Wild Zone 2, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<p>Wild Zone 2 may be accessible very early in the story, but it’s well worth hunting for new additions to your party here as there are three Pokémon that can be evolved to unlock Mega Evolutions later on, so adding them to your ranks early on is advised to increase their levels in anticipation for battles.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for a specific Pokémon, here are the details on everything you can find in Wild Zone 2 in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Fishing time. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Wild Zone 2 in Pokémon Legends: Z-A is available to explore after you complete Main Mission 5, and is one of the earliest areas you will be able to explore.</strong></p>



<p>There are six Pokémon species in total to find and catch to earn the golden crown for fully discovering the Pokémon in Wild Zone 2, earning a chunk of points towards Mable’s Research rewards.</p>



<p>The table below shows all Pokémon that spawn in Wild Zone 2, the time of day required, and notes on the specific location where they can be found.</p>

<p><strong>There is one spawn point for Alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 2, with the Pokémon that appears depending on the time of day.</strong></p>



<p>The locked spawn point for the Alpha Pokémon is located on the right-hand side of the zone from the fast-travel point, accessible via stepping stones from the top-right of the zone.</p>



<p>Other Pokémon in Wild Zone 2 can spawn as Alpha Pokémon, however, as every spawn has a chance of appearing as an Alpha. However, there are guaranteed spawns that can be farmed for valuable resources like EXP Candies.</p>



<p>All the details you need on alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 2 are below.</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A takes place entirely in Lumiose City, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a ton to explore. Pokémon spawns are scattered in various Wild Zones, and we’ve got all the spawns and Alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 1.</p>



<p>In total, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has 20 Wild Zones to explore, which unlock periodically at various points in the story, with Wild Zone 1 being just the tip of the iceberg. However, there are some handy Pokémon available in this spot that can be long-term inclusions in your party.</p>



<p>For all the full Pokémon spawns in Wild Zone 1, including the Alpha Pokémon available, look no further than this guide.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Hunt them down. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Wild Zone 1 is immediately available to access in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A, serving as part of the introduction locations, and features several Pokémon</strong>.</p>



<p>In total, there are seven species of Pokémon to find and catch to complete Mable’s Research Task for Wild Zone 1, though not all of them will be available to encounter immediately as some story progression is required before you can fully explore the area.</p>



<p>The table below shows all Pokémon that spawn in Wild Zone 1, the time of day required, and notes on the specific location they can be found.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon</th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Bunnelby</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Ground Level</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Fletchling</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Ground level</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mareep</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Two spawns directly opposite fast-travel point</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pichu</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Top-right opposite fast-travel point, requires Rock Smash</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pidgey</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Rooftops</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Weedle</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Ground Level &amp; Rooftops</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>There is one locked Alpha Pokémon</strong> <strong>spawn in Wild Zone 1, which is fixed to always be present in the game. However, it won’t be the only Alpha you can encounter in this area.</strong></p>



<p>Every Pokémon in Legends: Z-A has a chance of spawning as an Alpha, with only some having fixed and guaranteed spawns. Many of those rotate with several potential Pokémon, but this isn’t the case in Wild Zone 1.</p>



<p>All the details you need on Alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 1 are below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon</th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Alpha Pidgey</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Rooftops</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
