            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Intel is gearing up to announce and launch its next-generation Battlemage GPU. According to known leaker Golden Pig Upgrade, Intel is aiming to going to launch the Battlemage graphics card in December.</p>



<p>No specifics about the card weren’t part of the claim nor was any information on how many cards will be part of this lineup. However, the leaker was clear enough about the timeline.</p>



<p>“Looking forward to the wonderful performance of Battlemage next month,” the <a href="https://weibo.com/3219724922/5098080466897502">Weibo post</a> reads via on-site translation. </p>



<p>Battlemage is the second-generation discrete GPU from Intel. It’s the follow up to the Intel Arc from 2022. Intel released three versions of the Arc graphics card: Arc 3, Arc 5, and Arc 7. With Battlemage, it’s been rumored that Intel will only be releasing budget-friendly cards that sit on the lower end of the market. A competitor to Nvidia’s or AMD’s top offerings shouldn’t be expected.</p>



<p>Still, even if the low-end rumors are true, more graphics cards can only be viewed as a positive for PC enthusiasts. More and more players are heading to PC gaming, and the more options there are, the better the cost becomes for everyone. </p>



<p>Intel hasn’t responded to Insider Gaming’s request for comment on the rumored pending launch. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. Until then, please take the latest claims on Intel Battlemage with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>In addition to Intel’s pending new launch, both AMD and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-nvidia-rtx-50-series-graphics-cards-release-date-rumors-continue-to-circulate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia are expected</a> to announce new graphics cards in early 2025 around CES.</p>
