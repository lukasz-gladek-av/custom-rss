<p>Persona 3 Reload is bringing back the original’s singer with a new update celebrating the Nintendo Switch 2 release.</p>



<p>Released in 2024, Persona 3 Reload served as the series’ first remake, bringing the 2006 original back to life for newer generations. With the changes, the original vocalist, Yumi Kawamura, did not return. Instead, the music was sung by Azumi Takahashi, as well as returning contributor Lotus Juice. Upon its release, it received tons of praise for its reinvention of the game and dedication to the original. An expansion, titled Project Aigis, came out later that year and acted as an epilogue to the game’s narrative. A port of Persona 3 Reload is launching on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/persona-3-reload-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on October 23rd and, as celebration, a nostalgic voice is making her return.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>An iconic voice returns to Persona 3 Reload… 🎤🎶</p><p>Listen to eight dungeon and battle BGM tracks by the original Persona 3 vocalist – Yumi Kawamura – when the game launches on Nintendo Switch 2! </p><p>Patch will be available on all platforms. <a href="https://t.co/cZKpuVTWyP">pic.twitter.com/cZKpuVTWyP</a></p></div>— Official ATLUS West (@Atlus_West) <a href="https://twitter.com/Atlus_West/status/1980787484729430169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1980787484729430169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a>, Atlus West revealed that songs from the original Persona 3 and FES will be coming to Reload on October 23rd, when the Nintendo Switch 2 version is released. To celebrate the occasion, vocalist Yumi Kawamura, who performed the songs for the 2006 JRPG, spoke about the addition. In a statement below, she says</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It’s been a while!” Kawamura states. “I’m truly overjoyed and grateful to be reunited with everyone again. Persona 3 is a treasure to me as well—I can’t help but feel excited. Old friends, will you fight alongside me once more? New friends, how about letting my songs aid you in battle? Let’s celebrate together. Thank you for your continued support!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The songs being added to Persona 3 Reload from Persona 3 and FES are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Burn My Dread -Last Battle-“</li>



<li>“Mass Destruction”</li>



<li>“Deep Mentality”</li>



<li>“When The Moon’s&nbsp;Reaching Out Stars”</li>



<li>“Want to Be Close”</li>



<li>“Memories of You”</li>



<li>“Mass Destruction -P3fes Version-“</li>



<li>“Brand New Days”</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s important to note that the songs will only be available during exploration in Tartarus and in battles. The songs, as mentioned before, will come to Persona 3 Reload on October 23rd via a new patch. Luckily, all consoles, like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will get to listen to Yumi’s iconic tracks then, too. While Azumi’s versions of Persona 3’s songs were great, Yumi’s rasp and range can’t be beat. As a fan of the series, it’s good to see her renditions return and add some nostalgia to the amazing turn-based gameplay.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Yumi’s versions come to Persona 3 Reload? Who do you prefer, Yumi or Azumi? Did you play the remake? What did you think of it?

<p>Luigi’s Mansion is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 via Nintendo Switch Online just in time for Halloween.</p>



<p>As a benefit of Nintendo Switch Online, many nostalgic games from Nintendo’s past are available to play. From NES classics like Donkey Kong to Game Boy hits like Tetris, there’s a lot to enjoy for fans. With the newly released Nintendo Switch 2, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-upgrade-pack-details-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-online-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Expansion Pack</a> including GameCube, Nintendo 64, and Game Boy Advance titles was released. As the catalog grows, with recent additions including Forsaken 64 and Chibi-Robo, a spooky hit from the 2000s is coming just in time for Halloween.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/GvN4hHpfVqQ?si=YMZmjm1kbZz5gIyG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new video</a> from Nintendo, the company announced that Luigi’s Mansion is headed to Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. Furthermore, you won’t have to wait long to play it, as it releases on October 30th, 2025, the day before Halloween. The iconic 2001 title, released on the Nintendo GameCube, has since gone on to have a 3DS re-release and two other mainline entries.&nbsp;Luigi’s Mansion follows Mario’s brother, Luigi, as he navigates a ghost-infested mansion in search of his brother and friends. With a handy Poltergust 3000 and the kooky Prof. E. Gadd, you’ll take down the many ghosts and specters you’ll encounter.</p>



<p>The most recent title from the Luigi’s Mansion series was a re-release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a> for the Nintendo Switch in 2024. As for the last mainline entry, that was Luigi’s Mansion 3 in 2019, also for the Nintendo Switch. Its success as a Mario spinoff has made it a household name and one many hope makes a return with a new game. Perhaps the addition to Nintendo Switch Online could be a sign it’s in the works or if interest is there? In any case, Luigi’s Mansion’s addition is a scare we all can enjoy.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splinter Cell Remake Loses Another Director]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-remake-no-director-job-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splinter-cell-remake-loses-another-director.1331020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new job listing from Ubisoft, the Splinter Cell remake has lost its director again.</p>



<p>Based on the Tom Clancy brand, Splinter Cell brings the stealth espionage action to gaming. With six mainline titles and a dozen novelizations, the series was a hit in the 2000s/2010s. Unfortunately, we last played as Sam Fisher back in 2013 with the cool yet controversial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-adds-steam-achievements-for-splinter-cell-blacklist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blacklist</a>. Having been over a decade since the last entry, a remake of the franchise’s first title was in order and announced in 2021. Sadly, all the news surrounding the project since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t been the best</a>, with no updates and the original director leaving. Now, it seems whoever came after them has quit the remake, according to a new Ubisoft job listing.</p>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-hiring-new-director-for-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft Hiring New Director for Splinter Cell Remake</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/splinter-cell-remake-lost-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, a job listing, which has since been taken down, was available on Ubisoft’s website. The position, Game Director, was for the Ubisoft Toronto office and would be for the Splinter Cell remake. The description for the job states that the person would be part of the Splinter Cell development team, leading workers and coming up with new features. </p>



<p>In 2022, the original director, David Grivel, left the project and Ubisoft after more than a decade at the company. Given we haven’t seen any gameplay or updates like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a>, things look a bit unsteady. Just recently, the series did get a small revival with Netflix’s Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, an animated series from John Wick creator Derek Kolstad. The show <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-season-two-renewed-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was renewed</a> for a second season shortly after premiering, so it seems the hype for a new entry is very much present. Hopefully, things will work out and we’ll finally put on those night-vision goggles again.</p>



<p>What do you make of the news of the director’s departure? Did you watch Splinter Cell: Deathwatch? What did you think? Do you want to see a new Splinter Cell game in the future?

<p>Lootify’s October 2025 monthly codes can be used to redeem various rewards in the game, including Gold, Keys, Potions, Scrolls, and much more. The rewards can then be used to upgrade various items in the game, and also to make use of the rebirth feature, so let’s show you which codes are active.</p>



<p>Lootify is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-azure-latch-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> RPG dungeon game that blends together open-world exploration, thrilling combat, looting, as well as some ultra-challenging boss battles. Although the word ‘loot’ is in the name of the game, it certainly isn’t the most important element of Lootify. </p>



<p>One of the best ways by which players can focus more on combat and exploration rather than simply looting is by using some free Lootify codes, which the developers release through their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/official-lootify" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can have an easy gateway to free Balloons, Ruby Blocks, and Turrets by using the latest Car Battles Codes for October 2025.</p>



<p>Building a car is not an easy task, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-plants-vs-brainrots-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Car Battles lets even amateurs in the world of automobile engineering build their own vehicles, albeit with a small twist at the end. The cars that players build in the game are then used in combat against other players, where the objective is to destroy all vehicular competition. Players have to use items like turrets, custom wheels, and even blades to cause damage to their opponents, all while maintaining the structural integrity of their own vehicle, and this is where Car Battles codes can help.</p>



<p>That’s why designing your vehicle strategically is of utmost importance. After all, the placement of one drill can be the difference between you winning and losing at Car Battles. To upgrade cars to create the best possible machines, players will have to either spend in-game money or open crates of varying rarities to test out their luck. Think of the game as a free-for-all, but one where you get rewarded for destroying other players’ cars using your own. </p>

<h2 id="h-expired-car-battles-codes-nbsp">Expired Car Battles Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, Car Battles does not have any codes that have expired. Although that is to be expected, considering that this is a fairly new game, players will be keen to expand their arsenal using some free rewards. When new codes drop and the currently active ones stop working, they will be moved down to this section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing we recommend that all players do is bookmark this page for future reference about Car Battles, as we update the article with new codes as soon as they drop. This can save players from having to go through the hassle of finding the new codes from the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/472296619/Wreck-Team#!/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s Discord server</a> or from the developer’s socials.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-car-battles-codes">How to redeem Car Battles Codes</h2>

<p>Electronic Arts (EA) and Battlefield Studios have pushed out an update that nerfs XP bot farming in Battlefield 6 portal lobbies.</p>



<p>While portal lobbies will give players a 150% match completion bonus, <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1980703722800886102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they no longer</a> offer Mastery XP or challenge completions. This nerf only impacts those lobbies that have bots enabled.</p>



<p>When Battlefield 6 launched, many players used bot-filled lobbies within the portal to quickly rank up their weapons and complete challenges. That resulted in debate among players on social media about whether it was something that should be allowed. Then, a week after the game’s release, EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put out a statement</a> saying that a review of data found that <strong>“a large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots.”</strong></p>



<p>While they “completely understand” why these lobbies were made, EA said that it made it “noticeably harder” for players to play in lobbies that offered a genuine Battlefield 6 experience. This led the company to announce plans to make adjustments to the portal that would limit the number of XP farms that used available server space.</p>



<p>“Whether that’s Hardcore Conquest, All-Out Warfare, longer matches, or your favorite community-created experience, we want you to be able to find and enjoy it easily with your friends as you play your way together,” EA said at the time.</p>







<p>As expected with a major change like this, the reactions have been a bit mixed. While the overall feedback on social has been generally positive, with players calling the update “excellent news” and “as it should be”, there are those who aren’t happy about it.</p>



<p>The chief complaint among those upset involves the <a href="https://x.com/Jaidenatoor11/status/1980709454145536371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulty and length of time</a> it takes to complete various weapon challenges and unlock attachments. EA has said, however, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-progression-issues-and-xp-leveling-will-be-addressed-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that updates to progression</a> are coming as early as this week. </p>
