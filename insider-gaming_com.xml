<p>Counter-Strike is already the biggest multiplayer game in the world, and a mobile version would be a total game changer. As big as the PC gaming industry is, the mobile gaming industry is that much bigger with the amount of phones out there.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-on-mobile">Is Counter-Strike on Mobile?</h2>



<p>There is no official version of Counter-Strike available on mobile. Other first person shooters have stepped into the mobile space though. Call of Duty Mobile is one of the most popular and highest grossing mobile shooters ever. Riot plans to eventually launch their tactical shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-mobile-china-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VALORANT on mobile</a>, and Ubisoft is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-china/">working on a mobile version of Rainbow Six Siege</a>.</p>



<p>Counter-Strike is technically playable on phones through apps that can stream Steam to mobile devices, but if it does work, it won’t be well optimized. The closest thing to CS2 on mobile is playing it on Steam Deck, but the game is not Steam Deck Verified. While it’s not impossible for Counter-Strike to eventually reach phones, it’s extremely unlikely, as Valve has never prioritized mobile game development.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a mobile game like Counter-Strike though, there’s plenty to choose from.</p>



<h2 id="h-mobile-games-like-counter-strike">Mobile Games Like Counter-Strike</h2>



<p>Just by searching “Counter-Strike” on the iOS or Apple app store, you’ll see tons of games clearly trying to emulate the iconic first person shooter. Even the names of the games are trying to capitalize on the popularity of CS: Critical Strike, Modern Strike Online, Critical Ops, Counter Attack. All of these games advertise CS-like tactical gameplay and weapon skins, and many of these games have just ported over nearly exact copies of iconic maps.</p>



<p>Top-down camera versions like Bullet Echo are also similar to Counter-Strike, but offer a different perspective. Both Call of Duty Mobile and Arena Breakout are also really good, popular mobile shooter games. However they’re more similar to arcade-like action shooters than tactical shooters. As mentioned above, both VALORANT and Siege are eventually making their way to mobile, but not for some time.</p>
