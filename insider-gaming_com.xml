<p>Lootify’s October 2025 monthly codes can be used to redeem various rewards in the game, including Gold, Keys, Potions, Scrolls, and much more. The rewards can then be used to upgrade various items in the game, and also to make use of the rebirth feature, so let’s show you which codes are active.</p>



<p>Lootify is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-azure-latch-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> RPG dungeon game that blends together open-world exploration, thrilling combat, looting, as well as some ultra-challenging boss battles. Although the word ‘loot’ is in the name of the game, it certainly isn’t the most important element of Lootify. </p>



<p>One of the best ways by which players can focus more on combat and exploration rather than simply looting is by using some free Lootify codes, which the developers release through their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/official-lootify" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>You can have an easy gateway to free Balloons, Ruby Blocks, and Turrets by using the latest Car Battles Codes for October 2025.</p>



<p>Building a car is not an easy task, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-plants-vs-brainrots-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Car Battles lets even amateurs in the world of automobile engineering build their own vehicles, albeit with a small twist at the end. The cars that players build in the game are then used in combat against other players, where the objective is to destroy all vehicular competition. Players have to use items like turrets, custom wheels, and even blades to cause damage to their opponents, all while maintaining the structural integrity of their own vehicle, and this is where Car Battles codes can help.</p>



<p>That’s why designing your vehicle strategically is of utmost importance. After all, the placement of one drill can be the difference between you winning and losing at Car Battles. To upgrade cars to create the best possible machines, players will have to either spend in-game money or open crates of varying rarities to test out their luck. Think of the game as a free-for-all, but one where you get rewarded for destroying other players’ cars using your own. </p>

<h2 id="h-expired-car-battles-codes-nbsp">Expired Car Battles Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, Car Battles does not have any codes that have expired. Although that is to be expected, considering that this is a fairly new game, players will be keen to expand their arsenal using some free rewards. When new codes drop and the currently active ones stop working, they will be moved down to this section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing we recommend that all players do is bookmark this page for future reference about Car Battles, as we update the article with new codes as soon as they drop. This can save players from having to go through the hassle of finding the new codes from the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/472296619/Wreck-Team#!/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s Discord server</a> or from the developer’s socials.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 XP Bot Farming Portal Lobbies Nerfed By EA]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-xp-bot-farming-portal-lobbies-nerfed-by-ea/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-xp-bot-farming-portal-lobbies-nerfed-by-ea.1330852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts (EA) and Battlefield Studios have pushed out an update that nerfs XP bot farming in Battlefield 6 portal lobbies.</p>



<p>While portal lobbies will give players a 150% match completion bonus, <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1980703722800886102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they no longer</a> offer Mastery XP or challenge completions. This nerf only impacts those lobbies that have bots enabled.</p>



<p>When Battlefield 6 launched, many players used bot-filled lobbies within the portal to quickly rank up their weapons and complete challenges. That resulted in debate among players on social media about whether it was something that should be allowed. Then, a week after the game’s release, EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put out a statement</a> saying that a review of data found that <strong>“a large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots.”</strong></p>



<p>While they “completely understand” why these lobbies were made, EA said that it made it “noticeably harder” for players to play in lobbies that offered a genuine Battlefield 6 experience. This led the company to announce plans to make adjustments to the portal that would limit the number of XP farms that used available server space.</p>



<p>“Whether that’s Hardcore Conquest, All-Out Warfare, longer matches, or your favorite community-created experience, we want you to be able to find and enjoy it easily with your friends as you play your way together,” EA said at the time.</p>







<p>As expected with a major change like this, the reactions have been a bit mixed. While the overall feedback on social has been generally positive, with players calling the update “excellent news” and “as it should be”, there are those who aren’t happy about it.</p>



<p>The chief complaint among those upset involves the <a href="https://x.com/Jaidenatoor11/status/1980709454145536371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulty and length of time</a> it takes to complete various weapon challenges and unlock attachments. EA has said, however, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-progression-issues-and-xp-leveling-will-be-addressed-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that updates to progression</a> are coming as early as this week. </p>
