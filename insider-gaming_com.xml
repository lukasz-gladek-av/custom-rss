<p>In a shocking move, D-CELL GAMES’ Unbeatable has been delayed to early December, with less than 12 hours until its planned launch. As to why the last-minute delay happened, it seems an unreleaseable bug was found and needs to be fixed urgently.</p>



<p>Announced via Kickstarter in 2021, Unbeatable is an anime-inspired rhythm game releasing on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. As vocalist Beat, you’ll resist a tyrannical government that outlawed music. With the help of your band, you’ll bring music back to the world via engaging rhythm gameplay. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">demo for the game</a> was released on PC and PlayStation 5 and was well-received by fans. The game was originally set to release on November 6th, but according to the developer, it won’t launch until December.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a developer post on Steam</a>, RJ Lake, one of the game’s directors, announced that Unbeatable is now coming out on December 9th, 2025. The game was expected to launch in less than 12 hours, so the delay is very last-minute. As to why, the team cites a low-repro progression blocker that would require pushing the console release date back if fixed. To that end, to ensure the game releases on all platforms simultaneously, it has been pushed to December. </p>



<p>Delays for games are a rare occurrence, much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less at the last minute</a>. Given the popularity of Unbeatable, it’s sure to be disappointing. However, D-CELL GAMES does mention that, with the extra time, it’ll be able to work on some pre-launch content it couldn’t get to. So, while it’ll be a month before we get to play it, the version we’ll get will hopefully be the best possible one.</p>



<p>What do you think of Unbeatable’s last-minute delay? Are you disappointed? Did you play the demo? If so, did you enjoy it?

<p>What appears to be a nearly full lineup of Intel Core Ultra 300 Panther Lake CPUs has been leaked online ahead of an official announcement. </p>



<p>The new CPUs, which were listed by known hardware leaker <a href="https://x.com/jaykihn0/status/1986086104286597269">jaykhin0</a>, show processors ranging from the high-end Core Ultra X9 388H to the Core Ultra 3 322. When it comes to Cores, Panther Lake features a max of 16 cores, depending on the chip. For clock speed, users are looking at a max boost of 5.1 GHz for the top processor while the more entry-level options reach 4.4 GHz. </p>



<p>It’s unknown if this is the complete family of CPUs for the next mainline release, but it’s enough to get an idea of what enthusiasts should expect. You can check out all of the early specs for yourself below.</p>



<p>Intel is rumored to release Panther Lake to the public in Q1 2026.</p>

<p>A24 and Netflix are teaming up for a new video game adaptation: Overcooked. Furthermore, it will take the form of an unscripted reality cooking competition.</p>



<p>If you are an avid multiplayer fan, no title has come close to being as fun and frustrating as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overcooked</a>. Created by Ghost Town Games, the cooking simulator made waves in 2016 for its stressful yet enjoyable gameplay. Since then, a sequel and remaster have come out and it remains one of the best co-op indie titles in recent years. Now, it seems the concept of the game is making its way to one of the world’s biggest streaming platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-and-a24-planning-unscripted-competition-show-based-on-overcooked">Netflix and A24 Planning Unscripted Competition Show Based on Overcooked </h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive report from Deadline</a>, the outlet revealed that A24 has acquired the rights to Overcooked and wants to adapt the game into a cooking competition. With that, Netflix is said to be teaming up with the company to stream the series. No official comments from Netflix or A24 are available at this time. </p>



<p>As for what the show will look like, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the report</a> says it’ll be similar to Nailed It! and The Floor is Lava, two family-friendly shows Netflix has. Still, the high-octane challenges and ensuing chaos will remain, which were key to the game’s rapid success. Gemma Langford, Oli De-Vine, and Phil Duncan from Ghost Town Games and A24 are set to executive produce the show.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see how Overcooked is translated into reality TV. Fortunately, we won’t be the ones cooking and stressing out this time. Still, seeing how fun it is to watch people play it will definitely make for some fun television. As a fan of cooking shows myself, Overcooked is a great IP to bring to life in that way and I look forward to seeing how it comes out.</p>



<p>What do you think of Overcooked being a cooking competition? Did you play the game? Any good (or bad) memories with it? Could you do it in real life?
