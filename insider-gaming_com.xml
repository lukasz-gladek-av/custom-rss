<p>Everyone is so fixated with player count numbers, and ARC Raiders is the biggest extraction shooter in a long time. Embark Studios’ new title is here, so let’s check out its player count numbers and how it’s performing on Steam Charts.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> brings its own brand of extraction shooter excellence to the genre. Escape From Tarkov’s firm grasp on the concept is being challenged by the hilariously named Escape From Duckov, and now Embark’s ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>The latter was extremely popular during its multiple betas, and we’re seeing if this has translated to the full launch.</p>

<p><strong>The first 24 hours of ARC Raiders saw 264,673 players hop in simultaneously, according to Steam, and this figure is expected to grow.</strong></p>



<p>A game’s player count numbers are usually expected to go down over time; it’s a given. With new releases always on the horizon, what once was new eventually fades away. ARC Raiders is likely to retain a lot of players—which Embark is counting on as it has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 years of content</a> lined up—but the first-day numbers are always crucial.</p>



<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> reported an all-time peak of 264,673 within 24 hours. This is an exceptional figure, and again, this only accounts for ARC Raiders’ presence on Steam. We still don’t have a program or sophisticated piece of technology capable of accurately recording and reporting PlayStation and Xbox players.</p>



<p>Still, you can logically take the PC data and extrapolate it to get a good idea of how popular ARC Raiders is, and how it’s more than likely doing on other consoles or formats.</p>

<p><strong>ARC Raiders launched on a Wednesday (October 30, to be precise), and a new game’s first weekend is usually the busiest period for a game. ARC Raiders’ peak will likely skyrocket once it hits its first Saturday-Sunday period.</strong></p>



<p>We’ll be keeping an eye on ARC Raiders over the coming weeks and months. However, what we’ve been able to glean is that everyone’s desperate to see what the fuss is all about and how the final product holds up.</p>



<p>With the first 24 hours in the books, ARC Raiders was still comfortably hitting six digits for concurrent players. We’ll keep an eye on the game’s first weekend, as the 264,673 figure could very easily be broken.</p>
