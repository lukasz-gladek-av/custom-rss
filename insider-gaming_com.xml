<p>Rainbow Six Siege X showcase has kicked off and revealed a brand new 6v6 game mode, Dual Front. The new game mode can be tested today, with R6 Siege X closed beta beginning right after the stream.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-r6-siege-x-s-6v6-game-mode-dual-front">What is R6 Siege X’s 6v6 Game Mode, Dual Front?</h2>



<p>Revealed during the R6 Siege X Showcase, Dual Front is the new 6v6 game mode with an exclusive new map. Players can create teams that blend attackers and defenders as they complete dynamic objectives across the map. Moreover, R6 Siege X’s 6v6 game mode will consist of respawn, where players can return as their currently selected operator or change their operator for tactical adjustment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trailer also revealed some upgrades to the core Siege experience. Players will observe new environmental destruction, advanced rappelling, visual enhancements, an audio overhaul, and new animations like weapon inspection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>R6 Siege X’s 6v6 Dual Front mode will be a permanent game mode with “a brand new ever-evolving map” called District. District features two symmetrical fronts, each with three sectors. Each team has to capture one front while simultaneously defending their own as they progress through the sectors. The final sector will consist of a prototype that players need to destroy to win the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also a neutral sector with a timebound task that can change the tide of the battle. Each new season will bring a new assignment in Dual Front, introducing a new narrative, gameplay and neutral sector map updates.&nbsp;</p>
