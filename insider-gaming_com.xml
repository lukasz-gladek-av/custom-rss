<p>Techland has revealed what’s next on Dying Light 2’s expansive roadmap – a special, limited-time event called ‘Halloween Run’. This event will be delivered alongside update 1.19, and it broadens the Tower Raid mechanic, adds special spooky characters, and introduces new rewards and shop items, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Players dedicated to the game will be able to purchase two new bundles – Cursed Pirate and Count Skull, both of which are bursting with cosmetics that you can don to celebrate Halloween.</p>

<h2 id="h-get-spooky">Get Spooky</h2>



<p>From October 30 to November 20, Dying Light 2 players can participate in an extended Halloween event that’s open to even the newest players just starting their adventure in Villedor.</p>



<p>Each week, Techland will add new features and activities to Dying Light 2, just to keep things fresh. This content injection introduces a terrifying Tower Raid loop, new bounties themed on Halloween, and more cosmetics and new rewards than you can shake a pumpkin (?) at.</p>



<p>Players taking part in the Tower Raid can pick from four unique classes, each of which has traits specific to that character. It boosts the replayability factor of Halloween Run, which is great for players hungry to grind. </p>



<p>With Patch 1.19, the Techland team has also introduced a new control scheme that makes controlling firearms much more satisfying and intuitive. That’s along with the typical quality-of-life improvements and community-led changes that you’d expect with an update like this.</p>



<p>In the patch notes, Techland confirmed that some of the most niggling issues in Dying Light 2 have been addressed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Co-op spawning in Tower Raid</li>



<li>Broken quests and soft lock issues</li>



<li>Improved physics for certain heavy skills</li>



<li>Tweaked filter presets</li>



<li>Replaced missing dialogue and subtitles in some quests</li>
</ul>



<p>Are you looking forward to sinking your teeth into Dying Light 2’s Halloween Run update? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to use a weapon in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> that is easy to control and has enough bullets to go on a killing spree, then you must choose the XMG. It’s an LMG and here are the best attachments, Perks, and Equipment you can use along with it to make a solid loadout.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-xmg-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-xmg">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>

<li><a href="#h-is-the-xmg-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the XMG any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-xmg-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-xmg-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best XMG loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic</strong>: Kepler Microflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Ranger Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Fast Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Infiltrator Stock</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li>
</ul>



<p>Unlike other weapons where five attachments are more than enough, I recommend using eight attachments for the XMG – thanks to the Gunfighter Perk. </p>



<p>Start with the <strong>Kepler Microflex</strong> as it’s clean enough to land your headshots accurately. The <strong>Suppressor</strong> suppresses the gun sound and also hides you from the mini-map.</p>



<p>The <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> will greatly increase the damage range and bullet velocity of the XMG thereby improving the weapon’s firepower. The <strong>Ranger Foregrip</strong> will slightly increase Sprinting Movement Speed and Horizontal Recoil Control.</p>



<p>Yes, the <strong>Fast Mag II</strong> will significantly reduce the ammo capacity of the magazine but in return, you are getting quicker reloads, better ADS, and Sprint to Fire Speeds. The <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> comes in handy with a further improved Aim Down Sight speed.</p>



<p>Combine that with the <strong>Infiltrator Stock</strong> and your Aim Walking Movement Speed will also increase significantly while using the XMG. Lastly, <strong>Recoil Springs</strong> will be the cherry on top as it slightly improves both horizontal and vertical recoil of the LMG. </p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-xmg">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for XMG</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>Combining <strong>Gung-Ho, Assassin, and Double Time</strong> will activate the <strong>Enforcer</strong> Specialty as it grants a temporary buff to movement speed and health regeneration rate – a combination that goes well with the XMG</p>



<p>For the Wildcard, use <strong>Gunfighter</strong> as it will enable you to use eight attachments on your XMG. The sacrifice you’re making here is letting go of the fourth Perk slot (Perk Greed helps you achieve that) but it’s worth it.</p>



<p><strong>Semtex</strong> and <strong>Stim Shot</strong> should be your go-to Equipment choices here for quick damage and health recovery. Lastly, keep the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> and place them wisely for cheeky free kills.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-xmg">Best Secondary for XMG</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon options for the XMG are Stryder .22 and GS45.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-xmg-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock XMG in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the XMG by reaching <strong>player level 13</strong> in Black Ops 6. This should be fairly easy as it won’t take a lot of time to unlock the weapon and you can start leveling it up early in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-xmg-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the XMG any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Despite the XMG being a heavy weapon, you get a very fast TTK from it. On top of that, controlling the weapon is easy due to its low recoil, allowing you to easily spray down enemies at long ranges.</p>



<p>The only downsides of this weapon are its slow mobility and ADS speeds but the attachments I’ve recommended above should get that sorted.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-xmg-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the XMG in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If the XMG is too much for you, then the best alternatives are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS VAL</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a>. These two weapons are two of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-assault-rifles-in-black-ops-6-ranked-best-ar-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Assault Rifles in BO6</a> as they are ruling the meta right now, offering fast TTK similar to the LMG.</p>

<p>The DM-10 is a Marksman Rifle in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> capable of killing enemies in just two shots. However, you must use the best set of attachments, Perks, and Equipment to make the most out of the weapon in multiplayer.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-dm-10-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-dm-10-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best DM-10 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic</strong>: Kepler Microflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Ported Compensator</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Weighted Handguard</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Kepler Microflex</strong> is a good optic choice for the DM-10 as the maps in Black Ops 6 are on the smaller side, and having a bigger scope would only leave you tunnel-visioned when the action is intense and fast-paced. This clean optic provides enough field of view to take down enemies easily.</p>



<p>Coming to the <strong>Ported Compensator</strong>, this muzzle will improve the accuracy of the Marksman Rifle by significantly enhancing the vertical and horizontal recoil. The <strong>Long Barrel</strong> will improve the damage range while the <strong>Weighted Handguard</strong> further lowers horizontal recoil.</p>



<p>Get hold of the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> Fire Mods as it will increase the fire rate of the DM-10. This will come in handy to shoot down enemies faster, especially when they appear in numbers.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-dm-10">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for DM-10</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Cold-Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Bankroll</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Tactical Insertion</li>
</ul>



<p>The combination of <strong>Ghost, Forward Intel, and Cold-Blooded</strong> will activate the <strong>Recon</strong> Specialty – which is crucial as a Marksman Rifler. You can briefly see opponents’ positions through walls during the start of a round and that split-second is enough to plan for lethal attacks.</p>



<p>Once you unlock Perk Greed, keep <strong>Bankroll</strong> in the fourth Perk slot to gain a +150 score toward <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-scorestreaks-black-ops-6-and-how-to-unlock-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scorestreaks</a>. This will come in handy to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-weapons-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">level your weapons quicker</a> as Scorestreaks will recharge faster.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-dm-10">Best Secondary for DM-10</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon options for the DM-10 are Stryder .22 and GS45.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-dm-10-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock DM-10 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You need to reach <strong>player Level 43</strong> to unlock the DM-10 in Black Ops 6. This is the last Markman Rifle you can unlock at launch and will require you to play several matches to get this gun. In case you were wondering, here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how you can level up fast in BO6</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-dm-10-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the DM-10 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, the DM-10 is one of the best Marksman Rifles in the game at the moment. It comes with a very fast TTK and offers great mobility at the same time. Although its ADS speed is a little slower and a semi-auto weapon, you can kill enemies in just two headshots.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-dm-10-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the DM-10 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If you don’t like handling semi-auto weapons, then the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a> would be the best DM-10 alternatives in BO6. They are fully automatic rifles and are two of the most hard-hitting ones you can use.</p>
