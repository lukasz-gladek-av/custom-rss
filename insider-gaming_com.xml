<p>Minecraft’s ‘A Minecraft Movie’ live event has arrived, and players can hang out with cast members like Steve, Garrett, Henry, Natalie and Dawn in the game today.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-a-minecraft-movie-live-event-start-and-end">When Does A Minecraft Movie Live Event Start and End?</h2>



<p>A Minecraft Movie live event was released on March 25 at 2:30 PM PT and will last until April 7 at 2 PM PT. Players can find the live event through the main menu of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. If it is not visible, you need to update to the latest version of the game. When you load up the limited-time event, will Steve be waiting to take you on your new adventure?&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-live-event-mini-games">A Minecraft Movie Live Event Mini-Games</h2>



<p>A Minecraft Movie live event features three mini-games where players interact with a different cast member for each new activity. Like the movie, players will fight against the Piglins and defend the Midport Village.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-mining-with-henry">Mining With Henry</h3>



<p>Henry will require the players’ help with some good old mining for resources to build defences and weapons. Players will meet Henry at the Mineshaft and must dig for resources while defending themselves from the pesky Pilgins.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-protecting-the-payloads-with-natalie-and-dawn">Protecting the Payloads with Natalie and Dawn</h3>



<p>In this Minecraft Movie live event, mini-game players will help Natalie and Dawn protect their resources from waves of Pilgins while escorting transport carriages.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-defending-the-walls-with-garrett-nbsp">Defending the Walls with Garrett&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Three huge Nether portals have opened at the outskirts of the village, and hordes of Pilgins are rushing in to wreak destruction. Garrett and the players must take these Pilgins head-on while showcasing their archery skills. However, you are not the only one shooting projectiles.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-s-midport-village">A Minecraft Movie’s Midport Village</h2>



<p>The event also includes a new settlement, the Midport Village, which features shops, unique structures, adorable mobs, and hidden items. Thus, players have much more to do than fight in this Minecraft movie live event.&nbsp;Some of these items will be helpful when faced against the Pilgins. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-minecraft-yearn-cape">Minecraft Yearn Cape</h3>



<p>During the battle for Midport Village, players will receive six challenges, and after completing them, they will be rewarded with the Yearn cape. The Yearn cape features the “stunning art of a mineshaft inspired by Steve’s longing for the mines.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-minecraft-home-and-menace-capes">Minecraft Home and Menace Capes</h3>



<p>On the other hand, the Home and Menace Capes can be claimed by “watching a Minecraft creator for at least 3 minutes on Twitch and TikTok, respectively.” Players will receive a 5×5 redemption code for two capes, one inspired by Steve’s love for the mines and the other by Nether portal’s aura of danger.</p>



<p>All three capes will also be available in Bedrock and Java Edition, provided players use the same account on both editions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The First Berserker Khazan is a Soulslike, which means it’s difficult. Powerful mobs, even more deadly bosses, respawning enemies, and limited health. The genre isn’t for everyone, and despite the incredible aesthetic of Khazan, people want to know how difficult Neople’s Souslike is.</p>



<p>It took a long time for the Souls genre to win me over. I owned Demon’s Souls on day one, and hated it—now I love it. The unrelenting difficulty and intensity of boss fights aren’t for everyone. But darn it if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> isn’t worth it for its aesthetic alone!</p>



<p>If you need comfort more than classy visuals, here’s everything you need to know about The First Berserker Khazan’s difficulty.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-difficulty-settings-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">Are There Difficulty Settings in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A welcome inclusion. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, The First Berserker Khazan has difficulty settings, allowing players to choose between Easy mode and Normal.</strong></p>



<p>After my first death to <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan</a>‘s first major boss fight, I was presented with the screenshot above (I’m not sure if it’s the same for everyone). You can see two different settings laid out with easy-to-read descriptions, which you can check out here:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Easy: </strong>“This difficulty is intended for players who are unfamiliar with action games.”</li>



<li><strong>Normal:</strong> “This difficulty is intended for players who are familiar with action games and enjoy the challenge and sense of achievement that the genre is known for.”</li>
</ul>



<p>For the longest time, Soulslikes have avoided optional difficulty settings like the plague. I don’t know if it’s a pride thing or if it’s the notion of toughness that comes with the territory of playing a Souls title. But companies are starting to ease up on the “it’s this or nothing” approach.</p>



<p>2024’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-record-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade</a> is a recent example of a Soulslike having distinct difficulty settings. Thankfully, The First Berserker Khazan has followed suit with its <strong>Easy </strong>and <strong>Normal </strong>options.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-difficulty-should-you-play-on-in-the-first-beserker-khazan">Which Difficulty Should You Play on in The First Beserker Khazan?</h2>



<p><strong>Your The First Berserker Khazan difficulty decision rests on whether you want to enjoy the story or relish the challenge of combat.</strong></p>



<p>The First Berserker’s premise is fascinating, so it makes sense if you’re in it for Khazan’s journey. If constantly dying frustrates you and you want to progress the narrative, <strong>I recommend picking Easy</strong>.</p>



<p>However, if you enjoy combat, are happy to keep dying to bosses and learn their movesets in the hope of overcoming the imperious foe, <strong>stick with Normal</strong>. I play on Normal, I enjoy seeing the game over screen constantly, but I also live for the feeling of satisfaction when I finally beat a boss on my 153rd attempt.</p>

It could easily go down as the best Souslike of the year, but what do you think? Are better titles set to arrive in 2025? Let us know.</p>

<p>CD Projekt Red’s recent statements indicate that The Witcher 4 could target next-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as its release window has been pushed past 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-sometime-in-2027-at-the-soonest-cd-projekt-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>, CD Projekt Red discussed The Witcher 4’s release window during their latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DY-Q-Wd3Hz4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a>. During their presentation, the developers explicitly stated that the game would not arrive in 2026 twice, leading players to believe that the developers are targeting a 2027 release window and possibly next-gen consoles, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the segment about CD Projekt Group’s incentive program B, it was stated, “Even though we do not plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026, we are still driven by this financial goal.” Then, during the Q&amp;A section, CD Projekt Red’s chief financial officer, Piotr Nielubowicz, stated, “We are not going to announce the precise launch date for the game yet.”</p>



<p>Nielubowicz added that right now, all they can share for “more visibility to investors” is that The Witcher 4 will not be released “within the time frame of the first target for the incentive program, which ends December 31, 2026.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, CD Projekt Red has four different The Witcher projects in the works. The Witcher 4 is in the production stage, Project Sirius is in pre-production, and The Witcher Remake is in the concept phase. Cyberpunk’s Project Orion is also in the concept phase, and their new IP, Project Hadar, is in the IP concept phase.&nbsp;</p>
