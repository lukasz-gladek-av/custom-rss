<p>It seems like Silent Hill f might be coming to Switch and Switch 2, as well as previous-gen consoles, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. </p>



<p>Silent Hill f was off to a spectacular start, with Konami announcing that the game’s cumulative worldwide shipment volume has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-has-already-sold-over-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceeded 1 million units</a>. It seems like they want to get this number even higher by bringing the game to new as well as previous-gen platforms. </p>



<h2 id="h-silent-hill-f-might-be-coming-to-switch-switch-2-xbox-one-and-playstation-4">Silent Hill f Might Be Coming to Switch, Switch 2, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 </h2>



<p>If you head over to Konami’s <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/us/en/products/silenthill_f/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> right now, click on their Games tab, and then select Silent Hill f. You will see the Switch and previous-gen port mentioned on that page. These details are mentioned twice, once in the ‘Platform’ section, which lists ‘Switch, Xbox One, Steam, PS4’. The second time in the ‘Games’ section, which lists PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Android, and for some reason, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG’ as well. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those unaware of the title, Silent Hill f is a new instalment to the series, which blends psychological horror with a haunting Japanese setting. It is set in the 1960s, in the fictional small mountain town of Ebisugaoka; the characters and story were also created specifically for the game. Players have to embody the role of Shimizu Hinako as they explore this town, solve complex puzzles, and confront the distorted monsters. </p>



<p>The title features a “grotesque yet aesthetic world” with immersive 3D audio that enhances the tension and uneasiness. The title also features multiple endings where your choices shape your outcome. There are five endings that you can explore in total, and the store was written by the renowned author Ryukishi07 and features music by Akira Yamaoka. </p>



<p>In other news, a Microsoft Store leak has revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox release date</a> for Silent Hill 2.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-is-still-a-long-way-off/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-is-still-%E2%80%9Ca-long-way-off%E2%80%9D.1348897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you were hoping for a release of The Elder Scrolls 6 anytime soon, you may want to sit down for this one. According to Bethesda’s Todd Howard, the latest game in the franchise is still “a long way off”.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GQ</a> to talk about Fallout 4’s 10th anniversary and other Bethesda happenings, Howard admitted that the game isn’t close to being ready for players.</p>



<p><strong>“I’m preaching patience,”</strong> he said. <strong>“I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”</strong></p>



<p>Howard said after raising money for Make-A-Wish that would see a character made in The Elder Scrolls 6, they had a three-hour play test of the game. He wanted to make clear though, that it wasn’t to signal that anything was close and that, if he has it his way, the announcement strategy would be a bit different.</p>



<p><strong>“I like to just announce stuff and release it,”</strong> Howard said. <strong>“My perfect version –&nbsp;and I’m not saying this is going to happen – is that it’s going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear.”</strong></p>



<p>When asked if he wanted it to be like The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remaster where it was shadow dropped in April, Howard didn’t rule it out.</p>



<p><strong>“You might say that was a test run,”</strong> he said. <strong>“It worked out well.”</strong></p>



<p>When do you think fans will get to play The Elder Scrolls 6, and do you think they would do a shadow drop release for such a highly anticipated game?

<p>Use these Roblox Strongman Ultra monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Energy and Energy Gain Potions. </p>



<p>Strongman Ultra is a gym-based simulation experience on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-invincible-showdown-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>. To build a more muscular and toned avatar, you’ll need to lift weights, boost your cardiovascular fitness, and perform various exercises. Energy is the core resource that powers the gameplay. It determines how much your avatar can lift and how long they can keep training. Instead of grinding for hours to unlock new gym areas, you can easily redeem active codes to claim free Energy and Energy Potions. Use these rewards, hit the gym, and turn your gym rat into a full-fledged gym monster. &nbsp;<br></p>

<p>They say all roads lead to Rome, and that is certainly the case as anticipation for the release date of Anno 117: Pax Romana rapidly approaches, and we’ve got all the important timings you need to dive in.</p>



<p>The first entry in the long-running series in six years, Anno 117: Pax Romana is deploying as the latest city-building simulator, thrusting you in control of a crucial point of history, and excitement for the title continues to rise.</p>



<p>Release dates and start times vary, so it’s worth noting exactly when Anno 117: Pax Romana is available in your region.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-anno-117-pax-romana-coming-out">When is Anno 117: Pax Romana Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All roads lead to Rome. Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Anno 117: Pax Romana is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on November 13, and will also be available as part of a Ubisoft+ subscription.</strong></p>



<p>The eighth instalment in the Anno series, and the first since Anno 1800 in 2019, Anno 117: Pax Romana continues the trend started by its predecessor of releasing on consoles—with the last release being the first time that has occurred in the main series.</p>



<p>Excitement for the title rose during the Steam Next Fest, when a demo of the game was available to play, and there isn’t too much longer to wait until the full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-anno-117-pax-romana-start-time">Do We Know The Anno 117: Pax Romana Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Anno 117: Pax Romana’s start times have been confirmed by Ubisoft, though the exact timing depends on your location in the world and your platform.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S have a staggered global release, becoming available to play from 12 AM local time, while PC has a global release at 3 PM PT on November 12—which means, for some players, the actual release date will be a day earlier than advertised.</p>
