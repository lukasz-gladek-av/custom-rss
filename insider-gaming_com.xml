<p>Despite rumours, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will release on its previously revealed release date, November 14, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who don‚Äôt know, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-launch-a-week-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a claim</a> from yesterday stated that there was evidence of a potential release date change for Black Ops 7, with the game arriving a week earlier. However, Treyarch has debunked this claim, revealing that the release date for the upcoming title remains on track. </p>

<p>The latest post from Treyarch on <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1980670037985042637" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) discusses the release date for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. The developers have stated, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre less than a month away from #BlackOps7‚Äôs launch on November 14,‚Äù which clears up any doubts about a potential announcement of a release date change. The post also talks about their newest dev talk dropping today, October 21, along with more juicy multiplayer updates from the beta. </p>

<p>Talking about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Beta, it was revealed that RICOCHET Anti-Cheat achieved the strongest Beta results in Call of Duty history. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-matches-beta-cheaters-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">99% of the matches were cheater-free</a>, and cheaters were detected within three matches. This is excellent news for fans of the series, as Call of Duty has been one of the franchise‚Äôs biggest victims of in-game cheating. Hopefully, the case remains the same during launch. </p>
