<p>2025 wasn’t incredible for new shooters, in all honesty. There’s still a lot of reliance on existing live-service shooters, but the year did manage to throw up some amazing new highlights. Insider Gaming has identified one shooter that stood above the rest in 2025.</p>



<p>Between first-person shooters and third-person shooters, there’s a lot to feast on. 2025 might have been dominated by action-adventure games and indie darlings, but the gaming community is still being treated to AAA shooters capable of delivering immense action and gunplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a>‘s 2025 shooter of the year might cause some debate, but there’s plenty of cause to agree.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-shooter-game-of-2025-winner-battlefield-6">Best Shooter Game Of 2025 Winner—Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Boom, headshot! Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 was considered the point of no return for EA and the iconic shooter. Battlefield 2042 did almost irreparable damage to the Battlefield name, and if BF 6 didn’t completely deliver, it was probably over. Thankfully, Battlefield 6 is a gargantuan first-person shooter that reminds us all why players crave an alternative to standard point-and-aim shooters.</p>



<p>Yes, the campaign is underwhelming and fairly forgettable, if not worth a brief jaunt to warm you up for the online multiplayer. Everyone knows this is where Battlefield thrives. Some maps could be a tiny bit bigger, but this will come with time. It does mean you get the most intense and exhilarating action around you: Whether it’s the majesty and splendor or vehicles crashing bullets and shells on metal, a jet soaring overhead straight out of bounds because no one knows how to fly them, or the earth-shaking destruction of a crumbling building.</p>



<p>There’s a reason why Best Audio Design at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> went to Battlefield 6. There’s absolutely no title in history that captures the second-by-second thrill of war. It was tough to see if we’d ever get another strong BF game again, and with the addition of RedSec’s Battle Royale and free content, EA has delivered the full package.</p>

<h3 id="h-arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</h3>



<figure><figcaption>ARCs are scary. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>This was a close one, in all honesty. ARC Raiders has been the viral shooter sensation of 2025. Initial reactions to playtests were very positive, almost too positive. Embark Studios shrugged off suggestions that the initial hype couldn’t continue, and the October 30 launch was an instant hit.</p>



<p>Two months after launch and ARC Raiders was still hitting well above six figures in player count. The extraction shooter gained a reputation as a friendly addition to the merciless genre—Escape From Tarkov and Gray Zone Warfare are no free lunch—and might be the most accessible extraction shooter around.</p>



<p>After all, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-invented-a-whole-new-genre-and-nobody-noticed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders did create a new genre</a>.</p>







<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</h3>



<figure><figcaption>No one messes with Doomguy. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>DOOM is in a weird spot at the moment. The 2016 reboot was phenomenal, and it’s a matter of taste if you prefer DOOM: Eternal’s parkour-centric elements. One thing most agree on is that DOOM: The Dark Ages is a slight step back from the pair—but it’s still a brutal and bombastic affair. The Dark Ages’ prequel aesthetic and decision to lean more heavily into the story and cutscenes are hit and miss. DOOM isn’t one of the most celebrated shooter franchises ever because of its narrative storytelling, let’s face it.</p>



<p>But the core gameplay remains punchy and powerful. The parry mechanic and Saw Shield add nice variation; on the other hand, the dragon sequences are gimmicky and unnecessary, and in trying to change too much, some of DOOM 2016’s implicity has been lost. Still,  you’re assured a breathless ride, and fingers crossed the next DOOM reins in the creativity a smidge.</p>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You’d be psycho not to play it. Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whereas Borderlands 4 throws a lot of new ideas at the wall, and mostly scores. The open-world design works, and you can find unopened cans of chaos around every corner. The template remains unchanged: Four Vault Hunters to choose from with different abilities, saving the world, finding vaults, and collecting enough guns to use on the fire for Winter!</p>



<p>It would be interesting to see how Borderlands 4 fared at launch had Gearbox released the game in a fully working state. The performance issues destroyed the game’s chances of ubiquitous fanfare from all corners. Borderlands 4 shows that Gearbox has more ideas up its sleeves—the Grapple Hook and jetpacks are fun—and even more is needed if the next game is to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break 100 million units</a>.</p>



<p>Did any shooter that’s not Battlefield 6 get your vote for best shooter of 2025? Is it something that didn’t even make it onto our list, like a certain Black Ops 7? Be sure to let IG know through the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass members have been eating well in 2025, with a bunch of games across every genre offered each month, including Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and more added to the library this year. Where Xbox has PlayStation beat is by offering its own games Day One on Game Pass, so subscribers don’t end up paying extra for brand-new AAA titles.</p>



<p>There are several tiers of Xbox Game Pass, including Essential, Premium, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-13-games-in-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultimate</a>, and PC Game Pass. In the Essential tier, players get over 50 games in the library, no Day One titles, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/claim-fortnite-crew-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Crew</a>, EA Play, and Ubisoft+ Classics. Premium players get access to over 200 games, no Day One launches, but Xbox-published games will be added to the library within 12 months from launch. The rest of it is similar to the Essential tier.</p>



<p>Game Pass Ultimate gives players access to over 500 games, Day One titles, Fortnite Crew, EA Play, and Ubisoft+ Classics, as well as the highest tier of cloud gaming. PC Game Pass provides over 300 games, access to Day One titles, Fortnite Crew, EA Play, and more than 50 Ubisoft+ Classics. All subscription tiers, except PC Game Pass, provide access to all supported platforms, online console multiplayer, and cloud gaming.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Escape from Tarkov Issue Causing Accounts To Be Wiped]]></title>

            <guid>1392772</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><strong>Update</strong> – It appears that this issue affected a select few players, with the malicious operator in question posting an explanation on social media of what happened. They said the account wipes were carried out due to a vulnerability exposed by Steam account linking. This seems to have since been patched, while Battlestate Games still hasn’t provided an official statement.</p>



<p>In recent hours, some of the most prominent personalities in the Escape from Tarkov community have taken to social media to express concerns about a new phenomenon. What has been labelled a ‘vulnerability’ by some is causing Escape from Tarkov accounts to be <strong>wiped </strong>and altered by what is assumed to be rogue operators.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has stressed it’s aware of the issue and is working on it, but no official statement has been posted.</p>







<h2 id="h-has-your-tarkov-account-been-wiped">Has Your Tarkov Account Been Wiped?</h2>



<p>Hours ago, posts started surfacing on social media from users impacted by this Tarkov account wiping issue. In some cases, big-name streamers were recorded suffering from the problem <strong>live on air</strong>. Dr Lupo was one of the content creators struck by the anomaly.</p>



<p>In a comment under one of the investigative posts, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>already took measures. investigating</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s what the players are figuring out about the issue from what they’ve learned:</p>



<ul>
<li>There’s a vulnerability ‘somewhere’ that malicious operators are leaning on to access and reset accounts of other players, most notably prolific players.</li>



<li>Whoever is doing this is able to bypass two-factor authentication, as accounts that have the security layers in place are reporting this problem occurring.</li>



<li>It was thought this issue was related to Escape from Tarkov: Arena, but that most likely isn’t the case.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p><em>We’ve reached out to Battlestate Games for confirmation on what’s happening.</em></p>



<p>In August 2024, a technical malfunction caused player profiles <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-malfunction-profile-wipe/">to suffer from unwanted wipes</a>. It was reported that ‘tens of thousands’ of profiles were impacted by this back-end issue, which led to an irrevocable data wipe.</p>



<p>Popular creator Onepeg explained <a href="https://x.com/Onepeg/status/2004685750894559692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on social media</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My tarkov account got reset. Gg boys.</p>



<p>I did not use the wiki at all for at least the last few days. I haven’t clicked on any weird links. This has to be some other vulnerability.</p>



<p>pfp got changed to a QR code that forwards to a 7 second long youtube video calling me a bitch lmao at least these guys have a sense of humor.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One user took to socials to stress how impactful the issue had been, with their account being stripped of all progress at a pivotal progression point:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I got RESET TO 0 IN TARKOV?<br>Somehow, an hour ago someone logged into my account and reset it to 0, they also changed my profile Pic, my accounts have double log verification, etc. Never had this happen before, with any account whatsoever. I was lvl 53 ready to prestige 5 with all… <a href="https://t.co/dAtts06Ulc">pic.twitter.com/dAtts06Ulc</a></p>— BAXBEAST (@BAXBEAST) <a href="https://twitter.com/BAXBEAST/status/2004607588302717205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>This issue has struck amidst a lengthy Twitch Drops campaign that’s stuffing players’ accounts full of loot, which adds extra fuel to the fire and insult to injury.</p>
