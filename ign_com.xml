"As of June, the vast majority of sales — which is around 70% — came from physical copies sold and that reflects the strength of our offering."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/screenshot-2025-08-29-at-15-59-39-1756479591759.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Switch 2 owners preferred the physical version of Cyberpunk 2077.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Novakovski believes this is, in part, because "the entire game, along with its expansion, is fully contained on a 64 gigabyte cartridge, providing a plug and play experience which players find particularly attractive." And that has certainly proven to be the case, with 75.4% of all Cyberpunk 2077's Switch 2 sales being physical.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It comes as fans continue to debate the practice of publishers providing Game-Key Cards in Switch 2 boxed games instead of a physical cartridge. It's proven to be a divisive practice among some users, not least because while it allows collectors to have a game's box on their shelf, they're essentially useless unless your console is connected to the internet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The practice is so controversial, however, that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-survey-asks-your-openness-to-digital-games-and-offers-a-chance-to-give-feedback-on-switch-2-game-key-cards"><u>Nintendo has launched a survey</u></a> designed to poll the Switch 2 userbase on its thoughts surrounding digital and physical games, with questions designed to probe the reasons you might consider one option over another. Nintendo's also interested in finding out if your attitude to digital downloads has shifted over time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our developers truly made the most of the console’s features, offering new exclusive ways to play Cyberpunk 2077," Novakovski added. "We showcased them in a series of hands on presentations attracting praise from the player community and gaming media. And although we clearly see that sales of the on the new console are currently dominated by Nintendo’s first party titles, we were very pleased with Cyberpunk being among the best selling third party games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Switch 2 might pack much better hardware than the original, but a game I’m still surprised to see running at all (much less pretty well) on a Nintendo system is Cyberpunk 2077," we wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-review-update"><u>Nintendo Switch 2 Cyberpunk 2007 review update</u></a>. "I spent a few days with CD Projekt Red’s latest port to get a feel for how it runs, how it holds up, and how the Switch 2’s fancy new mouse controls work when applied to a high-octane FPS. The answer across the board is impressive, and if you haven’t had the pleasure of exploring Night City before, this seems like a solid way to do so."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cyberpunk-2-enters-pre-production-and-yes-cd-projekt-is-officially-calling-it-cyberpunk-2-now"><u>Cyberpunk 2077 sequel Cyberpunk 2 has officially entered pre-production</u></a>. The studio made the announcement as part of its latest financial results last month, where it said the Phantom Liberty expansion for Cyberpunk 2077 had hit an impressive 10 million copies sold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Nintendo's handheld itself? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-in-us-history"><u>The Nintendo Switch 2 debuted in June to become the fastest-selling hardware ever in the U.S.</u></a>, shooting spending on games to new records. Spending on hardware was up a whopping 249% year-over-year thanks to the console's debut, reaching $978 million and greatly surpassing the previous monthly record from June 2008 of $608 million.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Some of my favorite games of all time.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Labor Day weekend is a great time to get together with the family, sure, but it's also a nice little three-day window to get some serious gaming in. Assuming you don't already have a massive backlog of PC games to play, now is actually a pretty good time of year to find some video game deals. If you're looking to pick up a new game before the weekend arrives, you've got options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're in between major Steam sales at the moment, but another big PC games sale going on right now is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Dlm?object_uuid=57482acb-3f94-473a-b83a-8fac5977e551&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Humble Bundle Summer Sale</a>. There are a ton of discounted games here at prices that will last through the weekend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something great under $10, I've got some recommendations for you. Each of these games I've listed are wonderful for different reasons, but every single one of them are worth playing for hours at a time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PC Games Under $10</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">My first pick might not be for everyone, but it's one of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-of-my-favorite-pc-games-of-all-time-is-super-cheap-during-the-humble-bundle-summer-sale">my favorite gaming experiences</a> of all time. It's hard to really go too into detail without ruining some of it, but it's essentially a roguelike deck-building card game with a twist of psychological horror. If any of that sounds interesting to you, it's best to just start playing without learning more. Going in cold is the best way to play this game.</p><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227072"><div id="227072" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Inscryption</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next on this list is what has become one of the best indie games of all time. I was genuinely surprised how much I liked Hollow Knight. I don't usually like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/genre/metroidvania">metroidvania games</a>, but it has a sort of sad, dark charm that really drew me in. The gameplay is fun and the battles can get difficult, but the atmosphere of this game keeps you engaged at every turn. With the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">Hollow Knight sequel releasing next week</a>, now is a great time to jump into the original.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227443"><div id="227443" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hollow Knight</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't really feel the need to say much about The Witcher 3, because of course it's worth playing. CD Projekt Red's masterpiece is one of those rare games that I've ended up playing through multiple times. While it's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-books-reading-order">Witcher books</a> that ultimately birthed this franchise, it's really this game that made it a household name. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a> somewhere on the horizon, its as good a time as any to start your Witcher 3 journey for the first time.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227445"><div id="227445" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a PC gamer who also happens to be a Nintendo gamer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bug-fables-the-everlasting-sapling">Bug Fables</a> is one of those games that hits a very specific sweet spot. It's a turn-based RPG that has an eerily similar look and feel as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/paper-mario">original Paper Mario game</a>. It's a storybook adventure with puzzles and battles that has a fun overarching story. If you love games like Paper Mario and Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, you'll love Bug Fables.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227446"><div id="227446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My last recommendation is the cheapest and shortest game on this list. Gris is a beautiful platformer game with some fun puzzles and stunning artwork. This game tells a story of grief and loss, and these feelings unfold through an incredible use of color, music, and gameplay. You can <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/62257" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">play through the whole thing in a few hours</a>, and it's definitely worth paying $2.99 for what you'll get from it. This is one of those games that hit me surprisingly hard.</p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227447"><div id="227447" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gris</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">See all PC games on sale for under $10</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The games I've listed here are just some of my favorites, but there's actually a lot more in the sale that are worth a look. Humble Bundle has a specific page for all of the deals under $10 right now and it includes things like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-games-in-order">Batman: Arkham collection</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-games-in-order">Yakuza games</a>. </p></div><div catalogid="374d8a96-90ae-40eb-aed9-9d99fe47b2e6" id="227073"><div id="227073" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Humble Bundle Summer Sale</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Get an additional 20% off with a Humble Choice subscription.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to grab some console games at a discount, there are also a few <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/labor-day-sales-2025">other Labor Day sales</a> worth checking out.
