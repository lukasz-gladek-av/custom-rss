Challenging combat, awe-inspiring visuals, and an expansive open world ripe for players to explore cemented Elden Ring as Game of the Year at the 2023 Game Developers Choice Awards, where it also won Best Visual Art and Best Design. It even scored a lofty <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring/reviews">10 from IGN's review team</a>.

Considering how new this DLC is, it's no surprise it's not as heavily discounted as the base game, but it's still a $28 discount from its standard retail value of $79.99.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9 More PS5 Games Under $20</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">More PS5 Black Friday Deals to Explore</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty of other Black Friday deals still going strong on popular games, though they're certainly not as reduced in price as what we've gathered for you here. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDkkN?object_uuid=1863d934-3c0b-44e6-bef6-b2453fa9fbbd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D2FY9H73" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, which is primed to take the title of Game of the Year, can be picked up right now for $20 off its retail value — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-black-friday-deal-2024">its lowest sale price yet</a>.

Plus, you get a great game to test drive your console with.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will There Be More PS5 Game Deals for Cyber Monday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Cyber Monday officially starts on Monday, Dec. 2, many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-sales-to-mark-on-your-calendar">retailers have started posting these deals as early as November 30</a> to piggyback on the hype train of Black Friday. Make sure to read up on the sales schedules of your favorite retailers to take advantage of their deals while they last. But be warned: Some of these games are likely to sell out well before the sales even end. Don't take the risk and grab them while you can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Katie Reul is a freelance journalist whose entertainment reporting has been featured in IGN and Variety.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 30, 2024 10:00 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While it’s easy to focus on the new bestiaries, rods, fish, and mutations added to the overall experience, fans should note that the update comes bundled in with the gargantuan Megalodon Hunt. It’s an event that adds giant prehistoric creatures to fish for, making this an especially enticing addition to one of Roblox’s most popular games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/30/fisch-ancient-isles-the-megalodon-hunt-1732988478803.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fisch The Ancient Isles update gives Roblox fishing game its biggest content drop yet.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Ancient Isles have just been discovered—lush jungles, glowing ruins, mystery filled caves, and ancient fish whisper of secrets long forgotten,” a description from Fisching says. “What mysteries could these legendary lands unveil?

There’s a lot to explore in the Ancient Isles, and thanks to an increased level cap of 750, you don’t have to worry about maxing out your level too early.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to what Fisching calls “a ton” of quality-of-life and bug fixes, Fisch fans can now find a rotating fan art board in Moosewood that will feature more player creations as future updates roll out. There are also a few new titles, new ziplines to use around the map, and optimization settings to take advantage of.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fisch has lured in thousands of Roblox fans since it released earlier this year, but today’s update has helped it reach new heights.

Roblox gift cards can be converted into the Robux needed to make those purchases, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Cyber Monday</a> is one of the best times to find those gift cards on sale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are slight discounts on digital gift cards, the best savings you can possibly get is by going physical: Right now, you can get <a href="https://zdcs.link/92bnVY?object_uuid=39532ff3-ef49-4e73-ba5e-8b9fe2472693&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a full $20 off $100 Roblox gift cards</a>.

Though, I have to admit, getting $100 worth of Robux at a $20 discount is something you could even gift to yourself. A $100 gift card is equivalent to about 10,000 Robux. By saving $20, you're basically getting a whopping 2,000 Robux for free. Act fast, however, because I'm sure this Lightning Deal will sell out quick. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on what month you redeem your Roblox gift card, you’ll also get a different free virtual item. In November, that gift is the Midnight Crimson Sombrero, but if you wait until December (heads up: That's tomorrow), you’ll get the Festive Deadpan Alpaca Head.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Does Roblox Have Its Own Cyber Monday Sale? </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox as a platform doesn’t have an "official" Cyber Monday sale, but you might find deals, discounts, and special events within specific experiences.
