            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-booster-bundle-in-stock-for-just-39<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Or consider these single cards thanks to the recent TCG market crash.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has restocked the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKOLR3?object_uuid=b9cc7bee-1d27-44d0-9704-f24c20c00e6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Pokémon TCG: Journey Together Booster Bundle</strong></a>, and even though it’s up a dollar from its recent drop, it’s still the best value for this set on the market by far. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At $38.95, you get six booster packs from Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together, which, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">based on my pulls</a>, is easily one of the most exciting expansions we've had in a while. </p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218701"><div id="218701" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, you’re not getting sleeves or a coin-flip die, but you also aren’t spending over $80 on a box that was under $40 just last week. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXBgv?object_uuid=b9cc7bee-1d27-44d0-9704-f24c20c00e6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elite Trainer Box is currently out of stock at Amazon</a>, which isn’t surprising considering the price hit a new high of $99.49 before it vanished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't third-party gouging either. That listing was sold and shipped by Amazon, which makes it even more frustrating. Normally, Amazon adds its listing alongside the third-party offers, but this time, the Booster Bundle is quietly tucked away under a separate product page. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You have to dig to find the ETBs sold by Amazon ($81.79), but in my opinion, if you're buying Journey Together packs right now, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKOLR3?object_uuid=b9cc7bee-1d27-44d0-9704-f24c20c00e6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">booster bundle</a> is the right move. Better yet, grab two and get more booster packs than the ETB offers for less than it was priced at just days ago.</p></div><p id="cheap-journey-together-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cheap Journey Together Cards">Journey Together Single Card Price Crash</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Journey Together single card prices are settling down from their pre-restock panic, making this set very affordable to collect. Don't fancy spending money on packs for your chase cards? I've gathered them all right here so trainers can cherry pick what they need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I opened 49 packs across all our preview products for my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">IGN Journey Together preview</a>, and pulled 18 rare cards. Compared to sets like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions</a>, feels downright generous. But it’s not just about quantity. The art and theme choices in Journey Together are incredible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve got illustration rares with full-scene designs that feel like storybook pages, Secret Rares with actual competitive value, and Supporters that do more than just draw cards and pass the turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of my favorites include the Spiky Energy Hyper Rare, which adds reactive damage every time your Pokémon gets hit, and Iono’s Bellibolt ex, a Lightning-type engine that fuels itself with unlimited Energy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also pulled N’s Reshiram and Articuno in gorgeous Illustration Rare formats — two cards that not only look great but bring real utility. Salamence ex is a heavy hitter with 300-damage potential, and Lillie’s Clefairy ex quietly punishes Dragon decks by giving them a surprise Psychic weakness. It’s not every day a booster pack feels like a mini narrative, but this set pulls it off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
