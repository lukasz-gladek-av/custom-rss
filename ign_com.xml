It puts a lens up to its next project with a little less than 23 minutes of footage, showcasing the PvPvE FPS’s world and gameplay while doing its best to answer two major questions: How much will Marathon cost, and when is it coming out?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie says its “target pricing” is currently $39.99, a price point that puts it on par with the recently released (and massively successful) extraction shooter from Embark Studios, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>. Additional details on the Marathon package are hazy for now, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family">the PlayStation studio</a> only telling buyers to expect access to all gameplay updates – including maps, Runner shells, events, and more – “as the year progresses.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie adds that reward passes will not expire, with players able to purchase past passes and earn their rewards at any time. Those worried about potential pay-to-win mechanics have been assured that they have nothing to fear, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Finally, and most importantly, we believe in preserving competitive integrity in Marathon, so survival will never come down to how much money you spend," the studio said in <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post today</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ll share more about our plans for seasonal content, a roadmap, and details about when you’ll be able to try the game as we get closer to launch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie had previously set a Marathon release date of September 23, 2025, before what it called “strong and clear” feedback from players related to an April alpha test <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-delayed-as-bungie-promises-to-reveal-new-release-date-this-fall"><u>resulted in an indefinite delay</u></a>. At the time, Sony laid out a plan to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026"><u>see the new extraction shooter launch before March 2026</u></a>, with Bungie now doubling down on that plan today with a firmer March 2026 release window for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. The exact release date remains a mystery for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Marathon ViDoc also includes loads of fresh gameplay showing how its dark sci-fi world will have players fighting tooth and nail to survive. Bungie wants Runners to feel the pressure when scavenging Tau Ceti IV, so it’s made changes to immerse players with realistic weather and updated environmental storytelling in a world it’s calling “dark, gritty, and grounded.” Other recent additions include proximity chat, a solo queue option, a Rook shell with a limited loadout, and increased visual fidelity and updated UI.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bungie shows off its progress, the video also serves as a much-needed side-by-side for players to see what has changed since feedback resulted in that hefty delay earlier this year. The studio says more updates will arrive in the coming months, telling players to expect the next update in January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for that elusive Marathon release date, you can read about why Sony was willing to admit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-concords-failure-and-marathons-delay-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly"><u>its live-service strategy wasn’t panning out as it had hoped</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the wake of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-storms-the-game-awards-2025-wins-coveted-game-of-the-year">an incredible run at The Game Awards</a> last week, during which Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 won a record-breaking nine awards <em>and</em> announced a free DLC out right now, a whole lot of people are purchasing and/or downloading the game to see what all the fuss is about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This observation comes from multiple data sources, all of which are pointing to a sudden rush of players to Clair Obscur across platforms. On Steam, the game reached a peak over the weekend of 56,993 players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1903340/charts/#max" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to SteamDB</a>. The numbers haven't been that high since June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's popularity is reflecting in sales, as well. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3ma23xntiwk2v" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Rhys Elliott</a>, head of market analysis at Alinea Analytics, sales of Clair Obscur have spiked since The Game Awards. They're up 76% on Steam, 21% on PS5, and 3% on Xbox (where it's available on Game Pass). Alinea's estimate is that this amounts to over 200,000 more copies sold in just a few days.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/15/bafkreig3wwiueo7cpgfejnsw5o3sdym5rqer4tcx7j6wddi4kdn7hyvsey-1765831179743.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Alinea Analytics</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But returning players are also coming back. Mat Piscatella, senior director at Circana, said that "the percent of US active PS, XBX and US Steam players engaging with the game more than tripled by Dec 13th when compared to Dec 10th. US Steam showed the largest lift," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7zxuzbclk2f" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a Bluesky post</a>. Piscatella affirmed that this was the highest total of players engaged on Steam since June 1, with Xbox in the US seeing its highest total since June 27, and PlayStation in the US since June 10th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an incredible spike no matter how you look at it, reflecting both those playing for the first time as well as returning players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-dlc-is-out-now-the-game-awards">giving the free DLC</a> a shot. It's likely that its run of awards had something to do with this, especially since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-storms-the-game-awards-2025-wins-coveted-game-of-the-year">one of those awards was Game of the Year</a>. It's gained so much attention that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/french-president-emmanuel-macron-is-back-on-instagram-celebrating-clair-obscur-expedition-33-this-time-for-winning-game-of-the-year">even French president Emmanuel Macron</a> spoke up to congratulate developer Sandfall Interactive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you, like all these other people, are just starting Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 this weekend, here at IGN we have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-starter-guide-beginner-tips">helpful Beginner Guide</a> that you may find useful to read through as you start.
