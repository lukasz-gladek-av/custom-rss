Today is the last day that you can score <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> on PC via Steam for free with the purchase of an ASUS ROG accessory.

The legendary Doom Slayer returns with a Shield in tow, and he's even able to fly a dragon. This game brought what is arguably the best story in a Doom game thus far, with humans and villains more important than ever. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review">In our 9/10 review</a>, we wrote, "Doom: The Dark Ages may strip away the mobility focus of Doom Eternal, but replaces it with a very weighty and powerful style of play that is different from anything the series has done before, and still immensely satisfying in its own way."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game launched just recently on May 15, and if you haven't played it yet, this offer on Amazon is the perfect excuse. Over 20 Asus ROG accessories are included in this promotion, but you only have until the end of today, June 30, to claim this offer. Keys are delivered alongside order confirmation, and you can enter the order into <a href="https://us.gamesplanet.com/game/doom-the-dark-ages-steam-key--6997-1/agecheck" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamesplanet</a> to claim your free copy of Doom: The Dark Ages on Steam. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of our favorite items in this sale is the 49-inch ROG Swift QD-OLED Curved Monitor. This 1440p <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ultrawide-monitor">ultrawide monitor</a> has numerous excellent features that complement its gorgeous OLED panel. Asus has a custom heatsink inside the monitor to ensure no damage is done to the display, so no need to worry about overheating. Additionally, you also have a refresh rate of 144Hz here, which is essential for playing games in a smooth environment. The Swift monitor is priced at $899 right now, marking the lowest price we've seen yet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're just looking for the cheapest item, the Asus ROG Keris II Ace Wireless Gaming Mouse is your best bet. This mouse features a 42K optical sensor, ensuring precision across any game, and it only weighs 54g! Priced at $144.99, this is the cheapest ROG accessory on Amazon that includes a free copy of Doom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, another great accessory on sale is the ROG Azoth 75 Wireless Gaming Keyboard. This keyboard is equipped with an OLED display that you can customize to showcase audio visualizations, animations, settings, or even system temperatures. The Azroth 75 can be used via Bluetooth, wired, or via RF 2.4 GHz, with over 2,000+ hours of battery life with RGB lighting off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Alters developer 11 Bit Studios has responded to fan accusations it used generative AI text and translation in the game, and has promised an update to both to replace the AI-generated content with handcrafted assets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, players of The Alters spotted what appeared to be text generated by AI in the game, on a screen in the Command Center. Specifically, the text includes the line, "Sure, here's a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data:" followed by a Captain's log, which suggests that someone prompted an AI for the text and forgot to delete the AI's lead-in response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the English-language version of the game, that was the end of it. However, players of other language versions <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:o7fzbrxgcaoek5sjkxq3acq3/post/3lsm3lzvb3s2b" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">began to point out</a> that some of the game's translations include lines like, "Sure! Here is the translated text into Brazilian Portuguese.", suggesting that 11 Bit Studios had used generative AI to localize at least some portion of the game. The Alters does not include a disclosure on its Steam page stating that it includes generative AI, which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve makes mandatory</a> for all games that use the technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement sent via email to IGN and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published across social platforms</a>, 11 Bit Studios offered an explanation for the generative AI text and translations. The studio explained that the Captain's Log text was intended as a placeholder and simply got missed during final release, and that no other such instances appear in the game. As for the localization, 11 Bit says that generative AI translations were limited to a few cutscenes added very late in development that needed last-minute translations, and that it always intended to replace them with professional translations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the studio's statement, in full:</p><blockquote>We’ve seen a wide range of accusations regarding the use of AI-generated content in The Alters, and we feel it’s important to clarify our approach and give you more context. AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs during the development process and in a very limited manner. Our team has always prioritized meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game.</blockquote><blockquote>During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder. This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game. We have since conducted a thorough review and confirmed that this was an isolated case, and the asset in question is being updated. </blockquote><blockquote>For transparency, we’ve included a screenshot to show how and where it appears in the game. While we do not want to downplay the situation, we also want to clearly show its limited impact on your gaming experience.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition to that, a few licensed movies that the alters can watch in the social area of the base were added at the final stage of development. While those were externally produced, our team was not involved in the creative process, and these required additional last-minute translations. Due to extreme time constraints, we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch. It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localization hotfix, to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game. That process is now underway, and updated translations are being implemented.</blockquote><blockquote>To give you a better understanding of what a small part of the overall scope of the game’s narrative layer they are, those few external movies are approximately 10k words out of 3.4 million across all languages in the game, or just 0.3% of the overall text. The alternative was to release those specific dialogues in English only, which we believed would be a worse experience for non-English speakers. In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know. </blockquote><blockquote>As AI tools evolve, they present new challenges and opportunities in game development. We’re actively adapting our internal processes to meet this reality. But above all, we remain committed to transparency in how we make our games. We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we work towards that goal.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">11 Bit Studios is just the latest company to come under fire for generative AI usage. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-no-longer-includes-generative-ai-portraits-following-fan-backlash">Just last week</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 developer Frontier Developments had to walk back its use of generative AI characters portraits after widespread criticism. Activision has been skewered repeatedly for its generative AI use, including recent examples of an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-once-again-under-fire-over-alleged-generative-ai-use-now-for-a-fake-guitar-hero-game">ad for a Guitar Hero game that doesn't exist</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">certain Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assets.</a> Other games, such as Palworld, have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood">accused of using generative AI</a> but have gone to great lengths to prove the accusations were unfounded and that no generative AI was used.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of generative AI usage, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-review">gave The Alters an 8/10 in our review</a>, calling it "a highly atmospheric sci-fi character study mixed with simple but effective resource and base management that cleverly builds existential and interpersonal pressure throughout its story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The card-based, narrative-driven RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/_/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Sultan’s Game</u></a> just dropped its latest update alongside new DLC. There’s new story content, a downloadable soundtrack, new cards, and the base game is on sale for 15% as part of the Steam Summer Sale right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who aren’t familiar with Sultan’s Game, the story begins with a tyrannical sultan who has experienced every vice and pleasure life has to offer, and he’s grown bored. But then a mysterious sorceress arrives with a card game meant only for the realm’s most powerful people. Each round of the game assigns you a Sultan Card and tasks you with destroying it, but each card has different requirements to defeat it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cards come in four different types with four different tiers within those types. The four card types are Carnality, Bloodshed, Conquest, and Extravagance. You sate Carnality cards with nights of passion, feed the hunger of Bloodshed cards with living sacrifices, fulfill Conquest cards by capturing locations, and satisfy Extravagance cards with wealth and treasure.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/stone-carnality-card-description-1751305123213.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each card also comes in one of four tiers of increasing value: stone, bronze, silver, and gold. To defeat a Sultan Card, you must use a card of equal or higher value. So, for instance, if you need to destroy a silver Bloodshed card, then you must kill a character card that’s either silver or gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game is played with cards, in-world those cards represent real people, so sacrificing cards means killing actual subjects. As you might expect, this is just the kind of game a tyrannical ruler would love. But you don’t play as the sultan — at least, not after the tutorial. You are one of his courtiers who had the courage to call out the game for its cruelty and depravity. Your punishment? The sultan puts you in charge of playing the game and having to make life-or-death decisions to defeat each Sultan Card. If you fail, he’ll execute you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The beginning of each round will see you draw a new Sultan Card, and you’ll have seven days to figure out how to destroy it. There are activities available each day, and you can choose which activities to send cards in your deck to do. But you’ll need to be strategic about which activities you do each day and which cards you assign to them. Seven days can go by quickly, and there are limited resources at your disposal.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/overworld-map-1751305170813.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of those activities require dice rolls to determine if your chosen cards are successful. When you end the day, text-based scenes will play out based on who did what, whether they were successful, and your rewards. The primary rewards are gold coins (which can be used to gain access to other activities) or information cards (which can be used for a variety of things), but as the game progresses, more events get added with more varied results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, the story will be shaped by how you decide to approach each task and how moral or immoral you choose to be. Will you willingly go along with the sultan or secretly plot behind his back? Will you stay loyal to your wife or spend your free time at the local brothel? How will you treat the strangers that cross your path?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/story-choice-1751305201280.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what decisions you make, butterfly effects will follow in their wake, some of which won’t show themselves until long after you’ve made the initial choice. Some decisions might seem innocuous at first, but the story branches they open can continue branching from there and end up with wildly different outcomes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these decisions will test your morality. That starts as soon as the game begins, when you choose the background of your main character and his wife. Are you kind and charming or strong and intimidating? Are you a slave owner (this is a sultan’s court, after all) or a more enlightened friend of the nobility? Your starting deck and stats will be determined by the choices you make during this setup, but the moral decisions only get more complicated from there.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/personal-background-1751304762377.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We won’t give any spoilers here, but we will say that there are some truly dark and extreme choices you can make, and they can dramatically alter the course of the story and the things you experience in your playthrough. You’ll have to grapple with questions like, “Who am I willing to kill?” and “What makes one person’s life more valuable than another?” Some moments might elicit excitement, others fear, and others maybe even disgust. A single playthrough takes about 10 hours, but seeing every ending can easily run you to 150+ hours, so there are lots of different paths to take.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story has an extensive script, and the latest update refined that script. It also added new Steam badges, community items, and 10 new cards crowdsourced from the community (pictured below). But the biggest new additions come in the form of two DLCs: a downloadable soundtrack and prequel story.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/items-being-added-1751304688733.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The OST features 15 original tracks by Zeta and international artists, and it’s a fusion of Uyghur Muqam, guzheng, and Western orchestration that’s meant to represent the cross-cultural atmosphere of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The prequel DLC is a digital novella called A Game for the Sultan, which will let fans read the original story that inspired development of the game. Written by the game’s lead writer, it takes place in the sultan’s court, tells a standalone story, and delves into the origin of the dreaded Sultan Cards and how they first corrupted a sultan’s court.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/novel-capsule-1751304712045.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sultan’s Game and its DLCs are currently exclusive to PC and are available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/_/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Steam</u></a>.
