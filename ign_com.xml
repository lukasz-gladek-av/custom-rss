            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-minecraft-sets-on-sale-amazon-april-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Amazon is discounting the plastic brick version of blocks.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO and Minecraft fit together perfectly. The popular game is all about using your imagination to build just about anything out of digital blocks, and LEGO is the ideal medium to bring that into the real world. There are already a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-minecraft-sets">ton of LEGO Minecraft sets</a> out there and more are on the way. Now that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-a-minecraft-movie">A Minecraft Movie is in theaters</a>, Amazon is offering some pretty steep discounts on older sets that are actually really cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although there were some newer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-minecraft-movie-lego-sets-where-to-buy">Minecraft Movie LEGO sets</a> released earlier this year, none of those have gone on sale. If you're a fan of the game itself and not just interested because of the new movie, however, the sets that <em>are </em>on sale are worth a look.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Minecraft LEGO Sets on Sale at Amazon Today</h2><div id="218161" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="928b6967-86f1-42d0-98c5-1e6fd6f3441d"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Minecraft The Sword Outpost</h3></p></div><div catalogid="928b6967-86f1-42d0-98c5-1e6fd6f3441d" id="218162"><div id="218162" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Minecraft The Deep Dark Battle Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although there are other LEGO Minecraft deals available on Amazon, the two options we've featured here are the best overall savings. First there's The Sword Outpost set, which is recognizable by the massive sword backdrop, of course. At just over $30, this is the lowest price we've seen on this set all year and close to the lowest-ever price on Amazon. It also comes with quite a few minifigures, including Skeleton and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Creeper">Creeper</a> mobs. With only 427 pieces, it's fairly easy to put together in an afternoon and can be easily displayed or played with once you're done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second discount we've highlighted here is The Deep Dark Battle Set. At $44.49, this is the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BBSMSX9Z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest price we've ever seen</a> on this LEGO Minecraft set. This particular set takes you to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Deep_Dark">Deep Dark</a> and offers some cool functionality for kids. There's a knob included in the build that lets you raise and lower the Warden. The tower can also "explode" with a built-in switch. You only get two minifigures with this set, but each one comes with armor and weapons you can equip them with.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See more popular LEGO Minecraft sets</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">What About the Minecraft Movie LEGO Sets?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There have only been two Minecraft Movie LEGO sets released so far: The Ghast Balloon Village Attack and Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring. Both of these sets reflect specific scenes from the movie and include minifigures of the characters, including Jack Black as Steve.</p></div><div id="215965" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="0f3e36ea-4367-4f3f-80b5-d721970e0438"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Ghast Balloon Village Attack</h3></p></div><div id="215966" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="0f3e36ea-4367-4f3f-80b5-d721970e0438"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring</h3></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 3, 2025 10:00 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="article-subtitle">Not yet available for streaming.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Because when I saw this, I screamed:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">YOU CAN PLAY AS THE FREAKING COW?!?!!!!!

While Super Smash Bros. has taken the path of adding characters from every Nintendo-adjacent franchise imaginable to its roster, Mario Kart has gone the other way by digging deep into Mario lore and adding every single goofy little guy you've ever seen to the line-up of kart racers. Right down to one of the cows populating Moo Moo Meadows in Mario Kart 8.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">THEY REALLY ARE ADDING ANYBODY LMAO <a href="https://t.co/UcvrIXxg57" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/UcvrIXxg57</a> <a href="https://t.co/JJdofUopVe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JJdofUopVe</a></p>— No Context Super Mario (@SuperMarioOOC85) <a href="https://twitter.com/SuperMarioOOC85/status/1907442715823833568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Moo Moo, or just Cow as they're referred to in the official roster, is getting special attention online from the community. Already, people are drawing up fanart to celebrate this cute, goofy, seemingly random edition to a line-up that, up til now, has largely included the Mario series' most famous and beloved characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They're also, predictably, making all sorts of of memes:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Mario Kart players seeing that Cow racing <a href="https://t.co/7eAN22LWPd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7eAN22LWPd</a></p>— SwagKirb (@Swag_K1RBY) <a href="https://twitter.com/Swag_K1RBY/status/1907538841852076510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">wanted to let everyone know that this was my first thought upon seeing the moo moo meadows cow in mario kart <a href="https://t.co/CCWZA0nqfL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/CCWZA0nqfL</a></p>— ticky fraggle !

For instance, in one shot in the trailer, Mario consumes a burger. Will Cow also consume a burger at some point in the game? What does this mean, philosophically, for Cow?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's more, does this mean we'll get to see Cow wearing a variety of costumes like the other characters? Can we race as Cow in Moo Moo Meadows? How do all the other cows feel about this? How did a Cow get a driver's license anyway?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart World: Character Select Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">just went hands-on with Mario Kart World</a> at a special Nintendo event, and yes, we did play as Cow. Cow was one of our favorite playable characters, and we're excited to find out more about some of the other unlockable weird little guys we've seen on the courses, and potential funky costumes we might eventually see Cow donning. Hopefully Cow doesn't have to eat a burger first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got everything you need to know about Mario Kart World and the Nintendo Switch 2 here at IGN, from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-72-new-game-details-mario-kart-9-the-duskbloods-and-more">tons of new details about both</a>, to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">why the hardware and games are so dang expensive</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
