            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Red alert!!!!!</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Attention Everyone</strong>: Animal Crossing: New Horizons has a jump button now!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also walk backwards, and sideways!!!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why am I freaking out over this? Look. This is almost as exciting as when we all learned New Horizons would give us the ability to sit down on the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes as a part of Animal Crossing: New Horizon's 3.0 update, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-big-30-update-just-dropped-a-day-early">which dropped a day early today</a>, giving access to a new Hotel area, loads of new decorative items, some quality of life features like bulk crafting, and Dream Islands you can build alongside friends. But as players have discovered since, it's also added a subtle new feature to aid in construction and placement: essentially, a controlled way to step in the cardinal directions in very precise ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This feature is now tutorialed as part of obtaining the Construction App, though it's possible it may be available prior to that, and it's very easy to activate. You can use it any time by pressing the L button. Pressing it once will snap your character into place with a tiny little hop. Holding it down and moving the stick in a direction will let you take exactly one step in that direction, effectively the size of one "square" of space. This is ideal for activities such as precise furniture placement, or lining yourself up perfectly to hit rocks or even catch bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, sure, it's not actually a huge deal - just a fun quality of life feature. It's not like a REAL jump (and you can already jump small gaps automatically anyway). But Animal Crossing's audience has historically gotten very excited about little touches like this, such as the wave of excitement when sitting on the ground was confirmed to be in the game, or the love for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/77-amazing-little-details-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons">any number of other tiny details</a> players have found over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, if they ever add jump attacks it's over for you people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other small details in the new update worth celebrating, such as the ability to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qcmzyq/you_can_have_new_custom_design_on_slumber_islands/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">save individual custom designs to Slumber Islands</a> (effectively giving you even more slots), and the fact that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qcuyk8/former_villagers_remember_us/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former Islanders visiting the Hotel will remember you</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got a comprehensive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/ACNH_3.0_Update_and_Switch_2_Edition:_All_Details_and_Everything_New">guide to the 3.0 update</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/Kappns_Family_Hotel_-_How_to_Unlock_and_Guide">how to unlock everything</a> and what's included, as a part of our Animal Crossing: New Horizons Wiki guide.

It features the Umamusume, or women with some of the features (such as ears and tails) and abilities of horses who participate in races styled after real-world historical horse races. In the game this takes the form of a sports simulation game where players train Umamusume to compete in various raises and meet certain, character-specific goals.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the mobile game, a multi-season anime, a manga, and various other spinoffs, Umamusume has covered the stories of multiple characters based on real-world race horses from the '90s, '00s, and '10s. The film, Beginning of a New Era, released in Japan on May 24, 2024 and follows Jungle Pocket, based on the real-world horse of the same name, and her rivalries with Agnes Tachyon, Manhattan Cafe, and Dantsu Flame. In the film, Jungle Pocket trains with veteran trainer Tanabe in an effort to win the Triple Crown, a series of three races that can only be competed in once in a lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umamusume: Pretty Derby launched in the U.S. in July of last year and only increased its popularity from what it already enjoyed in Japan. So much so that fans are now paying attention to the real-life horses that inspired their fictional counterparts, cheering them on, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-fans-mourn-death-of-champion-racehorse-grass-wonder">even mourning the death of one last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
