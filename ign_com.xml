Even with the rumored Switch 2 likely arriving next year, it’s worth grabbing this bundle for your kids, a friend, or yourself, but do it quickly to avoid missing out, as it’s unlikely to last much longer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These bundles offer a $155 discount compared to purchasing everything separately at full price, making it an excellent value even with the Switch successor on the horizon. Plus, the inclusion of a 12-month <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">NSO subscription</a> is a step up from previous bundles, which only offered three months of online membership.

These discounts come as speculation grows about Nintendo’s next console, commonly referred to as the Switch 2. Reports hint at a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analysts-say-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-now-unlikely-before-end-of-2024">2025 release</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-officially-be-backward-compatible-with-original-switch-games">backward compatibility with current Switch games and Switch Online</a> has already been confirmed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Switch Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The final phase of Nintendo’s Black Friday sale is now live, and these are the best deals, which aren't getting any better! To be fair, they are mostly excellent as it is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sale features feature discounts on popular Switch titles, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-black-friday-deal-2024">Sonic X Generations for $29.99</a>, Super Mario Odyssey for $29.99, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom for $44.99, and Balatro for $19.99.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Switch MicroSD Card Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch and Switch OLED offer 32GB and 64GB of internal storage, respectively, with some of that reserved for the operating system. To put this into perspective, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> takes up 16GB, while Breath of the Wild requires about 13.5GB.

It's normally $150 but there's a 50% discount for Black Friday that drops it to only $74.99. MEGA is similar to LEGO, but the brand (which is owned by Mattel) creates sets for IPs that don't have a relationship with the other famous big block company. Some past and present examples include Pokemon, Star Trek, Halo, and, in this case, Microsoft Xbox. This would make an incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gifts-for-gamers">gift idea for any gaming fan</a> who loves working on complex building block kits like LEGO.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MEGA Showcase Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set</h2><div catalogid="71c42985-9d8c-4c5d-a28d-7485a219d539" id="211751"><div id="211751" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MEGA Showcase Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The MEGA Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set is a buildable 3:4 scale replica of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/12/02/xbox-360-the-launch-review">Xbox 360 console</a> with a brick count total of 1,342 pieces (5.5 cents per brick). The details in this build are, frankly, incredible, and include interactive elements, lighting effects, and the coolest accessories. Here's a rundown of the biggest highlights:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Xbox console exterior is well represented with details like a removable hard drive, ventilation holes in the rear, text in the right places, and lighting effects. Unfortunately, there's no option to swap in a red ring of death.</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Xbox console internals are just as faithfully reproduced as the exterior. There's a tray to pop in the supplied Xbox game disc (we'll get to this later), the motherboard, various heatsinks and doodads all connected by wires, and even a fancy little Cortana chip. It's also easy to get into the console (just press a little green button).</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The set includes an authentic looking mini <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/09/23/halo-3-review">Halo 3</a> game disc complete with a detailed Halo game box that looks just like the real thing. That's not even the best part. You can place the Halo disc into the console's internal disc tray and it will light up the Cortana chip inside. How cool is that!?!</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Xbox controller has a removable battery pack. When you slide in the battery pack, the controller's guide button lights up. That's because the light brick is installed in the battery itself.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">So why the big price drop? According to the user reviews, the fit and finish of the bricks is not as good as LEGO sets, so the build process won't go as smoothly (you might even need to whip out the Kragle). But once you're done, I'm sure you'll appreciate the incredible amount of authentic features that the designers put into this set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">LEGO Sets Are Also on Sale for Black Friday</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to keep your building block collection strictly LEGO, check out our guide to all of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-deals-black-friday-2024">best LEGO Black Friday deals</a> available right now.

Those who purchase will save a total of $155 as opposed to purchasing the console, year-long NSO subscription and video game separately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Black Friday is also a great opportunity to stock up on some new controllers in preparation for a holiday season filled with multiplayer gaming sessions.

In Nintendo’s case, some games saw price cuts as early as the first of the month, but November 24 was when many of the company’s top-selling items received big discounts at retailers.
