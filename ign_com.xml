While the 40+ level matchmaking option, Solo vs. Squads, was positioned by developer Embark Studios to be its big selling point, some players are more concerned with the return of an item duplication exploit and how it has affected the in-game (duck) economy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qqb1oq/evidence_of_a_bp_duplication_glitch_in_matches_we/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">no doubt</a> using the dupe glitch to amass piles of rare items like blueprints, it seems a few fans are manipulating the system to make some serious coin – and maybe even a quick joke. The duck has slowly become a bit of a running gag for fans on its own, as the squeaky bath toy is one of a few lightweight trinkets that can be found topside and then sold in Speranza for a decent chunk of Raider Coins. It also happens to be the sillier items in Arc Raiders, so when a recently patched dupe glitched returned in a new form, those looking to exploit the system knew just what to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who are discovering topside players with hundreds of ducks, however, are just confused.</p><p>Did we come across the duck Santa Clause or something?<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Did we come across the duck Santa Clause or something?” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qmdxju/what_the_duck_is_this_we_found_two_dead_raiders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a> a few days before the launch of Headwinds. “Dupe hacking gone wild? At first we thought it was some joke because the stash was just full of ducks but then we realized they were stacks of 15 ducks each.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Okay so I actually came across a guy in blue gate in a random house just spamming ducks on the ground,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qmdxju/comment/o1lccl2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>. “I assumed he was duping. The floor was littered with them, probably like 100 of them. He wouldn't respond and kinda just stared at me til I walked away.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders’ mallard problem has only gotten bigger in the aftermath of Headwinds, as the January content update also introduced a handful of more valuable (and more vibrant) ducks to collect as part of the new Bird City map condition. It’s resulted in an abundance of ducks across Buried City…and some very awkward moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A raider caught on fire in Buried City Metro, went down without saying a word, and left behind a mountain of Familiar Ducks,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qqv3yd/a_raider_caught_on_fire_in_buried_city_metro_went/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user shared</u></a>. “I extracted with $2.8M.

DDOS (Duck Duplication on Server).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a game that constantly sees players backstabbing each other for a small chance to net worthwhile resources, it’s hard to deny the comedy in PvP players only finding stacks upon stacks of little rubber duckies. Still, it’s definitely the kind of thing Embark <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters">promised to clean up earlier this month</a>. Players have complained of cheaters and exploiters in Arc Raiders for weeks, so as goofy as these issues are, they are still causing some players to worry that others have an unfair advantage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's especially concerning for those who have kept up with Arc Raiders updates since launch. Embark <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-12-0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued update 1.12.0</a> January 20 and fixed a handful of exploits, including an item duplication glitch. It took less than a week for players to begin reporting what appears to be a new version of the exploit, and it's unclear how long it will take for the developers to publish a new patch or how many other glitches will be discovered in the meantime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Arc Raiders cheater crackdown has seen <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-update-targets-infamous-stella-montis-glitch-but-some-say-rats-are-still-in-the-walls">holes plugged in Stella Montis</a> to try and ward off wall explolits, while some players, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/streamer-tfue-hit-with-30-day-arc-raiders-ban-amid-cheater-purge-then-immediately-unbanned">like streamer Tfue</a>, have found themselves banned (and then unbanned) without notice. As Embark tries to bring cheats to a halt, players are still finding the fun both in and outside of the game. Some have even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/please-try-to-be-friendly-to-other-guests-arc-raiders-players-bombard-real-life-stella-montis-hotel-with-5-star-reviews">looked to the real-world Stella Montis hotel to leave positive reviews</a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/googles-project-genie-seemingly-causes-some-investors-to-lose-faith-in-roblox-unity-andgta-6</link>
            <guid>1421623</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Just one day after the announcement of Genie, Google's generative AI-powered virtual world creator, a number of major video game companies are seeing their stock prices tumble, seemingly because some investors think you can just generate an entire video game with AI now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that's not what Genie is. Genie essentially lets you create a virtual "world" by offering prompts to describe the environment, a main character, and first or third-person view. Once it's created, you can control the described character and wander around the world you've made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's...kind of it? While you can walk around these virtual spaces with your keyboard, critically, there's nothing else you can really do. There are no game mechanics, there's no one to talk to, no goals, no scores or meaningful interactions. Additionally, each generation is limited to just 60 seconds. And while you could maybe argue that this is just the first step on a road to eventually getting AI to generate playable 3D video games, there's no real evidence yet that such a thing is possible, or that the games would be good or even coherent. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a>, for instance, tried to basically copy Breath of the Wild using Genie, and while they got something that essentially looks identical, that's just it. It's not playable, the "Link" looks kind of frightening actually, and Genie had to copy something that already existed to make this. It didn't come up with this on its own. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that hasn't really stopped a lot of investors from suddenly jumping off the video game train, a conclusion first posed by <a href="https://ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/unity-stock-falls-alongside-taketwo--roblox-after-googles-project-genie-launch-4429665" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investing.com</a> and shared by others, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mdnsmltgmk2f" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier</a>. Perhaps the most notable decline is Take-Two Interactive, which reached a six-month low this morning and, while it rallied somewhat by the closing bell, still ended down 8%. Engine maker Unity is in a similar spot, dropping 24% today also to a six-month low. Roblox stock also cratered today by 13% by close today, though notably Roblox has been on a downward trend since November. Still, it's a six-month low for Roblox, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every gaming company is seeing a massive nosedive. Ubisoft is technically down 7% today, but with its stock down to just $1/share, any small movement in either direction will seem significant. The company has been in pretty dire straits for months, even years now, and its announcement of more layoffs, closures, and cancelations earlier this month already had stock even further in a downward spiral. EA stock hasn't changed much today at all, but that's understandable, given EA announced last fall that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo">it was preparing to sell</a> to an investor group headed up by the Saudi Arabian government and will soon exit the public trading market. Meanwhile, Nintendo stock, down just under 5% today at the time this piece was written, has been all over the place all month, following a steady downward trend since November. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The pattern I'm seeing here between Take-Two, Roblox, and Unity is a sudden distrust not in games as an idea, but rather concerns about "platforms". Unity is a game engine. People use it to make games. If Genie can also make games, who needs Unity? In Roblox's case, Roblox is a pure user-generated content (UGC) factory - something that would likely become obsolete quickly if Genie took over. And for Take-Two, the publisher is about to release Grand Theft Auto VI later this year (we hope), which would very likely be accompanied at launch or not long after with some new version of GTA Online. While the current GTA Online doesn't rely on UGC, there have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-launches-official-user-generated-content-marketplace-for-mods">recent suspicions this new version might</a>. Again, the thinking here is seemingly that if people can just make their own little games in Genie, why would they bother doing it in Roblox or GTA or Minecraft or Fortnite or Unreal or anywhere else (Microsoft, for its part is too big to see any stock impact from Genie today and Epic Games is not publicly traded).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Is selling shares of major game publishers going to pay off for these investors? I'm not a stock expert, but if nothing else, it doesn't seem to be like a good idea to bet against GTA 6 right now (though Take-Two's earnings are next week, so we'll see I guess). And while Genie doesn't seem up to the task of making a whole video game out of nothing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">plenty</a> of other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/runescape-developer-jagex-insists-no-generative-ai-will-ever-be-present-in-any-asset-that-a-player-can-touch-hear-or-feel">studios</a> are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-create-hundreds-of-thousands-of-unique-ideas-needed-to-build-in-game-environments">coming out</a> on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-publisher-defends-generative-ai-use-insists-every-game-company-is-now-using-it">one side of the fence</a> or the other on using generative AI of any kind in their work. It seems that one way or another, the folks betting big money on generative AI will reap whatever harvest of that investment there is sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>1421620</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> developer Wildlight has announced a 5v5 limited time game mode available to all players starting today. It will run through the weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play PvP raid shooter launched this week and immediately <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/when-did-it-become-trendy-to-hate-on-a-new-game-as-highguard-struggles-to-win-over-the-internet-video-game-developers-come-to-its-defense">met with a “mostly negative” user review rating on Steam</a>, although that has improved in recent days to ‘mixed.’ Meanwhile, Steam concurrents have fallen after a peak of nearly 100,000, sparking questions about Highguard’s future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chief among the criticisms from players is that the size of the map feels too big and empty for a 3v3 competitive shooter. You’re able to summon a mount to get about faster (the mounts are one aspect of Highguard that players seem to universally like), but some thought a 4v4, 5v5, or even 3v3v3 mode would have been a better fit.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, just four days after launch, Highguard has a 5v5 mode, albiet for just a few days. Today’s update also introduces a brand new base called Soul Well. check out the patch notes below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Wardens can now experiment with this dark relic from a lost age, added to rotation in both 3v3 and 5v5,” Wildlight said. “As one of two major patches released during launch week, this update is emblematic of the Highguard team’s dedication to creating a ‘ready for live service’ game, resulting in immediate action. Just this week, the team has squashed hundreds of bugs, improved performance across the board: yesterday’s update, Patch 1.0.4 introduced a variety of bug fixes, new video settings, and highly-requested features.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the addition of 5v5 should go some way to countering that feeling of emptiness in Highguard, it doesn’t address complaints about the resource-gathering phase of each map, which involves what some are calling boring mining and loot farming. Through it all is a feeling that Highguard perhaps suffered from being the “one more thing” reveal at The Game Awards, where it might have better managed expectations in a slot earlier in the show. Wildlight staff have indicated they originally planned a true Apex Legends-style shadowdrop for Highguard, but The Game Awards chief Geoff Keighley asked the team about featuring it at the end of the show. Keighley has suffered a backlash of his own, with some feeling Highguard’ position in The Game Awards’ running order overly hyped the game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Highguard | LIVE NOW!

Wildlight will be hoping 5v5 gives Highguard the jolt in the arm it clearly needs.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Highguard update January 30, 2026 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">For our first weekend, we’re excited to drop an experimental 5v5 Raid playlist, a new Base and a bunch of performance improvements for 3v3, along with some more options in the Settings menus for people to customize their game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>5v5 Raid Mode - Experimental Playlist</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We heard the feedback! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lobby has been updated to allow for parties of 5 while the mode is live. Grab 4 friends and jump into some hectic raids!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few small tweaks for this mode:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Raids are now 10 lives instead of 6</li><li>Respawns are slightly longer during raids to allow generators to be planted/defused</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dev note: As most of you know, we are working on optimizations across the game. Many are in this patch and 3v3 should see good improvements! But… adding 4 more players to the game is not going to improve performance, right? Please keep that in mind as you try 5v5!</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dev note 2: Firing Range does not support 5v5 at this time, so the Play button will be grayed out if your party is over 3.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>New Base - Soul Well</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Soul Well is a dark relic from a lost age. The Iron Vigil has now prepared this base construct for use in the field where the dead still speak.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new base will be added to the rotation in all modes.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Optimizations</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This patch contains several optimizations that touch on animation performance, projectiles, draw submission times, and other gameplay systems. These optimizations benefit console and PC, but every PC is different, so the exact speedup to overall framerate is dependent on GPU, CPU, and other factors.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Quality of Life</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Enabled these visual settings on PC and consoles</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Motion blur toggle for PC and consoles</li><li>Anisotropic materials toggle for consoles (PC has this already)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
