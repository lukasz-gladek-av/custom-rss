            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has already rolled out three of its enhanced bosses, dubbed Everdark Sovereigns, since launch. And before the next ones arrive in the Lands Between, developer FromSoftware is bringing the original three back for some limited-time rematches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Everdark Sovereign versions of Gaping Jaw, Sentient Pest, and Darkdrift Knight will all be coming back in pairs over the next three weeks, starting tomorrow on July 10. Don't worry, you won't have to fight them both at the same time; this just seems like a way for players who missed the original runs of the monstrously enhanced Nightlords to get a second shot at them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1942587654463205707" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FromSoftware's schedule</a>, the Gaping Jaw and Darkdrift Knight will be the first duo up. Here's the full schedule:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>July 10 - 17: </strong>Gaping Jaw, Darkdrift Knight</li><li><strong>July 17 - 24: </strong>Sentient Pest, Darkdrift Knight</li><li><strong>July 24 - 31: </strong>Gaping Jaw, Sentient Pest</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, for those who have dropped off a bit or need a reason to come back to Elden Ring Nightreign, you'll have some big, bad bosses to tackle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players who have been locked-in since launch, though, might be disappointed to see FromSoftware re-running the old Everdark bosses already. If so, don't fret. The <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1942587660054212865" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studio confirmed</a> that Everdark Sovereign versions of Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast, and Fissure in the Fog are still in the works, and the timing of their arrival will be announced at a later date. I don't know what's in store, but <a href="https://x.com/OldManSakaki/status/1942598916530147566" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I like this one reply</a> suggesting Tricephalos will continuously split into even more dogs, like some kind of dog-hydra.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of the Everdark Sovereigns seem to have been fairly well-received so far, too. While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-latest-patch-shadowdropped-its-first-enhanced-boss">Gaping Jaw certainly made an impact</a> with its surprise debut, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-players-dont-seem-to-be-having-as-much-trouble-with-its-second-enhanced-boss">comparatively tamer upgrades</a> to Darkdrift Knight and Sentient Pest both added a lot to each bout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-will-get-dlc-bosses-and-characters-according-to-steam-page-slip-up">still DLC expected somewhere down the road</a> for Elden Ring Nightreign, but considering we're only a few months removed from its launch, I think we're seeing a reasonable cadence of new content and recurring shots at timed events. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-duo-expeditions-on-the-way-fromsoftware-confirms-as-sales-jump-to-35-million">Duos</a> and crossplay would still be nice, but otherwise, there's still much to do and see in the Lands Between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-bringing-back-its-first-set-of-everdark-bosses-before-the-next-sovereigns-arrive]]></content:encoded>
