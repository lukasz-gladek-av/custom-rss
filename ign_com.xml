Each aspect feels authored and prescribed to a clear vision — a piece of playable art that is as fun to wield as it is to watch (I should know, the gamescom queue was very long)," IGN's Simon Cardy wrote. "It may have been the shortest of demos, but so far, Silksong is very much singing to me, maybe even more than the original."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kirby Air Riders – The First Preview</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">its big Nintendo Direct,</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-the-first-preview">we had the chance to play Kirby Air Riders at gamescom.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The maximalism of Kirby Air Riders is its core charm; it feels brewed from impish, chaotic-neutral alchemy," our previewer, Leanne Butkovic, said. "Even Nintendo is calling this a “vehicle action game,” not a kart racer, which honestly seems apt – a silly genre distinction for a purposefully unserious game. It might not have been the sequel the people were clamoring for, but I’m glad that it exists."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil Requiem Hands-On Preview</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's Dale Driver had a chance to play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">a 20-minute demo of Resident Evil Requiem,</a> and one of the biggest things we took away from playing the game is that a new, unstoppable stalker could be the scariest one yet.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil: Requiem Trailer Shows Fresh Look at Grace Ashcroft's Backstory, But Where's Leon?</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-shows-fresh-look-at-grace-ashcrofts-backstory-but-wheres-leon">Resident Evil: Requiem showed up in a big way at ONL</a> with a new story and gameplay trailer that dives deep into our protagonist, Grace Ashcroft.

After playing the Pragmata demo at gamescom 2025, IGN's Matt Purslow and Dale Driver have some mixed feelings, enjoying the innovation but with slight concerns that the process could wear thin over a full game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Onimusha: Way of the Sword Skillfully Sharpens a PS2 Classic for a New Generation</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-skilfully-sharpens-a-ps2-classic-for-a-new-generation-gamescom-2025">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> brings back the franchise for the first time since the PS2 days, and we walked away from playing this new game in a very positive way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The gamescom demo may have been short – little more than some winding paths and a boss fight in a temple – but it’s more than enough to convince me that Onimusha: Way of the Sword is built on rock-solid swordplay fundamentals," IGN's Matt Purslow said.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Onimusha Could be as Sharp as Sekiro Without the Soulslike Difficulty</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Is Onimusha: Way of the Sword a triumphant return for the long-dormant franchise? IGN's Matt Purslow and Dale Driver got to play the demo at gamescom 2025 and share their thoughts about the supernatural samurai fighting demon combat and the inevitable Soulslike comparisons. How does Onimusha compare to the obvious Ghost of Tsushima and Sekiro comparisons? Let's find out.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">LEGO Voyagers Might Already Be My Favorite LEGO Game Ever</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's Ryan McCaffrey said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-voyagers-might-already-be-my-favorite-lego-game-ever">Lego Voyagers just might already be his favorite LEGO game of all time.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Will LEGO Voyagers have some poignant moment waiting for players near the end like fellow dialogue-free physics puzzle platformers Limbo and Inside?

handheld mode on Switch 2 and came away very disappointed with the game's performance, especially when in the open areas like Limgrave. Frame rate drops were significant when turning the camera whilst exploring outside of the tutorial area, and this, combined with a confusing button layout on Switch 2, made combat confusing and exploration fairly dispiriting. We weren't allowed to record gameplay at the booth, probably due to this fact, but you can hear our thoughts on Elden Ring Switch 2 handheld gameplay in this video. Elden Ring Tarnished Edition releases in 2025, so hopefully there's time for Bandai Namco to work on its performance.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Borderlands 4 Has The Weirdest Weapons You'll Ever See</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Harlowe is the latest exciting addition to Borderlands 4's vault hunter line-up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A higher threadcount, you might say.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been lots of excitement over the presence of a Hollow Knight: Silksong game demo on the show floor at Gamescom this year, in both the Xbox and Nintendo booths. And by all accounts, the demo seems pretty great. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-we-played-it-gamescom-2025">own previewer said</a> it's "a piece of playable art that is as fun to wield as it is to watch." But some Silksong superfans hoping for new story, new bosses, or new content to reveal themselves in this demo might be a little disappointed, because the Gamescom demo is the same demo from six years ago at E3 2019. But shinier.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We first noticed this when reading through our previews of the demo from today alongside our preview from 2019. It's more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/21/hollow-knight-silksong-feels-wildly-different-and-incredibly-familiar-e3-2019">discernable when looking at 2019's video footage</a>, but both demos cover the same two areas - the early game Moss Grotto, and the later Deep Docks. They cover the same encounters and bosses as well. We've been able to comb over some other footage posted by other individuals from Gamescom and yup, looks like an updated version of the same demo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, that's not necessarily a bad thing. If anything, it shows how far the game has come in six years. Looking at similar clips from both demos, and there are very clear signs of polish. Lighting and backgrounds have been adjusted, platforms have been moved around slightly. Fans have even spotted the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1mvp03b/a_piece_of_dialogue_between_hornet_and_lace_was/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teensiest, tiniest dialogue change</a> between the two demos. It's also not surprising that neither area has undergone massive content changes in six years. If these two levels were ready for prime time in 2019, they were likely the closest to "done" at the time that Team Cherry had ready, and thus wouldn't need developers to spend years tweaking them infinitely. And for what it's worth, this is also the first time we've seen the game on both an Xbox Series console, and the Nintendo Switch 2, as the E3 2019 demo was only on Nintendo Switch 1.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The only real disappointment to be had here is that we're not actually seeing any new content after such a long wait - no new bosses or enemies or characters or stories. So anyone looking to scour this new demo for clues as to what Silksong will be when it finally releases is probably not going to come up with much that we don't already know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, that probably won't be necessary either. Team Cherry has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-teases-special-announcement-later-this-week">announced an announcement</a> of some sort for tomorrow, and after a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-boy-geoff-keighley-is-teasing-hollow-knight-silksong-for-gamescom-opening-night-live">rash</a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-shows-up-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-with-almost-30-seconds-of-new-gameplay-as-a-treat">teases</a> around Gamescom and the demo finally re-emerging after a six year cocoon, it seems likely that a release date is imminent. (Silk)soon, we won't need to scour tidbits of footage for a crumb of new Silksong info. We'll just be able to, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-the-story-behind-the-insanely-long-wait-clown-meme">finally, play the long-anticipated </a>sequel to Hollow Knight for ourselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
