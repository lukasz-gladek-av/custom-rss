The PS5 version's <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0DQF6GRT8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest-ever price</a> is $34.99, but its current price is still very close to it and well worth taking advantage of while it's still live during the sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of these great prices, this game is absolutely worth it to add to your library. We gave it a 9/10 back when it was released in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">review</a>, with IGN's Luke Reilly calling it, "a victory of imagination and restraint in equal measure. Hazelight may have been rewriting the co-op rule book for a decade now, but Split Fiction is a new chapter that you (and a partner) cannot miss." We even consider it one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-video-games-of-2025-so-far">best video games of this year</a>, so you can feel content knowing you're picking up something worthwhile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This deal is just one of many great ones to pop up during Prime Big Deal Days.
