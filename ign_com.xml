            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting games to watch at Evo 2025 was Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-fury-pros-dramatic-reaction-to-losing-at-evo-2025-goes-viral-but-it-was-actually-10-years-in-the-making">From KojiKOG's memeworthy and dramatic reaction to his loss in top 8</a>, to the incredible grand finals betwen Go1 and ET, and all of the exciting moments in between. It was a great reminder of how much fun the game can be. While I wasn't able to talk to anyone from SNK at the actual show itself, Producer Yasuyuki Oda and Animator Masari Obari were kind enough to answer several questions of mine via email relating to the release of Ken in City of the Wolves and a few other topics that I felt would be of great interest to fans of SNK and fighting games in general.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the biggest surprises to me once I got my hands on with Ken is how similar to his SF6 counterpart he is, despite this being a completely different game. Can you talk a little bit about some of the challenges involving taking a beloved character from one series and making them fit under a whole new set of rules and mechanics?</strong><br>
<strong>Yasayuki Oda, Lead Producer on Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves:</strong> The biggest initial concern for us was finding how to bring Ken into the Fatal Fury gameplay system and world without compromising his identity as a character. Our development team has so many people that are passionate about the Street Fighter franchise, and I think their love and dedication to the series really shined through in all the little details we worked on for Ken. We slowly worked out over time how to incorporate Ken’s fast speed and flashy flame-based attacks into the system of City of the Wolves, constantly asking ourselves “What was missing?”, “What could we improve on?”, “What were Ken’s strengths and where could we leverage that?” After much repeated trial and error, this version of Ken finally took form. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ken is a character that’s always been very strong in Street Fighter 6, thanks to being able to convert most regular hits on block to a Jinrai Kick that forces some risky decision making on defense, a plus on block gap closer in his heavy dragonlash kick, on top of just having really good neutral buttons and a balanced tool kit. Were you ever concerned that some of these elements might make him a bit too strong in Fatal Fury?</strong><br>
<strong>Oda</strong>: As you said, bringing Ken over the same way he is in Street Fighter 6 would undoubtedly make him a strong character in City of the Wolves. Of course, we had to make careful adjustments as we adapted him to the game. Integrating mechanics like Braking and REV Accel were challenging, but I think we were able to highlight what makes Ken special while also giving fans a chance to experience a different playstyle within the systems of City of the Wolves. We’re looking forward to seeing what fans think and how they engage with this version of Ken. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>With Terry and Mai appearing in Street Fighter 6, and now Ken, and later Chun-Li coming to Fatal Fury, do you have any interest in working together with Capcom once again for another entry in the Capcom vs SNK series? Or is that a far off dream?</strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p><strong>That would be something, wouldn't it?</strong></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> That would be something, wouldn’t it? However, there is nothing I can talk about at this moment. We are always happy to receive questions like this because it shows how enthusiastic the fans are for another Capcom vs. SNK. It’s a great source of motivation for us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How do you feel overall about guest characters in fighting games? Do you think it’s a healthy trend for the genre, and do you think we might see more in future SNK games, or even in future updates of Fatal Fury?</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> I think it’s a great trend. Of course, it is important to respect the story and world of other games, but the introduction of guest characters has great potential for the future of fighting games to create new “chemical reactions.” That is to say, it can lead to unexpected outcomes and birth something new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for City of the Wolves, there are still characters we need to bring back before we start thinking about more guest characters. Please rest assured that we are putting all of our focus on that right now. Even after Mr. Big releases, there are still many new characters and new aspects of the game we are working on, so please look forward to them!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know she’s still a bit of a ways off, and we’ve got Joe coming first, but can you share any details about Chun-Li’s appearance in Fatal Fury? Will it be similar to the approach of Ken, in that you’re looking to her iteration in Street Fighter 6 as a primary source of inspiration?</strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We have a few surprises and finer details we're planning to add. We're looking to make this version of Chun-Li a culmination of her past iterations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> We are using her SF6 version as a base, but since many of our staff are fans of the entire Street Fighter series, we have a few surprises and finer details we’re planning to add. We’re looking to make this version of Chun-Li, like Ken, a culmination of all her past iterations, so please look forward to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>For Obari-san, what was it like getting to create the animations for such an iconic character that’s outside of the world of SNK, like Ken. Were there any kinds of signature touches you felt like you were able to add, or did you try to keep things as close to the source as possible? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Masami Obari, Animator on Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves:</strong> First of all, I would like to say that it was a great honor to work on this project. I am extremely grateful to Capcom for this opportunity. As for the original elements, I would say the most work went into designing these characters in my style. I’d like to call it Bari-Ken! (Haha). It was extremely fun to draw Ken within the style and animation of the Fatal Fury anime.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are there any dream crossovers that you’d like to work on, either within the realm of fighting games or outside of it? </strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p><strong>I would be extremely happy to see a collaboration with a real pro wrestler. </strong></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obari</strong>: I’m a huge pro wrestling fan, so I would be extremely happy to see a collaboration with a real pro wrestler. In terms of fighting games, I would be excited to see a crossover with Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer, a game I was originally in charge of the story and character design!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And finally, canonically, who do you think would win in a fight between Ken and Terry?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obari:</strong> To be honest with you, I think Terry would win. I think they are evenly matched in terms of strength, but Terry is carrying a lot on his shoulders, and his will is strong because of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, as a director of the anime, I would prefer not to decide and have the two work together to fight a common enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Every August, 70,000 gamers head to Indianapolis to attend the largest tabletop gaming convention in North America, <a href="https://www.gencon.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gen Con</u></a>. This year's event had large crowds packing the convention center and spilling into the nearby streets. Over 500 vendors filled the hall and a slew of new releases made their debut. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After four days of glorious dice rolling and cube pushing, 10 board games have emerged as the most compelling and unique titles I saw on offer. Most of these will be available in general retail shortly, and many are already open to preorder. This list is organized alphabetically.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't have time to read blurbs? These are them. If you do have time for blurbs, though, read on, because we have lots of info about why each one deserves a spot on this list.</p><p id="age-of-galaxy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Age of Galaxy">Age of Galaxy</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226507"><div id="226507" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Age of Galaxy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a difficult task cramming a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/genre/4x-strategy"><u>4X space conquest</u></a> into a small box, but this intriguing card game from Portal Games does just that. Each player controls an interstellar alliance of three unique factions drawn from a pool of 40 distinct options. This creates an asymmetric suite of abilities that informs and influences strategy. Utilizing a selection of multi-use cards, players explore new systems, settle planets, research advanced technologies, and build shiny galactic cruisers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While quick and sharp, the main focus is on executing tough decisions on how to use cards for either long-term benefits or short-term bursts. The inclusion of a solo mode is also a very nice addition that extends the life of the game. </p></div><p id="ace-of-spades"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Ace of Spades">Ace of Spades</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226508"><div id="226508" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ace of Spades</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games"><u>Solo gaming</u></a> is not a new concept, but it’s certainly exploded in recent years. Ace of Spades is the latest noteworthy title in this category, allowing a lone player to utilize a hand of cards to battle progressively tougher bosses. On the surface, it looks a lot like the tabletop version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>, but a closer gander reveals an interesting card game brimming with identity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wild setting helps as you head to Sweet Haven, Arizona seeking vengeance upon a vile necromancer. This leads to a cemetery where you are confronted by horrific denizens of hell intent on claiming your soul. Best of all, if you get tired of facing these terrors alone, you can call in a partner and play the game in two-player <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> mode. This works surprisingly well, even if the core engine feels more comfortable as a solo endeavor. This is a heavy-metal charged experience with distorted riffs and a thick tracklist of content.</p></div><p id="dying-message-card-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dying Message Card Game">Dying Message Card Game</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226506"><div id="226506" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dying Message Card Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the oddball entry of the list, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party game</a> for a collection of people where one is ruthlessly murdered and the others attempt to solve the crime. The twist here is that the victim tries to form clues from a randomly dealt allotment of cards. These contain symbols and characters of various types, requiring some creative thinking from the murdered participant. You’re given a few minutes to arrange the clue cards how you’d like, using them in conjunction with several suspect cards placed off to the side. The idea is that in the last moments of life, you’ve done what you can to leave a message for those who find you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After arranging the murder scene, the victim sprawls out on the table capturing their final position at time of death. The ensuing discussion as people try, often in vain, to tease out the meaning of the scene and decipher the clues can be riotous and engaging. Ultimately, the group guesses the murderer and either succeeds or fails. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a quirky design that absolutely requires the right set of people. Acquire the wrong crowd or a misaligned mood and it runs the risk of firing blanks. However, with some performative buy-in and a deductive attitude, Dying Message will hit its mark and result in a tabletop game that is wholly unique. </p></div><p id="high-tide"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="High Tide">High Tide</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226509"><div id="226509" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>High Tide</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Cozy games are all the rage right now. These are designs that present a relaxed experience which is more focused on meditative play and chill vibes over brutish competition. High Tide is the latest to break out in this category, selling out at Gen Con due to its stellar aesthetic and intriguing play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a small game, easily portable and completely unassuming. But it boasts a surprising amount of depth. Tiles are arranged randomly in a grid and players take turns stacking pieces upon ones that are higher. You may only move your own or neutral tiles, however. It teases out just the right level of strategic thought without tipping over into a cerebral grind. High Tide is a neat, novel work that stood out among the swathe of new games.</p></div><p id="lightning-train"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lightning Train">Lightning Train</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226510"><div id="226510" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lightning Train</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of the buzz surrounding Lightning Train is the pedigree of designer Paul Dennen. His previous work, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review"><u>Dune Imperium</u></a>, is a modern classic that has caught on like wildfire in the gaming community. This new release uses a similar concept of bag building as players add various resources to their bag in a strategic bid for developing their company. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal is to open train stations and railroad lines across North America, facilitating the delivery of goods to cities in need. The interesting detail is that players can share each other's infrastructure, sending cargo along another participant’s route. Both receive benefits from this cooperation, birthing a more nuanced and fuzzy strategic space. Unlike most games in the train category, Lightning Train is a more approachable design that slots in as a step up from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions">Ticket to Ride</a>.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-f"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the F">The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226511"><div id="226511" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pandemic-board-game-buying-guide"><u>Pandemic</u></a> has dozens of spinoff games at this point, and The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship appears to be just another iteration on Matt Leacock’s modern classic. That is not the case. This new design does contain some faint indicators of that previous game’s DNA, but it’s so much more than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a rich adventure game where players cooperate to take the One Ring to Mount Doom while evading the attention of Sauron. It’s part tower defense, with players recruiting Free World troops to battle invading Orcs and Southrons, and it’s part stealth thriller as Frodo must constantly sneak past armies and Nazgul. This is a tense affair, and it’s far more detailed and thematic than expected. In fact, it barely feels like a Pandemic property at all, which may take some people by surprise. Regardless, this is perhaps the most exciting game I played at Gen Con this year, and I’m enraptured by it.</p></div><p id="nature"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Nature">Nature</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226512"><div id="226512" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nature</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/91jYRn?object_uuid=fb854556-6e2a-4fc7-b3cb-9e9864335368&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0725LRH1W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Evolution</u></a>, the board game that captures the pressures of a dynamic ecosystem and how this influences species, has been wildly successful over the past 10 years of its life. It’s spawned numerous expansions and spinoffs, and may have just found its final state with Nature. This latest version of the system is pared down to a straightforward and approachable core game that retains the interesting card play of its predecessor. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the elements have been simplified, and it’s easier than ever to introduce this game to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">beginners</a> and non-hobbyist of any age. The magic resides in the game’s module system. Multiple add-ons exist that can be inserted to layer on sub-systems for flight, dinosaurs, and environments. This slightly increases the complexity, while boosting the strategic potential. A huge boon is that it changes up the feel of each session, and allows North Star Games to expand this properly infinitely. Nature is poised to have the longest legs of any game in the Evolution line.</p></div><p id="star-wars-battle-of-hoth"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Star Wars: Battle of Hoth">Star Wars: Battle of Hoth</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226513"><div id="226513" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: Battle of Hoth</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle of Hoth was the most talked about game heading into Gen Con. This was for good reason, as it puts a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">Star Wars board game</a> spin on the popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/27/days-of-wonder-announces-memoir-44-online"><u>Memoir 44 series</u></a> of games. Players take on the role of either the contingent of Imperial AT-ATs and snowtroopers, or the Rebel soldiers holding the line in order to protect the planet’s shield generator. Each takes turns playing cards from their hand to activate one portion of the battlefield, choosing from a selection of units occupying that flank. This restriction of the card system is a hallmark of the Memoir series, forcing tough decisions with only a modicum of rules overhead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">wargame</a> of sorts, it’s also a very streamlined and rules-light design. It’s a dramatic game, full of dice rolling and big moments where units are scattered and lines are broken. The Star Wars backdrop only helps.</p></div><p id="spooktacular"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Spooktacular">Spooktacular</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226514"><div id="226514" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Spooktacular</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the 1986 Spooktacular horror film festival, a freak accident occurs involving a lightning strike and a little bit of mystery. This results in dozens of monsters spanning the length of cinematic history being released from their fictional bonds. Now they are free to terrorize the festival goers and wreak havoc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This dynamite concept is realized through a highly asymmetric yet still smartly restrained system. Players take on the roles of movie monsters animated from the screen, competing to scare and devour guests. Each of the 20 included monsters is unique, featuring its own suite of abilities and cards. Yet, this is not an overstuffed game and the core processes are direct and sensible. The concoction here is magnificent, and this monster mash is full of delight and terror.</p></div><p id="vantage"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Vantage">Vantage</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226515"><div id="226515" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vantage</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vantage-board-game-review"><u>review of Vantage</u></a>, I declared it as possibly being the top game of 2025. It seems the crowds of Gen Con agreed, as this game was everywhere. This is a fully cooperative adventure where players crash land on an uncharted planet and must navigate its many mysteries in order to fulfill a collective mission. While this was clearly designed in the tradition of modern narrative adventure games, it goes about things its own way, massively improving on the pre-existing approach. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, it’s not a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign game</a>. Each individual session has a complete arc, which makes it far more approachable for most groups. It also does away with narrow objectives requiring players head to specific locations. Instead, many of the missions may be fulfilled in numerous ways. This highlights the game’s focus on creativity and freedom, allowing you to wander and explore whatever catches your eye. Finally, the mysteries of the world are special and worthy of the effort required. This is a fantastic game, and it was the closest thing to a singular standout title of the convention. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Charlie Theel is a tabletop games freelancer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january">announced it would shut down BioWare's Anthem</a> on January 12, 2026. And now, after a rocky six years for the game, its executive producer Mark Darrah has come forward to share details on exactly how Anthem came to be, and what went wrong in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_QY8F8z_4c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">part one of a planned multi-part video series</a>, Darrah spends an hour walking viewers through Anthem's development as he understands it from 2011 through the moment he took over as executive producer in 2017. Admittedly, his perspective isn't 100% complete, as Darrah was not working directly on the game throughout much of this time. But as a higher-up at BioWare and eventual executive producer, he was nonetheless positioned to see a lot more than most.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah was only executive producer for the final 16 months of the game's development. Even so, he opens the video by taking ownership of Anthem's failings and struggles:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some of this video is going to look like I'm trying to shift blame around, but ultimately the responsibility for this game does mostly rest on me," he says. "I have a list of people that I won't share that I also feel share blame on this project. Almost everyone on that list is more senior than me. The team worked really hard on this game, the team put a lot of excellent work on this game, and there are things that are amazing in this game even now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah goes on to walk through the first six years of development, outlining a number of pitfalls Anthem ran into along the way. He talks about Anthem's original conception at a time within EA where its executives believed single-player games were no longer desirable, leaving BioWare in a challenging position as an historically single-player-focused studio. BioWare lead Casey Hudson's early vision of Anthem, he says, was to do BioWare storytelling in a live service, always online format, and he proposed they come up with a new, never-before-seen business model to do it. That's how Anthem initially got momentum internally among EA's executive leadership. As Darrah puts it, "What if BioWare game, but it could do FIFA numbers?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, early on, Anthem ran into trouble because it struggled to get personnel to actually work on it. At one point, BioWare workers were shown a presentation intended for executives that outlined the game's more live service-y vision, and this put many developers off the idea. Additionally, as BioWare shipped Dragon Age: Inquisition, staff kept being moved to Mass Effect: Andromeda, leaving Anthem without the staff Hudson wanted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another trouble with Anthem highlighted by Darrah was the repeated shifting of what the game actually was. While the original pitch was to make something wholly unique, Darrah talks about how difficult that actually is when you can't offer reference points to developers or explain it to executives via familiar touchstones. So over time, Anthem did actually become more like familiar games such as Destiny and Borderlands.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In an early design document, Anthem was going to have six javelins. Where did this number come from? It got pulled out of someone's ass.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet another issue, says Darrah, was the level of secrecy involved. While he acknowledges it's important to keep things locked up to avoid leaks, there's a certain level to which he believes it's good to share details more widely. In the early days, he recalls Hudson would strategically share certain elements of Anthem within the wider organization, which allowed him to create excitement and gather feedback. But when Hudson left, no one stepped into that role, and Anthem became aggressively secretive. As a result, Darrah says, it was easier to hand-wave issues, tailor messaging to a very small group of people who were more susceptible to groupthink.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah also tells a pretty pointed story about how being too specific about expectations too early on can lead to disaster. Here's his full recounting of why Anthem didn't have six javelins when it launched:</p><blockquote>In a pretty early design document, Anthem stated that it was going to have six javelins. Where did this number come from? It basically got pulled out of someone's ass. I guess to be more fair, it was effectively broken down like this: We're going to have light, medium, and heavy javelins, so we're going to have two of each kind...and unfortunately this number, six, got presented in early 2017 to EA executives, that Anthem was going to have six javelins.</blockquote><blockquote>Pretty close to that presentation, the team realized that it couldn't do six javelins, for two primary reasons. One, because it couldn't completely figure out how to differentiate six different kinds of javelins, but also because it realized that it didn't have time to make six entirely different archetypes of gameplay. So now, the team is forced to present that no, in fact they're going to have four javelins at launch, and even though that six was based on nothing, was based on a number we said because it kind of seemed pretty logical at the time, but there's nothing behind that, became a source of immense pressure and anxiety from the executives.</blockquote><blockquote>I wouldn't be surprised to find out that one of the reasons that everything came to a head in 2017, with the massive changes that occurred on the project in 2017, culminating in me taking over the project, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that this was triggered by this change from six javelins to four. Again, that number six was based on nothing, but it was seen as the team falling apart.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah goes on to say that he remembers one of the cut javelins was a tanky paladin javelin that was more of a support class, while the other was a medium-class that he cannot remember at all — highlighting how nebulous the idea was to begin with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Toward the end of his video, Darrah talks about a push at EA in 2016 for all its AAA franchises to be "billion-dollar franchises", which would have involved Dragon Age releasing a game every two years. This push is also what sealed Anthem's fate as a live service game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah also cites three different occasions where he told leadership he thought they should push Anthem's release date out further, let Anthem define itself more, ship Andromeda first, and then bring Andromeda people over to finish Anthem. All three times, he says, he was turned down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_QY8F8z_4c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can watch Darrah's full video here.</a> He says he has at least a part two, and perhaps also a part three planned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem eventually launched in February of 2019 to middling reviews, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">with our own reviewer giving it a 6.5/10</a> and criticizing the grindiness, lack of polish and variety, and mismatched story.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan, a well-established charity speedrunning contest, has removed Nintendo games from its upcoming Summer 2025 event, despite showcasing them for the past nine years. This is because they suddenly received a warning from Nintendo about using games without permission. The non-profit hopes to feature Nintendo titles again in future events, likely having to lodge individual applications on a per-game, per-event basis. But why has Nintendo suddenly done this now?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First held in 2016, RTA in Japan is a charity speedrunning event. Contestants apply to play through all or part of their chosen game, aiming to break records or just smash their personal best in front of an audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, a huge number of games have been featured in previous events, ranging from NES classics to recent titles. Their upcoming event, RTA in Japan Summer 2025, takes place in Tokyo from August 9-15, with proceeds going to Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières). The line-up includes Cuphead, Castlevania Dracula X, Final Fantasy IX, Silent Hill 2 remake and Wattam, to name a few. However, all the Mario and Kirby titles that have been part of the event in previous years are glaringly absent.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/gettyimages-2217743482-1754500679089.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Don't expect Nintendo games at Japan's biggest charity speedrunning event.

BROOKS/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On August 4, RTA in Japan posted an <a href="https://rtain.jp/rtaij/nintendo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official announcement</u></a> on their website, explaining exactly why the Summer 2025 event will not feature any Nintendo titles. According to the announcement, Nintendo pointed out to the non-profit organization on June 13 that “organizations require prior permission to use Nintendo games,” adding that RTA in Japan’s previous use of Nintendo titles was “unauthorized,” as permission was not obtained in advance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon receiving this notification, RTA in Japan began negotiations with Nintendo, in the hopes of using the Japanese game giants’ titles again for future events. As of August 4, it has been decided that RTA in Japan will apply for permission on a per-event, per-game basis, basically having to ask Nintendo every single time one of their contestants wants to play through a game (even if it has been featured at a previous RTA in Japan event). In their announcement, RTA in Japan revealed that they were unable to establish clear guidelines on this process in time for the Summer 2025 event, hence the decision to omit Nintendo titles this time round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan also apologized to those who had applied to speedrun Nintendo games for the Summer 2025 and had their hopes dashed. Considering the number of Nintendo titles including classic games like Super Mario 64, in previous RTA in Japan event line-ups, it seems likely that many applicants were disappointed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, this seems like over-protective Nintendo picking on a small charity event. However, the majority of Japanese-speaking users commenting on the matter via Twitter / X took a balanced view of the situation or even sided with Nintendo, with many saying they understood why Nintendo had taken this action now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan started off as a small, volunteer-run effort. However, over the past few years it has grown into a large public event with major sponsors, and the organizer is now registered as a general incorporated association, with all the bureaucracy and responsibility that brings. The event’s growing prominence is likely what made Nintendo sit up and take notice. Some <a href="https://x.com/wsSe4nneZyMWvW1/status/1952515228874559675" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenters</u></a> even said RTA in Japan should have been more responsible and proactively taken measures to ensure that they had Nintendo’s permission to avoid disruption to speedrun events (comments archived on <a href="https://togetter.com/li/2585429" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Togetter</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a side note, with the Summer 2025 event, RTA in Japan will be doing <a href="https://x.com/englishrestream/status/1949258455589548514" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>restreams of speedruns with English commentary</u></a> for the first time, making the event more accessible to viewers overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by RICHARD A.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-by-daylight"><u>Dead by Daylight</u></a> players were left to fend for themselves after a recent update introduced several game-breaking exploits, so, naturally, they turned to Blizzard Entertainment and the Overwatch team for help.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behaviour Interactive, the studio behind the long-running asymmetrical horror game, found itself in fight or flight mode after issuing its July update last week. Two Survivors from The Walking Dead — Michonne and Rick Grimes — were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dead-by-daylight-x-the-walking-dead-official-announcement-trailer"><u>the headliners</u></a>, but the latest patch came with more than just bloody new content for players to feast on.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I've been in the dbd sphere for 9 years and I've never seen everyone this upset, even at dbds lowest points there was still a lot of great things to look forward to. I'm not gonna lie it blew my mind with how many people were upset, I've never seen this before.</p>— Brandyn (@wispfell) <a href="https://twitter.com/wispfell/status/1952802731166412895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of Dead by Daylight’s many playable Killers, it’s The Clown who waltzed into patch 9.1.0 with the most changes. Specifically, any Survivors who encounter the bottle-throwing menace will notice that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/1mdiat2/more_new_clown/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he is now much, <em>much </em>faster</a>, with certain builds and strategies only increasing his speed further. Killers are usually always a bit faster than their prey, but the new update turns The Clown into a unique force of nature that makes him nearly unescapable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As The Clown Killers flooded Dead by Daylight Trials, so too did several troublesome Survivor Perks. Builds using Streetwise, Blood Rush, and Last Stand were quickly becoming popular amongst die-hard fans who had discovered new exploits, including the ability to gain infinite item charges and occasional sprint boosts. These are bugs that can and have fundamentally shifted gameplay balance in Dead by Daylight as players take advantage of what many deem to be broken aspects of the experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These issues and more plagued the Dead by Daylight community for around one week, and with few promising updates from Behaviour arriving throughout that time, fans became desperate. There was only so much the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/1mfmo0i/i_cant_be_the_only_one_facing_clown_every_23/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memes of The Clown plastered onto Cars’ Lightning McQueen</a> could do to ward off the negative feelings brought by game-breaking bugs, so players eventually took their concerns from Behaviour support threads to somewhere else entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some strange reason, they turned to Overwatch for help.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/VHe3xqdxSd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VHe3xqdxSd</a></p>— Agente6801 (@SrAgente6801) <a href="https://twitter.com/SrAgente6801/status/1952822036583075933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2">Heroes Never...

Some messages are also asking for reworks for the Onyro Killer, while others are simply pleading for any amount of support at all. You’re more likely to spot The Clown fan art than any reply actually related to Overwatch depending on the post you click on, proving that Dead by Daylight fans have truly had enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not at all clear why Dead by Daylight players, among the hundreds of major game developers out there, latched onto the Overwatch team at Blizzard. The two games are multiplayer experiences and that’s... about it, as neither truly shares that much in common outside of an ability to control characters in an online setting. It’s pure chaos that was mostly contained in Overwatch threads, though you might find a few stray posts from players bugging official <a href="https://x.com/SLeNDeR_KiLL3R/status/1952628618376397054" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fortnite</u></a>, <a href="https://x.com/khrunchie/status/1952763662684291419" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Genshin Impact</u></a>, <a href="https://x.com/KaiuswithaK/status/1952780093593370891" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fatal Fury</u></a>, and more accounts, too, if you look hard enough.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">On the Hook</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it was the crossover no one expected or just general fan outcry, Behaviour heard the pleas for help and finally offered a detailed game plan for the future. With <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1952792732394754237" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its own post on X</u></a>, the Dead by Daylight team temporarily and immediately Kill Switched the Streetwise, Blood Rush, and Last Stand Perks, removing them from play as the studio worked on fixes. A hotfix, titled the 9.1.1 update, is currently set to follow today and is said to come with fixes for Streetwise and Last Stand, specifically, as well as “small adjustments” to Fog Vials.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">This is great and all but why does it always take so much community outcry for the team to actually realize something is bad? <a href="https://t.co/TDxL8icL6F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/TDxL8icL6F</a></p>— SpookyLoopz (@SpookyLoopz) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpookyLoopz/status/1952803243064738220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Blood Rush fixes are scheduled to arrive next week, as are more tweaks to Fog Vials. These are necessary fixes but only a small step to address the community’s wider issue with Behaviour’s communication strategy. As a result, the team says it already “rebuilding” its Kill Switch process “to be more nimble and better account for community sentiment.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other words, don’t expect game-breaking Dead by Daylight bugs to tamper with the overall experience for weeklong periods in the future.
