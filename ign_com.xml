In a release shared with IGN, Take-Two shared that the delay was "giving the team some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve. Rockstar has our full support of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto VI was originally announced for a fall 2025 release, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-insists-it-wont-release-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-close-to-each-other">CEO Strauss Zelnick said he felt confident in</a> even amid speculation of a delay.

Zelnick replied, "It’s- it's all of 2025. We’ve had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year. And mostly we’re grateful to Rockstar for constantly seeking perfection."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not exactly a surprise that GTA 6 has been delayed again, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history">given the studio's past record of delays</a>. And while most fans are prepared to wait patiently for GTA 6 regardless of when it drops, some fans are taking the news a little bit hard:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a call with investors today, Zelnick also said players shouldn't expect any changes to the cadence of updates to GTA Online due to GTA 6's delay. We also spoke to him about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-is-highly-confident-on-new-gta-6-release-date-but-says-when-games-are-released-too-early-bad-things-happen">how confident he actually is in the new release date</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just last week, Take-Two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-dev-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-in-sudden-firing-of-dozens-of-staff">fired dozens of employees</a>, alleging "gross misconduct" and, later, leaking "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-studio-rockstar-accuses-fired-employees-of-leaking-confidential-information-in-a-public-forum">confidential information in a public forum</a>."
