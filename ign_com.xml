            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a Nintendo Switch or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> owner, there is no better series of games to collect than Mario. The plumber has had some of his best adventures ever across the two systems, and this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday</a>, you can save on select Mario games for a limited time. Nintendo rarely puts its games on sale, so now is the time to pick these Mario games up before deals run out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Black Friday Nintendo deals</a> have been very popular so far and have mostly sold out at Amazon. We've included the other retailers that still have the games in stock.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Mario Switch Game on Sale for Black Friday 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">First up, it's hard to beat <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review">Super Mario Odyssey</a> for only $29.99. Mario's quest to stop Bowser from forcibly marrying Princess Peach sees him traversing various Kingdoms with a new friend named Cappy, a sentient hat creature and this game's central gimmick. Mario can throw Cappy to possess and take control of enemies, inanimate objects, and more. If there's one game from this list I cannot recommend enough, it's Super Mario Odyssey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another fantastic Nintendo Switch game on sale is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/28/luigis-mansion-3-review">Luigi's Mansion 3</a>, starring Mario's ghost-hunting brother. This time, Luigi enters a giant hotel with Mario, Toad, and Princess Peach for vacation, but as always, things go horribly wrong. One of the great new features involves solving puzzles using a cloned Luigi, named Gooigi, who can walk on spikes and squeeze through bars to get to places Luigi otherwise can't reach. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-black-friday-deal-2025">Paper-Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> was one of the best Switch games of 2024, and this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-video-games-best-early-deals">Black Friday</a>, you can save 50% on the beloved remake. Originally released for GameCube, The Thousand-Year Door brings a fantastic story, great characters, and a satisfying turn-based RPG combat system. The Nintendo Switch remake added numerous quality-of-life features, like the Partner Ring to switch Partners on the fly, a fast travel system to cut down on backtracking, and more. And that's not to mention the overhauled graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-showtime-review">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> is on sale for $39.99 for Black Friday. Princess Peach must defend the stage in multiple plays against threats from a new group of enemies in this action-packed adventure. Each play brings a different outfit and ability set for Peach, opening up a completely new gameplay style. This is unlike any other Mario adventure, so if this one went under your radar last year, it's a great time and a worthy addition to your Nintendo Switch library.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Great Nintendo Switch Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While there aren't any <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-console-best-black-friday-deals-2025">Nintendo Switch 2 console deals available</a>, you can still get the bundles before Christmas if you buy now. The Mario Kart World bundle includes a copy of the latest Mario Kart game while shaving off some of the cost of buying it separately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

Most retailers tease limited-time offers throughout November, but the real discounts usually don’t appear until at least a week before what I like to call "Black Friday proper."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my experience, PlayStation deals tend to stay consistent throughout the sale. So if you’ve been waiting for a good price on a PS5, controller, or game, these are the deals to watch. No need to worry about missing out, make the purchases you’ve been eyeing, and there won’t be any Black Friday regrets come December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.
