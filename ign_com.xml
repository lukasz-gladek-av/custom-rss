Its recent beta was hugely popular, with 1.9 million taking part across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. The beta hit a concurrent player peak of 175,000 across platforms, staying in the top five most-played Steam games every day it was available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Sloclap said crossplay between Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox won’t be available for Rematch at launch. The game is available to play now, three days early, for those who pay more for the Elite or Pro Edition, but the official release date is this Thursday, 19 June.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, crossplay is “one of our top priorities for upcoming updates,” Sloclap insisted. “We'll share an ETA as soon as possible, stay tuned!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lack of crossplay at launch for a competitive multiplayer game released in 2025 has come as a surprise to fans, some of whom have expressed their disappointment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Well that's a shame,” said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rematch/comments/1lcnq7o/official_no_crossplay_at_launch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor MajesticZed</a>, “was hoping to play with friends on a different platform. Guess I'll just wait to buy it until they implement it then.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some who were planning to play via PC Game Pass were particularly disappointed by the news, given it means they cannot play with Steam players because of the lack of crossplay. “What a joke,” said redditor schumacher01. “Ah man, this is a bummer,” added Natemcb. “Ruins the plans of me and my group playing until they add it.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Damn rip to the homies <a href="https://t.co/60cJmytC4D" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/60cJmytC4D</a></p>— Covent (@ChrisCovent) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisCovent/status/1934532251171389603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some are now saying they’ve refunded their preorders. “Okay that’s very disappointing, I'm refunding the game,” Peatrex said. “The whole point was to play with friends.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Rematch is an online multiplayer game, you can see why some who were looking forward to its release would be disappointed by the lack of crossplay. But Sloclap has said crossplay is a priority, so hopefully it’s added to the game sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-ending-explained-whats-going-on-in-fromsoftwares-co-op-spin-off<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't let <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign's</u></a> status as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service"><u>spin-off</u></a> fool you. It has plenty of stuff to pick apart for lore fiends. Much like the towering Erdtree, Nightreign is just one branch, one alternate timeline, with roots in the world of Elden Ring. Nightreign  brings its own unique  ideas and new characters to Elden Ring, even if the events of the game don’t tie directly to the original. You’ll know what we mean when we start exploring the ending of Nightreign below. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This article contains spoilers for the ending of Elden Ring Nightreign.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Is Nightreign Canon?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign bends the history of The Lands Between in a different direction, forking off from a pivotal moment in the lore to give us a peek at what might've happened if things had gone much, much worse. It’s better to think of the events of Nightreign as an alternate timeline rather than a canon storyline. You don't need to know everything about Elden Ring to enjoy it, but you do need to spend quite a bit of time running expeditions and fighting Nightlords to get the full picture. Once you do, you'll start to grasp how Nightreign fits (and doesn't fit) into the story of the Lands Between.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/2622380-20250519175129-1-1750056432765.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Elden Ring Nightreign Ending Explained</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As the intro cutscene explains: Nightreign takes place in a world where the Tarnished never show up. The war between the gods—known as The Shattering—breaks out after Marika stirs chaos in The Lands Between by smashing the Elden Ring. Thousands of years pass and nobody takes the throne, eventually luring "an abomination" known as the Nightlord to the land. This unnamed being is basically a walking natural disaster. Wherever he goes, the Night follows, and an endless torrent of rain slowly dissolves the world into nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leave it to FromSoftware to come up with an even bleaker version of the timeline than what we have in the original game. Here, the Elden Throne is just an empty chair sitting in the ruins of a world fading out of existence. There's nothing to rule or to conquer. And yet a peculiar group of people have been chosen by some unknown master to try and defeat the Nightlord anyway and end the Night. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's where we come in. The Nightfarers team up to hunt down lesser Nightlords on their way to the source of the catastrophe. This involves dropping down onto what's left of Limgrave and battling familiar monsters and bosses from not only Elden Ring, but the Dark Souls series as well. While the game doesn't explicitly state why the worlds have converged, I like to think of it as the result of ruptures in reality as the universe collapses in on itself.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Nightreign Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you bring enough of the Nightlords down, the true culprit is revealed to be the husk of a man named Heolstor. He carries what looks like the Moonlight Greatsword from Dark Souls in one of his three arms, and is one of the most spectacular boss fights FromSoftware has ever created. Defeating him rewards you with the Primordial Nightlord's Rune, which resembles the Great Runes you find in Elden Ring, only with an inky hue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Usually you return to see your allies hanging out in the Roundtable Hold after defeating a Nightlord, but killing Heolstor leaves you standing in front of a Roundtable Hold that has been long abandoned. A petrified corpse sits inside and when you place  the rune before it, it causes your Nightfarer to dissipate into streaks of light that fly into the sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A post-credits scene shows the Lands Between as we know it from Elden Ring—Erdtree and all—with golden leaves wafting in the air. One of those leaves lands on a tree branch atop a giant that looks a lot like Heolstor if he were made out of wood. It rises out of the sea, pausing a moment to face the Erdtree, and then steps away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's heavily implied that by defeating Heolstor we've retroactively stopped the Night from ever happening in the first place. In other words: We've chopped off Nightreign's branch of the story for good, leaving the events of Elden Ring to play out as we know them from the original game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Who is Heolstor and what happens in the alternate endings?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/spoilers-elden-ring-nightreign-heolstor-the-nightlord-final-boss-fight-youtube-0-11-30-1750056469544.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't know a lot about Heolstor outside of the relic you get from defeating him. It tells a brief story of a knight who was slain by a hero before mysteriously waking up to curse the world. It's vague enough to fit into several different interpretations, but the most plausible one seems to be that he is intentionally a nobody, a cosmic inevitability as natural as the sun setting in the evening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This lines up thematically with the alternate ending the Wylder can get if you finish his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Wylder_Remembrance_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>remembrance quests.</u></a> Instead of erasing the timeline, the Wylder takes up the mantle of Nightlord by using a Larval Tear, an item from Elden Ring that is associated with rebirth. You learn earlier in his quest that the Roundtable Hold only exists because the Nightlord exists, and his sister, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Duchess_Remembrance_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>the Duchess</u></a>, is locked to the same fate. He sacrifices himself to the Night to keep her alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Ironeye_Remembrance_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>Ironeye's</u></a> unique ending, he cuts the throat of the petrified corpse in the empty Roundtable Hold and prolongs the Night. His goal is to protect his clan of undying warriors who you might remember from Elden Ring as Those Who Live in Death. In Elden Ring's timeline, Those Who Live in Death are hunted by the followers of the Erdtree. The Ironeye's decision saves them from this outcome, but dooms the world as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Recluse's ending is the second most hopeful one you can get. Her remembrance reveals that she once had a child who she abandoned, leaving it to succumb to an endless hunger and start to devour everything in sight, including her own sister. After defeating Heolstor, the Recluse can find the Night-touched baby in the Roundtable Hold and embrace it. Her love calms the infant and seemingly prevents a new Nightlord from forming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaining Nightfarers don't have special endings associated with them. Their stories follow the events of the default ending and they likely disappear along with everything else when it's erased. But Nightreign's story isn't completely over: FromSoftware will eventually release new Nightfarers as DLC and they could provide even more insight into the nature of this sad world— possibly through their own alternate endings.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The same can't be said for the wave that is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-destined-rivals-cards">Destined Rivals</a> however, with single-card prices bobbing up and down the secondary market seas.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the worlds biggest Franchise ever, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mtg-aetherdrift-preview">Magic: The Gathering - Aetherdrift </a>sealed product has been discounted on Amazon, so there's never been a better time to rip open the expansion. Whilst <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-in-stock">MTG: Final Fantasy</a> has finally dropped, there's still plenty of buying options for sealed product from big box retailers and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-cards-to-buy-tcgplayer-mayhem-sale">TCG Player</a>. I've also found some cracking bargains on <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRRkq?object_uuid=dd8f7c62-50dd-458a-9254-ce965ea069b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SSDs</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObbV2?object_uuid=dd8f7c62-50dd-458a-9254-ce965ea069b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">portable storage</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OO7y?object_uuid=dd8f7c62-50dd-458a-9254-ce965ea069b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DDR5 RAM</a>, games and more. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Restock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking these prices against TCG Player secondary market values, a lot of these products aren't far off the mark. Make no mistake, they're still way off MSRP, but finding Pokémon products on shelves that haven't been marked up past the point of anyone caring is a positive. Still refusing to pay over MSRP for new sets? Well played, I'm proud of you. Here's some single card highlights for you to shuffle through instead. Spoiler, there's plenty of deals to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Singles Are On The Rise (Again)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to stick a pin on Destined Rivals single card values right now, and the dips in value seem to match the little bits of stock distributors release to stores. Looking at the tracking charts for each of these cards, we can see mostly plummets from day one, then either upticks or cards for sale that exceed the original value at launch. It's crazy, but we now know how low these cards can go. Sure there's always attempts at market manipulation, but I wouldn't buy any cards on the rise right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Journey Together Singles Are Settling In Value</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having keeping an eye on the market since launch, Journey Together singles are now more affordable than ever. Many of these cards have stabilized, with the main chase card - Lillie's Clefairy ex SIR, settling at around $150. If you were planning on getting into Journey Together at some point to collect the illustration rares and SIRs, now is a great time to jump in.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Epic Primastic Evolutions Cards That Aren't Umbreon</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's so many great cards in this set that aren't Umbreon ex SIR, all of which are a damn sight more affordable right now. Because I hate anything popular (Yes, I know I'm a massive fan of the most popular IP on earth), my two favorite cards are Dragapult ex SIR and Roaring Moon ex SIR. The former is now down to a respectable $125, with the latter holding it's value well since launch, floating towards the $200 mark. These prices and below are great deals for these cards, so don't miss out.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Discounted MTG: Aetherdrift Boxes </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering discounts at a big box store like Amazon? Surely not! Aetherdrift turned the MTG meta on its head introducing vehicles and other unique mechanics. This is a great time to jump into it and rip open some packs, it's deffinately one of the most "out there"  twists on the ever popular trading card game.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy MTG: Final Fantasy</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's finally here, Magic the Gathering: Final Fantasy is out in the wild. If you got a preorder for MSRP, well played, but many TCG and Final Fantasy fans missed out. Fear not, there's still some options on sealed products available right now, including options from the secondary market with TCG Player which is around the same or lower than the pricing of big box retailers right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Big Discounts On Crucial DDR5 and Storage</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crucial are one of the most dependable brands when it comes to M.2 and portable drives, and is a great option for those wanting the benefits of DDR5 RAM without flashy RGB and it's price tag. Here's some of the best deals in the Crucial price slashing marathon on Amazon right now. I currently use the X10 Pro 4TB for backing up files and folders on my PC and for watching videos on my projector, just a solid piece of kit.</p><p id="kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-ps5"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (PS5)">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (PS5)</h2></p><div catalogid="12468fbf-8990-4f79-9cda-997cbff2a2aa" id="223003"><div id="223003" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Come Deliverance II drops you into the brutal heart of 15th century Bohemia, and right now the PS5 version is just $47.99, down from $69.99.

Movie. In a recent interview with IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-nintendo-redesigned-donkey-kong-according-to-shigeru-miyamoto">Nintendo developer legend Shigeru Miyamoto explained why the great ape got a makeover in the first place</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So when it comes to character creation and working with characters, I still take an active role in that," he replied. "And looking back to the first generation Donkey Kong Country, we worked with Rare to create Donkey Kong Country.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we were talking about trying to create new versions, evolving Donkey Kong, we created the game called Jungle Beat. We worked together with the team that made 3D Mario. With the technology that was available at the time, we were able to make Donkey Kong more expressive. And going back to the design that Rare came up with, we reevaluated; what can we do with the design to make it more expressive? And then when it comes to the movie, we decided to move forward with this new generation Donkey Kong design."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-first-hands-on-preview">Donkey Kong Bananza hands-on preview</a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza's release will help flesh out the Switch 2's relatively light exclusive games list, which includes launch titles <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>.
