            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We've played 8 hours already, but there's a lot more road to go.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Drivers, ready your A buttons, because Mario Kart World’s countdown clock is finally about to tick down! Unfortunately, Nintendo opted not to send out the Switch 2 for any early coverage, so my review is still in the garage getting tuned up. The good news, however, is that I’ve already gone hands-on with Mario Kart World twice, and when this article is published, I’ll probably already be standing in line to pick up my copy so I can jump right back in. (Sorry, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-tutorial-game-welcome-tour-costs-10-nintendo-explains-why-its-not-a-free-console-pack-in"><u>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</u></a>, but you’ll have to wait a bit longer to get my 10 bucks.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-the-final-preview"><u>read my most recent thoughts on World</u></a> from a preview earlier this week, but I also wanted to take a moment to briefly share who I am and why I’m assigned to this review. (Those who have been watching our video reviews to the end may have seen us sharing some context about our reviewer’s tastes and history there as well.) Earlier this year I took over hosting duties for IGN’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99PCYdTX-vc5oSnnIsUbuSJk6Bli4SpL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nintendo Voice Chat podcast</u></a>, and I’ve been excitedly reporting on Nintendo for roughly a decade. I’ve also been doing more and more Nintendo reviews for IGN, including both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review"><u>Super Mario Party Jamboree</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review"><u>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</u></a> last year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also an <em>enormous </em>Mario Kart fan. I’m not sure there’s a video game franchise I’ve spent more total hours playing than this one. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review"><u>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</u></a> is my favorite entry – and in my top 10 favorite games of all time – and I’ve logged over 500 hours of track time there alone. That’s not even counting the base Mario Kart 8 on Wii U, which I proudly picked up at launch back in 2014 as one of the few Wii U owners out there at the time. (There were dozens of us!) With its gorgeous art direction, amazing track design, and impressive amount of content (including the return of F-Zero!), Mario Kart 8 Deluxe felt like the franchise reaching the finish line of the more-or-less linear Mario Kart formula that began on Super Nintendo, so I’m very excited that World is tackling something entirely new to this series rather than simply iterating on what came before.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’ve logged over 500 hours of track time in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe alone.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that one, my favorites are Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and Mario Kart 64, which are the two I spent the most time playing with friends and family growing up. Double Dash’s two-character mechanic is such a blast and 64 is an undeniable classic, but I’ll also shout out the 3DS’s Mario Kart 7, which I believe is the most underrated entry in the series. I’ve always loved just playing as Mario in Mario Kart – which leads some of my friends to call me crazy – but I am looking forward to racing as the new-look Donkey Kong in World.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every Mainline Mario Kart</h3><p>Ahead of Mario Kart World, I've been thinking about every Mario Kart from SNES to Switch. Here's how I'd rank them all. How would you rank them? Click "Remix a copy" and sort them yourself! (Didn't include Tour, Home Circuit, or the Arcade entries)</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As I mentioned, I do have a bit of a head start here because I’ve already played a healthy amount of Mario Kart World at a pair of Nintendo preview events. I went <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview"><u>hands-on with the Switch 2</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview"><u>Mario Kart on the same day as their reveal Direct</u></a>, and I was intrigued by what I saw from the new Knockout Tour mode – even though that initial demo was fairly limited. But earlier this week, we published my impressions from a more robust Mario Kart World preview event where I got unmitigated access to the launch version. You can check out my final preview while you wait for the full review, but there I said, “I’m confident Mario Kart World’s thrilling racing will kick off Nintendo’s eighth generation with a rocket start, even if I’m still not completely sold on its open-world exploration.” The combination of that hands-on time means I’m going into launch with roughly eight hours of gameplay already logged, so I can hit the metaphorical A button right after the “2” flashes to have a good boost off the line. I’m hoping to get our final, scored review published before the end of next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll even be working on my review from the floor of <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IGN Live 2025</u></a>, which is happening in downtown Los Angeles at The Magic Box this weekend, June 7-8. There’s a ton happening at the show, and you can <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>come on down to IGN Live yourself </u></a>for a chance to be part of the review process by playing against me. We’ll have an official “Game with IGN” setup featuring Mario Kart World where you can play against IGN editors like myself, our co-founder Peer Schneider, and many others – and if you see me on the show floor, you can channel your inner Pokémon trainer and challenge me to a race. (You can’t back out of a trainer battle once a stranger locks eyes with you, that’s just how it works.) Last year at IGN Live 2024, I had a great time playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe against fans that came out to the show, and I can’t wait to do it again – this time with a brand-new Mario Kart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can look forward to some updated thoughts on Mario Kart World in the coming days – and, if you managed to secure a Nintendo Switch 2 at launch, then I’ll see you on the open roads!</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is genuinely great! It's good to go after these! However, as players have gotten more comfortable with the gain and learned about this guaranteed, free reward, more and more people have developed a weird habit of beelining directly from chapel to chapel while doing <em>literally nothing else,</em> skipping camps of monsters and other rewards in favor of sprinting for five minutes, getting a charge, sprinting for five more minutes, repeat until it's nighttime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why is this bad? Well, largely because collecting flasks is all well and good, but it's not helpful to be able to repeatedly heal yourself if you're getting one-shot by Wormface. Good Nightreign play is a balancing act: you have a limited amount of time before night falls and the big boss arrives, so you need to spend it wisely by fighting increasingly difficult monsters, raiding camps, collecting better weapons and items, and leveling yourself up. If you're not at least level five or six by the time the first night falls, the boss is just going to smash your face in with one shot — the extra flask won't help you.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Therefore, an ideal strategy is to spend as little time running across the map as possible, and instead try to flow easily from place to place in close proximity to one another, grabbing flask charges where it makes sense in between raiding camps and fighting sub-bosses. And yet, <em>in spite of this,</em> every three or four times I queue, I end up with someone who keeps aggressively dropping map pins on chapel after chapel and running off on their own when we don't agree with the plan to spend half the game in a footrace across the map for a flask charge. Bud, I'm playing Recluse! I don't have any HP to heal in the first place!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yes. It's good to go to church and get right with our lord Marika. But it's also okay to have other, non-religious hobbies, like beating the snot out of this Abductor Virgin in the courtyard so we can get the map at the top of the tower and I can grab a new staff off the rack next to it.
