            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-today-pokmon-151-booster-bundle-surging-sparks-and-journey-together-restocks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon fans have plenty to sift through today with restocks across some of the most in-demand sets. Surging Sparks and Journey Together booster packs are back at reasonable prices, and the Azure Legends tin is a smart pickup if you're looking for variety in a single purchase. These items have been tough to grab without markups, so it's a good time to stock up while they’re available and shipping with Prime.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon 151 Booster Bundle, Surging Sparks, and Journey Together Restocks</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 151 Booster Bundle has also returned to Amazon, but don’t be fooled by the listed discount. Despite being marked as 20 percent off, the current $66.65 price is nearly double its original MSRP, which typically ranges from $30 to $35. If you’ve been trying to complete this nostalgic set, it's at least back in stock, but from a value standpoint, the deal is questionable.</p><div id="218684" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Add MLB.TV and Get $30 Off Your First Month of Sling</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Now through May 31, you can tack on MLB.TV and stream every single out-of-market game and get $30 off your first month of Sling TV. Get access to ESPN, TBS, FS1, and more, plus a free month of unlimited DVR.</p></div></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-151-bo"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG Scarlet &amp; Violet: 151 Bo">Pokémon TCG Scarlet &amp; Violet: 151 Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218823"><div id="218823" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG Scarlet &amp; Violet: 151 Booster Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Full Disclosure: MSRP is $26.94</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle brings back the original 151 Pokémon with modern mechanics and new artwork, making it a highly sought-after product among longtime fans and collectors. It’s marketed as a great way to access the set without buying a full booster display box, and it consistently sells out quickly. Still, at nearly twice the standard retail price, it’s worth thinking twice unless you’ve had trouble finding it elsewhere.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-sleeved-b"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG Surging Sparks Sleeved B">Pokemon TCG Surging Sparks Sleeved Booster Pack</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218824"><div id="218824" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG Surging Sparks Sleeved Booster Pack</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently the number one best-seller in collectible booster packs on Amazon, Surging Sparks includes over 250 cards, new Pokémon ex, ACE SPEC cards, and more than 50 cards featuring special illustrations. With solid pull potential and a modest price point, it’s an easy recommendation for casual players and serious collectors. Each pack contains 10 cards and is eligible for fast, free Prime shipping.</p></div><p id="the-last-of-us-joel-with-hatchet-b"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Last of Us - Joel With Hatchet B">The Last of Us - Joel With Hatchet Bust</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218825"><div id="218825" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Last of Us - Joel With Hatchet Bust</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Available now for pre-order, this officially licensed Joel bust from Dark Horse and Naughty Dog stands 8.5 inches tall, reaching 11 inches at the top of the hatchet. The statue features detailed texturing on Joel’s flannel, backpack, and face, all set on a battle-worn concrete base with moss and bullet holes. It includes a certificate of authenticity and is scheduled to ship in August 2025. Ideal for collectors and fans of The Last of Us looking to lock in a centerpiece item.</p></div><p id="pokemon-tcg-azure-legends-tin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin">Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218826"><div id="218826" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This newly released tin includes five booster packs and one random foil promo card featuring either Kyogre ex, Xerneas ex, or Dialga ex. Inside, you’ll find a mix of packs from recent expansions including Surging Sparks, Temporal Forces, Stellar Crown, and Obsidian Flames. It’s a solid mid-tier pickup for anyone looking to expand their collection with newer sets in one convenient package.</p></div><p id="dice-destiny-game-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dice &amp; Destiny Game Bundle">Dice &amp; Destiny Game Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218827"><div id="218827" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dice &amp; Destiny Game Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle features seven well-reviewed indie RPGs including Disco Elysium, Citizen Sleeper, Broken Roads, Roadwarden, and both Pillars of Eternity games. With ratings as high as 94 percent positive on Steam, the value here is undeniable for turn-based and narrative RPG fans. Plus, 15 percent off Citizen Sleeper 2 is included as a bonus coupon. The deal supports Care.org and is available for the next 15 hours only.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Jour">Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together Sleeved Booster</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218828"><div id="218828" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together Sleeved Booster</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Full Disclosure: MSRP is around $4.50 </p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Marked down from $15.99, this pack is part of the Scarlet and Violet expansion and comes in assorted packaging. Each blister contains 10 cards, with a chance to pull some of the newer generation cards and artwork styles. While the pack style you receive is random, this is a good opportunity to sample the set at a much lower price than usual.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Jour">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218700"><div id="218700" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the first time I’ve seen the ETB for a reasonable price without having to buy it from someone’s backseat eBay hustle. Nine booster packs, full-art N’s Zorua promo, card sleeves, energy, dice, the works. I’ve seen this box selling for $90+ since launch, so $70.31 from Amazon is genuinely solid. Lillie’s Clefairy ex is still floating around $180 and N’s Zoroark ex has dropped to $13, which tells me the hype has deflated and we’re in “buy because it’s fun” territory again. I like it here.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Jour">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218701"><div id="218701" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the low-frills version for people who just want to open packs without pretending they’re going to organize their collection. Six Journey Together boosters and none of the ETB fluff. Honestly, this is how I like to test a set when prices cool off. You still have a shot at cards like Salamence ex SIR, which tanked from $250 to around $106, or a sub-$20 N’s Reshiram. Even if you pull nothing, at least you didn’t overpay trying to win the cardboard lottery.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Jour">Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together - Sleeved Booster</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218703"><div id="218703" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together - Sleeved Booster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I threw one of these in my cart last week just to hit the free shipping minimum. One pack, random art, decent discount. There’s no reason to expect anything big, but the price is finally low enough that I don’t feel bad if I just pull a Furret. And if you happen to land something like Articuno’s Illustration Rare (now $18.69) or Wailord (around $14.55), it’s a nice win from a $10 impulse buy.</p></div><p id="train-sim-world-5-route-remix-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle">Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218704"><div id="218704" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t know how many people wake up wanting ten train simulator add-ons, but if you’re one of them, today is your day. For $15, you get Train Sim World 5’s Starter Pack plus nine routes and loco add-ons. Antelope Valley, Cajon Pass, Thameslink, Santa Fe F7—the whole diesel buffet. It’s Steam keys, it supports CALM, and the value is so off the rails (pun fully intended) that I bought it just to mess around with the Railpool BR193 Vectron. Don’t judge me.</p></div><p id="lepro-o1-ai-floor-lamp"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp">Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218705"><div id="218705" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of those “tech that doesn’t make sense until you try it” products. It’s a smart LED floor lamp with AI-generated lighting modes, music sync, voice control, app scheduling, and a vibe for every mood. It’s absurdly bright at 2300 lumens, and it looks clean in any corner setup. The AI stuff isn’t just fluff either. Say “I want relaxing light” and it’ll give you ten preset scenes. I think it’s great if you want one light to do everything without fiddling with settings for half an hour.</p></div><p id="lepro-b2-ai-smart-light-bulbs"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs">Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218706"><div id="218706" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the same AI bulbs as the ones in the floor lamp, but in classic 75W-equivalent LED form. They’re bright, colorful, and weirdly helpful if you’re too tired to fine-tune your lighting manually. The music sync is fun, the AI scenes work well, and the voice commands actually feel smart instead of gimmicky. I bought a set of these last month and haven’t touched the wall switch since. At $8 per bulb, it’s kind of a no-brainer.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218606"><div id="218606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up Surging Sparks because six booster packs under $50 is lower than what Amazon has been charging recently (It's still above MSRP though) Honestly, I wanted something new to crack open. It’s part of the latest Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion, so if you’re trying to keep up with current sets or just enjoy the chaos of pulling a good card, this one’s a smart grab.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-ionos-bellibolt-ex-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Pre">Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218607"><div id="218607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s for the collectors who care as much about presentation as they do the pulls. Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection comes with six packs, a full-art promo, and a display sheet that’s more elaborate than it needs to be — in a good way. It's also a cool way to snag Journey Together packs with a fantastic promo card.</p></div><div id="218685" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Free to Play VR Sandbox Game: DigiGods on Meta Quest</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>DigiGods is a free-to-play, physics-based, VR game that allows players to create, play, and share in a sandbox environment. Safety is a top priority with  the use of AI content filtering and human moderators to ensure a safe and positive environment.</p></div></div><p id="mass-effect-merchandise"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mass Effect Merchandise">Mass Effect Merchandise</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218608"><div id="218608" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mass Effect Merchandise</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think anyone who's replayed Mass Effect more than once knows exactly why these statues are tempting. I pre-ordered Jack immediately because, well, it felt necessary. The line includes Shepard, Tali, Legion, and others, and they look good enough that I’ve already made space for them on the shelf. If you're still quoting Garrus unironically, these are for you.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-pa"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Pa"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paldean Fates: Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218609"><div id="218609" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paldean Fates: Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Paldean Fates is priced a double MSRP, but it's also very hard to come by in 2025. I grabbed it because the baby shiny sub-set is awesome, but if you just want to grab the single cards from this set, it might actually save you money.</p></div><p id="fellow-traveller-publisher-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle">Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218610"><div id="218610" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay less to get fewer items, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity One Tree Planted</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle has some of the better narrative indies from the last few years. I paid the $12, added the games to my backlog like I always do, and immediately booted up The Pale Beyond. It’s a strong lineup if you like character-driven games and don’t mind occasionally being emotionally wrecked by minimalist storytelling.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-shr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shr"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218611"><div id="218611" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think of this one as the all-in-one box for when you want cards <em>and</em> a bunch of gear you probably won’t use but still want around. Nine booster packs, a promo, sleeves, dice, and enough extras to make you feel like you’re doing more than just opening packs. It’s a solid option if you like having a little structure with your chaos.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-terapagos-ex-ultra-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Pre"> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218612"><div id="218612" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I hesitated on this one, then immediately remembered it includes 18 booster packs and a playmat. It’s definitely a big spend, but if you’ve been waiting for a premium bundle that actually justifies the price, this checks out. I picked it up more for the experience than the individual cards, and that’s the right way to approach it.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-shining-fates-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collectio">Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218613"><div id="218613" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Shining Fates Pikachu V mostly because I never actually opened it when it first dropped, and now seemed like a good excuse. Four booster packs, a Pikachu promo, and the oversized card that ends up somewhere near your desk — standard stuff, but still a nice throwback if you missed it the first time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
