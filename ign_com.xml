It also includes a short segment on the negative reaction to some of the Madden games, with disgruntled fans letting EA know how they feel in various comments (“still trash… big pass” etc). There’s even a clip of YouTuber Angry Joe doing one of his famous rants, screaming: “Every year it’s the same thing!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are hints at dramatic events such as EA struggling with deadlines, signing licensing deals, and competition from other video games. There’s no mention of the infamous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-curse-returns-as-san-francisco-49er-christian-mccaffrey-out-for-4-games">Madden Curse</a>, but it seems like any documentary on Madden would have to at least touch on it.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">FIRST LOOK: <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimeVideo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@PrimeVideo</a> has dropped the trailer for a new series chronicling the rise of the <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@EASPORTS</a> Madden franchise. 🏈🎮 <a href="https://t.co/bU0PVaBS6q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bU0PVaBS6q</a></p>— Boardroom (@boardroom) <a href="https://twitter.com/boardroom/status/1856007717283889556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>It’s one of the biggest video games of all time, a groundbreaking brand that became a worldwide phenomenon, spanning generations — but it almost never happened… Now, 36 years after the first game's release, EA Sports gives viewers unprecedented access to the makers of the game that changed the game, and our culture too.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Prime Video.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
