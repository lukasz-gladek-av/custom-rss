The Intel Core i7-14700 CPU has a max turbo frequency of 5.4GHz with 20 cores, 28 threads, and a 28MB L2 cache. Although one generation old, the i7-14700 is still an excellent relevant CPU for both gaming and producitivity use.

It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. Like all Blackwell cards, the RTX 5070 Ti supports <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dlss-4-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvidias-latest-ai-upscaling-tech">DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation</a>.  This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution. If you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti may be a better value since it has the same amount of VRAM as the RTX 5080.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
