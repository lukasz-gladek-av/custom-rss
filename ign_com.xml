            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, we reported that disturbing horror game Horses had been banned from Steam, with developer Santa Ragione claiming that Valve refused to provide a clear reason for the ban or discuss it further with the studio. Now, at the last possible minute before the game was set to release widely across other PC store fronts, Epic Games Store has also banned Horses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news was shared with us by Santa Ragione, who passed on a press release stating that Epic informed them 24 hours before the game's release that it would not be distributing Horses, despite the studio's build being approved for release weeks earlier. Per the developer, no specifics on what content was at issue were provided, "only broad and demonstrably incorrect claims that it violated their content guidelines." The studio has shared the text of the email sent to them from Epic banning the game, which an Epic Games Store representative has confirmed is accurate. It is as follows:</p><blockquote>We are unable to distribute Horses on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies. The ‘Inappropriate Content’ policy prohibits content which “contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated.” The ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse. This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology). You have some options on how to move forward: 1. You can make updates to your product to ensure compliance and resubmit it for review. 2. If you believe we made a mistake, you also have the ability to appeal this decision. You can appeal by replying to this email or creating a private discussion on our Developer Support site. Select "Epic Games Store" as the topic. 3. You cannot change the title or content to repurpose it for another game. If you choose not to move forward, we'll refund your submission fee for this product.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">When Santa Ragione appealed, the studio says it was denied 12 hours later "without further explanation." Notably, the studio has also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m6zktxf4q222" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated on social media</a> that its own IARC Questionnaire submission came back with an "M" for "Mature" rating rather than "AO". It is unclear what caused the discrepancy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Santa Ragione explains the situation:</p><blockquote>Epic's decision comes after the overwhelming support Santa Ragione received last week upon the disclosure of Steam's ban, including the public announcement by Epic's and Steam's competitor GOG that they would promote and support the game. We do not know what triggered Epic's sudden decision. Following the announcement of Steam's ban, Horses became highly visible online, with strong support and a small but vocal opposition. It is difficult not to wonder whether this visibility played a greater role in Epic's choice than any newly discovered issue with the game itself.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN asked Epic Games for comment, and received the following statement from an Epic Games spokesperson: "We set clear <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guidelines</a> for the content that can be distributed on the Epic Games Store and found violations of those guidelines during our extensive review."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this article's publication, Horses is <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still listed as "Coming Soon"</a> on the Epic Games Store.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses was previously revealed several years ago, and has made appearances in showcases like The Indie Horror Showcase and Day of the Devs. It's gained some attention for its deeply unsettling premise: a young man travels to a remote horse farm to work for several weeks over the summer, only to find the farmer's "horses" are actually enslaved, naked humans with horse masks affixed to their heads. Horses, says Santa Ragione, is meant to be upsetting: it's at least partly a commentary on what sorts of morally horrifying things people will accept or even participate in without pushback, a subject we found was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">executed artfully, if upsettingly, in our 7/10 review of the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet, the game has been banned from now both Steam and Epic. Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">we reported</a> that developer Santa Ragione said it was rejected from Steam after the team submitted an unfinished but playable build of the game in order to create a store page, an unusual request that Valve said was necessary. Valve then rejected Horses, generally citing its Steam Onboarding Documentation, as well as the sentence, "Regardless of a developer’s intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Santa Ragione has since guessed this was in relation to a scene in the game at the time that depicted a fully clothed child "riding" one of the horses on their shoulders. However, the studio says it has since changed that scene to involve an adult instead of a child, and that all characters in the game are clearly adults in their 20s and up, a fact that has remained true in the final version of the game that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">IGN reviewed</a>, ironically, on the Epic Games Store. Santa Ragione says it was not given the opportunity to resubmit a build to be reconsidered by Valve, and remains unsure if this scene was even what triggered the ban in the first place. The studio claims that without being able to reach Steam's much larger audience, it is likely it will have to shut down following the launch of Horses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Valve issued a statement claiming it "gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with our onboarding rules and guidelines" and that its internal content review team discussed a re-review "extensively" but decided against it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses is now available on itch.io, GOG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-pc-game-storefront-gog-gets-behind-horses-after-valve-steam-ban-players-should-be-able-to-choose-the-experiences-that-speak-to-them">(which publicly expressed support for the game last week</a>), and Humble (which Santa Ragione says confirmed to the studio it would be available).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation hardware architect Mark Cerny has recalled his time working at Sega in the late 1980s, a period in which he likened conditions at the company behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-1991">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> to a "sweatshop."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0hh8BAr4dqZ792CwE1db3r" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My Perfect Console</a> podcast, Cerny made clear he was talking about Sega's Tokyo office during a specific period of time, when the company was under immense pressure to compete with the hugely dominant Nintendo, and teams sizes across the video games industry were tiny compared to the projects worked upon today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Atari had been one person making a game, maybe two or three," Cerny recalled. "By this point there were actual teams, it tended to be about three people at Sega making a cartridge. So you'd have a programmer — that was me — a designer and an artist. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/gettyimages-627142702-1764695996156.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mark Cerny. Image credit: Mintaha Neslihan Eroglu/Anadolu Agency/Getty.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've got to caveat this," Cerny continued. "I'm only talking about the second half of the 1980s at Tokyo office. But man, Sega was a sweatshop. Three people, three months, that's a game. And, you know, we would sleep at the office. And this is because [former Sega president Hayao] Nakayama's idea was, 'Why is Nintendo successful? They have 40 games. So what are we gonna do? We're gonna have 80 games for the Master System, and that's going to be our path to success.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Sega's boss wanted to flood the market with games to simply outnumber the range of titles available on Nintendo's top-selling NES. But this was the wrong approach, Cerny said, arguing that Sega should have narrowed its focus and encouraged its employees to work in larger teams on fewer, but more impressive titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you look at the history of games I think if you're trying to sell a console, you need about two good games, and that sells you your console," Cerny said. "Like Nintendogs and Brain Training, I think that's what sold the DS, if I remember that properly for Nintendo. So the bulk software thing is not the approach."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, Sega did allow a particular game more resources: Sonic the Hedgehog. But even then, and alongside its huge success, Cerny says that Sonic's creator Yuji Naka was berated for going hugely over budget.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The pressure was to make a game that could sell a million copies. Sega actually had — this was another one of Nakayama's brainstorms — the Million Seller Project," Cerny continued. "Sonic was terribly controversial — part of the idea there was, let's put much more resource on the project than usual... They were going to do, if I remember properly, three people, 10 months. But they ended up needing four and a half people for 14 months — I'm a little hazy on the numbers these days. And though it was a success, they blew their budget so badly... that Yuji Naka was just getting yelled at, and quit the company."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked whether Sega ultimately learnt its lesson from Sonic's success, Cerny noted that while the game's huge sales paid off "fantastically" for Sega, "Yuji Naka was pretty tired of the situation by that point." According to Cerny, Naka had been "making $30,000 a year" at the time of Sonic 1's success, though this was increased that year because he got the "president's bonus."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Sonic Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I guess that is interesting, how could he be yelled at but get it [the bonus] as well? It was an interesting environment, I have to say," Cerny mused. "It probably doubled his salary. So, we're talking about somebody who's a top-level creator making $60,000 in their best year and getting yelled at a lot. And he'd had it. And so that's what led to Sonic 2 being developed in the States."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cerny also discussed some happier moments from his time at Sega, and noted that his "room of 40 people back in 1987" had included some luminaries of the games industry, including Naka and the late Rieko Kodama, who would go on to create the beloved Skies of Arcadia. Still, Cerny did not stick around long-term, moving back to the U.S. in 1991 (and working on Sonic 2) before eventually beginning his long partnership with PlaySation, for which he is now most famous.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Mintaha Neslihan Eroglu/Anadolu Agency/Getty.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
