Sadly, the Collector Booster is the real value proposition here, because they’re like gold dust.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collector Boosters include cards that are functionally the same as the cards you’d get from a Play Booster pack, but since they feature foils and alternative art treatments, they’re where you’re much, much more likely to find pricier cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The product listing suggests players use the Collector Booster as a prize for whoever wins Draft Night, but I can see scalpers pulling it out and selling it on to make money on the secondary market.</p></div><div id="229434"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229434" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TMNT Turtle Team-Up Box</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Also in stock, however, is the new <a href="https://zdcs.link/QG8ppJ?object_uuid=b20f3927-00fd-4efd-9c8f-ee2c0dc2cfe5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Turtle Team-Up</u></a>.

Retro remaster developer Digital Eclipse has the original collection – which includes DuckTales, DuckTales 2, Chip ‘n Dale Rescue Rangers, Chip ‘n Dale Rescue Rangers 2, Darkwing Duck, and TaleSpin – set with a digital Switch release date of February 26, 2026, with Goof Troop and Bonkers packed in, too.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 announcement trailer for The Disney Afternoon Collection.

Goof Troop sees Goofy and his son, Max, go on a swashbuckling co-op adventure to save Pete and PJ, while Bonkers follows Bonkers D. Bobcat as he solves crimes in Toontown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a bundle fit for the biggest fans of classic gaming from the House of Mouse, with the total game count now reaching eight. The February re-release will finally bring the bundle to Nintendo’s hybrid consoles, with access to soundtracks, a behind-the-scenes gallery, and rewind features, available, too. There are also Time Attack and Boss Rush modes for those looking to shake up that classic gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Disney Afternoon Collection physical edition is also confirmed to be in development for those willing to wait until after the February digital release. Disney says the physical Switch release – which comes with the game cartridge, two sticker sheets, eight retro milk caps, and three collectible cards – is now available for pre-order and will ship “at a later date.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Disney Afternoon Collection Nintendo Switch Announcement Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Disney Afternoon Collection launches digitally next month.

I have trouble seeing its appeal to anyone else. But if vintage duck-based platformers are your thing, grab a Capri Sun and a handful of Gushers and invite your friends over to play.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.
