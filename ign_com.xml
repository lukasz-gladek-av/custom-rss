One developer has said it’s closer to the Xbox Series S than the PlayStation 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wild-hearts-s-qa-switch-2-is-closer-to-the-series-s-than-ps4/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wccftech</a>, Takuto Edagawa, producer of Koei Tecmo's Wild Hearts S, said that while it’s difficult to generalize about the power of the Switch 2, the Series S is a decent comparison.</p><blockquote>There are a lot of characteristics when it comes to raw computing power so it's difficult to generalize, but I think it can be thought as closer to the Series S.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-specs-battery-life-4k-and-up-to-120fps-storage-and-more">Switch 2's tech specs</a> include a custom Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores. Ahead of the console’s launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-says-its-custom-gpu-means-nintendo-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">Nvidia said the GPU enables 10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch</a>, with AI upscaling via DLSS and ray tracing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox Series S is the less powerful alternative to the Xbox Series X. It launched alongside that console in 2020, in direct competition with the PlayStation 5, and this November turns five years old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the Switch 2 is similar in power to the Xbox Series S, that suggests it will run most third-party games. Microsoft mandates that any game that launches on the Xbox Series X also launches on the S, so any developer working on a game for the current-gen Xbox must ensure the S is capable of running it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also worth noting that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-its-working-with-nintendo-to-get-call-of-duty-on-switch-but-will-black-ops-7-be-on-switch-2">Microsoft and Activision are still working on bringing Call of Duty to Switch</a>. The recently announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> isn’t confirmed for Switch 2 yet, but we do know it’s planned for release on the last generation of consoles (PS4 and Xbox One). That should mean it’ll run fine on Switch 2, based on Edagawa’s comments.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Switch 2 released with a number of third-party games to flesh out its launch lineup, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2">including CD Projekt’s demanding Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Where the Switch lacked many third-party multiplatform games, perhaps the Switch 2 will thrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 2 is off to a great start, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-becomes-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-with-over-35-million-units-sold-worldwide-in-just-four-days">selling 3.5 million units in just four days</a>.

Sorry — Barone didn't elaborate. "The world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley" is the full extent of his <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">message</a>.

I MEAN- DONT STOP TEASING. I MEAN- IDK IM SO EXCITED BUT I DONT WANT U TO RUSH TAKE UR SWEET ASS TIME WE LOVE U."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Barone admitted that he "didn't want to just be the Stardew Valley guy," explaining that was why he's currently working on Haunted Chocolatier. We shouldn't expect a release date anytime soon, though — there's "still a lot to be done," Barone recently admitted, particularly as he feels it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-says-he-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2-but-its-so-much-easier-to-add-more-stuff-to-stardew-valley-than-make-a-new-game-from-scratch"><u>"got to be better" than Stardew Valley</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, he also suggested that he may <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-says-he-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2-but-its-so-much-easier-to-add-more-stuff-to-stardew-valley-than-make-a-new-game-from-scratch"><u>"eventually make a Stardew Valley 2."</u></a> Before you get too excited, however, the developer also said it's "so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's all the systems — all the major systems — are already all done. That’s the stuff that’s not fun to do. When I make an update [for Stardew Valley now], it’s like, you know, oh, throw in this, throw in that.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launch-helps-street-fighter-6-hit-5-million-sales-2-years-after-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> has now sold over 5 million copies, Capcom has announced. That’s up from the 4 million reported in September 2024. The latest sales milestone was helped by the fighting game’s launch on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom said it aimed to “maximize the game’s userbase” by bringing Street Fighter 6, now two years old, to the Switch 2 at launch. The Switch 2 version has exclusive modes designed for the console, and new gameplay features that utilize the gyro functionality of the Joy-Con 2. It’s worth noting the Switch 2 version has crossplay, maximising the pool of players available for matchmaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These initiatives have contributed to Street Fighter 6’s wide appeal, expanded global sales and resulted in the title achieving the milestone of 5 million units sold,” Capcom said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-punches-through-3-million-copies-sold"><u>Street Fighter 6 hit 3 million copies sold back in January</u></a> 2024, seven months after launch. Capcom has said Street Fighter 6 is “generally progressing in line with our expectations,” but before launch it revealed it had aimed for the sequel to outsell Street Fighter 5, targeting over 10 million copies sold over the course of its lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we do not communicate specific figures for internal budgets, we look to outperform the title’s predecessor, Street Fighter 5, and are aiming for more than 10 million units over the life of the title,” Capcom said. Street Fighter 6, then, still has a long way to go before it beats Street Fighter 5’s sales total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put Street Fighter 6’s sales into context, 1993 SNES hit Street Fighter 2 Turbo sold 4.1 million copies, the seminal Street Fighter 2 sold 6.30 million, and Street Fighter 5 has sold 7.8 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another interesting comparison is with fighting game rival <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1"><u>Mortal Kombat 1</u></a>, which has also sold 5 million copies since going on sale in September 2023. Mortal Kombat is typically the best-selling fighting game franchise, outselling the likes of Street Fighter and Tekken by some margin. But Mortal Kombat 1 is seen as a sales disappointment, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-mortal-kombat-1-wont-get-any-more-dlc-characters-or-story-chapters-as-netherrealm-needs-to-shift-focus-to-the-next-project">developer NetherRealm recently confirmed it had left it behind to work on its next project</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom, meanhwile, continues to support Street Fighter 6 into its third year, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-confirms-year-3-roster-for-street-fighter-6">recently announced a set of four brand new DLC characters</a>: Sagat is out this summer; C. Viper this fall; Alex early spring 2026; and finally, Ingrid late spring 2026. The announcement was made in a trailer starring pro wrestler Kenny Omega, who dressed up as each DLC character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-review">Street Fighter 6 review</a> returned a 9/10. We said: "Street Fighter 6 is the most feature-rich a Street Fighter has ever been at launch, but even beyond that, it's roster of 18 characters is excellent, the new mechanics revitalize the one-on-one fighting formula, and it absolutely nails all of the little things that make for a stellar fighting game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

I just think the game should speak for itself on June the 10th."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Physical copies of MindsEye also needed a “major” update for “key improvements to ensure MindsEye plays as we intended and to meet all the characters at their best.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And just days before MindsEye’s launch, Build a Rocket Boy’s Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>confirmed they had left the company</u></a>, sparking concern from the studio’s fledgling community.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam concurrents do not tell the whole story, of course. MindsEye launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S as well as PC, so its true concurrent player count will be higher than that reported on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye carries a $59.99 price tag. At launch, there is a “tightly crafted linear story campaign,” and what’s called “single-player free roam,” but there are also a number of missions: a horde mode mission called “Destruction Site Shootout,” and two combat missions (“Honor Amongst Thieves” and “Friendly Fire”). Also at launch are six races, six checkpoint races, and three drone races. If you get the premium pass, you get an extra horde mode mission and an exotic cosmetics pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following launch, Build A Rocket Boy said it will deliver a “constant stream” of fresh premium content monthly, “ensuring MindsEye is a living, ever-expanding player experience.” This includes new missions, challenges, and game assets. “The continuous stream of studio-developed content, combined with the very best of the community’s own beautiful creations, means that MindsEye will continue to surprise and delight its players for decades to come,” Build A Rocket Boy added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy also confirmed its 2025 roadmap of content. In the summer there will be community updates, new missions, in the fall new single-player modes, multiplayer, and new missions, and in the winter free roam updates and new missions. Premium pass owners get extra missions and new packs throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

When asked if this perhaps signalled the whole studio would be shut down in the near future, Schreier noted it's "unlikely" they'd have laid off 40 staff if management weren't fighting to keep it afloat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cuts come just months after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony canceled two unannounced live-service games that were in development at Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games</u></a>.

For the uninitiated, the Horus Heresy is the Space Marine civil war that took place 10,000 years before the current Warhammer 40,000 setting. It is the foundation of 40K’s grimdark universe, and reveals how the carrion Emperor ended up on the Golden Throne.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege of Terra: End of Ruin is a hugely exciting release for 40K lore fans (the standard edition is available to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgGjJ?object_uuid=741aa9ae-3a67-4217-a1c4-bdda8e62b07f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder on Amazon</a>), but its special edition is even more enticing. It features a leather-effect cover with gold foil details, gilt page edges, and a metal emblem of a ruined Imperial eagle.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/preorders-jun07-bl-01-eraofruinltd-nkuyovjdyk-1749632718756.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The special edition of Siege of Terra: End of Ruin. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop had signaled the special edition would be available “strictly while stocks last,” and that it would go on sale at 10am UK time on June 10. It also told fans it planned to use a queue system “to ensure fair distribution.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this queue system caused chaos, with fans desperate to pre-order the book unable to make progress. Amid frantic messages of complaint across social media, Discords, and subreddits, Warhammer.com suddenly… stopped. It was offline, and no-one knew why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anger grew as those who had carved out time to be there for the pre-order launch were left empty handed. Eventually, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WarhammerOfficial/posts/pfbid0NGLkvUafYjdsmFoK6n22Am1hjz3pYwiHczUHdvvT6dXDcF6TPqwzifqyMb2FudFBl?locale=en_GB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Games Workshop issued a statement</a> on the debacle — a rare event in of itself — to say it had brought Warhammer.com offline because it had noticed scalpers were bypassing its systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Scalpers attempted to use bots to bypass our normal safeguards,” Games Workshop said. “Our eagle-eyed Tech Priests caught this happening in real-time, so we pulled Warhammer.com offline.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/60040181337-blsiegeofterraeraofruin-1749632804963.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Siege of Terra: Era of Ruin hardback remains available. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is that the special edition of Siege of Terra: End of Ruin is currently unavailable on Warhammer.com. In its place is a page asking for an email for a notification. Games Workshop said the special edition is still coming, “we’re just absolutely determined that real fans get it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All erroneous orders are being purged,” Games Workshop continued. “This is our number one priority. Please forgive us for a delay as we sort it all out.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/gw-1749633025785.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Games Workshop's statement. Image credit: Games Workshop / Facebook.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement has gone some way to calm angry fans who had hoped for a smoother launch of the special edition. Some are calling Games Workshop’s actions here a “small victory” over the scalpers, although there is a healthy dose of skepticism about the company’s efforts to truly combat the bots. Some suggest Games Workshop to use a raffle system, as other companies do for their high-profile products, or, even better, force interested customers to pass a Horus Heresy test to prove their worth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, Games Workshop has suffered pre-order problems for years now, and special edition book launches are often plagued by scalpers who go on to sell the products at hugely inflated prices. All eyes are on Games Workshop to see how it handles pre-orders for the Siege of Terra: End of Ruin special edition when they’re eventually re-launched.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s remember that Games Workshop is no minnow. In fact, the Nottingham, UK company is doing so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-maker-games-workshop-is-doing-so-well-its-giving-27-million-to-its-staff">it’s handing out £20 million (approx. $27 million) to its staff as a bonus</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop’s main business is the sale of miniatures fans assemble and paint for use in tabletop wargames, such as Warhammer 40,000. But it is increasingly an IP business, with huge revenue from smash hit video games such as last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii"><u>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</u></a>, and animations, such as Amazon’s Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level episode. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years"><u>Games Workshop and Amazon recently finalized a deal for Henry Cavill's Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe</u></a>, which will involve the creation of films and television series. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-iii"><u>Space Marine 3 is also in development.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
