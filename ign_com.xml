Both the standard console and the Mario Kart World Bundle are back up for order (while supplies last), giving anyone who missed out at launch a rare shot to pick one up at retail price. Target’s listings aren’t behind a waitlist like Amazon’s invitation system either. Over in the world of Pokémon, the Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box has dropped to $102.94 on Amazon, undercutting TCGPlayer’s listing by over $10. That’s a solid deal in the middle of Pokémania 2025, especially for sealed collectors or someone who needs that Illustration Rare Team Rocket’s Wobbuffet promo.</p><div catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca" id="225564"><div id="225564" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Students and Teachers Can Save 57% Off the Adobe Creative Cloud Pro Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The Creative Cloud Pro bundle includes 20+ apps, including Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Premiere Pro, and more for just $29.99 per month (normally $69.99).</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out today's best offers, collectors can lock in a preorder for the Tamashii Nations Cyclops S.H.Figuarts figure at $100, complete with multiple optic blast effects and poseable parts straight from the GAMERVERSE. Small Soldiers fans can relive ‘90s chaos with the new 4K Steelbook edition for $25.99, while Firefly diehards get a definitive version of Serenity in its 20th Anniversary 4K Steelbook for $29.96, loaded with extras. And if you're tired of throwing money at canned air, the RELIDOL 100000RPM Electric Air Duster is just $27.99 today, offering powerful cordless cleaning that pays for itself fast.</p></div><p id="destined-rivals-elite-trainer-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box">Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225515"><div id="225515" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now down to $102.94, beating TCG Players' price of $114.99 plus postage.

Not only is the Black Bolt ETB vastly undercutting the secondary market, Paradox Rift ETB is even cheaper (And an overlooked set in my opinion, stock up now). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's other great deals on ex boxes too, which are also near MSRP and around the same or just under listings on TCG Player.

As predicted, Nintendo Switch 2's launch window is seeing stock shortages. If you didn't preorder at launch, you've probably been waiting for stock drops since launch.</p></div><div catalogid="e7c6732a-ef4d-47d3-8a5e-d382139346bf" id="225578"><div id="225578" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Switch 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon currently has it's invitation system in place for both the standard console SKU and the Mario Kart world bundle, so it's always worth getting on the waiting list whilst you wait.

Directed by Joss Whedon and starring Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, and Summer Glau.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">The Legend of Zelda Hardcover Book Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly every The Legend of Zelda hardcover book you need for your collection is available in this sale with some cracking discounts. It includes my favorite one,  Hyrule Historia, that fills in more than a few gaps in the LoZ lore, although the timeline has already been slightly retconned. It also includes full and expanded official guides for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">KRK Kreate Powered Studio Monitors</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can personally guarantee a set of powered studio monitors will sound better than almost any sound system with or without a subwoofer. The new line of KRK Kreate studio monitors aren't just for recording music (Although they'd do an amazing job), they're a versatile sound option for content creation, editing, gaming, watching TV and movies and more. Buyers can even teather to them via Bluetooth for no fuss connections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been using the 8-inch speaker models for a couple of weeks now, and they destory my soundbar and subwoofer combo that cost's nearly double the price of these. There's precision adjustments knobs on the back, which I keep mostly in neutral with volume up by half for a crisp flat sound with the right amount of bass. Although that can be cranked up when needed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally I use an audio splitter so my Krate 8s can handle my Nano QuadCortex guitar amp moddler, my TV audio and gaming PC audio for the best experience. For me, going from a 3-inch to 8-inch speaker option is night and day. The clarity difference and range is top-tier, not to mention the jack, XLR and aux outputs available on each monitor that fits in perfectly in everyone's setup. You're getting top-of-the-range brand quality without the "gaming" brand tax, it's a win-win.</p><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2">Apple AirPods Pro 2</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225530"><div id="225530" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features. At $199, they offer a strong balance of value and performance. The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="iniu-portable-charger-10000mah-45w"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W">INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225531"><div id="225531" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is ideal for carrying around when you've forgot to stick your phone on charge overnight, 45W is more than enough power to charge anything whilst using it, from phones to Nintendo Switch 2. So who can argue for $12?</p></div><p id="donkey-kong-bananza"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Donkey Kong Bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225532"><div id="225532" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you own a Switch 2 and not Donkey Kong Bananza, there's something a-miss. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">We've given it a rare 10/10,</a> and is officially Nintendo's latest handheld's first killer app and system seller.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We anticipate losing up to 36 of our colleagues."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Supermassive Games, developer of Until Dawn and the Dark Pictures Anthology horror series, has said it will lay off up to 36 staff in a fresh wave of redundancies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> published to the studio's social media this afternoon, Supermassive also confirmed a delay to its long-awaited sci-fi horror project <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/directive-8020-a-dark-pictures-games">Directive 8020</a>, which will now arrive in "the first half of 2026".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announcing the studio's job losses, Supermassive said it had been forced to adapt its team structure to "better align" with "a challenging and ever-evolving environment" in which to make games. The cuts follow an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-developer-supermassive-games-plans-to-lay-off-around-90-workers">earlier round of redundancies in March 2024</a>, when the developer said it would shed around 90 workers in a similarly-worded statement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Supermassive previously stated it had around 350 employees as of 2023, meaning it has laid off around a third of the studio over the past 18 months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We remain focused on our upcoming projects and have made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026," Supermassive said. "The response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans. We're deeply grateful for the patience and support of our community."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A standalone entry in Supermassive's Dark Pictures Anthology, Directive 8020 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/supermassive-6-more-dark-pictures-anthology-games-planned">one of a list of apparently-upcoming entries in the series</a> spotted back in early 2022. The game was then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-and-the-quarry-developers-next-game-is-a-sci-fi-horror">made official later that year</a>, in a trailer included at the end of The Dark Pictures: The Devil In Me. Three years on, however, and fans are still waiting to play it.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A statement from Supermassive Games. <a href="https://t.co/Vom1CSGYGs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Vom1CSGYGs</a></p>— Supermassive Games (@SuperMGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Pictures Anthology kicked off in 2019 with spooky boat mystery Man of Medan, before 2020 historical horror Little Hope, and then 2021's Iraq-set House of Ashes. Next up was the murder hotel-inspired The Devil in Me in 2022, before then the virtual reality spin-off Switchback VR a year later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, progress on further entries in the series appears to have slowed, with Directive 8020 now set to arrive at least three years after the franchise's previous entry, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/directive-8020-might-give-the-dark-pictures-saga-a-massive-upgrade">positioned as a more standalone title</a>. Supermassive has said it has used the extra time to improve the franchise's gameplay, though links to previous games — such as via the mysterious recurring character of the Curator — sound like they'll be played down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, Supermassive will continue working on its delayed Little Nightmares 3, currently set to launch on October 10. Development on this project is unaffected by today's layoffs, the studio has confirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Time to reopen the Bureau.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Pokémon Presents, we saw a ton of new footage of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, including a brand new Mega Evolution. But for lore nerds, what was far more interesting was the official, confirmed appearance of a very popular character from our adventure in Pokémon X and Y. And yes, I'm going to spoil it for you below this video, so don't keep scrolling if you don't want to know.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you watched today's trailer, you'll know this isn't much of a spoiler: Emma, from Pokémon X and Y, is officially confirmed for Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Emma <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-frantically-trying-to-work-out-how-pokemon-legends-z-a-connects-to-other-pokemon-games">has been a part of fan speculation</a> ever since the game was announced, and theories about her presence in Z-A have only multiplied over time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some context, Emma is a young girl in X and Y who is adopted and trained by Looker, a detective in Lumiose City who's become a fan-favorite character after multiple game appearances. At the end of X and Y, Looker effectively hands over the keys to his Looker Bureau to Emma. We've already seen that the Bureau appears in this futuristic Lumiose, so it makes sense that Emma would be running it. What's more, her design suggests she's still running around the city as the crime-fighting Essentia, based on the outfit under her jacket.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— 【公式】ポケモン情報局 (@poke_times) <a href="https://twitter.com/poke_times/status/1947648245611536839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Emma's presence does beg some questions. When exactly is Pokémon Legends: Z-A set? We don't know! Emma is definitely older in her Z-A appearance, but probably not so much older that there would have had time to essentially rebuild Lumiose from the ground up, from its X and Y aesthetic to the futuristic city appearing in Z-A. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Have there been time-traveling shenanigans? Is this Emma's daughter, also named Emma? Probably not that second one. Maybe the denizens of the Kalos region are just really, really fast at building cities.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="de" dir="ltr">Serebii Update: Official artwork for Emma &amp; Mable in Pokémon Legends Z-A <a href="https://t.co/NWlAdn57aQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/NWlAdn57aQ</a> <a href="https://t.co/zsdP9u36Dw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zsdP9u36Dw</a></p>— Serebii.net (@SerebiiNet) <a href="https://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/1947648427816308992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's also worth pointing out here that another familiar face from X and Y appeared during today's trailer, albeit one that's maybe a little less instantly recognizable. If you spotted Mable, the new director of the Pokémon Research Lab, you might have recognized that she's a former member of Team Flare. She's uh, not exactly the most moral of people in X and Y, so it will be interesting to see if she's reformed since then or if there's something unsavory going on at the research lab.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were other reveals during today's trailer, including brand new characters like Naveen, Lida, and either Urbain or Taunie. We also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mega-pokmon-species-revealed-for-pokmon-legends-z-a">saw a brand new Mega Evolution, Mega Dragonite</a>. Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming to Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 16, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything shown <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-presents-july-2025-everything-announced">during today's Pokemon Presents right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
