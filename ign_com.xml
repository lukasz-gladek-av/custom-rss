Yesterday (September 1), however, it was resurrected to bring us up to speed on what's happening in Rayman's world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rayman turns 30! Join us on our official channels to celebrate an incredible legacy," the account exclaimed, attaching a brief video. In the video, brand producer Loic Gounon â€” who has been working on the Rayman franchise since 2006 â€” revealed that "a very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working together on the future of Rayman."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>ðŸ‘Š ðŸŽ‰Rayman turns 30!

And now, to mark 30 years, Ubisoft is "taking a moment to celebrate this incredible history by looking back," sharing behind the scenes, anecdotes, developer interviews, concept art, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what's to come? We haven't had a mainline Rayman game since 2013's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/rayman-legends">Rayman Legends</a>. "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working together on the future of Rayman," Ubisoft said.

Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E. was barely advertised or given the kind of showy spotlight reserved for major releases, quite possibly because it was a Web 3 game that uses cryptocurrency and blockchain. A top-down multiplayer shooter available on PC, it featured a number of Ubisoft characters, including Rayman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
