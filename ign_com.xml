            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-skins-revealed-including-a-shark-a-raccoon-and-a-parasite-warrior<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">G'Day Bait, Cash Bandit, and more arrive soon.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Treyarch has pulled back the curtain on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s Season 1 battle pass and a number of Operator bundles, revealing a wardrobe of skins that includes highlights like a shark, a racoon, and one outfit that looks…unpleasant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A full breakdown for the upcoming first season of content was revealed in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-blackcell-bp-bundles-zombies-announcement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on the Call of Duty website</u></a>. It comes with everything you could ever want to know about Black Ops 6 Season 1, including an updated battle pass system that has its own weapons and skins to unlock as well as first details about what comes with a BlackCell upgrade. Operator Sev serves as the mascot for this introductory content rollout, but the real eye-catching skins won’t be found in that standard battle pass.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/12/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-operator-bundles-1731438152690.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 comes with a few strange Operator bundles.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s Black Ops 6 post hides a few cosmetics that will no doubt have heads spinning across Multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone throughout Season 1. While some will surely spend their hard-earned COD Points on more tame offerings like the new Call of Duty League bundle and Cascade Failure tracer pack, others will be drawn to, for example, Carver’s Bloke Biter Ultra Skin. The outfit suits your Operator up as a great white shark, fit with gills, a dorsal fin, and a few rows of pointy teeth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The G’Day Bait tracer pack also comes with more goodies in the form of ocean-themed builds for the XMG LMG and KSV SMG, as well as a collection of bloody cosmetics, including an emote, weapon charm, decal, spray, and calling card. The Cash Bandit bundle, meanwhile, will let Niran scavenge the battlefield as a racoon with the Debt Collector reactive weapon skin, the Vault Security GPR 91 assault rifle blueprint, and more.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/12/parasite-warrior-1731439839950.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Black Ops 6's Parasite Warrior skin is downright unpleasant. Image source: Black Ops 6.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These are two animal bundles that add a layer of goofiness to Black Ops 6, but Carver’s new Parasite Warrior bundle adds a hint of horror thanks to a grotesque design that sees your Operator wearing a parasite that looks like it was ripped straight out of Alien. There’s also the Kick Some Brass bundle, which includes what looks like a steampunk version of a Killzone Helghast soldier, and the Eternal Hunter bundle, which gives Rossi a vampire look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty usually waits for later seasons to start pulling out the more creative Operator bundles, but Black Ops 6 looks like it wants to make an impression sooner rather than later. This year’s Call of Duty entry came out swinging when it launched on October 25. Although it’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-nerf-a-perk-so-overpowered-some-call-it-a-wallhack"><u>not been without its hiccups</u></a>, players have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-dev-says-game-pass-helped-convince-people-who-were-on-the-fence-to-try-the-game-but-now-the-challenge-is-to-convince-them-to-stick-around"><u>largely taken to its fresh takes on classic game modes so far</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 to launch on November 14, you can check out our reviews for its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review"><u>Campaign</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review"><u>Multiplayer</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-review"><u>Zombies</u></a> modes.
