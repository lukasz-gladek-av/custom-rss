            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-league-of-legends-tcg-riftbound-has-posted-explosive-early-growth-since-launch-with-searches-surging-over-300">League of Legends trading card game</a> Riftbound's second set, titled Spiritforged, was released in the US on February 13. The newest expansion has been out in China for a couple of months now, and in the west for just over a week, sowe've seen a general picture of how the new cards are impacting the metagame thanks to two recent Regional Qualifiers in Fuzhou and Chengdu. With that being said, these are some of the best Spiritforged cards I think you should look into picking up now that the set is finally available.</p><p id="blood-money"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Blood Money">10. Blood Money</h2></p><div id="234747"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234747" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blood Money</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At uncommon, this card is relatively easy to pick up at an affordable price as a single. This is a super cheap and efficient early removal spell to help you stay on tempo, and you'd be hard pressed to see Yellow decks like Viktor, Herald of the Arcane not running three copies. </p></div><p id="card-sharp"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Card Sharp">9. Card Sharp</h2></p><div id="234748"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234748" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Card Sharp</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Card Sharp is pretty versatile. There are a few Power hungry decks with Spiritforged, so being able to offset some of that cost with the Gold generated from Card Sharp and pressure with a 3 MIght body is worth considering. </p></div><p id="not-so-fast"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Not So Fast">8. Not So Fast</h2></p><div id="234749"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234749" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Not So Fast</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to the <a href="https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/rules-and-releases/riftbound-spiritforged-faq/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent errata to refexive triggers</a>, nerfing cards like <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/653046/riftbound-league-of-legends-trading-card-game-origins-icathian-rain" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Icathian Rain</a>, Not So Fast got significantly better. Before, you'd only be able to counter just one instance of damage, but now you can just counter the entire spell with Not So Fast. Definitely keep this card on your radar if you like Green decks. </p></div><p id="bellows-breath"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bellows Breath">7. Bellows Breath</h2></p><div id="234750"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234750" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bellows Breath</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Repeat mechanic offers a more dynamic way to interact with opponents. Bellows Breath is one of these, being able to clear a Battlefield of smaller units in the early game. </p></div><p id="trinity-force"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Trinity Force">6. Trinity Force</h2></p><div id="234751"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234751" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Trinity Force</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorite new equipments from the set, Trinity Force is one of the few cards that allow you to store extra points. I can see this making waves in Master Yi, Wuju Bladesman, as his Legend ability buffs defending units. In the Origins meta, the deck was great at holding to score points, and looks to be the same situation with Spiritforged. </p></div><p id="piercing-light"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Piercing Light">5. Piercing Light</h2></p><div id="234752"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234752" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Piercing Light</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Bellows Breath, this can be an early game removal spell for tempo, or an easy two-for-one later on. Kai'Sa, Daughter of the Void typically ran two to three copies of <a href="https://zdcs.link/z64yqj?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Falling Star</a>, so I can see this finding a home in that deck too. </p></div><p id="ferrous-forerunner"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Ferrous Forerunner">4. Ferrous Forerunner</h2></p><div id="234753"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234753" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ferrous Forerunner</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ferrous Forerunner is a big body that continues to pressure your opponent even after it dies. Doing its best <a href="https://zdcs.link/aA85lL?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wurmcoil Engine</a> impression, this guy will spit out two 3 Might Mech tokens upon death, allowing you to maintain your board presence. </p></div><p id="called-shot"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Called Shot">3. Called Shot</h2></p><div id="234754"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234754" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Called Shot</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if Called Shot had 1 Energy cost, I would consider extremely powerful. At 0 Energy <em>and </em>sporting the Repeat mechanic has convinced me it's the best draw and filter spell in the game. With a ton of ways to generate Gold tokens to help pay Power costs, this card is positioned to be seen in every Purple deck. </p></div><p id="guardian-angel"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Guardian Angel">2. Guardian Angel</h2></p><div id="234755"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234755" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Guardian Angel</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Guardian Angel is essentially copies four through 6 of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLpyVX?object_uuid=9f03421a-f93c-43ce-a309-393e5d0daab0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zhonya's Hourlgass</a>, which has the same effect. This, however, is an equipment, so it comes with a +1 Might buff and costs a Power to equip to a unit. Master Yi,  Wuju Bladesman is still poised to be a contender with Spiritforged, and this card is one reason for that. </p></div><p id="ezrea-prodigy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Ezrea, Prodigy">1. Ezreal, Prodigy</h2></p><div id="234756"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234756" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ezreal, Prodigy</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While Draven, Glorious Executioner is easily the strongest deck in the Spiritforged meta, many lists are playing Ezreal, Prodigy, which is the best card in the set for my money. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purple is undoubtedly very strong, and Ezreal's effect allows you to filter through your deck and a lot cards early, and fits into a few other archetypes nicely. </p></div><p id="where-to-buy-spiritforged"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to Buy Spiritforged">Where to Buy Riftbound: Spiritforged</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you prefer the rush of cracking packs hoping to pull your favorite chase cards, below are the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/league-of-legends-riftbound-tcg-spiritforged-where-to-buy-2026">Spiritforged sealed products available for purchase</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Origins before it, the second set is already sold out on Riot's online storefront, but you can order through TCGplayer at pretty high markups if you're desperate to secure the goods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Violent weather is about to hit the Rust Belt, as developer Embark Studios has revealed a first look at the new Hurricane map condition coming to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio pulled back the curtain on Shrouded Sky, its next major content update, with <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on its website</u></a>. It comes with a sneak peek at how hurricanes will tear through maps like Spaceport, promising what already looks like the most dangerous weather the southern Italy-set video game has faced yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Powerful Electromagnetic Storms and wintery Cold Snap conditions have had players seeking shelter before, but Embark says Arc Raiders hasn’t seen anything quite like this. Starting with the launch of Shrouded Sky February 24, Raiders may be subjected to strong winds that will have them rethinking how they approach PvP and PvE.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Searching for topside resources and blueprints during a hurricane will have players fighting both with and against the wind. Running with the storm could provide a small speed boost, for example, but running against it will result in slowed movement and drained stamina. Raiders can also expect everything from gas grenades to trailblazers and other throwables to behave differently when winds pick up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One look at the trailer makes it clear visibility will be low during a hurricane, but Embark says Arc Raiders players will want to be wary of debris, too. However, like with most other map conditions, the increased threat level means more opportunities to find better loot, with today’s post teasing Raider Caches and relics of the First Wave for those who brave the storm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shrouded Sky is Embark’s major update for February and follows the January <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-big-arc-raiders-update-of-2026-adds-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-bird-city-and-more-tomorrow"><u>Headwinds update</u></a>. While that relatively small content drop added a solo vs. squads queue option and the Bird City map condition, Shrouded Sky is said to come packed with a Raider Deck and map update, as well as a new Arc threat, which we may have gotten a small glimpse of toward the end of today's trailer. Players can also expect to reset their ranks once again with the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-outlines-expedition-changes-after-players-criticized-steep-reward-requirements"><u>the next Expedition</u></a> the following day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026"><u>Arc Raiders roadmap</u></a> also promised the Flashpoint update for March and Riven Tides for April.

Alongside the promise to bring a host of new features to Early Access players on Steam in just a few weeks, the footage comes mixed with a stylish animation that almost looks like it could stand alone as its own TV show.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the trailer’s silent hero falls in battle, we see others come to their aid, revealing that players won’t have to fight through Slay the Spire 2’s dark fantasy world alone. Gameplay featured in the footage highlights combat encounters for up to four players, with Mega Crit explaining in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2868840/view/538879349212840702?l=english" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post on Steam</u></a> that the multiplayer mode will feature its own specific cards and team synergies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Early Access is said to come with new cards, characters, events, relics, potions, abilities, alternate acts, and more, today’s trailer shows off how some of these new mechanics will offer chaotic twists on the original formula. The footage also teases an additional new character to look forward to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For 1,000 years, the Spire lay dormant, its secrets buried and its horrors forgotten,” an official description for Slay the Spire 2 says. “Now, it has reopened, hungrier and more dangerous than ever, devouring all who dare to ascend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“New perils demand sharper strategies, relentless cunning, and unwavering resolve.
