But that‚Äôs exactly what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> fans are excited to uncover with the release of guest character Conan the Barbarian this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let‚Äôs back up for a bit. Mortal Kombat is perhaps most famous for its various ninjas. Everyone knows Sub-Zero is blue and Scorpion is yellow. Ermac is red and Rain is purple (you see what they did there?). But there's no pink ninja, which is where Pink Floyd come in. Floyd is the name given to a rumored pink ninja supposedly buried within the bowels of Mortal Kombat 1, just waiting to be discovered. NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon has teased fans on multiple occasions by referencing a pink ninja called Floyd, and, back in 2023, <a href="https://x.com/thethiny/status/1706734341982687374" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mortal Kombat dataminer TheThiny</a> unearthed text in the Mortal Kombat 1 files that referenced a character called Floyd.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes. I honestly want to make a PINK ninja and name him FLOYD. No kidding.</p>‚Äî Ed Boon (@noobde) <a href="https://twitter.com/noobde/status/1577123361498759168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, it looks like Floyd may finally become a reality inside Mortal Kombat 1. Recently released gameplay showing off Conan the Barbarian includes a blink-and-you‚Äôll-miss-it 'Floyd' pop up in pink text displayed on the left of the screen. Bemused fighting game YouTuber Super, whose <a href="https://youtu.be/-pvxw2aRT9o?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early access Conan gameplay</a> contained the Floyd name, took to social media to express their excitement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Listen closely and you‚Äôll hear a guitar riff play alongside the Floyd pop-up during the Conan victory cutscene. Super had no idea how they activated it and couldn‚Äôt replicate it, but Mortal Kombat 1 fans are determined to get to the bottom of this mystery as soon as Conan comes out tomorrow.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The secret floyd fight in MK1 is coming with conan. I somehow activated it but didn't actually go into the match. I tried to get it again but was not successful. </p><p>Watch the full early access conan video here <a href="https://t.co/WpKeQFKB5C" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/WpKeQFKB5C</a> <a href="https://t.co/LqfFOyK2ZL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LqfFOyK2ZL</a></p></div>‚Äî Super (@lSuper_) <a href="https://twitter.com/lSuper_/status/1880317510081536378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it‚Äôs quite possible there <em>is </em>no secret Pink Floyd fight to activate, and this Floyd tease is just that: a tease. Boon is known for trolling Mortal Kombat fans, and the series is packed with pop culture references and in-jokes that go nowhere. You‚Äôd expect dataminers like TheThiny will work it if anything related to Floyd has changed when the Conan update kicks in, but players will still have to discover the activation, if it even exists.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">More details about the secret Floyd Fight:<br>The Floyd Easter egg triggers randomly at any stage. Once the icon pops up it plays a Guitar Riff (Pink Floyd reference?).<br>I believe you have to do a certain action / challenge at that time.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MK1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MK1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat1</a> <a href="https://t.co/bFGzCcbWp3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bFGzCcbWp3</a></p>‚Äî thethiny üê∞üçâ (@thethiny) <a href="https://twitter.com/thethiny/status/1880448153931116719?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Conan the Barbarian, due out January 21 as part of the standard DLC early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners before wide availability a week later, features the likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who famously played Conan in the cult classic 1982 film, but does not feature his voice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 Terminator is the final DLC character added to the gory fighting game as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and the aforementioned Conan the Barbarian. NetherRealm is yet to announce a third set of DLc characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://x.com/lSuper_/status/1880317510081536378" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Super / X</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-will-let-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-ranked-console-players-disable-crossplay-with-pc-as-cheating-complaints-ramp-up<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has addressed Call of Duty community complaints about cheating in Black Ops 6 and Warzone, and confirmed plans to let console Ranked players disable crossplay with PC players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cheating has become the hottest topic among hardcore Call of Duty fans following the release of Ranked Play in Black Ops 6 and Warzone with the launch of Season 1 last year. The apparent prevalence of cheaters is considered by some to be ruining competitive multiplayer, and Activision had come under fire for failing to address the problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Activision‚Äôs Team Ricochet, the division responsible for its Call of Duty anti-cheat tech, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-admits-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-anti-cheat-did-not-hit-the-mark-at-the-launch-of-season-1">admitted not enough had been done to prevent cheating with the launch of Season 1</a>. ‚ÄúAfter a series of updates our systems are in a better place today across all modes; however, we did not hit the mark for the integration of Ricochet Anti-Cheat at the launch of Season 01 ‚Äî particularly for Ranked Play,‚Äù Activision said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-community-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new blog post</a>, Activision outlined its plan to tackle cheating in Call of Duty in 2025, revealing it had issued over 136,000 Ranked Play account bans since the mode launched. Season 2, which begins soon, includes new and improved client and server-side detections and systems as well as a major kernel-level driver update, Activision said. The company promised ‚Äúa multitude of new tech‚Äù for Season 3 and beyond, including a brand-new system to authenticate legit players and target cheaters. It didn‚Äôt want to go into detail on that now, however, so as not to give cheat developers ‚Äúa peek behind the curtain.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, with the launch of Season 2, Activision will enable the ability to disable crossplay for console players who want to compete only against other console players in Black Ops 6 and Warzone Ranked Play. It is believed that the majority of cheating in video games is on the PC side, and indeed Call of Duty players on console have for years now disabled crossplay as a matter of course for standard Multiplayer. Now, Ranked players will get the chance, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe'll be monitoring closely and will consider further changes to prioritize the integrity of the ecosystem, and we‚Äôll have more details to share as we get closer to the launch of this feature,‚Äù Activision said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most Activision anti-cheat updates are met with a healthy dose of scepticism from hardcore fans, and this latest one is no different. Cheating is not unique to Call of Duty of course, but it has become a significant reputation issue for Activision ever since the free-to-download battle royale Warzone exploded in popularity back in 2020. The mega publisher has spent millions of dollars developing its anti-cheat technology as well as pursuing cheat makers in the courts, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October, ahead of the launch of Black Ops 6, Activision said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-it-wants-to-catch-and-remove-call-of-duty-cheaters-within-1-hour-of-them-being-in-their-first-match"><u>it aimed to kick cheaters out of the game within one hour of them being in their first match</u></a>. Black Ops 6 launched with an updated version of Ricochet's kernel-level driver (this also applied to Warzone), with new machine-learning behavioral systems focused on speed of detection and the analysis of gameplay to combat aim bots in place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The people behind cheats are organized, illegal groups that pick apart every piece of data within our games to look for some way to make cheating possible," Activision said at the time. "These bad guys are not just some script kiddies poking around with code they found online. They are a collective who profit from exploiting the hard work of game developers across the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But cheat developers are flawed (clearly ‚Äî they have to pretend to be good at video games). Every time they cheat, they leave breadcrumbs behind. We‚Äôre always looking for those breadcrumbs to find the bad actors and get them out of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
