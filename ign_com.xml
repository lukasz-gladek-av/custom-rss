It's the largest all-cash sponsor take-private investment in history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Under the terms of the agreement, the group will acquire 100% of EA, with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company. EA stockholders will receive $210 per share in cash. The per share purchase price represents a 25% premium to EA’s unaffected share price of $168.32 at market close on September 25, 2025, and a premium to EA’s unaffected all-time high of $179.01 at market close on August 14, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the close of the transaction, EA’s common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/gettyimages-970613584-1759148343537.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">EA boss Andrew Wilson will remain in charge of the company.

This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA will continue to be led by Wilson and will remain headquartered in Redwood City, California. The transaction is expected to close in Q1 FY27, subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The transaction will be funded by a combination of cash from each of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners, the latter of which is an American investment firm based in Miami, Florida, and formed in 2021 by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combined, the deal is for an equity investment of approximately $36 billion, and $20 billion of debt financing fully and solely committed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., $18 billion of which is expected to be funded at close. Each of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners plan to fund the equity component of the financing entirely from capital under their respective control, the companies said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The enormous sale comes just days before EA releases Battlefield 6, a crucial launch for the company, and hot on the heels of FC 26 and Skate. EA games in development include Mass Effect at BioWare, Star Wars Jedi 3 at Respawn, and Iron Man at Motive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Patrick T.

I wrote the last 10 or 11 of them, [so] I think the world probably had enough GTA from me," Houser said in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ign-in-conversation-with-dan-houser-at-la-comic-con-2025"><u>an exclusive interview with IGN</u></a> on Saturday, September 27, at LA Comic Con. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's not going to be a story that I wrote or a character set that I developed. I think it's going to be exciting. The game will be great, I'm sure."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dan Houser also wrote <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2"><u>Red Dead Redemption 2</u></a>, and in the same interview, he told IGN that "Red Dead 2, I think, was the best thing that I worked on. [It's] the best single kind of realization of open-world storytelling thematic consistency, and understanding how the games are assembled to take you on an emotional journey."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I also think <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-iv">GTA 4</a> [is one of his favorite games]," he added, "because we did try and evolve how we did the storytelling and did it in a fundamental way. I think the middle section of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v"><u>GTA 5</u></a> is amazing. When we got the three characters working… I think it was not flawless, but it was so smooth, that middle section. I thought that was really amazing. And then the end of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption"><u>Red Dead 1</u></a>. Those are my favorite bits."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-just-cant-do-all-the-projects-you-want-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-says-bully-2-didnt-happen-due-to-bandwidth-issues"><u>Houser also recently explained why we never got</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bully-2"><u>Bully 2</u></a>, chalking the issue up to "bandwidth issues." "You know, if you've got a small lead creative team, and a small senior leadership crew, you just can't do all the projects you want," he admitted.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-development-began-in-earnest-in-2020-following-the-massive-success-of-red-dead-redemption-2-take-two-says">Development of GTA 6 began “in earnest” right around the time Houser left in 2020</a> following the success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2"><u>Red Dead Redemption 2</u></a>. It was originally slated to release in 2025, but suffered a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026"><u>high-profile delay from fall 2025 to May 26, 2026</u></a>. In a statement issued at the time, Rockstar apologized for the significant delay, saying: "We are very sorry that this is later than you expected."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Houser is currently at Absurd Ventures, the company he started up after leaving Rockstar. His new crime fiction comic series, American Caper, will be released on November 12, 2025, with the first arc comprising 12 issues. While we don't yet know what games the team is working on, we do know that last September, a group of around 20 developers formerly of Ascendant Studios — including its former CEO — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ascendant-studios-fate-uncertain-as-immortals-of-aveum-devs-form-new-studio"><u>joined Houser's Absurd Ventures to form a new studio in San Rafael, California: Absurd Marin</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of GTA 6 Trailer 2 and Rockstar's accompanying info-dump has sparked all sorts of speculation about what to expect from what is sure to be the biggest video game of all time. While we wait to find out, we’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2"><u>all the details we’ve discovered so far</u></a>, a roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-70-brand-new-screenshots-reveal-the-characters-and-places-of-leonida"><u>70 brand new screenshots</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-look-even-better-on-ps5-pro-experts-give-their-verdict"><u>the expert opinion on how GTA 6 will look on PS5 Pro</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One person unaffected by the GTA 6 hype is Grand Theft Auto 5's Trevor. Actor Steven Ogg recently said he feels "absolutely nothing" inside for GTA 6 — even though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-says-gta-6-will-be-the-largest-game-launch-in-history"><u>Rockstar has suggested it will be the biggest video game of all time</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
