            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> players haven‚Äôt decided what their favorite weapons are yet, but they‚Äôve already fallen in love with a new movement tech called ‚Äúladder launching.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To catch you up to speed, the ladder is a gadget available to use with the Assault class in Battlefield Studios and EA‚Äôs latest Battlefield game. It‚Äôs a traversal tool that can be used to reach high-up places, opening up opportunities to gain new vantage points or even sneak up on unsuspecting enemies. The thing is that now, just days after Battlefield 6 launched for PC and consoles, the ladder is also being used for much, much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you‚Äôve even accidentally whipped out the ladder while playing Battlefield 6 multiplayer, you might have noticed that actually mounting it can be a hassle. The bottom of the gadget bumps players around if placed at a certain angle, triggering moments that balance frustration with slapstick humor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some Assault classes in Battlefield 6 have found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o558n3/assault_ladder_is_criminally_underutilized_im/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>practical uses for the tool</u></a>, others are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o4g675/me_when_i_meet_the_ladder_of_repulsion_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>struggling to use it at all</u></a>. However, it‚Äôs a secret, third segment of the community that has pushed things even further by using those wonky physics to catapult themselves around maps.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Ladders might be broken in Battlefield 6 üíÄ <a href="https://t.co/OUnM6Ux1Wd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/OUnM6Ux1Wd</a></p>‚Äî Mokey (@mokeysniper) <a href="https://twitter.com/mokeysniper/status/1977115683839152535?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/mokeysniper/status/1977115683839152535" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>@mokeysniper</u></a> published a video detailing exactly how the ladder launch works, admitting that, while the move is far from a game-breaking exploit, it is quite fun to pull off. All it takes is maneuvering around the gadget at the right angle and speed, causing a chain reaction that sends players careening through the air.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, ladder launching is, mostly, practically useless in Battlefield 6. That said, some players are still finding ways to create entire montages centered around ladder launching.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Took 2 hours to break ladders in BF6 ü™§üé£<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BF6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BF6</a> <a href="https://t.co/13ffncb2GH" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/13ffncb2GH</a></p>‚Äî merkwy (@merkwey) <a href="https://twitter.com/merkwey/status/1977433170334400873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Players probably should get too used to ladder launching in Battlefield 6, though, as David Sirland, lead producer at Battlefield studio DICE, has already confirmed the Battlefield Studios team has <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1977705926476918979" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>plans to deliver a patch in the future</u></a>. Considering the average player will find its bumpy edges more annoying than useful, a patch is probably a good call.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We can likely expect even more ladder launching clips to show up online while the team fixes the Assault ladder. In the meantime, you can see how other players are at least trying to use the ladder, below.
