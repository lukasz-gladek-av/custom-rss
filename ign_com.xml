And now it's topped even that record over the weekend, hitting a concurrent peak of 462,488 players according to Valve's official figures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, November 9, Arc Raiders had a higher concurrent peak than Battlefield 6 (441,035), and placed behind only the eternally popular Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, and PUBG. Of course, Arc Raiders' true concurrent player peak will be higher, given the game is also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, but neither Sony nor Microsoft make their player numbers public.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Arc Raiders tears up Steam's most-played games list, streamer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/us-multiplayer-gamers-are-the-minority-shroud-one-of-the-biggest-streamers-in-the-world-urges-his-followers-to-vote-for-arc-raiders-over-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-game-of-the-year">Shroud has continued to call on his fans</a> to vote for it as Game of the Year 2025 over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><u>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</u></a>, calling multiplayer gamers "the minority" (even though research shows that it's mostly multiplayer games that retain high player counts).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I thought I was only going to play five or six hours of Arc Raiders on launch day before sitting down to write this initial review in progress, but after just a handful of matches, I suddenly couldn’t pull myself away – and before I realized it, I’d been playing for 10 hours," we wrote in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review"><u>IGN's Arc Raiders review-in-progress</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is without question the most hooked I’ve found myself on an extraction shooter (and I’ve played a lot of them), with clean and tense gunplay, a progression system that’s been incredibly satisfying so far, and a loot game that has me sweating over what to put in my backpack and what to leave behind."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
