            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With its unsettling backdrops and detailed worldbuilding, Tormented Souls 2 may <em>look </em>like a contemporary horror game, but don't let that modern dressing fool you. At its core beats the blackened heart of stone-cold classics like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, with all the treats — and tricks — that both endeared me to and enraged me about these formulaic survival horror games when they first gained popularity. Fixed camera angles? Check. Tank controls? Check. Insanely complex puzzles and an even more bizarre story, complete with cheesy dialogue and a manual save system? Check, check, check, and check. It makes Tormented Souls 2 a surprisingly faithful homage, bringing back all the stuff I loved about old survival horror games… as well as many of the things I loved to hate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tormented Souls 2 picks up right after the events of its 2021 predecessor, but you don't have to have met the Walker sisters before to make sense of this sequel. That’s partly because it tells a standalone story, and partly because it's so fantastical that nothing makes sense anyway. Sure, you may have questions about Caroline's fetching eyepatch, but all you really need to know is she’s searching for answers about her little sister Anna's terrifying visions and reality-bending drawings. For reasons that seem to exist exclusively in schlocky horror tales, that answer apparently sits somewhere in the depths of a creepy convent nestled in a far-flung location. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before Caroline even gets the chance to shrug off her (exceedingly 90s) leather jacket, though, Anna goes missing, and it's up to the older sibling to both find her sister and figure out what the hell is going on before it's too late… with an emphasis on the “hell” bit, naturally. As stories go, it's not unique, no, but the twists and turns of Tormented Souls 2's roughly 20-hour campaign are delightfully over-the-top in the same way the original Resident Evil games are. It’s packed with cheesy dialogue, curious flavor text, and some truly bizarre encounters I couldn’t help but smile at. Caroline's stay in the remote town of Villa Hess will take you to a number of wonderfully grim places, including a processing plant, spooky school, abandoned mall, bunker, and the sprawling convent you start off in, keeping the creepy environments feeling fresh.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And those environments are so detailed! Stuffed with interest and plenty of lore, Villa Hess and its surroundings are such fascinating, atmospheric places to explore. You never know when a key item or a helpful tool may be secreted away in a hidden room somewhere, so it's always best to keep your curiosity piqued. While your investigation is sometimes interrupted by a bladed demon or shambling zombie, you'll find that enemies have a tendency to stay dead in Tormented Souls 2 — once you've cleared out an area, you're usually left to explore at your leisure. With little more than a flickering candle to guide the way, though, it's a little too easy to miss things; I've been caught out a couple of times by overlooking a key clue or item, even in areas I <em>thought</em> I'd examined pretty closely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is seemingly the law for old-school survival horror, the more you play, the more you'll find yourself opening up new routes to old places, providing access to rooms and entire areas that were previously blocked off. I suspect the backtracking will irk some — there's a lot of it, particularly early on — but as the levels and fetch-quests are well-designed and usually rewarding, I couldn't begrudge it. That said, there's a reason fixed camera angles and tank controls are considered relics of the past. I grew up playing the games Tormented Souls 2 pays homage to (Resident Evil, Silent Hill 3, Parasite Eve, Alone in the Dark), but moving around Villa Hess is frustrating even when there isn't a demon on your tail, with tight corridors and dead ends that make getting from one side of a building to the other unduly long-winded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Add in Caroline's fear of the dark: she'll freeze and start to hyperventilate if plunged into darkness for even a split second, dying completely if you leave her there too long. You can’t even put away your lighter to shatter a porcelain pot or smash open a wooden crate unless there's an ambient light source nearby… which there very often isn't. The lighter sure does add to the atmosphere, though, which is almost continually tense and unnerving. As the primary source of light quite often, you'll have to proactively step into a room to illuminate what, if anything, is hiding in the shadows, which inevitably means unwittingly getting up close and personal with the denizens skulking around the place. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Vikki's List of Classic Horror Games That Deserve a Remake</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It all falls apart a bit when there <em>is</em> something hiding in the dark, though. Tormented Souls 2's combat isn't clumsy as much as it is enraging. The reliance on Caroline's lighter means you're often unarmed when something lunges at you, and the fixed camera angles and stiff character movement make it harder than it should be to retreat or create a little distance. Caroline protects herself with a range of acquired and improvised weapons, from a shotgun to a nail gun. Some of them can be upgraded to improve their rate of fire or reload speed, but they're still slow to use and difficult to wield accurately in a panic. I know it's kind of a genre convention to ensure we feel weak and underpowered, but this could've been achieved through scarcer ammo or by throwing more enemies at us; inefficient weapons and fixed cameras don't ramp up the tension as much as snap the immersion entirely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, that jankiness follows you into boss fights. One of the first you'll encounter, a giant nun, stomps around the room trying to batter you with a gigantic steel cross. But in that one single room, there are at least <em>three</em> different fixed camera angles, which means you may find yourself inadvertently sprinting <em>towards</em> your foe if the camera shifts while trying to put distance between you. This wouldn't be so bad if your shotgun held more than two shots at a time or if the nun flinched with each hit, but she'll keep galloping like an aggravated rhino, which made the camera feel like the real boss I was fighting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, for every underwhelming boss fight you're forced to endure, you'll happen across a good half-dozen puzzles which confuse and delight in equal measure. I never felt closer to an old Resident Evil or Silent Hill game than trying to figure out how to open a door, or decode a cipher, or prise open the jaws of a dead shark for reasons I still don't quite understand. Often deeply cryptic, maddeningly illogical, or completely unsolvable because I stupidly missed a clue somewhere, these puzzles were exactly what I want from a game like this, all the way down to the mini-puzzles that ask you to combine specific items in your inventory. Yes, I'll admit one or two (or five) brain teasers truly stumped me for an embarrassing amount of time, but if that isn't old-school survival horror, then what is?</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">If you're nostalgic for the survival horror games of old, Tormented Souls 2 can provide a modern-looking trip down memory lane, with all the good and bad that brings. It has a tense atmosphere to soak up and some gorgeously spooky locations to explore, but you’ll need to push through janky combat and a bit of backtracking to enjoy them. Its esoteric puzzles really test your brainpower in a way that could sometimes frustrate, but also delighted the part of me that missed smashing key items together to see what would happen. There's a lot to enjoy here, as well as plenty that perhaps should have remained in the past, but Tormented Souls 2 still manages to stand as an entertaining callback to the adventures that made contemporary horror gaming what it is.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/tormented-souls-2-review]]></content:encoded>
