It's the largest all-cash sponsor take-private investment in history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Under the terms of the agreement, the group will acquire 100% of EA, with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company. EA stockholders will receive $210 per share in cash. The per share purchase price represents a 25% premium to EA’s unaffected share price of $168.32 at market close on September 25, 2025, and a premium to EA’s unaffected all-time high of $179.01 at market close on August 14, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the close of the transaction, EA’s common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/gettyimages-970613584-1759148343537.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">EA boss Andrew Wilson will remain in charge of the company.

Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA will continue to be led by Wilson and will remain headquartered in Redwood City, California. The transaction is expected to close in Q1 FY27, subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The transaction will be funded by a combination of cash from each of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners, the latter of which is an American investment firm based in Miami, Florida, and formed in 2021 by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combined, the deal is for an equity investment of approximately $36 billion, and $20 billion of debt financing fully and solely committed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., $18 billion of which is expected to be funded at close. Each of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners plan to fund the equity component of the financing entirely from capital under their respective control, the companies said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The enormous sale comes just days before EA releases Battlefield 6, a crucial launch for the company, and hot on the heels of FC 26 and Skate.

I wrote the last 10 or 11 of them, [so] I think the world probably had enough GTA from me," Houser said in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ign-in-conversation-with-dan-houser-at-la-comic-con-2025"><u>an exclusive interview with IGN</u></a> on Saturday, September 27, at LA Comic Con. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's not going to be a story that I wrote or a character set that I developed.

I think the middle section of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v"><u>GTA 5</u></a> is amazing. When we got the three characters working… I think it was not flawless, but it was so smooth, that middle section. I thought that was really amazing.

They are made."</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly a year after its debut in Poland, Andrzej Sapkowski's latest Witcher novel, Crossroads of Ravens, finally arrives in English this week. Amazon is currently selling it for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjAwy?object_uuid=9c107776-76db-4695-84a2-6e134a786c12&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$24.50 in the US</a> (18% off the $30 MSRP) and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOg4B7?object_uuid=9c107776-76db-4695-84a2-6e134a786c12&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">£19.99 in the UK</a> (20% off the £20 RRP).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crossroads of Ravens is a new standalone prequel novel in The Witcher saga. It takes place decades before either the games and the main novel saga, following a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-andrzej-sapkowskis-new-book-focuses-on-a-teenage-geralt">teenage Geralt of Rivia fresh from Kaer Morhen, and in his early steps as a Witcher</a>.</p><div catalogid="6559bbb9-3f23-4c20-b295-2b73b9d89225" id="228495"><div id="228495" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Crossroads of Ravens (The Witcher)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>English Release Date: September 30, 2025.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Amazon’s description, the prequel finds Geralt “stumbling through a world that neither understands nor welcomes his kind.” Fresh from Kaer Morhen, a rash attempt at heroism nearly ends with his execution, but he is saved at the last moment by Preston Holt, “a grizzled witcher with a buried past and an agenda of his own.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Under Holt’s mentorship, Geralt begins to learn what it really means to walk the Path, not just in battling monsters but in surviving the prejudice and politics of the Continent. Sapkowski frames this as the story of “how legends are made, and what they cost.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It makes sense for this new tale to look back rather than push forward. Geralt’s arc already reaches a definitive conclusion in the main saga, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/15-the-witcher-anniversary-cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt games</a> have effectively carried the timeline on in their own way, set just a few years after the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-books-reading-order">books</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, while Sapkowski’s novels remain the bedrock of the series, The Witcher has long since grown into something much bigger.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv">Dawn of War 4</a> got a new gameplay trailer over the weekend, and while excitement continues generally for the upcoming real-time strategy game, the video has sparked a number of complaints from some within the Warhammer 40,000 community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with the voice acting, which some are saying sounds flat. The complaints here stem from comparisons to Relic’s much-loved Dawn of War, which came out in 2004. Based on the new video, the chatter from the Space Marines especially doesn’t have enough oomph, and lacks the metallic ‘vox’ texture the Space Marines usually have when speaking through their helmets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My best guess here is that the developers at King Art Games needed the Space Marines to sound sufficiently different to the Adeptus Mechanics, one of Dawn of War 4’s brand new factions. The Ad Mech are the fanatical worshippers of the Machine God of Mars, tech priests who have discarded their humanity in favor of cybernetics. Their voices have that metallic vox-ness to them by default, which may have forced King Art’s hand when it came to the Space Marines' audio. After all, on chaotic battlefield, the player needs to know which faction is saying what.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Here’s your official look into the next evolution of the iconic real-time strategy franchise with Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV!</p><p>First revealed during PC Gaming Show: Tokyo Direct, this new trailer has been captured entirely from in-engine gameplay.<a href="https://t.co/Tdy6sZQTof" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Tdy6sZQTof</a> <a href="https://t.co/SJGiQWy6g3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/SJGiQWy6g3</a></p></div>— Dawn of War IV (@PlayDoW4) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayDoW4/status/1972347455808393305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Voices for Space Marines aren't good, compared to DOW1 or DOW2,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dawnofwar/comments/1nst8b0/comment/ngpg480/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said the wonderfully named redditor KillerKanka</a>. “You know it's missing that ZEAL, the mechanical filter, the ‘COME. SHOW ME WHAT PASSES FOR FURY AMONG YOUR MISBEGOTTEN KIND’ or ‘SPESS MEHRINESS ATTAAAAACK’ or ‘STRIKE FROM THE SKIES, BROTHERS.’ It's much easier to correct, tho, but still.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Looks promising, but please fix the Space Marine voice acting,” added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dawnofwar/comments/1nst8b0/comment/ngrk15a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ImSorryOkGeez</a>. “That dude does not sound like he is ready to burn heretics, kill mutants, or purge the unclean.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Orks in Dawn of War 4, the voice work we hear in the video is nowhere near as over-the-top cockney as Warhammer 40,000 Orks traditionally sound, and indeed how they sound in Dawn of War 1. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s a growing row about the inclusion of Primaris Marines, which, well, if you’re not in the weeds on Warhammer 40,000, this one may prove to be a head-scratcher.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Firstborn” Space Marines, as they’re known, were essentially replaced within the setting by Primaris Marines. They’re bigger, tougher, stronger, and faster than the OGs, but some within the fandom absolutely hate them for their softer redesign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot to unpack here, but essentially this debate about the Primaris Marines boils down to a feeling that Games Workshop has “toned down” the Space Marines over the years so that they look a little less like the religious fanatics the lore suggests they are, and more like the poster boys Warhammer 40,000 needs to attract new fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War, which came out over 20 years ago now, leaned into the Warhammer 40,000 of that time, and so its Blood Ravens (the Space Marines chapter at the heart of the Dawn of War games) delivered on that fanaticism. Dawn of War was based on Warhammer 40,000 4th Edition (we’re now on the 10th), and so the Astra Militarum were called the Imperial Guard, the Aeldari were called the Eldar, and the Necrons didn’t speak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War 4, due out 2026, was always going to have a different feel in keeping with the Warhammer 40,000 of today, the grimdark far future we see in Amazon animations, in video games like the record-breaking Space Marine 2, and perhaps (hopefully!) in Henry Cavill’s Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe. Dawn of War 4 was always going to feature Primaris Marines, which have been the default Space Marines for almost a decade now.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not surprised by complaints around the voice work, which probably could do with a shot in the arm, or the complaints about the Primaris Marines (this is an ongoing complaint about all things Space Marines). The Warhammer 40,000 fandom, perhaps more than any other, is big on tradition. But I am surprised to see complaints about the game’s visuals, which I think look pretty detailed. King Art has spoken about going hard on sync kills, which Dawn of War 1 was famous for, and we see those in action here. Some are saying Dawn of War 4 looks too colorful, but to me it looks fine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are more extreme reactions online, some of which compare Dawn of War 4 to the critical and commercial flop that was Dawn of War 3. It’s impossible to make such a comparison based on what we’ve seen of Dawn of War 4 so far, and King Art has made it clear from the start that it’s using Dawn of War 1 as its reference point for the game with base building and big armies the focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, with each new video, Warhammer 40,000 fans will continue to have their say on Dawn of War 4, right up until launch and beyond. Heresy is at the heart of the Imperium, and so perhaps King Art knew full well it was going to have to deal with a healthy dose itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
