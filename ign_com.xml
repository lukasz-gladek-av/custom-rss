            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has addressed Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition's rocky launch, extending its refund policy for the game, offering a 50% upgrade path discount, and promising a string of patches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-master-crafted-edition">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition</a> is a re-release of Relic Entertainment‚Äôs 2011 action game, Space Marine. Both Games Workshop and publisher Sega are not calling this a remaster. Instead they point to quality-of-life and graphical improvements "that take the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine experience to the next level."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These include higher fidelity and improved textures, 4k resolution, "improved" character models, a modernized control scheme and interface overhaul, and remastered audio.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition launched on June 10 across Xbox Series X and S and PC, and straight into Game Pass (there‚Äôs no word on a PS5 version). While it appears to be going down okay on Game Pass, on Steam, where Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition costs $39.99 / ¬£34.99, it has a ‚Äòmostly negative‚Äô user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-has-a-mostly-negative-steam-user-review-rating-with-players-labeling-it-a-shameless-blatant-cash-grab">Most of the complaints revolve around the high price of the game relative to the changes it makes over the Anniversary Edition</a>, with other issues including usability problems and somewhat baffling visual changes. A lot of the negative reviews are from fans who say Sega should have given this Master Crafted Edition to owners of the original game for free or with a discount, which leads us nicely onto Sega‚Äôs latest update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3169520/view/523095184762732964" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on Steam</a>, Sega said ‚Äúwe‚Äôve heard your concerns around pricing,‚Äù and outlined the steps it was taking. To start, it has extended its refund window for Master Crafted Edition to July 10. This means that if you bought the game you can get a full refund, regardless of playtime, as long as you request it before 6pm BST / 10pm PST on July 10, 2025 (when the Steam Summer Sale ends). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, there is, as so many fans had asked for, now a 50% upgrade discount. If you own Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Anniversary Edition, you‚Äôre eligible for a 50% discount when buying the Master Crafted Edition until 6pm BST / 10pm PST July 10 2025 when the discount offer ends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, that means if you already bought the Master Crafted Edition and qualify for the discount, you‚Äôll need to request a refund manually via Steam Support (before July 10) then re-buy the game at the discounted price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe know this situation has been frustrating for some of you, and we‚Äôre sorry for the confusion it‚Äôs caused,‚Äù Sega added. ‚ÄúWe hope this approach offers a workable solution while we continue improving the game itself.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, Sega released the patch roadmap for Master Crafted Edition. It includes a number of improvements all due out in the coming weeks. Highlights include user interface enhancements, fixes for the game running on Steam Deck, and networking improvements. The details are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe‚Äôll continue listening, improving, and communicating as these changes go live,‚Äù Sega concluded. ‚ÄúThanks for sticking with us.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 video games have been on a great run lately, with the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii"><u>Space Marine 2</u></a> leading the charge of well-received, successful titles.
