            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-what-we-create-is-more-important-than-the-amount-spent-on-development<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Q&amp;A</a> with investors, Nintendo executive and storied designer Shigeru Miyamoto answered a question about the trend of rising development costs, saying that what Nintendo creates is far more important than what it spends on development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question related to rising development costs, asking if Nintendo's own expenses would increase in the future and if the company could mitigate those increases. Miyamoto stepped in to respond first, saying that while cost increases are inevitable, and Nintendo is focused on creating good and unique experiences first, it's also quite possible to make great games without spending massive piles of money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's his response, in full:</p><blockquote>Our research and development expenses have been increasing each year. Since our scale of development has grown, a corresponding increase in costs is, in some respects, inevitable.</blockquote><blockquote>However, our belief is that what we create is more important than the amount spent on development. We continue refining our products until we are confident that we have created something that our consumers will be satisfied with. With that in mind, what is important is to find ideas that are worth honing, and this has not changed since the era of Nintendo Entertainment System. Everyone has different interests, so we cannot make sweeping statements about what ideas are worth pursuing. However, one thing we are sure about is that it should be something which has not existed in the past. The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings. We believe that it is important to nurture developers who take this unique concept to heart, allocate funds to development if necessary, and release games only after we are confident in the product – and repeat this process over and over again.</blockquote><blockquote>On the other hand, in the entertainment business it is possible to create appealing products based on intriguing ideas, without incurring significant costs. Children’s toys are a prime example of this. We believe that not all products require large costs. Even in the case of video games, with the current technology it is possible to create fun games with a small number of developers in a short period of time. We believe it is important not to lose sight of this perspective.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/gettyimages-2173872596-1731077735788.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto. Photo by Lars Nicolaysen/picture alliance via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fellow executives Shinya Takahashi and Ko Shiota followed up on Miyamoto's answer. Takahashi reiterated the importance of "unique titles that are small in scale" that can be expanded, rather than spending huge amounts of money. He added that the Switch has evolved in such a way that it includes different methods to limit cost increases. And Shiota added that the company is working hard to ensure developers can work efficiently, and that "bigger budgets do not necessarily equate to better ideas." Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa threw in at the end that investment in development is a necessity - otherwise Nintendo won't have great hardware and software at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same Q&amp;A, Miyamoto <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-creator-of-mario-zelda-donkey-kong-and-more-denies-being-a-genius">dismissed a question</a> referring to him as a "genius", saying new Nintendo employees had referred to the Mario, Zelda, and Pikmin creator as "surprisingly normal" after meeting him. Miyamoto has also recently made statements about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-wants-nintendo-to-be-left-out-of-the-game-wars-focused-on-high-specs-and-performance">wanting to be left out of the console wars</a>, and said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-on-ai-nintendo-would-rather-go-in-a-different-direction">Nintendo would rather go in a "different direction"</a> than the rest of the industry when it comes to artificial intelligence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes ahead of Nintendo's announcement of its Switch successor console. The company recently confirmed the Switch 2, for want of a better name, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-officially-be-backward-compatible-with-original-switch-games">will play Switch games and Nintendo Switch Online will carry forward</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Lars Nicolaysen/picture alliance via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

But in its recent financial report, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record">Microsoft sounded delighted with Black Ops 6’s early days performance</a>, saying sales on PlayStation and PC were 60% higher compared to the 2023 release of Modern Warfare 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes were on Black Ops 6’s impact on Game Pass, though. Growth in Microsoft’s subscription service has stalled in recent years, and the day one release of the latest entry in Activision’s phenomenally successful first-person shooter series was seen as a make or break moment for Game Pass.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has yet to say exactly how many new subscribers Black Ops 6 brought through the door, although CEO Satya Nadella has confirmed that Game Pass set a record for new subs on launch day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, Treyarch associate creative director Miles Leslie, who has worked on Call of Duty for 16 years, said Black Ops 6’s release on Game Pass has helped convince players who were “on the fence” to give the game a shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we've seen is it's allowed people that might have been on the fence, might have had some of that friction, might have been like, 'I haven't played in a while' to actually come back and try the game," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That will be music to Microsoft’s ears, given it’s desperate to expand the Call of Duty audience in the long term. Analysts have suggested the company was willing to sacrifice Black Ops 6 launch sales on Xbox for a potential bigger overall player base, which it intends to monetize long-term with the release of battle passes and cosmetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've gotten to the point now where Black Ops and Call of Duty have been around so long - I've been working on it for 16 years," Leslie added. "And really the challenge for us is how do you bring along the fans that love Call of Duty, but how do you create an environment where you can welcome new fans in?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trick now of course is to convince Game Pass players to stick around and keep paying that monthly subscription.

These co-op missions are set during the game’s campaign, but with different characters who are off doing other missions that tie in to the events that follow main character Titus.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Operations mode restricts a squad to one Space Marine of each class. So, for example, it is impossible to have an all-sniper team (developer Saber has said this is a deliberate design decision to encourage “strategic variety.”)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is Space Marine 2 will actively matchmake you into a group with a player who is the same class as the one you have selected. In-game, there is an area of the Battle Barge where players must “assemble” before an Operations mode mission kicks off. The countdown only begins when all three players have selected a different class. This means <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-having-awkward-pre-mission-standoffs-because-two-of-the-same-class-cant-play-together">you can end up in awkward standoffs where two or more players want to be the same class</a>, each waiting for the other to blink first and switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a frustration that often bubbles up on Space Marine 2 Discords, subreddits, and on social media as players work to level up certain classes above others. Staff at Saber have said class matching is on the cards, but modders have already gone one step further and removed the class limits in Operations mode entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Astartes Overhaul, from Tom, aka Warhammer Workshop, is perhaps the most significant mod yet for Space Marine 2. This massive upgrade to Space Marine 2 gameplay, available to download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40000spacemarine2/mods/89" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus</a>, lets players select any squad configuration without class restrictions, among many other changes that affect the balance of Operations mode. So, if you want an all-sniper team, you can have it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/sm2-1731072484969.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Space Marine 2 modders have unlocked customization options currently unavailable otherwise.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Remarkably, the changes Space Marine 2 mods make to the Space Marines themselves, whether it’s a purely aesthetic customization not normally possible or certain classes using weapons and equipment they’re not supposed to, can be seen online by other players in public PvE sessions. While Space Marine 2 uses dedicated servers, a lot of the game elements are client-side controlled. So if you’re playing with random players, there’s a chance you might see things like Bulwarks wielding Thunder Hammers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-update-40-secretly-clamped-down-on-pvp-modding-publisher-confirms-but-doesnt-have-a-problem-with-pve-modding">Space Marine 2 publisher Focus Entertainment has confirmed to IGN that it has no problem whatsoever with PvE modding</a>, but Tom is playing it safe. He recommends those who use the Astartes Overhaul mod stick to private lobbies “to minimize disruption to other players' games.” “Keeping the Overhaul in private lobbies helps ensure a positive experience for all players,” he continued. “Your support in keeping things balanced is hugely appreciated!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No class limits in Operations isn’t all the Astartes Overhaul mod does. It even adds allied reinforcements to the Operations missions. This means you’ll encounter various allies who bring fresh support to each mission, including Imperial Guard soldiers, Space Marines, and even Dreadnoughts.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/emblems-1731072535187.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Astartes Overhaul adds new Chapter emblems for Warhammer 40,000 lore fans to tinker with.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the mod adds a ton of new Chapter emblems, an expanded arsenal of weapons for each operator, an expanded enemy roster (including early access to a new enemy type), “lore accurate” weapon buffs (“Bolters and other iconic weapons have been rebalanced for that real 40K punch”), new mid-operation checkpoints, new takedown animations, and new Retributor cosmetics and customizable Mark 8 armor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The addition of Retributor cosmetics is notable because the Loyalist Space Marine Chapter starred in Syama Pederson’s much-loved fan-made YouTube video series Astartes.
