That is an <strong>incredible </strong>deal for the later 77" screen size. On a normal day, you would be paying that much for the 65" model. This TV and others in LG's C-series lineup have won top spots in several of our buying guides, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-high-end-4k-tv">best 4K TV</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-for-gaming">best TV for gaming</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">best TV for the PlayStation 5</a>.

The Victus is HP's lineup of budget-oriented gaming laptops. This model features a 15" 1080p display, a low-voltage AMD Ryzen 8 8845HS CPU, GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The RTX 4070 has a maximum TGP rating of 120W, which is actually quite impressive for such an affordable gaming laptop. That means it will perform pretty well relative to other RTX 4070 gaming laptops.</p></div><p id="gaming-laptops"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Gaming Laptops">More Cyber Monday Gaming Laptop Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="028a145e-5dc2-4e3c-a711-702c006350a6" id="211413"><div id="211413" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Console Fortnite Cobalt Star Console Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony released their entire set of Black Friday PlayStation deals last week and most major retailers have followed suit. The best deal is definitely on the consoles themselves: the PS5 Slim Disc Edition has dropped to $424.99 (originally $500) and the PS5 Slim Digital Edition has dropped to $374.99 (originally $450). I would choose the Disc Edition because it's only $50 more and then I have the option to buy (and later sell or trade) physical disc media. But if you want to save some money and go the Digital Edition route, I would suggest getting the NBA 2K25 bundle, which also includes a game. Although the Fortnite Cobalt Star bundle has a fancy looking box, no actual game is included.</p></div><p id="playstation-5"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="PlayStation 5">More Playstation Cyber Monday Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="56b24fb1-b74e-4b45-8835-20eee9ba9746" id="211427"><div id="211427" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metaphor: ReFantazio</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://howl.link/fmaa2am0vzacr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> was released on October 11, so it's nice to see a nice 29% off discount so soon after launch. This is an outstanding RPG that gets pretty much everything right: intensely enjoyable combat, a gripping epic storyline, and hyper-stylized graphics. I've beaten the game, and I think it's just as good as Persona 5 (which I also loved).

In fact, this TV could even be a better <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">gaming TV</a> than the LG C4.

This 45" soundbar houses 11 precisely engineered internal speakers, including two dedicated height channels. It's Dolby Atmos ready, and there's enough power here that you can probably get away without a subwoofer. However, the Sonos Arc can be wirelessly paired up with other Sonos speakers and subs to add even more sound distribution. The Arc also has a built-in microphone for voice control so it is Alexa and Google Assistant compatible.</p></div><p id="sonos-deals"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Sonos Deals">More Cyber Monday Sonos Deals</h3></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will the Deals Change for Cyber Monday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In my experience, many of the same deals we saw on Black Friday will return for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday 2024</a>, including deals that were sold out or expired. Retailers usually release their hottest selling items in batches so that every sale event has at least some inventory reserved. That said, I also expect plenty of new, never before seen deals. Traditionally, Black Friday was known as the "retail holiday," where the best deals were found in-store, and Cyber Monday was known as the "online holiday," where the best deals were online only. Although today the lines have blurred, it is still true that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">many online only retailers still consider Cyber Monday the sale event of the year instead of Black Friday</a>. Expect some amazing sales to come out of online-only sites like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, Lenovo and several online-only deals from traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. In fact, Amazon has taken the preemptive and already switched over to Cyber Monday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

The beauty of Splendor lies in its simplicity: It's a great game to bust out a family gathering for players of all ages and experience levels due to its intuitive ruleset and average 30-minute playtime. Once you get a handle on the basic premise of the game, there's room for plenty of strategy to come into play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an economic engine game designed around the concept that players are working to build an increasingly powerful economy to buy cards that earn them points (dubbed "prestige" in the world of Splendor). In good ol' Renaissance fashion, your currency is none other than gemstones, which are represented by multi-colored tokens. The end goal is to reach 15 prestige points, which you accumulate by purchasing cards worth variable amounts of points with the gems you collect. If you're spending your gems on cards wisely, you might even become eligible for a visit from a noble, which gives you a massive point boost. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Splendor is a race to the finish line among players, but this game doesn't make it easy. Whether it's your rival reserving a card you had your eye on or someone hoarding the already-limited supply of tokens that you needed to purchase the card you've been saving up for, there's plenty of curveballs along the way that make game sessions with friends and family ripe with tension and necessitate thorough planning. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the price you're paying, this is a fantastic board game to snag this December, whether it be for your own collection or a fun gift that you can count on arriving before the holidays. If you'd rather pick it up in-person, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qrp7on?object_uuid=5eb6e6ed-179d-4100-b430-2408a5e13bfd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target is also selling Splendor at the same price</a> for Cyber Monday.

He said it's "a terrific third-person shooter with a compelling story, loads of weapons that are a blast to use, and a healthy variety of enemies to use them on. It once again borrows many of its ideas from the Gears of War series, but they’re good ideas, and Space Marine 2 does a fine job of making them its own."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not the only game deal on our radar right now, either.

While those lines have blurred, Cyber Monday remains the top event for online-focused retailers like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Even traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart roll out exclusive online-only offers. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-best-cyber-monday-deals-2024">Switch</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-playstation-cyber-monday-deals-2024">PS5 deals</a> are also now live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the same deals from Black Friday normally return for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday 2024</a>, including some that sold out or expired. Retailers often stagger their inventory, reserving stock for each major sale event. This means Cyber Monday will bring back popular deals alongside brand-new, never-before-seen offers. But, most importantly, Cyber Monday is the final day of the Black Friday sale season, with most the deals going with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelance writer who works with the Guides and Commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 2, 2024 9:10 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
