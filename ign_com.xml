Shortly following the announcement, users reported that the store was struggling to load — with many linking the troubles to a flood of wizard wannabes rushing to claim their copy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone with more than two hours of Hogwarts Legacy gameplay time on their account by December 18 will be granted a Chocolate Frog Back Bling in Fortnite, Epic Games has said. And that's not the only Harry Potter content coming to its battle royale game. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/fnbr-39-11-winterfest2025-wizardingworld-blog-inlinesupporting-charmschallenger-plusup-1920x1080-1920x1080-bcdd7a9c11ca-1765544822327.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite's Hogwarts student outfit.

These outfits will be customizable so you can dress as a student in any of the Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, or even Hufflepuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Harry Potter content coming to Fortnite is no surprise — fans tracking the game's files have previously ppointed to a collaboration coming in the near future, and expect broomsticks as Mythic items within the game's upcoming annual Winterfest celebrations.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this, Harry Potter is just the latest in the long line of Warner Bros. characters now arriving into the game following the shutdown of the publisher's own live-service attempt Multiversus. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Familiar faces from DC and Adventure Time have been in Fortnite for some time, but recent months have seen the addition of the Scooby-Doo gang, Beetlejuice and Jason Vorhees — all former Multiversus veterans. Will we see more next year, such as characters from Game of Thrones, Gremlins and Looney Tunes?
