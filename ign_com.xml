Only the young mercenary Ike and his colorful band of soldiers-for-hire stand between Tellius and chaos."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance's arrival for Switch 2 was first teased during Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct last April, and it's notable that of the 11 titles shown, we're still waiting for Super Mario Sunshine, Pokémon Colosseum and Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Tactics RPGs</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 2023, IGN listed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance">Path of Radiance</a> in ninth position within our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-tactics-rpgs">10 Best Tactics RPGs of All Time</a> ranking. "Path of Radiance stays true to its predecessors’ core game systems, like the weapons triangle, but upgrades everything from the skills system to the flow of battles," we wrote at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Its innovations and tweaks have influenced every Fire Emblem game since then. The Battle Preparations and Base screens add important story details and character interactions, while expanded shove and rescue functions make for more strategic combat, and a smart bonus rewards system keeps battles flowing by setting turn-limits and providing specific sub goals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you only know Path of Radiance because it introduced the world to Ike (of subsequent Smash Bros. fame), you’ll find a criminally underplayed strategy RPG that’s every bit as rewarding today as when it surprised GameCube owners back in 2005."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
