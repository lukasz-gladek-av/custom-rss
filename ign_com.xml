This update will now launch on June 9, 2026," the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/destinythegame.bungie.net/post/3mf63bvtcms2g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>. "We will provide exact details closer to release covering previously announced Weapon Tier Upgrading, but also additions like expanding Tiered Gear to all Raid and Dungeon activities, Pantheon 2.0, Tier 5 stats for Exotic Armors, and more."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio is, of course, preoccupied <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-reaffirms-march-release-date-with-february-server-slam-sony-state-of-play"><u>getting Marathon out of the door</u></a> after last week's State of Play reaffirmed its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-looks-like-the-marathon-release-date-has-leaked-via-the-xbox-store"><u>March 5 release date</u></a>. Nonetheless, the delay intimates the studio may be struggling to juggle everything on its plate, particularly as it alludes to "sizeable quality-of-life updates."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Through June, we will continue to have routine bug fixes and stability improvements, continued portal modifiers, Guardian Games (March), and the return of a more frequent Iron Banner cadence (April)," Bungie added. "In terms of communications, we will be focusing on providing you with updates about our live game content, community activations, and general upkeep through the TWID and our Destiny social channels."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement closed on thanking players for their "continued patience and support," and said there'll be more information on the next major update and future plans for Destiny 2 "closer to launch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Raids and dungeons getting tiers and pantheon 2.0 is great, but will there even be anyone left playing by then?" asked one player on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1r8gvip/comment/o64wflf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Destiny 2 subreddit</u></a>. "I still log on every week and play a little bit, but nobody can deny that renegades was not meant to last six months."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destiny 2: Renegades – Lawless Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not to be a total downer, but that really gives me age of triumph 'final update' style vibes of making all the endgame viable," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1r8gvip/comment/o64y411/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a> another fan. "Not to mention this is just a major update in the end. It isn’t gonna have expansion level content, but its now releasing right around when the next expansion was supposed to, which I assume is also delayed at least three months. Even with way more content in this update, renegades being the expansion for nine months at least now is very bad."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Until June is rough. The population is going to be absolutely dire by then…," one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1r8gvip/comment/o64w8mu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a>, to which someone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1r8gvip/comment/o64xup6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>: "Dire[?] It's dire right now. Falling off a cliff." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of writing (when, admittedly, much of the U.S. is asleep), there are 10,463 players online right now on Steam. Once Human, eFootball, and single-player Hollow Knight: Silksong all have higher concurrent counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s undoubtedly a tough time for Bungie and Destiny 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-bungie-hasnt-brought-in-as-much-money-as-it-thought-it-would-when-it-bought-the-developer-as-destiny-2-falls-off-a-cliff"><u>with parent company Sony recently saying the studio has failed to meet its sales and user engagement expectations</u></a>. In its latest financial report, Sony said it had recorded a 31.5 billion yen (approx. $204.2 million) impairment charge as a result of Destiny 2’s underperformance. That was significant enough to drag down profits at Sony’s Game &amp; Network Services Segment, which includes Sony Interactive Entertainment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-review"><u>The Edge of Fate expansion</u></a> in July, Destiny 2 saw a slump in player activity, and Bungie's team is feeling the pressure. "For years now, Destiny has been on this steady hardening of the core [audience],” game director <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-dont-want-to-be-a-dead-game-destiny-2s-directors-on-reassessing-the-shooters-future"><u>Tyson Green told IGN back in November</u></a>. “More and more core players are staying and playing the game, but relatively few [new] people come into the game. There's a tightening and contraction, and this presents problems for a game that you're trying to maintain as a live service, especially when you want to keep serving those core players with great, compelling expansions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
