            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-multiplayer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There's some rising left to be done in the amount of maps, factions, and modes available.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the multiplayer mode of Tempest Rising. For thoughts on the story mode, check out the </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-review-single-player-campaign">Tempest Rising single-player campaign review</a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem with Tempest Rising's multiplayer is that while it's perfectly competent at recreating a slice of the old Command &amp; Conquer multiplayer with a pair of new and interesting factions, it's just that: a slice, rather than the whole pie. With only two factions, nine maps, and the most basic of options for customizing its two or four-player matches, just about everything here screams "minimum viable product." Combine that with the fact that Tempest Rising doesn’t aspire to be anything more than a revival of C&amp;C’s gameplay, and there's not a tremendous amount to get excited about. It may well expand over time – such as whenever the Veti faction arrives – but like a vehicle factory that's only half built, it won't be super useful until you're certain you'll have enough harvested Tempest in the bank to complete it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I could try to comment on unit balance, but like with any fresh-out-of-the-gate multiplayer game, anything I say will almost certainly soon be obsolete. My anecdotal experiences with the community's apparent preference for GDF over Dynasty, probably thanks to their self-replenishing drone swarms, is likely to either be nerfed in a patch within a week or proven completely wrong. Soon, I'm sure someone way smarter than I am will figure out a devastating counter that reduces the seemingly unbeatable (and admittedly pretty cool) strategy of loading Skycrane transport helios with drone operating infantry to automatically barrage anything in range to a garbage-tier strategy for fools.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So I'll leave that to the folks who are busily hashing out the best build orders and counter strategies for the unique characteristics of each faction, which are mostly remixes of C&amp;C ideas with a few twists to get a hang of. I’m a big fan of the Dynasty’s Scrap Trucks, which let you quickly unfold a vehicle-repairing turret anywhere on the map and start plopping down structures that you can pre-construct at your con yard. Naturally, there's no end to the opportunities for showing off your micromanagement skills by deftly controlling the transforming Trebuchet tanks, picking targets for your long-range artillery and airborne units to clear the way for flamethrowers and armor, activating special abilities to disable groups of enemies and leaving them vulnerable, laying mines, scouting, calling in support abilities, etc. – all while building and protecting your own resource economy and climbing the tech tree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because of Tempest Rising's retro style and adherence to time-tested tech trees I've found it instantly familiar and easy to slip back into old habits; I've been enjoying going back to the classic engineer-rush where I steal the enemy's construction yard out from under their noses while a handful of infantry distracts them from the opposite flank. (That'll only work for a short while after launch, so I'm getting that trollish thrill while I can.) If it worked in C&amp;C, it'll probably work here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few features that feel like they're built almost exclusively for the hyper-competitive set, such as the Doctrine tech tree that invites you to dump thousands of precious Tempest credits into upgrades that, for the most part, don't get all that good until you're several tiers deep. Boosting my infantry health by 15%, for instance, doesn't seem all that worth it until I have a <em>lot</em> of infantry in play (as opposed to building more infantry). At my skill level – and probably that of most people who aren't hardcore players – the vast majority of my games thus far haven't lasted long enough to build up the kind of excess cash I'd need to invest in that sort of thing, with most of them wrapping up before the 15-minute mark. But I'm sure that plenty of people will find uses for these to get the upper hand with specific builds, so it's good to know there's more depth to be mined if you put in the time to train up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, if you <em>are</em> a competitive player looking for your next RTS fix, know that Tempest Rising doesn't have a ton for you to play with at the moment. For one thing, if you play ranked, there are only 1v1 matches available. Even if there were 2v2 ranked matches (it's actively being worked on, the developers promise), there would only be three maps available that support four players in teams or free-for-all. 1v1 isn't much better in that regard, with just six options. Combine that with there only being two factions until whenever the Veti expansion comes along – which could be a while given the lack of a published timeline – and it feels pretty slim compared to a lot of the games that inspired it.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dan's Favorite RTS Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's nothing wrong with the maps that are here – each is a symmetrical layout with areas of high and low elevation, plenty of bottlenecks and alternate routes, all dotted with capturable neutral structures that can give you a "free" (for the cost of an engineer) foothold to build defenses and forward production off of, as well as a few that generate resources. It's simply that there's nothing unexpected – good or bad – at all, and that gives it a very bog-standard feeling. It’s hard to make the argument that Tempest Rising has gone for quality over quantity when there are no big standouts.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Tempest Rising’s multiplayer mode is a better looking but anemic version of the same exact style of RTS multiplayer we've been playing for 30 years. There's certainly value in that, since Command &amp; Conquer’s fast-paced strategic action still holds up as well as ever, and matches are quick and tense when you’re up against an evenly skilled opponent. It may be a minimum viable product with only two factions and a handful of maps, but it is viable, and it remains a good time to duke it out as GDF and Dynasty with others or bots.</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div><h3 data-cy="object-review-title">Tempest Rising Review - Multiplayer</h3><div data-cy="review-content"><p>okay</p><p>Tempest Rising's multiplayer mode replicates the thrills of old-school Command &amp; Conquer-style RTS gameplay, but with just a couple of factions and a handful of maps there's not much meat on its bones.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Lay claim to his and other seasonal Boss Powers by traversing the world and defeating Hell’s greatest threats. Blizzard has thrown down the gauntlet with this new season, increasing difficulty across the board while tamping down top-end outliers. To combat this, IGN and Maxroll have teamed up to bring you a fresh set of guides to help you claim the immeasurable power of Diablo IV’s toughest enemies and fight back against the demonic hordes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Diablo 4 </strong>Seasonal Theme: Boss Powers</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/diablo-4-seasonal-theme-boss-powers-1745945457621.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 8 allows you to harness the powers of Diablo IV’s toughest foes. There are <strong>24 Boss Powers</strong> available, and the first time you defeat each of these Bosses, you claim their power for yourself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss Powers each have a <strong>Main</strong> and <strong>Modifier</strong> effect to boost your build. You can equip 1 Main Power and 3 Modifiers, and all powers can be upgraded to increase the potency of both effects. Use ‍Spectral Ash to upgrade them, dropped from Apparition Incursions and by defeating any Boss. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Apparition Incursions</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/diablo-4-apparition-incursions-1745945479329.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The new seasonal mechanic, <strong>Apparition Incursions</strong>, is available at any difficulty level, and gives you the opportunity to unlock a subset of the available Boss Powers very early on. Various Apparition Monsters appear in these timed boss rush events throughout Sanctuary. Defeating these monsters spawns 1 of 10 possible Apparition Bosses and defeating them grants you their Boss Power. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After defeating the first Boss, continue the event for a chance to fight a second Apparition Boss, after which Belial himself joins the fray. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Reworked <strong>Diablo 4 </strong>Boss Ladder</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/diablo-4-reworked-boss-ladder-1745945512131.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Beginning in Torment difficulty, you can now challenge Diablo IV’s Boss Ladder <em>without</em> collecting any prerequisite materials. This means you can claim the remaining Boss Powers as soon as you’re strong enough. The items previously used as summoning materials have been rebranded as Lair Boss Keys, and instead unlock a chest after defeating each boss to grant the associated <a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/resources/boss-loot-table-cheat-sheet" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Uniques and Mythic Uniques</u></a>.

Defeating this “mini-Belial” rewards the player with a second instance of that Lair Boss’s loot, as well as <strong>Betrayer’s Husks</strong>, the Lair Boss Key for Belial. Belial’s Loot table is special in its own right: though you won’t be afforded a chance to double it, you can select rewards from any other Lair Boss’s Hoard upon his defeat.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>New Diablo 4 Lair Bosses</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/diablo-4-new-lair-bosses-1745945551553.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You may have noticed some new but familiar faces in the infographic above.

As early game Fury generation is the Upheaval Barbarian’s nemesis, it employs Leap and Aspect of the Relentless Master along with the Walking Arsenal Key Passive to stay in the fight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Druid - </strong><a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/lightning-storm-druid-leveling-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Lightning Storm</strong></u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lightning Storm Druid is by far the easiest Druid build to get off the ground. With relatively low Spirit costs and no real dependency on Codex aspects, its screen-wide AoE is excellent at most farming activities. It employs the full suite of Companions for their strong early game damage and to leverage the Clarity passive. Given time to set up, this passive allows the build to channel at near-max Critical Strike Chance from a very low level.<strong>
</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Necromancer - </strong><a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/minion-necromancer-leveling-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Minion</strong></u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minion Necromancer is one of the most simple and efficient leveling builds to gear and play. With your Minions carrying the majority of the weight, you can comfortably level up with ease. During the early levels you use Sever to aid your undead forces, but later you lead an army of Skeletal Warrior Reapers and Cold Skeletal Mages to victory across Sanctuary.<strong>
</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rogue - </strong><a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/dance-of-knives-rogue-leveling-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Dance of Knives</strong></u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you want to easily Spin2Win to Torment 1 and beyond? Then this is the build for you. This ‍Dance of Knives build does not need to manage Energy, nor does it rely on any aspects. You utilize the power of snapshotting ‍Concealment and ‍Shadow Imbuement to scale your ‍Dance of Knives. Dark Shroud handles your defenses while leveling, and provides a nice Movement Speed bonus. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sorcerer - </strong><a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/firewall-sorcerer-leveling-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Firewall</strong></u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lure enemies into your Firewalls to burn them to death. Combine this with powerful Conjuration skills like Familiar and Hydra for supporting fire, and Spark to restore mana and you have a well-rounded offensive package. Defensively, you use Ice Armor while Teleporting across the battlefield to avoid damage. Keep moving and watch enemies burn to death in your wake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Spiritborn - </strong><a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/quill-volley-spiritborn-leveling-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Quill Volley</strong></u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Quill Volley Spiritborn is a ranged powerhouse. You fire several feathers that fan out while being able to shotgun enemies at close range, creating a superb mix of AoE and single target damage. Add in the Rebounding Aspect to hit enemies up to 16 times in a single attack! Between Soar, Rushing Claw and the Seeker this build has mobility for days, ensuring you’ll be in endgame in no time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Best Diablo 4 Season 8 Endgame Builds</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barbarian - </strong><a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/leapquake-barbarian-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Earthquake</strong></u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Play HotA Quake with Mantle of the Mountain’s Fury to smash your enemies so hard the world itself shatters around you! Leap onto foes, unleash devastating ground stomps and even use Call of the Ancients to summon your ancestors to aid you in battle. If you are looking for a build that prefers to be in a target-rich environment, then Earthquake Barbarian is the build for you in Season 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Druid - </strong><a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/cataclysm-druid-build-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Cataclysm</strong></u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even after a myriad of nerfs, the Cataclysm Druid returns as the top option for Druids in Season 8. As it can no longer maintain snapshotted buffs through successive casts, the build instead relies on the Provocation passive to guarantee overpowers on a per-cast basis. It recovers the Critical Strike Chance lost from the Xan rune through gear tempers, runes, and Boss Powers. Despite the setbacks, it’s still capable of clearing most endgame content before you even notice the mobs are there.<strong>
</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Necromancer - </strong><a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/blood-wave-necromancer-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Blood Wave</strong></u></a><strong> / </strong><a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/bone-spear-necromancer-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Bone Spear</strong></u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With two of the top builds across all classes, Necromancer is an incredibly strong choice for Season 8. Blood Wave or “Shadow Surfer” fills the screen with Blood and Darkness using AoE moves that cover the entire screen in devastation. Alternatively, as a Bone Spear Necromancer you impale your foes with massive spears of blood thanks to Indra’s Memory. Place your enemies in a Bone Prison to guarantee an Overpower from the Bone Duster’s Aspect for even more damage. So, whether you prefer Shadow Surfer or Bone Spear, you can’t go wrong with Necromancer in the Season of Belial’s Return!<strong>
</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rogue - </strong><a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/death-trap-rogue-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Death Trap</strong></u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stack Cooldown Reduction to spam the Rogue’s powerful Death Trap Ultimate Skill and deal huge damage to anything caught in the blast. Then watch as your Death Trap re-arms itself to fire again thanks to the Eyes in the Dark Unique Pants. This build has been a rogue staple since the release of Diablo 4 and it’s still going strong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sorcerer - </strong><a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/lightning-spear-sorcerer-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Lightning Spear</strong></u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Summon Spears of living Lightning, use the Aspect of Splintering energy to ride the lightning and deal massive damage. Then activate Unstable Currents to spawn even more Lightning Spears. This build scales well into the late game, benefiting from Mythic Uniques like Heir of Perdition and Ring of Starless Skies.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Spiritborn - </strong><a href="https://maxroll.gg/d4/build-guides/quill-volley-spiritborn-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Quill Volley</strong></u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The endgame Quill Volley Spiritborn build rapidly fires shotgunning feathers to deal with both groups of foes and dangerous bosses. Harmony of Ebewaka enables a massive damage bonus by combining the Gorilla and Jaguar Spirit Halls. With Rod of Kepeleke and Ring of the Midnight Sun you create an infinite resource loop, immediately spending and restoring all of your Vigor with each attack. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Season 8 Tier Lists</strong></h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Bossing</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As the theme of Season 8 centers around Bossing, we’ll bet you’re wondering about which archetypes are the best to take down these worthy adversaries and claim their Powers.
