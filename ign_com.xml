            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ready to feel old? Today marks the 25th(!) anniversary of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-ix"><u>Final Fantasy 9</u></a>, and Square Enix is going all out by… uh, launching a fan art project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If that falls a little short of your remake-shaped expectations, you're not alone. There was a lot of excitement about the much-discussed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-ix"><u>Final Fantasy 9 remake</u></a> after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-set-tongues-wagging-on-potential-switch-2-nintendo-direct-remake-reveal"><u>Square Enix launched an official Final Fantasy 9 25th Anniversary website earlier this year</u></a>, and while the publisher has at least acknowledged Final Fantasy 9's special day with an "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFDDlEaUXxw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>anniversary special movie</u></a>" and a request to collect special memories from fans, that's pretty much it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Celebrating 25 years of Final Fantasy 9 today," said a tweet posted to the game's official X/Twitter account yesterday, July 6. "When a theatre troupe set out for a royal kidnapping, Zidane and Princess Garnet are thrown into an emotional adventure that's never left the hearts of those who've played it. What does FFIX mean to you?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in a follow-up message posted today (July 7), Square Enix <a href="https://support.na.square-enix.com/ceform.php?id=441&amp;la=1&amp;h=cbf426fd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>invited players aged 13 and up in selected countries</u></a> to submit their FF9 fan art between now and the end of October. If selected, it will then be used on the Final Fantasy portal site, as well as official social network accounts.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— FINAL FANTASY (@FinalFantasy) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinalFantasy/status/1942056235010073084?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The X/Twitter account of passion project Final Fantasy 9: Memoria Project further stoked speculation earlier today by quote-tweeting Square's post, adding: "When are we going to tell them, Square Enix?"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">When are we going to tell them, <a href="https://twitter.com/SquareEnix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SquareEnix</a>? <a href="https://t.co/yLt8EQuWOD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/yLt8EQuWOD</a></p>— Final Fantasy IX: Memoria Project (@MemoriaProject) <a href="https://twitter.com/MemoriaProject/status/1942104895882141808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's a far cry from what some fans had hoped for, not least because last year, Final Fantasy 14 producer Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game"><u>talked a bit about what a Final Fantasy 9 remake might look like</u></a>, warning it may not all fit in one game and so go in the direction of Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Earlier in 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-9-remake-rumors-fuelled-by-final-fantasy-14-director-yoshi-p"><u>Yoshi-P also announced Final Fantasy 9-themed extras</u></a> for the Collector’s Edition and Digital Collector’s Edition of Final Fantasy 14 expansion <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-dawntrail"><u>Dawntrail</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, the game's social media and Reddit communities have been full of shocked players commenting on the lack of news. "This CANNOT be it bro," <a href="https://x.com/ThePrinceMagus/status/1942069129847988416" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> one. "The remake. Announce the remake," while another <a href="https://x.com/Chelseapaul23/status/1942060055550931434" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "At least confirm or deny the remake rumors plz."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The 25th anniversary is a big milestone and announcing it would be the best right now. My hopes are gone," added<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1ltjijy/comment/n1rd8vg/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> another disappointed fan.</u></a> Interestingly, though, some fans have taken this lack of announcement as a sign there may still be news to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"October is the month, boys," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1ltjijy/october_is_the_month_boys/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> this excited player, while <a href="https://x.com/SoulEater923/status/1942061104282075253" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another</a> added: "Cutoff date is the end of October because y'all will reveal the FF9 Remake in November, right?" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a Reddit thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyIX/comments/1ltnqlv/youve_reached_a_checkpoint_how_are_you_doing/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>entitled</u></a>, "You've reached a checkpoint. How are you doing given the so far disappointment of no announcement?", one fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyIX/comments/1ltnqlv/comment/n1rqoo6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>: "At this point I've played myself more than I've played the actual game. Just call me Zorn &amp; Thorn 'cause I'm a certified resident of Clown Town."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Domino's Pizza can't believe we haven't had an announcement yet…</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Did <a href="https://twitter.com/dominos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@dominos</a> just become the coolest pizza company? <a href="https://t.co/VmK8KLTtj1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VmK8KLTtj1</a></p>— Wickid 🇺🇸 (@PirateHunterWik) <a href="https://twitter.com/PirateHunterWik/status/1941678144462676393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 9 remake rumors have swirled around Square Enix ever since the unannounced game emerged as part of a 2021 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-now-explainer-making-sense-of-rumors-datamines-leaks"><u>Nvidia leak</u></a> of upcoming titles. The list, confirmed legit by Nvidia but potentially outdated, includes a number of Square Enix games the company has either announced or released since, such as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chrono-cross-the-radical-dreamers-edition"><u>Chrono Cross remaster</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-long-rumored-remake-is-real-after-all-includes-voice-acting-and-classic-original-version">Final Fantasy Tactics remake</a>, and of course the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake"><u>Final Fantasy 7 remake</u></a> for PC. However, Final Fantasy 9 remake has yet to materialize. Just a few months before the Nvidia leak, in June 2021, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/final-fantasy-ix-the-animated-series"><u>Final Fantasy 9 animated series was reported to be in development</u></a>, although we haven’t heard anything about it in the years since, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Both are versions of the classic Pokémon Donphan — and now fans are debating how Paradox Pokémon will debut. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, players can encounter Paradox Pokémon in the wild — though in Pokémon Go, there's an expectation that these powerful creatures will likely pop up in raids, similar to how the Ultra Beasts from Pokémon Sun and Moon debuted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paradox Pokémon originally being spotted in Scarlet/Violet's "Area Zero" crater has meanwhile led some fans to suggest the species would be a good fit for this year's Pokémon Go Wild Area event, which is designed to feel like something of a safari. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">22 Paradox Pokémon species exist, with a selection of more common and Legendary Pokémon remixed. Jigglypuff gets a billion-year-old variant named Scream Tail, for example, while the Legendary Terrakion gets a new variant, Iron Boulder, that looks like an anime robot. Regardless of how some of the Paradox species are introduced, these new versions of Legendary creatures seem most likely to be found in raids.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/07/xxwyyaad4cbf1-1751879193869.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go's 9th Anniversary artwork.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One note of caution about Pokémon Go's anniversary artwork is that the game has, on occasion, not always followed through with what these images have set up. Fans have been quick to point to past teases for Mega Mewtwo and fan-favorite Ghost critter Mimikyu in previous annual artworks, only to not materialise. But Pokémon Go's developer has seemingly become wiser to these expectations — and indeed Paradox Pokémon are the logical choice for the next big selection of creatures to join the game, after the recent debut of Gigantamax creatures, the fully-launched Ultra Beasts and almost all Mega Pokémon now being available. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other teases in this year's artwork include Gigantamax Butterfree, which fans expect to debut soon, Mega Metagross, one of the game's last remaining Mega species yet to turn up, and a player avatar receiving a virtual thumbs up (which some fans are taking as a sign that remote communication or even remote trading might be arriving). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's Zygarde, star of the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> for Switch and Switch 2. While already in Pokémon Go, fans are currently limited to having just one of the creature. Could we see more become available, and potentially through Mega Raids, if Zygarde does get a Mega in Z-A? As with the temporally-divergent Paradox Pokémon themselves, time will tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Pokémon Go's developer said it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-developer-acknowledges-golden-pokstop-issue-ruining-games-big-9th-anniversary-event-now-investigating-fix">investigating an issue with Golden PokéStops that intefered with in-game 9th anniversary celebrations</a>. Last month, IGN sat down with Pokémon Go director Michael Steranka to discuss the game's future, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-developer-addresses-pay-to-win-fears-as-it-introduces-unprecedented-20-premium-pass-with-gold-bottle-cap-that-boosts-a-pokmons-stats-to-100">its recent introduction of a $20 Golden Bottle Cap item to boost a creature's stats for the first time</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-director-talks-new-ownership-says-saudi-backing-wont-see-demands-such-as-cristiano-ronaldo-added-to-the-game-yeah-thats-a-little-bit-not-our-vibe">why the game's new Saudi-backed ownership at Scopely would not negatively impact Pokémon Go</a> — or result in Cristiano Ronaldo being added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
