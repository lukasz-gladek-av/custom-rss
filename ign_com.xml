While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-26">last week saw some big changes to X and Y promos, alongside Prismatic Evolutions</a>, the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-best-singles-to-chase-and-buy">Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion Destined Rivals</a> will be the focus for most trainers, at least for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's reflected in some of the biggest crashers and climbers of the week for single cards in the new expansion, including some <em>huge</em> changes once again for hotly sought-after chase cards like <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qmn0g6?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex SIR</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3bgd?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ethan's Ho-Oh ex SIR</a>.</p><p id="crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/02/pokemon-tcg-climbers-and-crashers-this-week-june-2-ign-crashers-1748870510773.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most notable crashers since <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqw7Jq?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Destined Rivals</a> officially launched over the weekend include <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObMED?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Ariana, down to $38.16</a> and falling from a previous high of $150 (from before the expansion launched).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxeM8?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cynthia's Garchomp ex (Hyper Rare)</a>, which is now just $67.83 (falling from $138.68), alongside its <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAJMm?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secret Art rare equivalent for $220.81</a> instead of its previous high of $469.90 before release day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also Arven's Mabosstiff ex, which is down to $31.28 (was $49.99), Team Rocket's Crobat ex, down to around $77.24 right now (previously $120), and finally Yanmega ex for $31.94 instead of $99.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are some big changes compared to the previous highs we saw during the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025">expansion's launch week</a>, and we're expecting even more big moves soon as well.</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/02/pokemon-tcg-climbers-and-crashers-this-week-june-2-ign-climbers-1748870527162.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So this is where things get... expensive. While Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex had previously dropped to around $338, it's shot back up and the next best available listing on TCG Player is $523.80. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's a huge spike after what was such a great drop (down from $450 previously), so there's some hope it will settle again around $340 again in the near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Rocket's Moltres ex also recently spiked again to $314.69, after recently dropping to just below $200. It was at a high of over $400 in the build up to release as well, so it could be worth holding out to see where this one sits next week instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other big climbers this week include Ethan's Ho-Oh ex (Secret Rare), up to $250 from a recent low of $145, alongside Team Rocket's Spidops, up to $23.99, and Zamazenta, up to $16.98.</p><p id="sealed-boosters"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Boosters">Pokémon Card Sealed Boosters</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Long story short; things are looking bleak at retail for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> right now. Almost everything is way above MSRP and seems to becoming the new normal for big box retailers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I could write a whole article and why this is and what should be done to stop this practice, but here we are. If you have your heart set on opening booster packs, have at it: TCG Player and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG</a> secondary collectors market is significantly cheaper than big box retailers at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will likely be the case unless you can secure drops on new sets such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-destined-rivals-expansion-unboxing#:~:text=Destined%20Rivals%20is%20the%20kind,building%20it%20around%20a%20character.">Destined Rivals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a> fast.</p><p id="revisit-last-week"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Revisit Last Week">Last Week's Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week's crashers and climbers saw Prismatic Evolutions chase cards dropping in price while classic X and Y promos like Venusaur ex, Blastoise ex, and Charizard ex climb high.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/znxejD?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee ex SIR</a> dropped by 36% since mid-April, which would also mark around the time Prismatic Evolutions reprints started rolling onto store shelves. This alongside the community refusing to pay astronomical prices on Scarlet and Violet chase cards seems to be driving down prices across the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7LGY?object_uuid=be02ba6a-2980-4fac-9935-bc97f9597ce3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon ex SIR</a> has always been one of the cheaper eeveelutions in Prismatic Evolutions, but seeing a cool 28% drop from $338.69 to $240.98 feels like a half decent plateau, although I would personally put my money on this becoming a sub-$200 card before the year is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Senior Commerce Editor, for IGN.
