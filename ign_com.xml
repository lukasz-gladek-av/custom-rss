            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We've made so many of these that we can't tell anymore until someone else plays it."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil has been one of the video game industry's quintessential, flagship horror games for years now, delivering everything over the years from unsettling, atmospheric haunting to outright jumpscares. But as its development team continues to search for new ways to freak people out, a few of its leaders are admitting that they're not always 100% certain what elements of Resident Evil are actually scary anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from our interview with director Koshi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazama at Tokyo Game Show 2025. We started by talking about Resident Evil: Requiem's new protagonist, Grace, and her <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-are-still-being-coy-about-leon-kennedy">differences from the more action-oriented Leon S. Kennedy</a>. That led to a discussion of why the series was pulling back on the heavy action elements in Requiem, as Nakanishi explains:</p><blockquote>I think you can broadly classify Resident Evil titles on a scale of how much they're like Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 7 was definitely on the 2 side of that, as it returned to survival horror roots and was very acclaimed for that. Resident Evil Village built on that and added in more action and gunplay and brought it toard the RE4 side of that particular scale. But if we kept going in that direction there's almost an inflation effect, where you have to keep adding more and more action to outdo the previous title, and by doing that you ultimately end up where Resident Evil 5 and 6 went, and although they're still great games, the general consensus is that they pushed Resident Evil so far in the action direction that it was no longer horror. I didn't want to have to do that with Resident Evil's ninth title where I just tried to outdo the action in Village and ended up making something I didn't want to make. Firmly swinging the scale toward the Resident Evil 2 style was our intention, and it's almost an upgrade of that Resident 2 style.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">But that led to a follow-up question where I asked Nakanishi about the other side of the coin, of trying to outdo their own scares with each new title. Nakanishi noted that their goal isn't necessarily to innovate horror, but there is a certain numbing effect that working on these games for so long has, where they really need to see audience reactions to know if what they've made is actually scary or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've made so many of these that we can't tell anymore until someone else plays it," Nakanishi says. "There was actually a bit of a worry internally before we showed the [Resident Evil: Requiem] hands-off at SGF and the first hands-on at Gamescom, was this actually scary? Because we don't even know anymore. This is our bread and better, what we make every day."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I ended up asking Nakanishi if there was anything they had cut from the game for being too scary. He couldn't recall anything specific that was actually removed from the game after it had been added, but he did remember one anecdote that might make fans of Ethan Winters chuckle:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We didn't really implement it, so it wasn't cut, but- we don't know if something's scary. So we say, we'll do this, we'll do that, we keep adding on stuff, and at one point we were like, what if [Grace] gets a big gash in her leg, or her leg gets cut off, because that thing attacks her, and oh my god it's so scary, but we talked ourselves down a little bit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So at least we know Grace probably isn't going to have the same issues Ethan did with hands. Probably.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We previewed Resident Evil: Requiem just last month, and you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">read our impressions of what we've seen so far right here</a>. You can also check out the rest of my discussion with Nakanishi and Kumazawa, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-on-nintendo-switch-2-wasnt-in-the-original-plan-say-developers">how Reqiuem came to the Nintendo Switch 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-are-still-being-coy-about-leon-kennedy">what's going on with Leon Kennedy</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">So many models in so many different games.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently held a fan-voted tournament to determine the greatest racing game of all time. There were a total of 32 entries split across four categories: Arcade Racing, Simulation, Street Racing, and Wild Card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Mario Kart 8 Deluxe ultimately won the fan vote and was crowned champion, it isn’t exactly known for its realism. Several other entries in the tournament give you the chance to drive cars based on real-life counterparts, including a wide variety of different Toyota models.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Toyota brand has been around for almost 90 years and competes in several different racing series, meaning there are lots of different models that can be included in racing games. And some games make very good use of that. Here are five standout titles that were popular in our fan-voted tournament and also put you in the driver’s seat of Toyota cars.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Forza Horizon 5</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza Horizon 5 has the rare distinction of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-review"><u>getting a 10 from IGN</u></a>, and it finished as the runner-up in our fan-voted tournament, so we think it’s safe to call this one of the best racing games ever made. One of its many strengths is the dizzying number of cars in its roster. It had more than 500 vehicles at launch, and DLCs and seasonal additions have brought that number to more than 900 in the nearly four years since it released. That includes 32 different models of Toyota, ranging from classic sports cars like the 1974 Celica GT to pickup trucks like the 2020 Tundra TRD Pro to rally cars like the 2021 GR Yaris to modern sports cars like the 2022 GR86.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Gran Turismo 7</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gran Turismo 7 won the Simulation region of our tournament and made it to the Final Four before being ousted by Forza Horizon 5. It was a very close battle between the two, so this is clearly a beloved title. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gran-turismo-7-review"><u>IGN gave it a 9</u></a>, so we’re big fans too. Like the game that defeated it, GT7 also sports an incredible number of different cars. It had 424 cars at launch and has since brought that number to more than 500, which includes 41 Toyota models. In addition to the kinds of sports cars, rally cars, and pickups that are present in Forza Horizon 5, there are also LMP1 cars like the TS030 Hybrid ’12 and TS050 Hybrid ’16, as well as concept cars like the FT-1 and FT-1 VGT.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Forza Motorsport 4</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza Motorsport 4 might be 14 years old, but it still holds up as an outstanding racing game and celebration of all things four-wheeled. It had a tough draw in our tournament, dominating its first-round matchup before having to go up against the juggernaut that is Gran Turismo 7 in the second round. IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/10/06/forza-motorsport-4-review"><u>gave Forza Motorsport 4 a 9.5</u></a>, and like the two games that preceded it on this list, its vast selection of cars was a big reason why. That included 19 different models of Toyotas, highlighted by the S class 2002 Top Secret 0-300 Supra, one of the most powerful Unicorn cars in the game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Project Gotham Racing 2</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Gotham Racing 2 might not have catapulted into mainstream popularity like the previous games on this list, but IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/18/project-gotham-racing-2-2"><u>gave it a 9.5</u></a> and it holds a special place in our hearts, largely because of its focus on style in addition to speed. You earn Kudos points for doing things like powersliding, catching air, driving clean races, and drafting behind opponents. And many goals require that you finish with a certain number of Kudos points, meaning you have to balance driving fast with driving pretty, providing a gameplay experience that separates it from other racing games. That sense of style extended to the cars themselves, too. There were three Toyota models in the game, and they’re all classics: the 1967 2000GT, MR2 Spider, and 1996 Supra.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In what some might have considered a surprise, Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix made it to the quarterfinals of our tournament and put up a solid fight against Forza Horizon 5. This is the updated version of Rockstar’s third game in the series, which added new vehicles, songs, races, maps, updated UI, and brought back Tokyo from Midnight Club 2. It was a marked improvement over said predecessor, and while it was never the fastest or prettiest game around, it more than made up for that with depth and variety. IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/14/midnight-club-3-dub-edition-remix">gave it an 8.8</a>, and it let you drive, customize, and fine-tune the 1998 Toyota Supra Turbo.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/5-standout-racing-games-that-let-you-get-behind-the-wheel-of-a-toyota]]></content:encoded>
