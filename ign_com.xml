Co-founder Markus Mäki will continue to serve as interim CEO until the leadership change takes effect March 1, 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m excited and honored to join Remedy at a pivotal time,” Gaudechon said in a statement. “The studio has a unique creative identity and a strong pipeline. My commitment is to protect what makes it special, deliver exceptional games, and scale Remedy in a way that builds lasting value.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mäki took over as interim CEO after former Remedy CEO, Tero Virtala, resigned from his position in October 2025. It was a sudden shakeup that arrived after the studio’s summer multiplayer FPS and its first self-published game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fbc-firebreak"><u>FBC: Firebreak</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-admits-fbc-firebreak-underperformed-commercially-we-were-unsatisfied"><u>failed to impress on a commercial</u></a> and critical level (we gave it a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-review"><u>6/10</u></a>). Virtala was with Remedy for just over nine years, leaving the Espoo, Finland-based game company to search for a long-term replacement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We now know Gaudechon has been picked to fill the role. His experience in the industry has seen him serve at EA as a studio head and executive producer over titles like Battlefield Heroes, as well as a general manager and executive producer for Eve Online developer CCP Games. Now, he’ll oversee a company he says “has the voice and the ambition to be a pillar of the industry’s future.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will stay close to players, earn their time and trust, and strengthen our independence in how we build and publish our games, while continuing to work closely with the partners who have supported us along the way,” the soon-to-be CEO added. “I will be moving to Finland with my family and I’m incredibly excited about getting to work directly with the team at the studio.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, fans of Remedy’s work are looking forward to its mind-bending sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-resonant"><u>Control: Resonant</u></a>. Announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-resonant-announced-by-remedy-for-2026-release-the-game-awards-2025"><u>the 2025 Game Awards</u></a>, the follow-up is expected to launch sometime this year for PC and consoles. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-2-in-production-readiness-stage-at-remedy-max-payne-remakes-in-full-production"><u>Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes</u></a> are also in development and expected to launch at an unspecified point in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

The retailer is offering some excellent deals on a selection of PS5 games, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> (<a href="https://zdcs.link/98AvY2?object_uuid=b9970cff-297f-4a1b-8f11-43049189aa1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D4RJGFDT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">down to $30</a>), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QLpv1X?object_uuid=b9970cff-297f-4a1b-8f11-43049189aa1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0F1C14LY8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">down to $40</a>), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> (<a href="https://zdcs.link/9yPA0n?object_uuid=b9970cff-297f-4a1b-8f11-43049189aa1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0F8R7QS54" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">which is down to $25.24 after clipping a coupon</a>), and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are just the start of what's available. Have a look through more of our favorite PS5 games that are currently on sale at Amazon below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Select PS5 Games on Sale at Amazon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes these deals even better is that some of the games above have hit their lowest prices yet at the retailer. Price tracker camelcamelcamel shows that this is the lowest price <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0F1C14LY8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silent Hill f</a>, <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0DDR3VVVP" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Civ VII</a>, <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0FGB66VX5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Double Dragon Revive</a>, and <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0F8R7QS54" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> (with its coupon) have all hit at Amazon so far. Similar to Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, with the help of the coupon on its store page, this also marks a new low price for <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CVSDJNKS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Space Marine 2</a> at the retailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And while it's not the lowest price point it has ever hit at Amazon, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-remake-best-deal-walmart-black-friday">matched its Black Friday price</a>, which is certainly still a deal to celebrate. If you haven't added it to your library yet, now is a great time while it's still on sale for $30.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That applies to all of the available games: This is a great opportunity to scoop them up and save while they're still on sale. They're not the only game deals worth taking advantage of right now, though. If you're looking for more outside of PlayStation, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/humble-choice-february-2026">February’s Humble Choice lineup</a> has dropped for PC players as well, offering the chance to add 8 games to your digital library for just $15 when you sign up for a Humble Choice membership. This month leads with Resident Evil Village, which is definitely worth grabbing ahead of Resident Evil: Requiem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-has-an-excellent-sale-on-select-ps5-games-today]]></content:encoded>
