            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> finally has a new update with much-needed performance improvements and tweaks to the difficulty settings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda said update 1.2 focuses on fixes for quests, gameplay, and performance, and includes new damage settings. 1.2 won’t roll out to all platforms just yet, Bethesda added, but it will be released today, July 9, on Steam Beta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A performance patch was much needed. Oblivion Remastered has enjoyed a hugely successful launch, with over 4 million players and a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam (although that's since fallen to 'mostly positive'). However, if there’s one issue that continues to crop up, it’s performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-revisited-profound-problems-have-yet-to-be-addressed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> found Oblivion Remastered on consoles to have significant problems across the board. DF’s Thomas Morgan said of Virtuos’ Unreal Engine 5 overhaul:</p><blockquote>No platform is spared of issues: whether it's PS5, PS5 Pro, or either Xbox Series machine, all struggle with traversal hitches while roaming the open world. Secondly, there's major sub-60fps frame-rates, where I've also discovered that performance slowly degrades with more playing time — quite possibly down to a memory leak. And finally, software freezes are the icing on the cake, with all PlayStation and Xbox platforms crashing to the system menu on loading a save one too many times.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">How does this manifest itself in-game? According to DF, a “charged” playthrough with more continuous play time behind it performs worse than a fresh boot. Cycling through saves also introduces bugs in the charged playthrough, Morgan revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And this is particularly curious: this also leads to the camera position being too high while riding horseback. You can fix this by resetting the game. The update 1.2 patch notes, below, include "Fixed player character height scaling," which may be a fix for this specific issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a dire position for any remaster to be in and developer Virtuos needs to address the game's stability - the crashes - as a priority,” DF continued. That’s a damning assessment of Oblivion on console, but what about PC? DF called PC performance “dire.” It’s worth checking out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-is-one-of-the-worst-performing-pc-games-weve-ever-tested" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DF’s analysis in full</u></a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>.

The special box is now available again for just £44.99, marked down from its usual market value of £84.95, but you’ll need to request an invite to purchase.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h2><div catalogid="5ff3030f-51b6-4106-a2b6-6e881ad1e801" id="224714"><div id="224714" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This limited, invite-only system is the same approach Amazon UK previously used for high-demand sets like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-amazon-invite-requests-151-and-prismatic-evolutions-sets-uk">151 and Prismatic Evolutions</a>. It’s a strategy aimed at cutting out scalpers and ensuring real collectors have a fair shot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather than competing against bots or watching third-party prices skyrocket, Amazon’s invite model gives fans the opportunity to buy at retail, without the usual stress. While receiving an invite doesn’t guarantee a purchase, it significantly improves your chances over a general public listing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar with the Destined Rivals expansion from Scarlet &amp; Violet, the Elite Trainer Box includes everything needed to dive into the set. Inside, you’ll find:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>9 Destined Rivals booster packs </li><li>1 full-art foil Wobbuffet promo card</li><li>65 themed card sleeves</li><li>45 Energy cards</li><li>Player’s guide, damage-counter dice, flip coins, markers, and a collector’s box with dividers</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this makes it ideal for both new players and seasoned collectors looking to build their collection if they haven't had chance to partake in the expansion yet.

Head to Amazon UK, sign in with your account, and hit the “Request Invite” button on the Destined Rivals ETB product page to be in with a chance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do recieve a "you've been invited" email, you'll have 72 hours to make your purchase before the offer lapses.

Further technical enhancements for the PS5 Pro are also in development, the developer said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stalker 2 launched in November 2024 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-launches-big-on-steam-as-dev-promises-fixes-for-rough-edges"><u>a positive reception on Steam</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-already-sold-1-million-copies-with-many-more-playing-on-xbox-game-pass"><u>1 million sales</u></a>.

A-Life was a key feature of the first Stalker game that governed AI behavior across the game world. At a high level, it is a system for simulating life in the Zone that works its magic seemingly independently of the player’s actions or whereabouts. It helps to create convincing AI and the emergent gameplay Stalker is famous for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC had said A-Life 2.0 would make the Zone feel alive as never before, that it would fuel emergent gameplay on a scale previously thought impossible. Indeed for some fans, A-Life 2.0 was Stalker 2’s biggest selling point. But when Stalker 2 actually came out players discovered that A-Life 2.0 didn’t work properly, with some questioning whether it was even in the game at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN in December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam"><u>GSC explained what went wrong with Stalker 2’s A-Life 2.0</u></a>, and vowed to fix the system.

"Players peaked in the week of May 25 and then started to fall back a bit.

When we asked Piscatella for comment, he noted that Elden Ring: Nightreign and the original Elden Ring weren't really comparable sales-wise, due to being very different games sold at very different prices. "That being said, Nightreign launch unit sales did not reach the same neighborhood as those of Elden Ring."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was followed closely by debut game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> at No. 2, which is also now the 16th best-selling game of 2025. As with Nightreign, The Dark Ages didn't hit the sales heights of its predecessor, Doom: Eternal, but according to Piscatella, "this is more timing than anything. Doom Eternal launched in March 2020... and nothing is going to ever comp well to any new game that launched in March of 2020."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New games F1 25 and Capcom Fighting Collection 2 debuted at No. 15 and No. 19, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, spending on video game content was up 2% year-over-year to $3.7 billion, largely driven by subscription spending on non-mobile platforms, according to analysis by Circana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hardware spending dropped by 13% year-over-year in May, to $172 million, with Nintendo Switch dollar sales dropping 44%, Xbox Series dropping 30%, and PlayStation growing 3%.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Continuing development is not sustainable..."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The live service bloodbath continues — this time the casualty is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a>, the mech shooter game from the people behind World of Tanks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Steel Hunters launched on April 2 in early access form on Steam. Some had hoped for Titanfall vibes from this free-to-play, PvPvE shooter, but it fell completely flat. And just three months later, developer Wargaming has announced plans to sunset the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post addressing Steel Hunter’s community, Wargaming said the game’s servers will live on for another three months before the game goes dark permanently from October 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Today we share difficult news: we've made the decision to sunset Steel Hunters,” Wargaming’s statement began. “You've given us so much passion and support but unfortunately we've come to the conclusion that continuing development is not sustainable. We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear and we genuinely share in your disappointment.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what went wrong? Amid the difficulties so many live service games have endured in recent times,  Steel Hunters failed to capture an audience. It launched on Steam with a peak of 4,479 concurrent players and a ‘mixed’ user review rating, and it was downhill from there. At the time of this article’s publication, the 24-hour peak was 97, with just 52 concurrent players — that’s devastating for any free-to-play game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/rakura/recommended/1691340/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top user review on Steam</a>, from a player with over 300 hours on Steel Hunters including its various pre-launch forms, lamented the potential of the game, and praised its mech design and maps. However, they critisized Wargaming's lack of a roadmap, slow pace of updates, and various bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Early access should have never happened," they said. "We should have never left beta. Time and time again the players have been vocal about changes or fixes that were needed and have come to the table with very helpful solutions only to be met with 'we are moving forward' only to then react with 'why did it go south?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Live service video games are enduring a tough time right now, with a number of titles falling by the wayside or finding themselves canceled before launch. Sony’s Concord is perhaps the highest-profile example of that, a PlayStation disaster that cost the gaming business hundreds of millions of dollars. But only last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say">Microsoft canceled an unannounced MMORPG from the developer of The Elder Scrolls Online</a>, resulting in hundreds of layoffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

I’m never bored.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
