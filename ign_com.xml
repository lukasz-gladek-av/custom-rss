            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/2024-was-a-slow-year-for-our-fastest-genre<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Around this time last year I criticised The Game Awards for continually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-best-sports-racing-category-is-an-insult-to-both-genres"><u>forcing racing games to share a common category with sports games</u></a>, to compete for recognition at what’s described (by The Game Awards) as “gaming’s biggest night.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up until this year it was an award no traditional sports game had ever actually won. The category had been totally dominated by racing games, with the exception of 2015 (Rocket League, which still has cars in it) and 2020 (Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2, which is still… on wheels). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year FC 25 got the gong. Just a single racing game made the shortlist: F1 24. A great racing game, no doubt, but one that’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-24-review"><u>hard to argue was an immediately essential upgrade</u></a> for those who already owned F1 23, or F1 22, or so on. What else could’ve made it? Monster Jam Showdown? Good fun (which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-jam-showdown-review"><u>shouldn’t be surprising</u></a> given the developer’s recent form with the Hot Wheels Unleashed series) but I wouldn’t fancy its chances at The Game Awards. Le Mans Ultimate? Well, that’s still ostensibly in Steam Early Access, even though they’re… already selling in-game DLC before the game’s officially “finished.” Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review"><u>No chance.</u></a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sad reality is there simply weren’t enough racing games released in 2024, full stop. For the first time I can remember in my nearly 14 years at IGN, we didn’t even hand out an award for the year’s best racer. There just weren’t enough of them to even pad out a list of finalists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sad stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, for clarity, I <em>have </em>had a number of fresh reasons to slide behind a steering wheel this year, but the bulk of these opportunities have arrived as updates to existing racing games I already own. Most months of 2024 have seen an injection of new cars and content for Gran Turismo 7. As is usually the case with GT, not <em>all </em>those cars have had a solid racing pedigree, but I won’t pretend I’m not at least mildly interested in seeing how fast an eight-year-old Toyota Hiace can lap the Nordschleife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A 2024 expansion to EA Sports WRC added several new cars and two new countries: Latvia and Poland. The new countries feature some excellent stages, and it makes a lot more sense for Codemasters to improve WRC this way than immediately put it on a yearly, F1-style cadence (if only the asking price for the DLC wasn’t as uncomfortably close to the cost of an entirely new game anyway).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I won’t pretend I’m not at least mildly interested in seeing how fast an eight-year-old Toyota Hiace can lap the Nordschleife</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side, The Crew Motorfest literally became 50% larger for free, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-crew-motorfest-official-season-5-launch-trailer">all players getting access to the entire island of Maui</a>, added to Motorfest in November. Maui is not a bespoke area; it’s been seamlessly injected into the game’s existing world (and developer Ivory Tower has even added a fantasy connecting bridge, meaning you have a choice to either fly, boat, or drive to Maui from O’ahu without any loading screens. It admittedly hasn’t turned me into a Motorfest regular, but there <em>are </em>some satisfying stretches of road and some nice areas on Maui – which is obviously a lot quieter than the more densely-populated O’ahu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown has grown in a similar fashion with its Ibiza expansion (although don’t expect a bridge from Hong Kong to the Mediterranean). Solar Crown’s Ibiza map is a fairly small section of the island that may come as a nostalgic bonus for those players who recall blasting around the Spanish party paradise in 2011’s Test Drive Unlimited 2, but it’s hard to say whether it’ll turn around Solar Crown’s slow start. The map, after all, wasn’t Solar Crown’s main problem.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mount Panorama has finally found its way back into Forza Motorsport in its most-recent update, but I have to admit I’m extremely disappointed with all the fake sponsors used throughout the track. It just makes it appear totally inauthentic compared to Bathurst in Assetto Corsa Competizione, Gran Turismo 7, and even Forza Motorsport 7 – all of which feature real sponsors. It feels like a bizarre step backwards for the series, but hopefully it can be redressed. The update arrived along with a bunch of antipodean automobiles that have largely been seen in the series before, but nonetheless appeal to me as a dedicated Australian meathead. There’s only one new car, but it <em>is </em>a great one: a 1991 HSV Commodore VN Group A SV. If there’s one thing I like more than Australian cars, it’s the 1990s, so this fills both of those criteria. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/21/forza-vn-commodore-1734777778443.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Despite its faults, Forza Motorsport's garage philosophy is still more global than GT or NFS.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And speaking of the ’90s, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/need-for-speed-unbound-vol-9-official-reveal-trailer">Need for Speed Unbound just added a motorbike</a>, which is a surprising and impressive first for a series that’s literally celebrating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/need-for-speed-turns-30-the-lasting-legacy-of-eas-fastest-franchise"><u>30 years since its 1994 debut this month.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, sure, there’s been plenty of tinkering still going on beneath the bonnets of most of the biggest racers in the business, but very little new blood in the genre in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s worrisome, particularly as younger generations continue to exhibit an increasing disinterest in cars in general, but I do think 2024 is probably just an aberration.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Greatest Racing Games Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I say this because 2025 is looking extremely exciting in the racing space. Assetto Corsa Evo promises to be one of the biggest racers of the year and, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/massive-open-world-map-confirmed-for-assetto-corsa-evo"><u>1,600-square kilometre open world map</u></a> in development for it, I do mean that literally. JDM: Japanese Drift Master from Polish studio Gaming Factory has shown promise for some time, and you can already check out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364930/JDM_Rise_of_the_Scorpion/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>free demo of this on Steam now.</u></a> Tokyo Xtreme Racer is set to return after a nearly 20-year absence. Project CARS spiritual successor Project Motor Racing is scheduled to arrive in 2025. It’s got the Lister Storm in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes please.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s just some of what we know about already. Will Wreckfest 2 arrive in 2025? The planned release date for that is yet to be confirmed, but that should be something special. Is 2025 the year we hear about the future of Forza Horizon? Next year will mark four years since Forza Horizon 5, after all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, I’ll see you at the starting line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-team-fortress-2-comic-has-released-its-long-awaited-final-issue<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Team Fortress 2 comic has just released its newest update, seven years since the last issue and seemingly the finale to this long journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Fortress 2 Issue 7 "The Days Have Worn Away" is the first update to the online digital comic series since January 10, 2017, and it looks like it might just be the comic's finale based on this tweet from Valve writer Erik Wolpaw.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Pic from the last tf comics meeting ever. (not pictured: Ira Crosby) <a href="https://t.co/snfI2KiM27" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/snfI2KiM27</a></p>— Erik Wolpaw (@Wolpaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wolpaw/status/1870213443221106918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Did you know the construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was one hundred and ninety nine years late? Literally everyone alive when construction started was dead by the time it finished," The Team Fortress 2 team writes in a <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=235677" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post </a>announcing the new issue. A perhaps more extreme example of something taking a long time to complete than this comic, but an apt analogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For fans of Team Fortress 2, you'll find the gang all here including a newly married Soldier and even a maskless Spy. The issue also has a dedication to Rick May, the voice of Soldier who died in 2020 at the age of 79. The story itself concludes a long, winding journey that TF2 fans have been waiting a long time to see updated, so I won't spoil the rest of the comic here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The comics have served as an invaluable tome to find out more about the different TF2 characters, especially background characters like Miss Pauling and The Administrator. The comics are very much worth a full read if you haven't checked them out already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve is continuing the trend of emerging from what seems like some kind of gaming hibernation, first with the release of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a> and the testing of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valve-steam-announcement-page">new hero shooter, Deadlock</a>. This new comic issue serves that Valve creatives are still tinkering in the background, working on new stories for our favorite games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.
