            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's what we know.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A</a> on my Switch 2 since it was first released and have loved every minute of it. The game takes place entirely in Lumiose City and I've found that it runs beautifully on the new console. Whether you're catching PokÃ©mon in the wild zones or diving into intense battles, everything looks crisp and gameplay is perfectly smooth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't actually need to own a Switch 2 to play PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A, though. The standard Switch version is now available for $10 less than its Switch 2 counterpart. So if you're a PokÃ© fan who hasn't yet taken the plunge and purchased the latest console, you don't have to miss out on the latest PokÃ©mon adventure. The real question is: How well does the Switch 1 version actually run? IGN had the chance to play the game on both consoles side-by-side and it would seem the older console is quite capable of running the game â€“ with the exception of some frame rate loss. You can check out our comparison below to see for yourself how the two versions of the game stack up against each other.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Upgrade?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like we noted in our comparison video, the differences between the two versions of the game are noticeable, but not so vast that you really <em>need</em> to upgrade to play the game. If you want the best possible gameplay experience with the sharpest possible visuals, then I'd say it's absolutely worth upgrading to the Switch 2. If you don't want to dish out the $450 for a new console, however, the Switch 1 version of the game will work just fine. The environments will be a little less detailed and some of the PokÃ©mon may look a bit stilted in their movements, but overall the experience will still be fun.</p><div catalogid="f068ae83-e47c-49c5-b680-e7171e09803f" id="225667"><div id="225667" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 - Pokemon Legends: Z-A Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who did upgrade to the Switch 2, I'd say the value in such an upgrade is more about future games than this current in-between period. Nintendo will continue to release <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">upcoming Switch games</a> on both consoles, but eventually the older hardware won't be able to handle the latest releases. This has already been the case for games like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, which are both Switch 2 exclusives. And while <em>this</em> PokÃ©mon game is available on both consoles, I can almost guarantee that the next mainline game in the series won't be able to run on the original Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This brings some added value to something like the latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/All_Switch_2_Bundles">Switch 2 bundle</a> because it gets you the Switch 2 version of the game at a slight discount when you buy the bundle alongside it. So even though PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A doesn't necessarily require an upgrade, it's still a potential reason to purchase the next generation console. This is especially true when you consider that Nintendo has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-us-price-rises-for-original-switch-warns-price-rises-for-switch-2-games-and-the-nso-membership-may-be-necessary-in-the-future">already raised the price of the original Switch</a> and warned that the price of the Switch 2 will also likely increase down the line.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">You can always purchase a Switch 2 upgrade later</h3></div><div catalogid="53fafc1c-dc52-4e84-9598-afe719211c50" id="222303"><div id="222303" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PokÃ©mon Legends Z-A (Switch 2)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are planning on playing PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A on the original Switch, it's worth noting that you can choose to purchase the Switch 2 upgrade for the game down the line. If you start playing the Switch 1 version and end up purchasing a Switch 2 later on, all you need to do is purchase the $10 upgrade pack to access better graphics and performance. Considering the cost of the Switch 2 version is only $10 more than the Switch 1 edition, you won't be paying more by taking this route.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 20, 2025 6:37 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/should-you-upgrade-to-a-nintendo-switch-2-to-play-pokemon-legends-z-a]]></content:encoded>

Gameplay for this Futurama mod also feels familiar, as you run around as Fry and complete missions for characters such as Bender, Professor Farnsworth and Dr. Zoidberg. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="fr" dir="ltr">ANNONCE ðŸ“£ ðŸŽ® : La dÃ©mo de Futurama Hit &amp; Run, sera disponible le 19 octobre ! Une idÃ©e juste parfaite ! ðŸš€ <a href="https://t.co/cy8WBhoLYL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/cy8WBhoLYL</a></p>â€” Mooonaa ðŸ’• (@lycheemoona) <a href="https://twitter.com/lycheemoona/status/1979533450718716390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">There's driving too, of course â€” with Fry able to zoom around a section of New New York in a hover car. One particular mission has Fry escorting Bender back to the Planet Express headquarters while avoiding police in hover cop cars. But there's no sign yet of actual flying â€” perhaps in future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, the demo includes four story missions, plus a set of street races, vehicles, costumes and other Easter eggs to find and unlock. The demo also comes with an acknowledgement that it currently uses AI-generated dialogue as a "temporary placeholder." The mod team states: "Professional voice artists are already engaged, and their recordings will replace the placeholder content in a future update."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 25 Futurama Episodes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Response to the demo has been positive, not least from Joe McGinn, who worked on the original The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run over two decades ago. "As the lead designer of the original game, I can only say... this looks awesome!" McGinn wrote in a comment on the mod's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKPz3PE7_4s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a>. "I want to play it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/matt-selman-simpsons-hit-and-run-remake">Fans have long hoped for another Simpsons game</a>, and previously cheered on a separate unofficial Hit &amp; Run project that looked set to remake the entire title in Unreal Engine 5. Alas, that idea ran into legal issues with Disney, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/awesome-looking-the-simpsons-hit-and-run-fan-remake-is-complete-but-it-will-never-be-released">its creator has now said the finished version will never be released</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there may well be something new and official for The Simpsons fans to play in the not-too-distant future, as the franchise's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-simpsons-long-rumored-fortnite-mini-season-now-feels-imminent-as-kang-and-kodos-turn-up-in-game">long-awaited Fortnite mini-season now finally appears to be near</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
