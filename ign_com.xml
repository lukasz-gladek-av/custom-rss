Starring Rahul Kohli, Saros is arriving in 2026 for PlayStation 5, and enhanced for PS5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Revealed during today's PlayStation State of Play, Saros certainly looks like a Housemarque game. As Arjun Devraj, a Solatri enforcer searching for answers on a dangerous, shifting planet haunted by an eclipse and at least one very large, powerful being, it certainly has the air of Returnal about it. The phrase "come back stronger" definitely makes one think of roguelikes, and the spread of fireballs evokes Housemarque's bullet-hell tendencies.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative director Gregory Louden calls Saros the "ultimate evolution" of the Housemarque gameplay-first experience. It's a new single-player IP, but builds on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/returnal-review">Returnal's third-person action</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not exactly the same thing all over again, though. Over on the PlayStation Blog, Louden said a key gameplay distinction between Saros and Returnal is in permanent resources and progression. The world changes upon the player's death in Saros, but players will also be able to permanently upgrade their arsenal of weapons and suits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More info is expected later this year, as Housemarque plans to show a first extended look at gameplay later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">everything shown today during the PlayStation State of Play, be sure to check out our recap here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Musashi's face has apparently been modeled after Toshiro Mifune, the late, iconic Japanese movie star who has played Musashi in samurai movies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Way of the Sword will take place in Kyoto which has been taken over by an evil force known as Malic which is summoning Hell and its residents into Japan.
