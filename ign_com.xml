            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-insists-it-wont-release-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-close-to-each-other<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two is set for a pretty 12 months, with Rockstar’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> and Gearbox’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> just two of the massive games due to launch during the 2026 fiscal year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reporting its most recent financials, Take-Two insisted GTA 6 is still on course for launch during fall 2025, despite ongoing speculation that Rockstar may delay the game into 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Take-Two’s publishing label, 2K, is set to release another crucial game, Borderlands 4, during the same fiscal year (at some point between April 1, 2025 and March 31, 2026).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is there a danger, then, that GTA 6 will eat Borderlands 4’s lunch? Not so, according to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick. Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Zelnick said that while he couldn’t offer a release date for GTA 6, the guaranteed megahit won’t cross paths with Borderlands 4. “I think it’s safe to say that we wouldn’t, and no one would, stack up huge releases unnecessarily,” Zelnick said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this mean for Borderlands 4’s release date? Well, in order for it to get out of the way of GTA 6 (assuming GTA 6 does indeed release fall 2025), and to fit in with the next fiscal year, it would either have to launch in the April to June 2025 quarter or the January to March 2026 quarter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If GTA 6 does release at some point between September and December next year, Take-Two will probably want at least a three-month gap between it and Borderlands 4, forcing Borderlands 4 into late spring to early summer 2025, or late winter to early spring 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 won’t be the only game desperate to avoid being dragged into the black hole GTA 6 creates within the video game industry. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, in development at 2K's Hangar 13, is also due out at some point in 2025. Then there are all the big games coming from other publishers. GTA 6 will probably be the biggest video game launch of all time, so no other game is safe from its gravitational pull. Even the might of Call of Duty, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-reportedly-a-black-ops-2-sequel-set-around-2030">set to launch yet another premium iteration around October or November 2025</a>, will be sorely tested by GTA 6.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Concept Art - PAX West 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Take-Two news, the company has sold indie publisher Private Division to an unknown buyer in the wake of shuttering Roll7 and Intercept Games, saying it wants to focus on its core and mobile businesses going forward. While virtually all of Private Division's live and unreleased games will go to the new buyer, Take-Two said it will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-rest-for-the-wicked-review-early-access">continue to support No Rest for the Wicked</a>, the recently-released action RPG from Moon Studios that's currently in early access.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Developer Creatures Inc. explained that emblem events will let players take on others with emblems, Shinedust, and other items on the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Four tiers of emblems, which can be displayed on a player's profile, will be available: a Participation Emblem for one win, a Bronze Emblem for five wins, a Silver Emblem for 25 wins, and a Gold Emblem for 45 wins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players must choose the specific event battle mode to gain wins towards the event total, though these just award the regular 15 experience points for a win. Event missions have also been added to Pokémon TCG Pocket though, with players able to obtain Shinedust and Pack Hourglasses for completing event battles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This first Emblem Event isn't quite a full competitive mode for Pokémon TCG Pocket but is certainly a step in that direction. It will also be the first proper competitive test of which decks are best, with both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo ex and Charizard ex having dominated so far</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October as a streamlined, digital version of the beloved trading card game. It has players opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others;</a> a simple formula that's already proved popular given it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">$12 million in four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is perhaps because, without spending money, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">it will take close to two years to collect every card in just the first set</a>.

I would like to thank all the fans who have stayed connected with us as well as everyone in the Xbox community who have been patiently waiting. Kojima Productions (Death Stranding) will continue to connect more and more players around the world, so please stay tuned.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Death Stranding Director’s Cut challenges players to reconnect a fractured society after the cataclysmic ‘Death Stranding’ event. This has opened a doorway between the living and the dead, leading to creatures from the afterlife roaming the fallen world marred by a desolate society. Carrying the disconnected remnants of humanity’s future in his hands, players take the role of Sam Bridges as he embarks on a mission to deliver hope to humanity by connecting the last survivors of a decimated America.</blockquote><blockquote>Director’s Cut is the definitive experience which also introduces a new ‘Ruined Factory’ location, a treacherous underground compound packed with fresh dangers. Sam also now has a wealth of new delivery assists, from cargo catapults and ramps, to a stabiliser which features thrusters that assist with cargo weight shifts and reduce the impact of landing when jumping from high areas. Melee combat has been amped up with the addition of more moves including a drop kick, whilst the new Maser Gun can stun enemies and short-circuit vehicles temporarily with electricity. Finding the perfect weapon loadout is now achievable thanks to the new firing range location, whilst the new Racetrack enables players to race and compete in time-attack competitions against other players who are connected online. Protagonist Sam Bridges can even ride Buddy Bots to traverse the wastelands with greater ease.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a busy time for Kojima and for Death Stranding. Its sequel, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, is due out as a Sony-published PS5 exclusive in 2025, and a movie based on the first game is in the works. Elsewhere, Kojima is working on OD for Xbox Game Studios, and Physint for Sony Interactive Entertainment. Could Death Stranding's launch on Xbox signal an eventual Xbox release for Death Stranding 2 further down the line?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-youtuber-accidentally-leaves-12-hour-147-round-zombies-run-live-on-stream-instead-of-saving-and-quitting<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I'm in pain."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty Zombies YouTuber MrRoflWaffles had a disastrous end to a high round Black Ops 6 run, leaving the game at round 147 and after 12 hours of play rather than saving and quitting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6’s round-based Zombies mode sees players face off against endless waves of the baddies in a bid to reach ever higher levels of difficulty. Saving in Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode is only available to solo players, and you can only save one solo match at a time, which means if you leave the match without saving, there is no save to return to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MrRoflWaffles, who has 2.11 million subscribers on YouTube, set out to break his personal best of round 141 and to hit round 200 before the disastrous mistake put an end to the attempt.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">do NOT do this on round 147 in black ops 6 zombies 😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/QftwaSjISE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/QftwaSjISE</a></p>— Milo (@MrRoflWaffles) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrRoflWaffles/status/1854317500126626153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The disaster began when a confident MrRoflWaffles signaled his intention to save and quit then load back into the match. "This is how this works chat," he declared. "You quit the game, you reload in, and you try not to get bugs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MrRoflWaffles, perhaps moving too fast through Black Ops 6’s pause menu for his own good, accidentally selected ‘leave match’ rather than ‘save and quit.’ Despite the ‘leave game?’ warning pop up, MrRoflWaffles proceeded, putting an end to the run forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, MrRoflWaffles’ chat couldn’t believe what they’d witnessed, with various messages of disbelief littering the screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Realization then kicked in, and, as you’d expect, MrRoflWaffles couldn’t believe what he’d done. “I left?!” he said. “What?! What?! What?! Are you kidding me?! You’re kidding me! You’re joking chat. Noooooooo!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“12 hours of my life,” MrRoflWaffles eventually sighed after a period of silence. “The bugs won. I’d rather have fought the bugs! I can’t believe I just did that. I’m in pain.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, who’s to blame? MrRoflWaffles for accidentally pressing the wrong button, or developer Treyarch for putting the 'leave match' and 'save and quit' buttons right next to each other in the Zombies pause menu? For his part, MrRoflWaffles said it was entirely his mistake, but called on Treyarch to make the leave match button a 'hold for three seconds' selection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I really want to blame Treyarch for putting the leave button next to the save button,” MrRoflWaffles said. “I want to blame them, but honestly this is my fault. I pressed the button.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/07/screenshot-2024-11-07-095630-1730977686676.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">MrRoflWaffles reacts in disbelief after accidentally ending his Black Ops 6 Zombies run. Image credit: MrRoflWaffles / YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a desperate bid to save the run, MrRoflWaffles pulled the power cable and ethernet cord out of his Xbox, hoping Black Ops 6 would somehow forget what had transpired. But, alas, the game remembered. No save files were available upon loading back in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A clearly devastated MrRoflWaffles decided to end his stream early, saying that starting all over again “tilted” would only cause him to die early on in a subsequent run. But he insisted he would continue his bid to hit round 200 — perhaps once he’s had a lie down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking on Zombies mode yourself?

I was especially touched by the wonderful reception we received at gamescom, and it was incredible to see everyone creating such unique Zois during our 'inZOI: Character Studio' demo period.</blockquote><blockquote>Initially, we were uncertain about introducing 'Canvas' to the world, not knowing how many people would actually participate. However, the turnout was amazing, with an enormous number of uploads. Seeing so much engagement brought us immense happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with inZOI. Your feedback and insights made us realize the responsibility we have to provide players with the most complete experience possible.</blockquote><blockquote>This message is about that realization. After reviewing your feedback from inZOI: Character Studio and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have decided to release inZOI in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we couldn't bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving inZOI the best possible start.</blockquote><blockquote>It's said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care required to nurture a child to adulthood is how I see our journey with inZOI — a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date reflects our commitment to building a stronger foundation for inZOI, so we can embark on this journey in the best way possible.</blockquote><blockquote>Until the release date, we'll continue working to improve any areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation. Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for a long time to come.
