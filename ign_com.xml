Time to choose your Nightfarer and set out into Limveld in hopes of defeating the Nightlord before you’re lost to the rains. We’ve teamed up with Maxroll to bring you a variety of guides to help you get started, introduce you to each of the Nightfarers and help you navigate the dangers of Limveld.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Getting Started in Nightreign</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/getting-started/elden-ring-nightreign-beginners-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nightreign <u>beginner's guide</u></a> goes over everything you need to get started: an introduction to each of the 8 playable characters, an explanation of the game's central hub, nagivating Limveld, the basics of combat, and how to handle the Nightlords, before wrapping everything up with a bit of information on Nightreign's metaprogression systems.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Maxroll Nightreign Character Guides</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Learn more about each of the game’s Nightfarers, how their skills work, and some additional information about each of their unique playstyles.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Wylder</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-2-wylder-1748614589634.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Wylder is a well-rounded character, suitable for beginners. His Sixth Sense passive allows you to cheat death and stay up through one instance of fatal damage. As a generalist, he doesn't excel with any specific weapons, but can use most martial armaments. His favorite weapon is the Greatsword.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/wylder-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wylder Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Guardian</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-3-guardian-1748614612549.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Guardian is Nightreign's tank class. He's most comfortable wielding a large shield and a weapon that can be used while guarding, such as a Halberd, Rapier, or Hand Crossbow. The Guardian deals less damage than the other Nightfarers, but has immense durability and multiple ways to disrupt foes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/guardian-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Guardian Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ironeye</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-4-ironeye-1748614631528.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Ironeye is the bow specialist, though his high Dexterity makes him proficient with a variety of other melee weapons such as daggers and curved swords. Unfortunately, his low durability makes him a poor choice as a front-line fighter, so use melee weapons with caution. Overall, his abilities are simple to use, making him an excellent choice for beginners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/ironeye-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ironeye Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Duchess</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-5-duchess-1748614659315.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Duchess is a dagger-wielding Nightfarer who excels at evasive action to weave in and out of combat. Her starting weapon comes with a potent character skill, enchanting your blade with the Magic affinity for extra damage. In addition, she can adeptly wield Glintstone Sorceries due to her high intelligence, and she has decent Faith scaling for Incantations as well. For the Duchess, look out for weapons with the Magic or Frost Affinity, and those that can trigger statuses like Frostbite or Blood Loss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/duchess-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Duchess Character Guide</u></a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Raider</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-6-raider-1748614679688.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Raider has high Strength and uses large/colossal weapons to smash his foes. While he can use a variety of martial armaments well, his FP is extremely low, making it difficult to use weapon skills. The Raider's inherent durability makes him difficult to stagger, helping him ensure that his blows connect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/raider-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Raider Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Revenant</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-7-revenant-1748614720933.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Revenant is a support class, though her high Faith allows her to use offensive Incantations with ease. However, her ability to deal damage is limited as she has no method of FP recovery. Her passive ability summons the shades of foes to fight at your side, distracting enemies and dealing damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/revenant-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Revenant Character Guide</u></a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Recluse</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-8-recluse-1748614743897.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A spellcaster adept who can use her character skill to restore FP, the Recluse excels at unleashing devastation from afar. Her stats favor Sorceries and Incantations, but she can use Magic, Frost, Fire, Holy, and Lightning affinity weapons. This character is a bit more difficult to play as you don't have as many defensive options, and need to manage FP in addition to your Health and Stamina. However, if you do everything correctly, she deals significant damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/recluse-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Recluse Character Guide</u></a></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Executor</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-9-executor-1748614759386.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Executor excels in single combat. He has high Dexterity and Arcane, giving him access to a majority of the game's smaller weapons. Look out for Katanas in particular, as these scale off of Dexterity while also triggering the Blood Loss status to enemies. Position carefully because the Executor has low durability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/characters/executor-character-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Executor Character Guide</u></a></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nightreign Map Guides</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-10-map-1748614774402.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Limveld map is teeming with points of interest to explore. Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/limveld-map-key-locations" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limveld Map &amp; Key Locations guide</a> teaches you about the various encounters, what mob types to expect, and the rewards you can earn for clearing them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you explore, you'll encounter random events known as <strong>Raid Events</strong> which often involve fighting a challenging foe. If you clear the raid, you earn a valuable Power for the remainder of your run; learn more with Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/raid-event-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raid Events guide</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Defeating Nightlords unlocks Shifting Earth events. Each of these events transforms a quadrant of the map into a unique zone, frequently filled with lots of bosses to fight - and similar to Raid Events, they award a special power when cleared. Learn more with <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/shifting-earth-events" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maxroll’s Shifting Earth event guide</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nightreign Resources</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-11-resources-1748614809755.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Explore <strong>Roundtable Hold</strong>, Nightreign’s main hub area. Here, you can switch your characters, perform Relic Rites to prepare for the next expedition, test things in the Sparring ground, read up on the game with the Visual Codex, explore your character’s story at the Journal, and set out from the Table of Lost Grace to do battle against a Nightlord. Learn about all this in Maxroll's <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/roundtable-hold" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roundtable Hold guide.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Relics</strong> and <strong>Vessels</strong> are part of Nightreign’s metaprogression system. At the end of each run, you earn Relics and Murk, which you can spend at the Small Jar Bazaar. Some Relics have random affixes that may or may not be useful, whereas others (often earned through character quests or by defeating bosses) have fixed stats and are quite powerful. As you progress in the game, you also unlock additional Vessels, letting you equip a different Relic combination on your Nightfarer. Learn more about this system with Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/relics-vessels-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relics and Vessels guide</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the Sorceries and Incantations in Nightreign belong to a specific Spell School. The Spell School determines which modifiers buff your spells - for example, a Glintstone Sorcery won't benefit from bonuses to Godslayer Incantations. This isn't very clearly explained, though, so if you’re curious on how to buff your Spells, check out Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/guides/incantation-sorcery-types" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sorcery and Incantation School Guide</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Maxroll's Nightreign Database</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/nightreign-12-database-1748614846283.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Browse Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/elden-ring-nightreign/getting-started/elden-ring-nightreign-beginners-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign Database</strong></u></a> to learn more about the Weapons, skills, spells, Relics, Vessels, Relic modifiers, Talismans, passive traits, and Nightfarers available in the game.
