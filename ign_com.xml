He most recently hung out with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZWKbHKCUkpw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinda Funny Games</a> for a chat and was asked if there was a favorite game of his that was pitched but never made, to which he gave his answer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, I’ll share one. Resistance 4.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Price, he and the developers “did pitch that one and it was a wonderful concept, and it just in terms of timing and market opportunity, didn’t work out.” He added that the Insomniac team were “passionate about extending the story further because I do believe that Resistance has set up a really cool alternate history base where anything can happen with the Chimera and where they go and what their origins are.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resistance is a series of first-person shooters Insomniac developed following their work on the Ratchet and Clank games. Set in an alternate history where aliens invade the UK in 1951. There were three Resistance games made, all for the PlayStation 3 before Insomniac moved on to other projects like Marvel’s Spider-Man and new Ratchet and Clank games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Price announced earlier this year that he will be retiring from Insomniac Games after over 30 years at the company. He has named Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang as Co-Studio Heads who will succeed him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac Games’ most recent title was Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 which just received a PC release, and their next game is set to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-have-to-be-like-logan-today-and-remain-very-stoic-insomniac-quiet-on-whether-wolverine-will-make-2025">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/is-psn-down-february-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">All services related to PlayStation's online network are currently down.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a helpful PSA from us to let you know that PSN is currently down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downdetector</a>, PSN has been suffering from an outage since at least 3pm PST/6pm EST. The PlayStation Network Service <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">page</a> also shows that all services, from sign-in to gaming to the PlayStation Store are all down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888041723831484682" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Sony said it was "aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear when services will resume for PSN, but the outage means that this weekend begins without access to some of your favorite games including Marvel Rivals, Call of Duty, Fortnite, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The situation was bad enough that publishers warned their players about the downtime. NetEase, the company behind Marvel Rivals, told its community via Discord that "due to PlayStation server’s emergent issue today," PlayStation users might have difficulty launching games, apps, or network features. "We are actively communicating with the PlayStation team and will restore the game once we receive a solution plan from the PlayStation team," NetEase continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We apologize for any inconvenience and will notify the community through official channels once the issue is fixed. Thank you for your patience and understanding."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll have an update for when services resume. In the meantime, no other platforms are reporting outages so it appears specific to PSN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
