            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-accounted-for-more-than-half-of-monster-hunter-wilds-total-dollar-sales-in-the-us<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is a smash hit across the globe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-surpasses-8-million-units-sold-in-3-days-and-is-the-fastest-capcom-game-to-do-so">with an incredible 8 million copies sold in just three days</a>. In the U.S., Capcom’s action game is the best-selling game of 2025 so far, and it’s PC in particular that’s dominating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Circana, not only was Monster Hunter Wilds the best-selling game of February, but launch month dollar sales more than doubled the total Monster Hunter: Rise achieved during its March 2021 debut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of February across PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam. But here’s the interesting stat: Steam accounted for more than half of Monster Hunter Wilds’ total dollar sales. That's despite some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-mixed-steam-user-review-rating-capcom-issues-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-troubleshooting-guide">high-profile performance issues on PC that have led to a 'mixed' user review rating for Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Monster Hunter Wilds’ PC success shouldn’t come as a surprise, given PC has become increasingly important for multiplatform releases. Speaking to IGN in a recent interview, Strauss Zelnick, boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40% of overall sales, or even more with certain games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That stat came as part of a discussion about the current console generation. In the U.S., February video game hardware spending fell by 25% when compared to a year ago, to $256 million. That’s the lowest February total for video game hardware spending since the $184 million reached in February 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick pointed to the PC platform as growing in importance while publishers wait for Sony and Microsoft’s next moves and with the Nintendo Switch 2 waiting in the wings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue,” he said. “Of course, there will be a new console generation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is evidence of the trend, then. But it wasn’t the only new release in February to do well. In fact, according to Circana’s data, the top four best-selling games of February 2025 were new releases, with Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Sid Meier’s Civilization VII, and PGA Tour 2K25 joining Monster Hunter Wilds. Other new releases appearing among the month’s top 10 best-sellers included Obsidian’s Avowed, which also launched day-one into Game Pass, and Sega’s Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Circana said the launch month dollar sales total Kingdom Come: Deliverance II reached in February 2025 was more than five times higher than the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance achieved during its February 2018 debut. Embracer Group, parent company of Kingdom Come: Deliverance developer Warhorse Studios, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-shows-no-sign-of-slowing-down-sells-2-million-copies-in-less-than-2-weeks">has already hailed the sequel’s sales success</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">February 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>NEW Monster Hunter: Wilds - Capcom USA</li><li>NEW Kingdom Come: Deliverance II - Plaion</li><li>NEW Civilization VII - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>NEW PGA Tour 2K25 - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>NBA 2K25 - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Microsoft (Corp)</li><li>NEW Avowed - Microsoft (Corp)</li><li>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - Sega</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>Madden NFL 25 - Electronic Arts</li><li>Minecraft - Multiple Video Game Manufacturers</li><li>EA Sports FC 25 - Electronic Arts</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 - Sony (Corp)</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II - Take-Two Interactive</li><li>Hogwarts Legacy - Warner Bros.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-sales-are-outpacing-ps4-in-the-us-xbox-series-x-and-s-lags-well-behind-xbox-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a mixed picture for video game console sales in the United States, with the PlayStation 5 still outpacing its predecessor, the PlayStation 4, but the Xbox Series X and S lagging far behind the Xbox One.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the most recent data from Circana, after each platform’s first 52 months in the market, PS5 unit sales exceed PS4’s sales pace by 7%, while Xbox Series X and S combined now trails Xbox One by 19%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As positive as the picture is for Sony’s console effort in the U.S., especially as it comes without a PS5 price cut, it's yet more depressing news for Microsoft. The Xbox Series consoles have for some time struggled for sales globally, and Microsoft has admitted it lost the so-called console war a long time ago in the face of competition from PlayStation and Nintendo Switch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Xbox Game of 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft, of course, takes a bigger picture view when it comes to determining the success of its gaming business. It looks to PC as a major growth area, is pushing its subscription service Game Pass across multiple devices, and is launching many of its Xbox games on rival consoles in a bid to boost its bottom line. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, for example, will hit PS5 soon, as will Forza Horizon 5. Doom: The Dark Ages, meanwhile, is set to launch on PS5 at the same time as PC and Xbox in May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There have been questions over whether Microsoft might call it a day for Xbox consoles as a result of the failure of the Xbox Series X and S, but the company was recently reported to have green lit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/full-next-gen-xbox-reportedly-set-for-2027-xbox-branded-gaming-handheld-due-out-later-in-2025">a next-gen Xbox for release in 2027, as well as an Xbox handheld during the same year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This console is reportedly a premium successor to the Xbox Series X, and alongside a first-party Xbox gaming handheld and new controllers will allegedly round out Microsoft’s console offering in 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Central</a> reported that the next-gen Xbox will be more like a PC than any Xbox before it, and will support third-party storefronts such as Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG. Continued backwards compatibility is a given.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console"><u>Xbox president Sarah Bond said</u></a> Microsoft was "moving full speed ahead on our next generation hardware, focused on delivering the biggest technological leap ever in a generation."</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is much speculation around the future of consoles generally. As mentioned, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-data-suggests-that-ps5-has-outsold-xbox-series-xs-2-to-1"><u>Xbox Series X and S are floundering</u></a> in the ‘console war,’ and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-entering-the-latter-stage-of-its-life-cycle-sony-says"><u>Sony has suggested PlayStation 5 is approaching the second half of its life</u></a>. While Nintendo is set to launch Switch 2 later this year, there is growing concern that the traditional video game console business could be under threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer has said in interviews that the console business has failed to grow meaningfully in recent years, offering a sizable but static customer base that is increasingly playing a handful of enormous games and leaving little room for everything else. Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore"><u>former Xbox executive Peter Moore told IGN</u></a> that Microsoft would have been discussing whether consoles have a future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Circana’s data, console sales are in a slump right now. February video game hardware spending fell by 25% when compared to a year ago, to $256 million. That’s the lowest February total for video game hardware spending since the $184 million reached in February 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 was once again the best-selling hardware platform of the month across both units and dollars. Xbox Series ranked second in both measures. Accessories spending in February declined by 8% when compared to a year ago, to $220 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The industry overall is having a particularly tough time. February 2025 projected U.S. consumer spending across video game hardware, content, and accessories declined 6% when compared to a year ago, to $4.5 billion. Spending so far this year is 11% lower than at the same point in 2024, at $9.0 billion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video game content spending, specifically, fell 4% compared to a year ago, to $4 billion. Non-mobile subscription spending growth of 9% was offset by declines in mobile (-4%), as well as full game and add-on content spending across both console (-11%), and the PC, cloud and non-console VR (-4%) segments.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there is hope things will improve this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-will-sell-loads-of-switch-2-consoles-at-launch-regardless-of-price-analysts-predict-june-release-date-once-again-mentioned">Some analysts have said the Nintendo Switch 2 could be the biggest console launch of all time irrespective of its price</a>. And then there’s the looming behemoth that is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which is still set for release in fall 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S only, and could end up as the biggest entertainment launch of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Strauss Zelnick, boss of Rockstar parent company Take-Two, has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">he expects GTA 6 to spark a surge in console sales</a>. “When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles,” Zelnick told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar 25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
