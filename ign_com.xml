            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The fate of PlayStation's upcoming live-service game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame"><u>Fairgames</u></a> is once again under scrutiny as its creative director, Daniel Drapeau, has confirmed he has left Haven Studios to join Warner Bros. Games Montreal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the second high-profile exit of the summer, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-woes-continue-as-playstation-executive-jade-raymond-exits-fairgames-developer-after-external-test-sparked-concern]"><u>studio founder Jade Raymond also exiting back in May</u></a>, several weeks after an external playtest reportedly met a lukewarm response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As of this week, I joined WB Games Montreal Inc. as creative director," Drapeau announced in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358635412245868544/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>LinkedIn post</u></a>. "I can't wait to start this wonderful adventure with all the great people here at the studio. I also want to particularly thank Yves Lachance, Logan A. Lesage, and Bryan Theberge for their trust and support throughout the process. Now, let's do this!"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The news follows a rocky time for the game's development, and incorrect industry speculation surrounding its future. Last month, analyst Michael Pachter wrongly claimed the game had been canceled, though was later forced to <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1956792553954771444" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>walk back his statement</u></a> and admit he had "no info on the game at all."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither Haven nor Sony have commented publicly on Drapeau's departure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, the news will hardly restore confidence in PlayStation's embattled live service ambitions. Sony announced plans in February 2022 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-by-2026"><u>launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026</u></a>, later saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-10-live-service-games-will-be-from-different-genres-and-for-different-audiences"><u>the push would bring games of different genres to different audiences</u></a>. It spent big on studio buyouts as part of the drive, bringing in Destiny developer Bungie, the now shuttered Firewalk Studios, and, of course, Haven Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firewalk, you'll remember, was the studio behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Concord</u></a>, one of the biggest disasters in PlayStation history. Just a couple of weeks after it launched to eye-wateringly low player numbers, Sony decided to kill the game entirely and shortly thereafter shut down its development studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us multiplayer game. And earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live-service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side, Arrowhead’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> has been a breakout hit, and became the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fairgames — stylized as Fairgame$ — is described as "a competitive modern heist game where you team up to break into exotic locations and steal the cargo." The twist is that you not only need to outsmart guards and security systems, but you also need to compete against other teams, too. There's no word yet on when it'll launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong"><u>Hollow Knight: Silksong</u></a> will retail for just $19.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there's been a lot of rumors over the last few days — including a $20 price on <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/hollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch/432032.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gamestop</u></a> (since removed) that was later <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/hollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch/432032.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>corroborated</u></a> by noted leaker Billbil-kun — developer Team Cherry has now <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/teamcherry.bsky.social/post/3lxqi3epy3s2p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>confirmed</u></a> it, revealing the game will retail for $19.99 in the U.S., €19.99 in Europe, and ¥2300 in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an eye-catching price, not least because many publishers are quietly testing more and more expensive games. Xbox recently priced the highly-anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> for $80 — the first of its games to break the typical $70 ceiling — but after a furious backlash, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers">ended up dropping the pre-order price to $70 "in line with current market conditions."</a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all, either. The team also revealed exactly when we'll get to play it, too: 7am PT, 10am ET, 4pm CEST, and 11pm JST. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Cherry finally revealed a release date for the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong at gamescom: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date"><u>September 4, 2025</u></a>. We learned the news via a nearly two-minute new trailer dropped by Team Cherry, which showed a ton of new footage from the game. We see Hornet exploring, loads of new insectoid NPCs, dreary graveyards, swamps, a bustling city, new enemies, new bosses, an Ori-style escape sequence, and more. It'll be available on PC, Switch, Switch 2, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, we learned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight"><u>the original game</u></a> has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-reaches-15-million-copies-sold"><u>managed to top 15 million copies sold</u></a>, a rare feat indeed for an independent game. And perhaps not coincidentally, Hollow Knight, eight years post-release, has repeatedly hit<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#48h" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> all-time high concurrent player counts on Steam (per SteamDB)</u></a> over the last two weeks, topping 70K just this past weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong is currently the most wishlisted game on Steam, but is it actually fun to play? We tried out two levels from the Hollow Knight Silksong demo at gamescom 2025, Moss Grotto and Deep Docks. One was easy one, and one was very challenging, but does it live up to the hype? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/hollow-knight-silksong-weve-played-it-gamescom-2025"><u>Find out in our Hollow Knight: Silksong preview from the show floor</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
