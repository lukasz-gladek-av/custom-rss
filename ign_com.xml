In a new interview, former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida said he thinks NieR: Automata "revived" the Japanese game industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001799.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AVWatch</a> (as translated by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1905573888693764488" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genki_JPN</a>), Yoshida said the Japanese games industry was struggling after chasing overseas trends in the PlayStation 3 era. He said he thought director Yoko Taro made NieR: Automata without thinking whether or not it would sell overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From there, it became clear that Japanese creators were making 'Japanese things' and those things were selling overseas," Yoshida said. "Everyone realized that with NieR."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was just a matter of saying 'it's okay to do it like that,' but 'we have to do it like that,'" Yoshida continued. "So the direction of Japanese creators became 'let's stop imitating overseas countries anymore,' 'if we create things with our own culture and that we understand, they will understand it overseas.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the Japanese game industry was revived after NieR so much so that I would say it was before NieR and after NieR," Yoshida said. "To put it simply, I think NieR: Automata was the title that made people realize 'let's make something Japanese.'"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">NieR: Automata has been, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-series-director-producer-and-composer-start-new-project-it-might-be-nier-it-might-not-be-nier">by all accounts</a>, a success for publisher Square Enix and the creative team behind the game, including Yoko Taro. It's spawned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/nier-automata-ver11a">an anime adaptation</a> and a flurry of cameos for popular protagonist 2B, in everything from Fall Guys to Soulcalibur.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The future of the series <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sounds-like-well-eventually-get-a-nier-sequel-but-dont-hold-your-breath">seems a bit unclear</a>, as of this writing. While the mobile game NieR: Reincarnation <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-3-has-been-in-front-of-us-all-along-per-series-creators-tease">may well have been the NieR 3 fans were waiting for</a>, it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-mobile-game-shuts-down-in-april">also shut down last April</a>. The creative team has worked on a handful of other projects too, like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoko-taro-card-rpg-voice-of-cards-switch-october">card-driven RPG Voice of Cards</a>, but NieR fans are still waiting for the next premium game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, Yoshida saw a shifting of the tides with NieR: Automata. Given how popular the game is today, I'm inclined to agree. Hopefully we see more from NieR soon, but now, as we're roughly eight years removed from its original 2017 launch date, it's a nice recognition of Automata's already-tangible legacy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Among the news is confirmation that its launch roster might be a little smaller than you'd expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In several Q&amp;As following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_juWbTw4hc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent video update</a>, both with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2416952692" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fighting game content creator Sajam</a> and in the 2XKO Discord (via <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2xko-will-have-a-smaller-number-than-you-would-expect-when-it-comes-to-champions-at-launch-but-theres-a-good-reason-why" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VG247</a>), Riot confirmed there will be 10 playable champions — characters — at launch. According to game director Shaun Rivera, it sounds like the lower number could help get 2XKO in players' hands faster.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know it seems like a low number. I know. Trust me, y'know, we hear it," Rivera said in Sajam's stream. "Honestly, we'd rather just get the game out to y'all to play ASAP, instead of keeping it in the oven until we have some number higher of champions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rivera went on to note that, with systems like the different Fuses and Solo/Duo play, there are "a lot of ways" to play the characters on the roster. Plus, this won't be a static game post-launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"On top of that too, we're a live service game," Rivera said. "So [the] champion train is gonna start once we're out the door and in your guys' hands, so we're gonna start releasing those champions. We'd rather get it to you and do that, instead of just hold it for longer."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As executive producer Tom Cannon pointed out on the stream, these characters have also seen some changes throughout development. He referenced Jinx, who just got a gameplay showcase in yesterday's video update: "Go back to the very first announce trailer, which had Jinx in it, and you can see how much effort our creative department and the whole team has put into continuing to make the game as good as it can be. And then when it gets to that point, that's when we'll release it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it's a notably smaller launch roster than most fighting games. For reference, Street Fighter 6 launched with 18 characters, and fellow tag fighter Dragon Ball FighterZ arrived with 24 at launch. On the smaller side, Granblue Fantasy Versus' original launch had 11 characters, and the arcade version of Guilty Gear Xrd had 13.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">League of Legends 2XKO launch roster of playable characters confirmed so far:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ahri</li><li>Ekko</li><li>Yasuo</li><li>Darius</li><li>Illaoi</li><li>Braum</li><li>Jinx</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Katarina was also seen in some footage at one point, but has <a href="https://x.com/2XKOintel/status/1814798398828257793" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">been cut from the launch roster</a>. So there are three champions left to reveal before launch, from League of Legends' titanic <a href="https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/List_of_champions" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">170 champion</a> lineup (as of January 2025).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's a surprisingly low number, 2XKO has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riots-2xko-is-the-tag-fighter-i-didnt-know-i-wanted">also impressed many players</a> in its public showings. A <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/2xko-alpha-lab-overview--faq/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Alpha Lab preview</a> is planned for April 18 through 20 for the United States, Canada, and Brazil, but no official launch date has been set yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While this might blur some perceived console lines, it's a fun crossover and the Drifter's outfit in particular suits the world of Sea of Thieves quite well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 15 of Sea of Thieves <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/sea-of-thieves/Sea_of_Thieves_Season_15_Details_and_Patch_Notes">recently went live</a>, adding various new encounters, voyages, and new content to the long-running piracy experience. Rare's game has managed to stay afloat for quite some time, and it's even seen success on PlayStation 5, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-rares-sea-of-thieves-tops-the-ps5-sales-chart-whats-the-next-xbox-game-to-go-multiplatform">topping an EU sales chart</a> back when it made its way to the platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Destiny 2, meanwhile, launched Heresy and continues to chart a path out from its big narrative conclusion in The Final Shape.

The cosmetics are live now in Sea of Thieves, though it remains to be seen if Destiny 2 will receive any Sea of Thieves content. In this writer's opinion, they should put a big pirate boat in space.
