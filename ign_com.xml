And, like The Witcher 4, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will face questions around whether or not it’s targeting the PlayStation 5 or the inevitable PlayStation 6, or, perhaps most likely, is a cross-gen game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Intergalactic heads straight to PS6, Naughty Dog faces the prospect of having skipped the PS5 generation in terms of brand new games. So far, the studio has released ports, remasters, and remakes on Sony’s current-gen console, including The Last of Us Part II, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, The Last of Us Part I, and The Last of Us Part II Remastered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naughty Dog revealed Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet at The Game Awards 2024. It features a star-studded cast that includes Tati Gabrielle from the Uncharted movie as protagonist Jordan A. Mun, and Kumail Nanjiani of Marvel's Eternals as a man called Colin Graves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But fans have analysed the trailer, below, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-fans-already-think-theyve-worked-out-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophets-cast">to piece together the rest of the cast</a>, and though it focuses on just a couple of characters, a photo of what appears to be a crew revealed even more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-director-neil-druckmann-wants-naughty-dogs-new-game-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-to-make-you-feel-really-lost-and-confused">shared more details about <u>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>interview</u></a> with Alex Garland, the writer of zombie movie 28 Days Later, Druckmann talked candidly about the development process, confirming Intergalactic had been in the works for four years already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I joke about this with the team. We made a game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-2"><u>The Last of Us 2</u></a>, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game," Druckmann said, to which Garland joked: "Who gives a shit?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Exactly," Druckmann added. "But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about — let's make a game about faith and religion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet takes place in an alternate historical timeline and features a "pretty prominent religion," too, which has "changed and bastardized and evolved" over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This whole religion takes place on this one planet, and then at one point, all communication stops," Druckmann teased. "And you're playing a bounty hunter that's chasing her bounty, and she crash lands on this planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So many of the previous games we've done, there's always, like, an ally with you," he said. "I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, who are the people here, what was their history. And in order to get off this planet — again, no one has been heard from this planet for 600 years or so — if you ever have hoped to have a chance to get off, you have to figure out what happened here."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assuming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet releases in 2027, and taking into account Druckmann’s comment about it being in development for four years so far, by the time the game comes out it will have been in the works for six years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a pretty long wait, but speaking to IGN on the red carpet ahead of The Last of Us Season 2 premiere, Druckmann said that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is not only playable right now, but “really good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will say we are playing it at the office and it's incredible,” Druckmann teased. “It's really good. I'm so excited to finally put gameplay out into the world and show people about it, because we just showed you the very, very, very tip on the iceberg. The game goes pretty deep beyond that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Earlier this month, series creator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">Neil Druckmann cast doubt on the prospect of The Last of Us 3</a>, saying: “I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if there’s no The Last of Us 3, would Naughty Dog and Druckmann keep the TV show going past the games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the question IGN put to Druckmann himself on the red carpet ahead of The Last of Us Season 2 premiere, and he replied to say that while he has an ending of The Last of Us story in mind, because he’s not sure if he’ll get the chance to make The Last of Us 3, he’s leaving nothing on the line.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have to have an ending,” Druckmann said. “When I made The Last of Us 1, I didn’t know if there was going to be a sequel, so that had to be a definitive ending. When I worked on Uncharted 4, I don’t know if we’ll ever get to do it again. I need it to be a definitive ending. Last of Us 2, same way. All these things have to line up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t know how long I’ll keep doing this or whether I’ll be given another opportunity. So I leave nothing on the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Right now it’s like, we have an ending in mind. And that ending will be it. That ending will be it for this story.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One question hanging over Druckmann is if he will even have the time to make The Last of Us 3, were it to be green lit for production. That’s because he has his hands full with The Last of Us TV show, which is set to round-out the events of The Last of Us 2 video game with Season 2 and Season 3, and the recently announced PlayStation game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As far as everything else, and you’re asking me about future games, my time so much is, we have to finish this season,” Druckmann continued. “We’re not quite done. We’re almost there. Knock on wood we get to do it again. Season 3, there’s a lot more story we have to cover, as you know with game two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then my hands are pretty full with Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Last of Us Season 2 Character Posters</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In February 2024, Druckmann teased a "concept" for a potential The Last of Us 3 at the end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC3C7GMMfDU&amp;ab_channel=NaughtyDog" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2</a>, noting that there's "probably one more chapter to this story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first game had such a clean concept of like, the unconditional love a parent feels for their child," he said. "The second one, once we landed on this idea of the pursuit of justice at any cost, justice for the ones you love, we felt like, 'there's a clean concept here and there's a throughline from the first game, about love.' If we never get to do it again, this is a fine ending point. Last bite of the apple, the story's done."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The great thing about working at Naughty Dog is that we don't have to," he added. "It's always like, 'we would love another Last of Us, but if you guys feel you're passionate about something else, we'll support this other thing.' Very privileged position to be in, I never take that for granted. I've been just thinking about it, 'is there a concept there?' And for now years, I haven't been able to find that concept. But recently, that's changed, and I don't have a story, but I do have that concept that to me is as exciting as 1, as exciting as 2, is its own thing, and yet has this throughline for all three. So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundles-back-in-stock-amazon-spring-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus more Pokémon TCG booster sets hanging on during the Spring Sale.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I wasn’t planning to buy more Pokémon cards this week. Then I saw that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Scarlet &amp; Violet – Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</a> was somehow <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXEDw?object_uuid=97f4f848-ef36-4c95-a72e-88d7b7b771c5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">still in stock on Amazon for $45.02</a> following its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-finally-solves-pokemon-tcg-shortage">massive Pokémon TCG restock</a>. The restock has come at a great time, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-spring-sale-2025">Amazon Spring Sale</a> in full swing, there are plenty of hot sets to pick up while stock lasts. Suddenly, my willpower crumbled like a 60 HP Basic tackling a 390-damage Hydreigon ex. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite? This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> set is chaos in the best way. You’ve got chase cards that deserve to be slabbed, like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5AlX?object_uuid=97f4f848-ef36-4c95-a72e-88d7b7b771c5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$432 Pikachu ex Special Illustration Rare</a>. That’s not a typo. The little electric mouse is putting in work as both a collectible and a monster in battle. Topaz Bolt deletes nearly anything from the board, and Resolute Heart makes it annoyingly hard to knock out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the Latias ex and Latios combo, pulling a full-on romance movie moment with matching connected artwork. Latias is the rarer and, apparently, the more expensive twin at over $200. I guess big sibling energy costs more. Meanwhile, Milotic ex is out here channeling its inner supermodel with light and shadow drama, and somehow also counters Tera Pokémon like it moonlights as a meta card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My personal favorite? Ceruledge. It’s giving neon fever dreams, and I mean that as a compliment. This is the first time its card has actually been valuable, and I think illustrator Rond deserves a standing ovation. Or at least a coffee. Ceruledge isn’t even a top-tier Pokémon competitively, but with this art, I don’t care.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a collector, the value potential is real. If you're a player, some of these cards slap on the battlefield. And if you just like shiny things and the thrill of gambling $45 on cardboard, welcome to the club. I already cracked one box and I’m convincing myself I “need” another for science.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bundle includes six booster packs, so you’re not guaranteed any heavy hitters, but at the rate people are snapping these up, I wouldn't wait too long. Pikachu isn’t going to pull itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
