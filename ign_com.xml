"Civ 7 is officially Steam Deck verified," it said. "Make history on the go."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next entry in the beloved franchise promises a "revolutionary new chapter" as it "empowers you to build the greatest empire the world has ever known." Its release is finally just a few weeks away, with a lengthy eight years between it and Civilization 6.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Civilization 7 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-civilization-game-officially-announced-by-firaxis">Firaxis announced "the next iteration of the legendary Civilization franchise" was in development</a> as of February 2023 before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-unveiled-at-summer-game-fest-releasing-in-2025">fully unveiling it as Civilization 7 in June 2024</a>.

We "think that's definitely the way to go, considering those older games aren't going anywhere and are still quite playable. From ages that completely transform your chosen civilization, to a bold, readable, but grounded new art style, Firaxis is already putting their best foot forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's coming to PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X and S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. Those wanting to play on its release date will need to pay $99.99 for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Deluxe Edition</a>, while those only willing to pay $69.99 (or $59.99 on Switch) will need to wait until February 11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
