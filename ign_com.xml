            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an old idea that second efforts generally aren’t as good as the first. It’s called the sophomore slump, and there are a dozen reasons for it. Sophomore students don't care as much as freshmen; bands have less time to write, practice, and record a second album than the “breakout” hit they worked on for years before anyone knew who they were; athletes who have exceptional rookie years regress to the mean; and so on. There’s no denying the power of new car smell. I think part of the reason College Football 25 popped off as hard as it did (and trust me if you’re unsure: it <em>popped off</em>) was it’d been more than a decade since NCAA 14 and people really, <em>really </em>wanted a new game based on college football. It didn’t hurt that it was also a good game, but the yearly “it’s the same game as last year” fatigue of the sports genre hadn’t set in yet. That makes College Football 26 the real test.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll be honest, reader: I haven’t had a ton of time with this sequel yet (I've been busy finishing up my review of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-review"><u>Mecha Break</u></a>, which I thought was pretty great), so these impressions are going to be pretty light. One of the things I’m interested in as I play more is how this car handles after we’ve put some miles on her, and if it falls into the same slump so many games, bands, and students have hit before it. But while that remains to be seen, I’m having a pretty good time so far. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of that is College Football 26 is built on a really firm foundation. College Football 25 was a good game, and it still has that infectious spirit and sense of tradition that made it a nice change of pace from the more straight-laced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-review">Madden</a>. From what I’ve seen, College Football 26 builds on that in good ways. One of the things I’m appreciating most is the Trophy Room, which tracks the real world trophies you’ll accumulate across your entire career, no matter what mode you’re in. It’s cool to see stuff like the Heisman Trophy, the Unitas Golden Arm Award, and the Orange Bowl Trophy collected in one place, and be able to learn about them, too. There’s a lot of history to college football, and I appreciate that EA has tried to capture that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, most of my time has been spent sneaking Quick Play games in where I can, so I haven’t really dug into College Football’s major modes too much yet (something I plan to remedy this weekend), but I have noticed some on-the-field stuff that makes me happy. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Better defenders can now make plays average ones can’t.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The little change I’m happiest about is to how defenders play the football when it’s in the air. If you’ve played College Football or Madden in the last few years, you’ve probably been intercepted (or had one of your defenders intercept) a pass that they can’t see without turning around. They’ve essentially got eyes in the back of their heads, and it could be very frustrating. EA has said they’ve changed that, and in my testing, it’s proven true. Now a defender has to see the ball to pick it off, and you’ll notice defenders turning their heads (or not) before the ball arrives. If they don’t, however, it doesn’t mean that defender can’t make a play on the ball. They can still swat it. It’s a good change because it’s two-fold: you now actually have a reason to swat the ball down instead of going for the pick every time, and better defenders can now make plays average ones can’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also a big fan of dynamic subs and custom zones for defenders. The former allows you to swap players on the field and not just on the playcall screen (thank <em>God</em>), though you may have to wait a play for the substitution to take effect, and the latter is the defensive version of last year’s custom stems for routes on offense. I enjoy the defensive game more than the offensive one, so being able to set where I want my zones to be on the field in real-time and not in a menu is welcome. I’m enjoying playing around with this stuff, and I imagine I’ll be using it quite a bit.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Football Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that I have the time to really dig into College Football 26, I am excited to see all the new additions to Road to Glory, where I’m really looking forward to being able to play my high school career, as well as all the new bells and whistles in Dynasty, which is where I imagine I’ll be spending most of my time. But the on-field stuff is where it counts. I can’t say yet if EA has avoided the sophomore slump with College Football 26, but I’m going into this year optimistic, and that’s not nothing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-26-review]]></content:encoded>

Now, as an adult, summers don't quite hit the same. Whether it's the weight of the world bearing down on me or the severe lack of couch co-op games, I'm not sure. But, every once in a while, a special game comes around that brings me back to that feeling of pure joy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction, the follow-up from It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios, launched earlier this year and features another amazing co-op adventure designed specifically for two players. Despite being only a few months old, the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game are already discounted to just $35 during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-sale-top-deals-live">Prime Day</a>. Don't wait too long, though, as Prime Day ends tonight at midnight PT.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Split Fiction Drops to $35 on Amazon</h2><div catalogid="0dba8478-9b0f-4ee7-beef-cededf54465f" id="225069"><div id="225069" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Split Fiction (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-two-review">It Takes Two</a> is already one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-co-op-games">best cooperative games</a> of all-time, taking home <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2021-winners-revealed">top honors at the Game Awards in 2021</a>. Split Fiction is shaping up to be another instant classic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its predecessor, Split Fiction is a split-screen experience designed for two players that can be played locally or online. It even includes a Friend Pass so you and a buddy only need to purchase a single copy in order to play together. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game features plenty of memorable moments and requires you to carefully coordinate with your partner to solve puzzles as you alternate between sci-fi and fantasy worlds. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Our reviewer gave it a 9</a>, saying "Split Fiction is so good at wanting to be played it’s hard to <em>stop </em>playing. It simply doesn’t stay the same long enough for it to ever become boring." In fact, it's already on our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-video-games-of-2025-so-far">best games of 2025</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to save even more on PS5 games, we've rounded up the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-prime-day-ps5-games-on-sale-at-amazon">best Prime Day PS5 deals</a> available right now, so make sure to stock up before the sale is over.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Should I play It Takes Two first?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the similarities between the two games, Split Fiction is a completely new experience featuring a brand-new story and characters. So, if you never got around to It Takes Two, you don't have to worry about missing anything by jumping straight into Split Fiction. Although, there are quite a few nods and inside jokes for players who have played the previous game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Shop the lowest prices this Prime Day</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matthew Adler has written for IGN since 2019 covering all things gaming, tech, tabletop games, and more.
