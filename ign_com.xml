While not everyone will take advantage of that option (some will play local co-op, some may play with someone who already owns the game, etc), that's still a whole lot of people playing Split Fiction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a huge sales jump from Hazelight's last game, It Takes Two, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-two-selling-1-million-copies-shows-that-players-want-co-op-only-games-josef-fares-says">didn't reach the one million milestone until a month after launch</a>. But that in and of itself was deemed an impressive milestone, with studio head Josef Fares saying at the time that it proved players want co-op games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">really dug Split Fiction</a>, calling it "a rollercoaster of constantly refreshed gameplay ideas and styles ‚Äì and one that‚Äôs very hard to walk away from" in our 9/10 review.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
