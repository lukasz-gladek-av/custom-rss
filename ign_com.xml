Information about playable pianos and beard cosmetics was all there, but what they also found was that the studio behind the massively popular multiplayer game had upped the crafting requirements for one of its most iconic tools: the Wolfpack.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/24/arc-raiders-wolfpack-requirements-1771970287801.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Wolfpack now requires one Rocketeer Driver to craft. Image captured in-game by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As outlined in Shrouded Sky’s accompanying patch notes, the Wolfpack, a throwable equipment that showers Arc enemies with homing explosives, now requires one Rocketeer Driver to craft. Now, players will need the component, as well as two Arc motion cores and an explosive compound, to make just one Wolfpack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The changes fall in line with a series of new adjustments to resource requirements, which see Arc components also added to the recipes for the Deadline mine, Trailblazer, Showstopper, and Vita Spray. It’s the Wolfpack tweak that has Raiders up in arms, though, mostly because Rocketeer Drivers are infamously rare and hard to collect. The most consistent way to find one of these epic items is to kill a Rocketeer – a task that currently takes two Wolfpacks to accomplish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rditsw/hot_take_wolfpacks_were_too_easy_to_craft_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some believe the change is understandable considering the previous recipe asked relatively little from players</a>, much of the community online has already started voicing their concerns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Let me just kill a rocketeer to get 1 wolfpack that can half kill another rocketeer,” one Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdd2f7/comment/o746rwv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t even want the blueprint anymore,” another player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74jteq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First time I’ve said this but if they keep going in this direction people will stop playing,” a X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/gmanskiyoutube/status/2026377384056725559?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. “It’s hard enough to gather some of these resources.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Doesn’t quite add up <a href="https://t.co/1KLOMIWnQe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1KLOMIWnQe</a></p>— ARC Central (@TheARCcentral) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheARCcentral/status/2026389327081578664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 24, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The grenade can’t lock on to other players but can tear through hordes of small Arc, making it one of the best PvE tools Raiders have at their disposal. It can also quickly dismantle the armor featured on large Arc, such as the Matriarch, Queen, Leaper, and Bastion, but it’s the math asking players for two Wolfpacks to kill one Rocketeer that has fans questioning Embark's judgement. While showing concern about how update 1.17.0 asks players to work harder for crafting materials, some have started chiming in with their own recommendations for how to fix the issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If rocketeers start consistently dropping more than 1x driver, we can talk,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74eo6f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They need to up the drop odds on drivers,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74ffry/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. “Right now you’re lucky if you get two. Make two the base with higher odds of 3+. Otherwise wolfpacks will basically just be used when looted on the map.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players are asking for more rewarding Rocketeer loot and reduced requirements for the Wolfpack, but others are still exploring all Shrouded Sky has to offer. The February update launched today, focusing on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embark-shows-off-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-with-first-look-at-two-new-threatsand-beards"><u>map changes for Dam Battlegrounds and the new Firefly and Comet Arc threats</u></a> as its latest additions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund shared more about how the studio plans to continue building on Arc Raiders in the months ahead during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> earlier this month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Final Fantasy VII is getting a makeover on Steam. No, not the remake. I mean the actual, original game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/39140/view/514107648813039662" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Announced last month</a> and released today, this updated version of Final Fantasy VII comes with a handful of new features as seen on the storefront. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3837340/view/498346952550779352" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to an official post</a>, this new version of the old game will include a 3x speed mode, the ability to turn off random encounters, a "battle enhancement" mode that will max out Limit gauge and let players recover HP/MP during battles, and an autosave feature.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The new version of the game will replace the 2013 edition on the Steam store, and the 2013 edition will no longer be available to buy. However, those who already own the 2013 version will receive the new version free of charge, <em>and</em> will still have access to the 2013 version in their libraries simultaneously with this new version. Critically, though, save files are not compatible between the two versions, so you will have to start a new game to enjoy the re-release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This update effectively brings the game up to parity with the other modern console ports of Final Fantasy 7. For years, the 2013 edition on Steam had been behind the times, effectively just an old (and often buggy) PC port.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's still worth checking out the original Final Fantasy VII if you missed it back in the day, or even if you just want a walk down memory lane ahead of the conclusion to the Final Fantasy VII Remake Trilogy. It's been teased that we're getting "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-will-share-more-updates-than-ever-before-on-final-fantasy-7-remake-project-this-year-says-director">more updates than ever before</a>" on the trilogy this year, leading fans to hope that the announcement of Part 3 is imminent. Meanwhile, Part 2, Rebirth, is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-and-xbox-this-year">coming to Switch 2 and Xbox later this year</a>. FF7 for everyone!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?
