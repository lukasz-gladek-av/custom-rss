Whoops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"An internal, developer-only Black Ops 7 playtest was set to begin this weekend," explained CharlieIntel on X/Twitter.

Capture points of interest, destroy payloads, and transmit valuable data to score. Use your wingsuit to flank and reach objectives before your enemy. The first team to reach the score limit wins."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also Overload, which is described as "two teams of six players each fight to control a neutral EMP device that must be delivered to the enemy HQ for score.

Matt Cox, General Manager of Call of Duty, insisted that “as a team, our vision from the start was to create a back-to-back series experience for our players that embraced the uniqueness of the Black Ops sub-franchise.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 7 is set to star Milo Ventimiglia, Kiernan Shipka, and Michael Rooker, with Ventimiglia portraying David Mason, Shipka as new character Emma Kagen, and Rooker reprising his Black Ops 2 role of Mike Harper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-insists-heavily-criticized-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-ads-in-loadout-menus-were-a-test-published-in-error-strips-them-out-following-backlash"><u>Activision pulled controversial adverts placed inside Black Ops 6 and Warzone loadouts</u></a>, insisting they were a “feature test” published “in error.” It’s worth remembering that Black Ops 6 is a premium, $70 game, and this year’s Black Ops 7 is expected to jump to $80 after Microsoft said that gamers will see Xbox charging $79.99 for new, first-party games around the holiday season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And don't forget, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beavis-and-butt-head-are-coming-to-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-with-season-04-reloaded-and-players-are-joking-theyre-more-milsim-than-most-skins-in-the-game"><u>Beavis and Butt-Head are now in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"You might have heard some of the rumors..."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has confirmed it experimented with plans to make <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> an open-world game, and for it feature online elements, before it ultimately changed course. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a revealing developer diary video, Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi introduced a brief look at this now-cancelled, earlier version of the game, where multiple protagonists can be seen in action-heavy gunplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, however, Capcom ditched these ideas to focus back on the Resident Evil franchise's horror roots, its developers said. When it arrives next year, Requiem will be a single-player game, and offline only.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've managed to pack a lot into this game. We were even exploring many different systems early in development," producer Masachika Kawata noted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You might have heard some of the rumors," Nakanishi continued. "Things like an online Resident Evil, or an open-world Resident Evil, which we spent some time experimenting with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But in the end, although we had some interesting concepts, we realized that it wasn't what fans wanted to see or play. So we went back to the drawing board, and created what led to Resident Evil: Requiem."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see a few brief shots of the cancelled online version of Requiem below:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The cancelled Resident Evil 9 project <a href="https://t.co/Vu7z2tlppQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Vu7z2tlppQ</a></p>— Waleed (@Waleedx2007) <a href="https://twitter.com/Waleedx2007/status/1938392141769687115?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing Requiem's setting, art director Tomonori Takano noted that Capcom had made the deliberate choice to place the game's action in urban environments, in order to differentiate it from other recent games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil Village and the recent Resident Evil 4 Remake are all set outside major population centers, whereas Requiem will see the return of Raccoon City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Previous titles were often set in rural areas with lots of nature," Takano noted. "This time it is more focused on the urban environment. And there are many scenarios that are set as a modern drama, including Raccoon City."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we now know the setting and single-player focus of Requiem for certain, Capcom remains more coy over whether floppy-haired fan-favorite Leon S. Kennedy is also playable in the game, alongside its currently-announced protagonist, FBI agent Grace Ashcroft. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-spotlight-june-2025-everything-revealed">Capcom Spotlight 2025 broadcast</a> included comments from Nakanishi that stated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">Leon would be a "bad match for horror"</a> — though the director stopped short of confirming the character would not be present at all. Fans suspect Capcom is still to showcase Requiem's more action-heavy moments — for which Leon would be better suited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
