            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/a-marvel-rivals-player-created-a-playable-doctor-octopus-concept-and-fans-love-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I thought, ‘Since I can't play right now, why not make it myself?’"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase Games has promised to release at least one new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> hero <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-promises-a-new-hero-every-month-and-a-half">every half-season</a>, but that didn’t stop one creative player from bringing his idea for a playable Doctor Octopus to life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit user <a href="https://x.com/WickedCube" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WickedCube</a> surprised <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">r/MarvelRivals</a> followers earlier this week with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1isc6a2/we_need_more_vanguards_so_i_made_one_doctor/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a 30-second video showing what looks like rough gameplay</u></a> from NetEase’s smash-hit hero shooter. At a glance, the footage seems to focus on a pre-Hulk Bruce Banner suspended in midair in what appears to be a testing room – but it’s more than that. Marvel fans will recognize this eight-armed version of the gamma-infused doctor as an unpolished, Marvel Rivals-inspired take on classic Spider-Man villain Doctor Octopus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's stiff and a touch goofy, but the likeness is unmistakable. Squint and you’ll see a well-thought-out concept of what Doc Ock could potentially look and move like should NetEase ever decide to send Otto Octavius crawling into Marvel Rivals. With his arms able to magnetize the player up and around obstacles, WickedCube’s idea come-to-life essentially allows the character to fly so long as he’s close enough to a stable structure – an important note in a game with destructible environments. This rough Doc Ock concept even comes with named abilities, including Havoc Claw for the standard melee attack and a ranged move called Wrecking Grip. At 16,000 upvotes at the time of publication, it’s impressive, playable, and made entirely by one person.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Doc Ock has always been one of the coolest villains in Spider-Man, and his tentacles would be a challenge to implement,” WickedCube tell us, describing where his inspiration stemmed from. “As far as I know, they haven't been fully implemented with playable 3D movement in a game before.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I thought, ‘Since I can't play right now, why not make it myself?’</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The India-based indie game developer previously worked with Space Engineers studio Keen Software House before resigning <a href="https://wickedcube.itch.io/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to focus on his own project</a> in January 2024. He's been looking for contract positions and prototyping mechanics since then, so character work usually isn’t a priority. Creating a controllable version of Doctor Octopus in Unity required clearing a few hurdles, but it’s this exact challenge that helped WickedCube pursue the idea. The rest of the push came from an unlikely source: the recent PSN outage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It all started when PSN was down and I couldn’t play Marvel Rivals,” WickedCube explains. “While browsing Twitter, I came across some <a href="https://x.com/LordDepis/status/1883639630404407479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>really cool Doc Ock fan art</u></a>. I thought, ‘Since I can't play right now, why not make it myself?’”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Doctor Octopus in the style of Marvel Rivals<br>.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarvelRivals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarvelRivals</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarvelRivalsfanart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarvelRivalsfanart</a> <a href="https://t.co/d3XHXMZsCL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/d3XHXMZsCL</a></p>— CoryHarris.jpg (@LordDepis) <a href="https://twitter.com/LordDepis/status/1883639630404407479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The result has seen thousands of players appreciating his ideas for Doc Ock, with some calling for NetEase to bring him onto the team. WickedCube calls the reception “incredibly rewarding,” adding that he’d be more than happy to see the Marvel Rivals studio lift some of his ideas should Doc Ock officially make his way into the game. Although he has no plans to polish the design further, the goal is to release a playable version of the character in the near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After seeing the response on Reddit, I want to share this and future concepts as a YouTube tutorial series,” WickedCube added. “I also plan to open-source the code on GitHub and make the playable versions available on Itch.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase will charge forward with its Marvel Rivals post-launch plans with two new official characters this Friday: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-sets-february-release-date-for-the-thing-and-human-torch">the Human Torch and The Thing</a>. Both heroes follow their Fantastic Four teammates, Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, who launched early last month. It’s a shockingly strong start that outpaces competitors in its field, but comic book fans can’t help but look to Marvel’s catalog of heroes and villains as a universe with limitless potential.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">WickedCube’s post says his viral project was born out of the community’s desire to see more Vanguard, or tank-like characters, added to its roster. Not even the strongest rumor has suggested we’ll see Otto show up in-game any time soon, but the Doc Ock designer says he’s already cooking up more ideas for other potential heroes. Two names on his mind are X-Men mainstays Nightcrawler and Professor Xavier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The character roster at launch is large enough to keep the game enjoyable for a long time, and the rate at which they’ve promised to release new characters is mind-blowing,” he added. “The designers clearly understand how to make a fun game, which, in my opinion, is the hardest thing to get right.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals is primed to deliver its Season 1 mid-season update tomorrow, February 21. In addition to those aforementioned character releases, the content update will add balance changes, gameplay tweaks, and more. While we wait for launch, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-director-and-entire-seattle-design-team-laid-off-netease-tells-fans-not-to-worry-about-the-game">layoffs that recently impacted the U.S. team at NetEase’s Seattle branch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/duet-night-abyss-preview-all-the-boobs-in-the-world-cant-hide-its-shallow-grind<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Duet Night Abyss is a fantasy multiplayer game that’s hotly anticipated in the gacha gaming community. It’s all about cool-looking combat, grinding, and oh yeah – boobs. And based on what I’ve played so far, the busty barmaids and endless slog for incrementally better gear aren’t likely to capture your attention for very long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I played an early PC build of Duet Night Abyss ahead of its closed beta test, with the caveat that I wasn’t able to experience multiplayer functionality, so consider this preview to be more about Duet Night’s mechanics, world, and the grand narrative that underpins it all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your player character, a beautiful waif in bandages, awakens in a swirling snowfield. Mysterious voices speak to you. You are helpless and breathy. But out of the snow, someone reaches for you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s Berry, a major character who’ll see you through the basics of movement in this world: most notably, the Helix Jump – a slick way of vaulting yourself through the air. There’s no cooldown on that jump, and you’ll find quickly that it’s a fun and efficient way of getting around – and powerful in combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once separated from Berry, you’ll really begin to come into your own – both gameplay-wise and narratively speaking. Broke in a strange new city run by the ominously named Empire, you must become a “Phoxhunter,” picking up “commissions” at a rough-and-tumble tavern owned by the world’s least believable barmaaid. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But wait. That’s only half the story. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Double Take</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a second protagonist, a male version who looks strikingly similar to the girl you just met. The idea is that these two show different sides of the same narrative. In the city, the girl sees townsfolk experiencing discrimination, violence, and cruelty at the hands of the Empire. Meanwhile, the boy is a part of the Empire, commanding the same brutish soldiers who are now wounded and pitiful after battle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much has been made of these dual protagonists and plotlines, but frankly, I don’t think they’re as revolutionary as the developer seems to think they are. There were no surprises, no events in one character’s story that might make the other’s revelatory. Of course, this is early on, and I hope to be proven wrong as more story content becomes available.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, solid story or not, this game’s art is beautiful. I loved the linework, the colours, the fluid animation. I tend to approach the anime aesthetic with skepticism, so trust that my praise says something about how polished and breathtaking the aesthetic was. Unfortunately, I began to feel less enthusiastic the boobier Duet Night became (more on that later).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The English voiceover is absolutely fantastic, one of Duet Night’s highlights. As I progressed and met more characters, I found each one’s voice and dialogue distinct and full of individual personality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’re through the initial story quests, you’ll be participating in a lot of combat. It’ll be familiar to anyone who has ever played any kind of hack-and-slash, but it’s fun for a while. All the shiny sword slashes and oversized guns look epic, especially paired with the Helix Jump ability.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Switching between melee and ranged weapons is seamless. And to really hone your killing skills, you can equip the ridiculously named Demon Wedges: equippable supplements to your weapons that bump up various stats. You can mix-and-match a few of these at any time, playing around with combinations to find synergies that could take your combat to the next level.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Daily Grind</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I still have an unclear sense of Duet Night’s intended monetization model. There are hints, of course, such as multiple currencies – I was overwhelmed trying to understand where to obtain each one, and what each one could buy. Though there didn’t yet appear to be an interface to spend IRL money, you can bet that’s coming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not going to mince words: Duet Night Abyss is a grindfest. Take the “Retrace” system, which is a dice roll to win a bunch of random new weapons to pick from. It’s literally “click a button and see what you get.” Your rewards may be epic, but are mostly not. Provided you have enough of the “Hourglass” currency, you can just hammer that Retrace button like a slot machine. It’s one of the least engaging things I have ever seen in my time as a gamer.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not going to mince words: Duet Night Abyss is a grindfest.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also pick up “commissions” from the aforementioned tavern, which are instances where you’ll do most of your flashy combat. They may have different themes (a church overgrown with grass, for example, or a mine), but they all follow the same formula: a bunch of rooms that look exactly the same, where you can defeat increasingly difficult – and boring – waves of monsters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can grind for weapons to craft into better weapons. Grind for coins to buy cosmetic items, like a chicken for your head. Grind to obtain new playable avatars (most of them busty women). Or you can enter “Sandrealm Meditation,” which is a euphemism for practicing your combat skills via – you guessed it – grinding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But all the flashy abilities, gear, and flower hats you’re grinding for mean nothing without an audience to impress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, I did not experience any of Duet Night's social aspects. The instances can match you up with three other players – friends or randoms – but given that I was playing before the closed beta began, there was no one for me to match up with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Duet Night will feel like less of a grind as it opens up to players and a community grows, though I’m not sure at this stage what that would look like.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Alone in a Crowd</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I recognize that grindy games do have an audience, but as a game reviewer, I feel icky recommending them when there are so many more engaging, delightful, and dare I say interactive games out there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the beginning, I thought I might like Duet Night Abyss. In those first moments I felt like I was watching a beautifully animated film, and intrigued where the waif’s story might lead me – even if I did have to grind my way there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then the, uh, curvaceous women began appearing. This isn’t uncommon in anime – but it immediately narrows the audience down to one of… specific tastes. I personally felt isolated: as slick as Duet Night Abyss was, I could never fully appreciate the better parts of it, such as the art or cute side quests, knowing that this game wasn’t looking for players like me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an audience out there for Duet Night Abyss. But it isn’t me. Maybe it’ll be you.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bison. A masterpiece, even if critics at the time didn’t think so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No word yet on casting, but you can probably expect to see some of your favorite Street Fighter characters appear in this one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A previous version of this film initially had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-new-movie-appears-to-have-its-directors">Talk to Me directors Danny and Michael Philippou attached</a> to helm the film, but they <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-action-street-fighter-movie-looking-for-new-director-as-talk-to-me-filmmakers-exit-report">departed the project in the summer of last year</a>. The choice of Eric Andre Show alum Sakurai could mean that Legendary is moving in a new, more absurdist direction for the film. As a fan of the more cartoony elements of Street Fighter, I’m actually excited if this is the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, you can play the most recent Street Fighter game, Street Fighter 6 which recently released its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-season-2-roster-revealed-with-four-new-characters">newest fighter, Mai Shiranui</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-and-pc-single-player-action-game-lost-soul-aside-the-big-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After roughly a decade in development, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lost-soul-aside">Lost Soul Aside</a> is finally scheduled for a launch. Originally the passion project of solo developer Yang Bing, Lost Soul Aside has grown to become a major Sony-published title under the company's 'China Hero Project,' with Bing now the founder and CEO of Shanghai-based studio Ultizero Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a release date of May 30 on PlayStation 5 and PC closing in, IGN had the opportunity to sit down with Yang Bing to discuss the long road to launch. So many years of development went into this single-player action game, escalating from a solo creator's vision to a trailer reveal at Sony's State of Play. Through it all the hype has grown, with some calling Lost Soul Aside an exciting mix of Final Fantasy characters and Devil May Cry combat — even from the moment Yang Bing's initial reveal video went viral in 2016.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the help of a translator, IGN asked Yang Bing about the early origins of Lost Soul Aside, its inspirations, what challenges the team has faced over the years, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's been almost nine years since the first glimpse of Lost Soul Aside, on </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5El-yYNUwU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>your YouTube channel</strong></u></a><strong>. How did you get started on this project, and how old were you at the time?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So I remember our first promotional video was released in 2016. I was born in 1990, so when the video was released, I was about 26 years old, so that was actually when the project started. I remember [Lost Soul Aside] probably started around, at the end of 2014, the beginning of 2015.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/lsa-1739990523109.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Expect massive set-piece battles in Lost Soul Aside. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What were the original inspirations behind Lost Soul Aside? Has that ever shifted over the course of development?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So personally, I have loved playing games since I was young. And of course, back at that time, I had some personal favorite genres. Later on, [my] passion towards games wasn't changed, didn't change a lot. So I wanted to develop something that I really like. And then the tools and game engines were relatively mature. So that was the beginning of [Lost Soul Aside].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The overall style and then, the inspiration, has not changed that much. From the beginning, the beginning of 2016 until now, about like nine years or 10 years, it continues to feature a blend of fantasy elements with some realistic visuals, characterized by this real-life aesthetic. So this style has not changed. The combat style has also consistently leaned towards high speed and flashy action. So this is something that we have been sticking to for all these years. During this development process, we, of course, continued to see some new and excellent works, which maybe we got some influence through, [on] our thought along the way. So from the beginning, this personal trailer gradually evolved into a more mature and well-run version, I should say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How did the Sony collaboration come around? Can you describe what that first meeting was like, and how the partnership has been since?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> Well, actually, back to 2016, I had some contact [with a] PlayStation colleague. That was, for me, a turning point, which I think is quite remarkable. So when I released this promotional video, I got a message from a colleague at PlayStation, who said that they wanted to discuss the project in detail and explore a potential collaboration. Back at that time, I was still in South Korea, and I felt really grateful for this opportunity. At the end of 2016, I went back to China and then immediately, I went to PlayStation, Sony in Shanghai, visited them, and met with them in person. And so from that time, we kind of started our collaboration. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent years, the collaboration has been continuously deepening. Initially, it started with the Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-investing-further-in-chinese-development-program-genshin-impact"><u>China Hero Project</u></a>. And then, later on, we kind of joined this collaboration with Sony, and then Sony officially announced that it's going to be published by PlayStation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What would you say makes Lost Soul Aside stand out from other games in its genre?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So the play will be very smooth, because we think that when the players play, they will likely be impressed by the overall operability of the game, including the combat experience and the interaction with the environment. It will be very smooth. And in order to achieve this kind of smooth feeling, we actually try our best, utmost, to ensure that the player's input receives immediate feedback. For example, all the weapons can be switched seamlessly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the combat for this kind of skill combination can be combined seamlessly as well. All the skills can be canceled as well. We have spent a significant amount of time ensuring that everything flows as smoothly as possible. So, this is something that I think will impress players the most. And then, furthermore, the intent, our intention, is to shape the two main characters, the combination, Kaser and Arena. So we can provide players with the option like turning Arena into a weapon and other elements, to help Kaser fight in battle. [He] can provide some help during his journey. So I think that all these elements combining together can become a very outstanding and recognizable aspect for our game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Where did the concept for Arena, the transforming dragon companion Kazer has, come from?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So that kind of idea and thought actually started at a very, very, very early stage, even before this project started back to 2016. So, I remember I watched some YouTube video... there's a special effects creator who makes a segment featuring a crystal that can [transform] into various weapons, a shade, and many other things. Combined with my idea, I always thought about this idea, about a dragon [that] can transform, all kinds of shapes. Even before this game project has started, I had the idea about something like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than this dragon, I was thinking that the protagonist has a companion, which at that time is somewhat similar to a dragon-like creature that can transform into a weapon, [to help] the character, assisting in the battle. So I always had this kind of idea from the beginning, I had the idea to incorporate [it] into this project. This idea that the protagonist has a dragon partner that can become a weapon, this idea actually, I had it since 2014.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/lsa-again-1739990287639.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">In Lost Soul Aside you play Kaser, who has help from a transforming dragon. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What ideas and themes does Lost Soul Aside center on, that you want players to take away from this game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yang Bing:</strong> So, the core theme primarily just revolves around Kaser, the protagonist, and his companion Arena, and they embark on various adventures together. And of course, during that process they face numerous challenges, including traps and a variety of formidable enemies. So the focus is on Kaser, who starts off as an ordinary individual, an ordinary person. And then after he meets Arena, and then later, they continuously establish some kind of relationship with other characters. So in this adventure, we want the players to experience the growth of the characters, transforming from ordinary people, or him from an ordinary person at the beginning, to a hero who can save the world by the end.

And then we have to accumulate experience and to enhance the development experience during all this process and all these years. So, I think this is very essential, for developing this kind of skill and type of project, this is one thing. And then the other challenge for me, I should say this because for me, I started from my personal ideas. I work. I used to work just by myself. And later on, I continuously [accumulated] knowledge on how to collaborate with other members as a team, with the help of Sony PlayStation, and now because we have established a team. So it requires everyone to come together to make the idea happen. So for me, this is constantly a learning process, and I need to overcome this challenge to make the project a successful one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You're planning to launch day one for both PC and PS5?
