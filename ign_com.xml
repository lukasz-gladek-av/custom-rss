            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Flash in the pan.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a new Chicken Run video game in development, and its voice cast is sure to ruffle some feathers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chicken-run-eggstraction">Chicken Run: Eggstraction</a>, from Outright Games, is described as an “action-stealth” video game that is of course based on the Chicken Run franchise. It’s a top-down, heist game that picks up where Aardman's 2023 film Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget left off. Expect a launch this fall on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s interesting here is Chicken Run: Eggstraction’s voice cast. It sees Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie in HBO’s The Last of Us adaptation, and Josie Sedgwick-Davies return to voice Molly and Frizzle from Dawn of the Nugget. But it’s also got Chicken Shop Date creator Amelia Dimoldenberg, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/gettyimages-2203000182-1750769939753.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Amelia Dimoldenberg not on a date in a chicken shop. Photo by Cindy Ord/VF25/Getty Images for Vanity Fair.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see why Dimoldenberg is involved, given the nature of her YouTube interview show. Dimoldenberg has seen a meteoric rise to fame in recent years as ever more famous celebrities agree to a spot of fried chicken on a first date. The question is, will Spider-Man star Andrew Garfield join her on the cast?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to the game! Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Chicken Run: Eggstraction follows the film Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, with an exciting new story that continues the adventures of its feathered heroes as they work to save chickens from the evil nugget industry, where chicken-kind is still in danger! Take control of the Chicken Run characters, and embark on a mission to infiltrate five fortified farms and liberate the captive chickens. But beware, there are plenty of eggstra security measures in place that players will need to overcome to lead these fowl to freedom. From avoiding watchful security cameras and hawkeyed humans to hiding in traffic cones, players will be tested on their stealth, skills and strategy. Equipped for up to two players in local co-op, players can tackle this high-octane adventure alone, or team up with a friend to hatch a plan for success.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/eFS5vxYlfY8?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Amelia Dimoldenberg / YouTube</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, Grave Seasons might look like any other nice, cozy farming sim like Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon: you’re a stranger who’s come into a farm in the small town of Ashenridge, full of seemingly friendly people. You plant and harvest crops, craft items, and make friends. But there’s a mysterious, unnerving sense that tugged at the back of my neck during my half-hour playing Blumhouse Games and Perfect Garbage’s not-so-cozy farming sim. One that kept me much more engaged than your garden-variety farming game, with its impressively intriguing threads that added a little drop of poison to the well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a brief intro to the player character, who’s escaped a prison sentence in search of a new beginning, things start getting weird. Hari, a neighborly caretaker who’s maintained the property since falling into ruin, greeted me with an incredulous (but charming) hello, which doubles as a quick tutorial. At first glance, the stuff he introduced me to wasn’t that strange. I had the standard tool wheel, complete with a shovel, pickaxe, watering can, and so on. But I also had a crowbar?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s because Grave Seasons isn’t just a grim or slightly spooky take on farming: it’s also a mystery game. And while I didn’t have a chance to use a crowbar during the early section I played, it sounds like you’ll need to use it to break open locked doors later on in the story. But given the mysterious circumstances under which my character came into their new home, I’m curious to learn about their motives and means.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Grave Seasons isn’t just a grim or slightly spooky take on farming: it’s also a mystery game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After working my new land, picking some chilis, cabbage, and tomatoes that Hari so neatly planted – and doing a little planting of my own, burying some carrot seeds my new friend offered as a welcoming gift – I did some exploring. To my shock, I found a severed hand and a bloodied ring amidst the weeds and garbage littering the far reaches of the property. I tugged at this new thread immediately, taking it to Hari to see what he had to say about it, rendering shock and horror from my musclebound, tutorial-dispensing neighbor.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing really came from this interaction, beyond that reaction, and the revelation that I could talk to Hari about other stuff, and even offer them a gift. Obviously, I’m sure there are opportunities to spend more time with them (or any character, as I met later) and figure out what he might actually want. But a half-hour demo isn’t exactly designed for that kind of long-game mindset. So I gave them the chocolate ice cream cone in my inventory as a sign of friendship (and maybe more). Unfortunately, he reacted to the frozen treat about as well as he did to the hand… I didn’t get another chance to try my hand (no pun intended) at offering them something else, but given Grave Seasons’ dark, slightly comedic tone, I’m curious to see what winds up tickling their fancy in the full game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then I retreated to my shed, where I found a pickling and fermenting station a while earlier to put my chilis and cabbage to good use by making some kimchi. This highlighted one of my favorite parts of Grave Seasons. Although it’s decidedly horror-focused, Grave Seasons doesn’t skimp on the stuff that makes farming games great in the first place. With a diverse menu, well-realized in a sharp, pixelated art style, this demo made me hungry as I marveled at the pixel art of garlic, hummus, pickles, and salads. Kimchi in hand, I set back out to my house to find a new character sitting on the edge of the well in my yard.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/04-1750722909801.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pilar, a fashion designer with a passion for vintage clothing, greeted me with another warm welcome before telling me about their plans to forage for some rare herbs that night. After agreeing to explore my new home a bit, I tried talking to them more, again about the hand, getting another shocked response. I gave them my fresh kimchi to see what they thought about it, but just like Hari, no dice.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pilar and Hari's dialogue was consistently engaging, funny, and distinct in a way that conveyed loads of personality and life.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Here was another favorite part of the demo: just talking to Pilar and Hari. Their dialogue was consistently engaging, funny, and distinct in a way that conveyed loads of personality and life. I would’ve sat there for the entire demo just gifting them every last radish, head of lettuce, and cigarette in my inventory if I could. Based on the trailer and other materials Perfect Garbage has shared, I’m excited to see what other characters I get to meet. And I’m eager to watch them play out their roles in this mystery, which deepened at night.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/03-1750722932949.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After cleaning up some trash, mining for some minerals and iron, watering my carrots, and putting some crops into storage to be sold, it was time to take a walk in the woods with Pilar. Upon walking into the gulley, something was immediately off. Then, a pair of bright red eyes opened behind them, claws emerging at Pilar’s ankles, illuminated by their lantern. In the blink of an eye, some kind of eldritch beast mangled Pilar. It took me about a minute to refix my dropped jaw after seeing that… I can’t believe how expressively gory Grave Seasons would get, or that they just killed off Pilar like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was the end of the demo, but it absolutely left me wanting more. Setting up a story that blends in all sorts of seemingly disparate threads like this – from small-town murders to bloodthirsty creatures beyond comprehension lurking in dark woods – created just the right kind of intrigue. I’m sure I’ll wind up investigating my now-dead friend’s witchy ways, make more friends (and enemies), and grow crops to make tasty food while doing it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/02-1750722948942.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve had a lot of trouble sticking with most farming sims because they lacked a certain sense of intrigue; that hook to keep me looking forward to the next day for something other than fresh crops. This is exactly what the developers at Perfect Garbage are looking to remedy with Grave Seasons; I’m sure this first day was a condensed version of the kind of pacing we’ll see in the full release, but I love the balance of visual novel-like mystery with the more relaxing pace of farming gameplay, ensuring that fresh crops grow in time with the narrative and dramatic tension.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grave Seasons promises to inject something sinister into the farming sim genre with a compelling horror-mystery that seems on track to deliver personality, fright, and charm in spades. I’m interested to see and learn more about Grave Seasons’ community of charming townsfolk and the secrets lurking underneath Ashenridge’s small-town veneer when it ships on PC and consoles sometime next year.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/grave-seasons-is-a-cozy-farming-sim-with-a-dark-side]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Firaxis and 2K are committed to reversing the fortunes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii"><u>Civilization 7</u></a> with an all-new update, much of which has been "influenced by the community."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This month's "hefty" <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Update 1.2.2</u></a> brings a raft of long-awaited features like Large and Huge Maps, expanded Advanced Game Options, and a community favorite: Steam Workshop support. There's also new Town Specializations, City-State Bonuses, Beliefs, balance changes, UI improvements, and — best of all, of course — "a very pettable Scout dog."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can also finish their current save under a previous version by using the legacy Steam beta branch. Backwards compatibility for existing saves is also available, although you should note that "some new abilities or effects may not appear until you start a new game or advance to the next Age in your current campaign."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the best experience, we recommend starting a new game, or continuing your current game into the next Age," Firaxis said. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Large and Huge map sizes — which I'm afraid aren't available on Switch, along with Standard — default to 10 players, but multiplayer campaigns max out at eight people, inclusive of AI companions. The team hopes to expand Huge to accommodate 12 players eventually, but right now it "needs a bit more time to make sure increased player counts won't compromise game stability or performance." That said, because of the size, these maps have been spruced up with Pantheons (and two new ones have been added to Antiquity), Religious Beliefs, Discoveries, and City-State bonuses to "ensure there’s enough content for all the players in a game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One of the best things about Civilization is how many ways there are to play," the update added. "Some players are happy to peacefully build the biggest, best Cities while others want to ignore all that and go conquer the world ('Yes, your amazing City does look great in my empire'). With 1.2.2, we’ve added several new advanced game setup options to give you even more control over how you play."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means you can now decide whether to enable, disable (or turn off entirely) Legacy Paths per Page, specific Crises, as well as disable Score Victory. AI difficulty can be amended, too, and you can bypass Civ Unlocks On Age Transitions now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve had a lot of fun playing with different Legacy Paths on or off in each Age. While Legacy Paths that don’t lead to a Victory are always optional, sometimes it’s nice to just tune them out entirely and focus on playing into the unique strengths of your leader and civ," Firaxis added. "For a fun sandbox game we’ve been playing in the office, try turning off Legacy Paths for Antiquity and Exploration, and setting the game to Abbreviated Ages. If you want to lean into the sandbox feel even more, try turning off Legacy Paths in Modern and the Score Victory, too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Feedback from fans about Religion has necessitated changes, too, with the team now adding new Beliefs and updating existing ones to give bonus incentives for converting your own Settlements. There are "bigger and bolder changes" also on the horizon for Religion, but we'll find out more about those at a later date. You can also expect Town focus bonuses to help them feel more "impactful."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Urban Centers in particular have received a glow-up, and now gain access to many of the Buildings that were otherwise only available in Cities (like Libraries and Monuments in Antiquity)," the update explained. "Fort Towns gain the ability to purchase multiple walls so they can really lock down strategic chokepoints. We also introduced a new type of Town Focus: the Resort Town. These relaxing scenic retreats gain extra Gold and Happiness on Rural tiles with Happiness and increased Yields on Natural Wonders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Lastly, we felt massed Hub Towns were overshadowing some of the other options and gave them a slight nerf from +2 Influence per connected Settlement to +1 Influence. We’re going to keep our eye on them to see how they compare against the other newly buffed Towns."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players will also now be able to find and install mods from Steam Workshop. Oh, and there's even a new loading screen, with rewritten and re-recorded narration from Gwendoline Christie.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also an absolute smorgasbord of tweaks and fixes, but if I wrote all those out here, we'd be here until Christmas. You can head on over to the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official website</u></a> to see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Civilization 7 has had a rough launch on Steam — that much is clear. The strategy sequel has struggled for players on Valve’s platform ever since its launch in February. Despite a number of patches issued by developer Firaxis to reverse things, Civilization 7 finds itself in the unenviable situation of having fewer players on Steam than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi"><u>Civilization 6</u></a> and even the 15-year-old <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v"><u>Civilization 5</u></a>. According to Steam user reviews the game is 'mixed,' although the last 1,500 or so reviews has it falling to a 'mostly negative' rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Update 1.2.2 is out now, although Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 players will have to wait a little longer as the team works "diligently to get these updates through the additional Switch submission requirements." Players still experiencing issues or bugs are encouraged to disable mods and make the team aware. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We thought Civilization 7 was 'good,' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-review"><u>awarding it a fitting 7/10</u></a>, writing: "Civilization 7's improved warfare and added bits of narrative flair give me reasons to keep clicking one more turn late into the night, but the desire to streamline and simplify this legendary 4X series feels like it has also gone a bit too far, particularly when it comes to the interface."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
