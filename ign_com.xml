Like you probably are right now, I was a bit skeptical about how good the recipes could be from a Pac-Man-themed cookbook, but authors Lisa Kingsley and Jennifer Peterson — wait for it — <em>cooked</em>.<strong> </strong>The 160-page hardcover book features over 60 delicious recipes that are easy to make in the comfort of your own home. This is the perfect companion for when you're hosting a game night or having a video game-themed watch party of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">industry's biggest events</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this latest cookbook may seem a bit strange, there are actually a <em>lot</em> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-cookbooks">video game cookbooks already out there</a>. It's actually surprising it took this long for Pac-Man to get in on the action.</p><p id="pac-man-the-official-cookbook"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pac-Man: The Official Cookbook">Get the Pac-Man: The Official Cookbook on Amazon</h2></p><div catalogid="967c2dac-ccec-43fc-a71a-3a6ea661802b" id="220793"><div id="220793" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pac-Man: The Official Cookbook</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's filled with a wide variety of recipes, from healthy quick bites to full meals for the family. Each recipe comes complete with easy-to-follow instructions and crisp full-color photographs to show off the finished product. As you'd expect, many of them are fun and creative nods to Pac-Man's long history. You can make a pepperoni pizza in the iconic shape of Pac-Man, turn Blinky into a hearty tomato soup, whip up some sweet cherry pocket pies, and even make eerily accurate Ghost cake pops. Personally, the smash burger recipe has my attention. Pick up Pac-Man: The Official Cookbook now for just $30 to level up your cooking skills and try something new in the kitchen. </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pac-Man Cookbook Preview</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Pac-Man related news, the next entry into the yellow blob's video game library is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/shadow-labyrinth-official-release-date-announcement-trailer-nintendo-direct-2025">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, a bizarre take on both the Metroidvania genre and traditional Pac-Man mechanics, based on the Secret Level episode titled Circle. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-review-prime-video-tim-miller">We gave Secret Level a 5 overall</a>, and in our review said "[w]ith a dubious selection of source material and indistinct styles of animation, Secret Level struggles to find satisfying stories for a short-form anthology." </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
