            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">I ain't got time to bleed.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> is finally getting a minigun and other weapons fans have long-called for as part of the jungle-themed Python Commandos Warbond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Due out December 2, the Python Commandos Premium Warbond adds new armor and weapons to Arrowhead’s explosive third-person action game. As well as the new minigun, which Helldivers 2 has been crying out for since launch, the warbond includes a chainsword and a flame dog.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s the minigun that’s the star here, and this, coupled with the jungle theme rekindles memories of the original Predator movie, in which Jesse Ventura fired a minigun called ‘Old Painless’ at hapless enemy soldiers as well as a Yautja, while uttering the iconic line: “I ain't got time to bleed.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, if you’re fighting back against the Automatons, perhaps Helldivers 2’s new minigun will give off Terminator 2 vibes. After all, Arnold Schwarzenegger was partial to the occasional minigun, wasn’t he? At least he kept those cops alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, Katherine Baskin, Social Media and Community Manager at Arrowhead, leaned into the long overdue arrival of the minigun with a fun, in-universe message to players:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Ministry of Defense received thousands of requests from squad commanders for a minigun and we’re excited to finally give our Helldivers access to the M-1000 Maxigun! Belt-fed with ultra-high ammo capacity, this one is sure to make those bugs bleed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The AX/FLAM-75 “Guard Dog” Hot Dog, meanwhile, is a drone equipped with a flamethrower “to coat your foes in the fires of freedom before returning to your backpack to refuel.” And then there’s the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool, which very much looks like a chainsword that the Emperor of the grimdark 41st millennium would approve of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new primary weapon is a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher called the AR/GL-21 One-Two. “Heavy to wield, but the damage dealt is heavy too, making your primary slot more versatile than ever with two guns in one,” Arrowhead explained. check out images of all the new weapons in the slideshow of screenshots, below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2: Python Commandos Premium Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The armor, too, leans into the Predator vibes. The RS-20 Constrictor light armor set is the official uniform for the League of Patriotic Arm Wrestlers, “so it’s guaranteed to give your squad bigger and more rippling biceps to intimidate the enemy.” Arrowhead! You son of a bitch!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s a fun Rambo reference: “but if you’re carrying the team, maybe you need the RS-40 Best of Prey: a heavy armor set patterned after legendary Helldiver, Ronald Mambo and his famously powerful and burly physique.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both of these armors are equipped with the Rock Solid passive, which makes your Helldiver more steadfast against staggering and ragdolling attacks.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/25/a690f335c0e8fdde0e351c3824da84fbcc85f82a-1764080654886.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll also have two capes and coordinating player cards available: Foe Rent Asunder, which is pre-tattered to give a battle-worn appearance, and Mark of the Constrictor, for Helldivers "who strangle out any anti-democratic behavior they encounter."

PC-specific features include AI upscaling via Nvidia DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 3, an unlocked framerate, Japanese and Chinese voiceover, ultrawide display support, higher resolution environment textures, and DualSense support for haptic feedback and trigger effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, though, a new report from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-selling-playstation-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Alinea Analytics</u></a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/sony-estimated-to-have-made-usd1-5-billion-from-steam-but-the-novelty-is-wearing-off#:~:text=Image:%20Push%20Square,of%20impact%20they%20once%20were" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PushSquare</u></a>) estimates that while Sony has made an astonishing $1.5 billion from Steam since it started bringing its first-party titles to Valve's platform, this has mostly been buoyed by the initial rollout, with sales of sequels — think <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west"><u>Horizon Forbidden West</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War: Ragnarök</a> — slowing down. Analysts suggest this shows "the novelty is wearing off."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"All of Sony’s major franchises have already landed on PC. The audience that was once excited to experience these games for the first time has largely been served. Later releases naturally face smaller potential audiences, and our estimates clearly show this," analyst Rhys Elliott wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We launch-aligned our Steam estimates for God of War and its sequel, God of War Ragnarök. We found that God of War sold 2.5M copies after 427 days on Steam, over 2.5x more copies than Ragnarök sold in the same timeframe. Also, 13% of God of War’s Steam players also played Ragnarök on Steam." The same trend can be applied to Marvel's Spider-Man sequel.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve itself has made around $350 million from the 30% cut it takes from all games purchased on Steam, the analyst estimated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review"><u>IGN's Stellar Blade review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: "Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre."
