            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/outlast-film-adaptation-in-the-works-from-saw-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The primary writer on the game series is working on the screenplay.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Outlast is getting a film adaptation, and it's in the hands of a studio well-versed in the horror genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Saw studio Lionsgate, which is also behind series like The Hunger Games and John Wick, announced on Wednesday a deal with developer Red Barrels to bring Outlast to the big screen. The adaptation (which was first revealed by <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3837643/the-studio-behind-saw-brings-iconic-horror-game-outlast-to-the-big-screen-exclusive/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloody Disgusting</a>) is being led by horror producer Roy Lee (It, Barbarian, Late Night with the Devil).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">JT Perry, who served as the primary writer on the Outlast games, is working on the screenplay. In a statement, Perry called the adaptation "an incredible opportunity to dive deeper into the characters and killers we love.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/30/outlast-1730307482226.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Outlast is the latest horror video game to get a film adaptation.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lionsgate hasn't revealed too much else about how closely it'll follow the plot of the games, but it does promise to capture the horror elements Outlast become known for — "immersive atmosphere, chilling sound design, and relentless suspense" — in its announcement. Further information, including a release window, is still pending, but it's still very early days. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When Outlast launched in 2012, it changed the landscape of horror gaming, setting a new standard for immersion in the genre,” Lee said in a statement. “Its deep, emergent lore has provided a perfect foundation for creating a film that delves into the psychological and physical horrors at the core of the franchise. I’m excited to bring this unique world to life for both new viewers and the series’ dedicated fans.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As die-hard fans of horror across every medium, at Red Barrels we are great admirers of Roy Lee’s and Lionsgate’s work," added David Chateauneuf, co-founder and creative director at Red Barrels. "Horror movies old and new have had an undeniable impact on our franchise over the years, and to now have the opportunity to work on an Outlast film with true horror legends is a dream, or should I say, nightmare, come true."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Outlast released in 2013, and the first-person psychological survival game quickly gained traction for that aforementioned immersive horror atmosphere. Outlast followed journalist Miles Upshur as he investigated a remote psychiatric hospital, but its 2017 standalone sequel picked up on another cast of characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most recently, Red Barrels released multiplayer game The Outlast Trials last year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outlast-trials-review">IGN gave it a 7/10</a>, calling it "a bloody cooperative horror game that burns brightly, but fizzles after a few enjoyable hours."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's only the latest horror video game to head to the big screen, with Five Nights at Freddy's 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-2-gets-2025-release-date-m3gan-20-moves-back-one-month">coming next December</a> and an Until Dawn film <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-gets-2025-release-date">releasing next April</a>. For more, check out our breakdown of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/upcoming-video-game-movies-and-tv-shows">every video game adaptation in the works</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.
