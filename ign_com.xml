The sequel to Mutant Mayhem is still due out September 17, 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First released back in 2020, The Last Ronin features a dystopian world in which all but one of the Turtles have perished, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-last-ronin-tmnt-game-god-of-war">drawing inspiration from God of War</a> among other works.

In January, Paramount hailed the success of the Sonic movie franchise after Sonic the Hedgehog 3 helped it pass $1 billion at the global box office. 2024’s Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which stars Keanu Reeves as Shadow, made nearly half a billion dollars during its theatrical run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It feels like early days for this new era of Turtles films, and there’s no indication when the first movie will come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
