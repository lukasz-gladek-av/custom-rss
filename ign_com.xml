However, the presentation ended with one big tease that’s farther out – a major feature coming to World of Warcraft’s next expansion that players have been asking about for years: player housing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The presentation didn’t offer any real details about exactly how player housing would work or what it would entail. All we learned is that the feature is in the works, and that we’ll finally see it in World of Warcraft: Midnight, the game’s next expansion planned for a full reveal in late summer of 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of player housing has been toyed around with in expansions going as far back as the Warlords of Draenor. At the time, the “Garrison” feature was floated as WoW’s answer to player housing, but ultimately fell short of the customizability and more permanent nature of player housing in other MMORPGs, such as Final Fantasy 14.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Garrisons were ultimately abandoned at the end of Warlords of Draenor, serving no real lasting purpose for most players, and Blizzard hasn’t revisited the idea of player housing since. Notably, Guild Wars 2 just implemented player housing earlier this year as well, suggesting the feature is a popular one for MMO players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, we don’t know much else about what World of Warcraft’s next expansion, Midnight, will entail. We did see a content roadmap during the presentation that suggests the expansion will be officially unveiled in late summer of 2025. Midnight will be the second part of what Blizzard is calling “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-three-expansions-in-world-of-warcraft-the-worldsoul-saga-blizzcon-2023">The Worldsoul Saga</a>”, which also encompasses The War Within and the expansion following Midnight, entitled The Last Titan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-everything-announced">everything announced from today’s Warcraft Direct right here</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-1-and-2-remasters-shadow-dropped-with-improved-graphics-quality-of-life-improvements-and-other-new-features">remasters of Warcraft I and II</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-next-major-patch-will-finally-visit-the-legendary-goblin-capital-undermine">next patch for The War Within</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-classic-heads-to-mists-of-pandaria-next-year">next update for World of Warcraft: Classic</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

They’ll receive a new customizable ground mount specifically built for use in Undermine (it’s a fancy car) that goes really, <em>really </em>fast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As usual for a new major patch, Undermine(d) will bring with it numerous new activities. There’s a new arena map, and a new dungeon, Operation Floodgate, which will join the remaining four The War Within launch dungeons in the Mythic pool. There will also be two new delves, some new variations on existing delves, and new story and updates for delve companion Brann Bronzebeard. Finally, there’s a new eight-boss raid, The Liberation of Undermine, which will take teams through the city itself and into the decadent heart of the goblin empire, where players will finally fight goblin faction leader Gallywix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undermine is a significant location in the Warcraft universe, though this is the first time players will visit it. In Warcraft’s history, Undermine was the underground site beneath the isle of Kezan that goblins claimed for their capital after rebelling against the Zandalari trolls. However, during the Cataclysm, the volcano the city was situated beneath erupted. The goblins evacuated the surface of Kezan, and Undermine was thought to have been destroyed. However, there have been hints ever since then that Undermine is still operational, and the new patch will allow us to see the city for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft patch 11.1 “Undermine(d)” is planned for release early next year, with a patch 11.2 coming in the summer.
