            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"i really appreciate the nomination, support and votes, but it doesn't feel right in this category."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Vedinad, developer of Megabonk, has withdrawn his game from The Game Awards following its nomination for Best Debut Indie Game, saying it doesn't qualify for the category.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post to Twitter/X</a> from the official Megabonk account, vedinad made the announcement today:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm withdrawing from The Game Awards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's an honor and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately i don't think it qualifies for the category 'Debut Indie Game'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game 🥸</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"i really appreciate the nomination, support and votes, but it doesn't feel right in this category. you should vote for another one of the amazing debut titles, they are all amazing games! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"thanks again! new megabonk update coming soon ✌️"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update 2.23pm PT: </strong>Megabonk was listed as a nominee under Best Debut Indie, along with Blue Prince, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Despelote, and Dispatch. Since this statement, The Game Awards creator Geoff Keighley has shared a statement of his own acknowledging the request and stating that Megabonk would be removed <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990899068022005881?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a Twitter/X post</a>. At the time of this update, Megabonk was still listed on The Game Awards website as a nominee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"@MegabonkGame, a nominee for Best Debut Indie Game, reached out to clarify that he is an established solo developer who had been presenting himself as a new creator under the name Vedinad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re grateful for his honesty. As a result, MegaBonk will be removed from the category.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"He’ll share more about his story when he’s ready, but we respect that he didn’t want to take recognition away from other debut teams — even though the game itself is outstanding."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Original story continues below:</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Critically, Best Debut Indie is awarded to the "best debut game created by a new independent studio." So what counts as a new, independent studio? This definition certainly can get a little fuzzy - game dev teams are often Ships of Theseus, with certain groups sticking together, hiring others, and rebranding. For instance, Dispatch was made by AdHoc Studio, and is the team's collective first original game. However, AdHoc was founded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-reportedly-began-as-a-new-splinter-cell-game-by-the-dispatch-developers">by a team of former Ubisoft and Telltale developers who had previously been working together</a>. Cocoon, by Geometric Interactive, won Debut Indie back in 2023 and was arguably in a similar situation with former developers from Playdead. But by that logic, it's also unlikely anyone's "first game" would ever make it to The Game Awards, as most people's first projects are small, student, or experimental.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vedinad's argument at least makes a bit more sense for himself, given that he is effectively a solo developer and has worked on other projects under other names. But even solo developers have help: Miguel Angel, for instance, is credited with the OST, Giovanni Fim made the Steam art, and there are a handful of names listed as playtesters, as well as a "special thanks" to vedinad's mom. Vedinad seems to be as close to a solo dev as anyone really gets. What really is a game studio, anyway?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What this ultimately seems to boil down to is that there's at least some level of confusion about what the categories of The Game Awards actually mean. This isn't the first time this has happened. In 2023, Dave the Diver - a game made by a subsidiary of Korean gaming giant Nexon - was up for Best Indie, leading <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/keighley-weighs-in-on-debate-over-dave-the-diver-qualifying-for-best-indie-game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TGA creator Geoff Keighley to respond</a> that indie can "mean different things to different people," and even the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-director-finally-ends-indie-debate-after-controversial-the-game-awards-2023-nomination" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> director admitted the nomination was confusing</a>. We've also seen some oddities like Sifu being up for Best Fighting Game in 2022 (it's an action beat-em-up), and even some recent eyebrow raisers like Monster Hunter Wilds being nominated this year for best RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Define it all however you want, but Megabonk's developer has spoken, as has Keighley. You can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">catch up on all the other 2025 nominees right here</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/megabonk-quick-review">check out our early thoughts on Megabonk here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a trading card game kind of day today, with deals so good that I couldn't help but focus in on them. Specifically, I'm talking about Pokémon and Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Air Bender. Not only are there some exciting restocks, but the potential savings today are literally ridiculous.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collector Booster Boxes for Avatar have been restocked at Amazon, with Phastasmal Flames and Mega Evolution restocks coming in heavy too. I've included where's the best to buy at face value alone in today's article, but the heavy hitting discounts on Amazon come from applying for an Amazon Visa card and using AMEX or Discover to pay $1 on your order to get over 50% off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means free Booster Bundles, Blisters, Premium Collections and Boosters with just the gift card alone. But when considering Booster Boxes, such as Phantasmal Flames or Avatar Collector Booster Box, you'll halve the price left to pay. Let's get into it and i'll guide you through exactly how to do it.</p><p id="magic-the-gathering-avatar-the-l"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The L">Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230696"><div id="230696" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best things Nickelodeon put out when I was a kid, and it's fandom still beats strong. This Universes Beyond MTG set hasn't only got me back into Avatar, but it's got me on MTG Arena to learn the game, not just collect it when I can. Collector Boosters aren't for playing, it's for those who want some solid binder material with far better pull rates than standard play boosters. There's a premium for that of course, but Amazon won't charge until it ships, which means you'll probably have a day or two to get the money you need together.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article"> Up to 50% off Pokémon TCG and Free $60 Gift Card</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Imagine getting Pokémon TCG Booster Bundles for free, or paying $20 to $30 for an Elite Trainer Box, cool right? Well it's a real deal, and here's how to do it. Start by applying for a Amazon Visa card, then if accepted you'll get an instant $60 Amazon gift card added to your account, which means free Booster Bundles, Premium Collections and Booster Blisters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're after something more expensive and want to knock the price down before using the $60 gift voucher, you'll need an AMEX or Discovery card. By paying $1 on your Pokémon TCG items in your basket, you'll receive an automatic discount up to 50%. So whatever you need to pay after the gift card is cut in half. That's not bad when you're talking Elite Trainer Boxes and Booster Boxes. If this discount doesn't apply, check the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31VGq?object_uuid=d80120ca-bbf4-4fed-bfed-cb314e194b09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">loyalty page on Amazon to see if you're eligible</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TCGPlayer 10% Cashback Black Friday Event </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You read that right, everything is eligibe too. Buy something, get 10% back as in-store credit. With sets like Mega Evolution and Phantasmal Flames finding new floors, this is 100% the best time to fill those gaps in your binder. The sale kicks off on Black Friday, November 28. and ends on Cyber Monday December 1.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Elegoo Saturn 4 Ultra Resin 3D Printer Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elegoo Saturn 4 Ultra line of Resin printers are perfect for anything that needs intricate detail, especially the 16k model, although the standard ultra does an amazing job too. The Saturn 4 Ultra and Mercury V3.0 wash is a perfect starter kit for anyone wanting to get into the hobby.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Elegoo FDM Printer Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">What if I said I printed a full sized Stormtrooper helmet on a Neptune 4 Max in one go? It was such a fun project and this printer can handle some insane projects on the large and small side. In fact all of these FDM 3D printers are great for printing anything practical. I'm looking at you cosplayers.</p><p id="meta-quest-3s-128gb-amazon-exclusiv"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Meta Quest 3S 128GB (Amazon Exclusiv">Meta Quest 3S 128GB (Gorilla Tag Bundle) </h2></p><p id="teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-la"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The La">TMNT: The Last Ronin Box Set</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230604"><div id="230604" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Preorder: Releases November 25</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin Box Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This set contains three hardcover graphics novels encompassing the TMNT: The Last Ronin continuity. That includes "Lost Years", "The Last Ronin", and "The Last Ronin II: Re-Evolution". I won't spoil them for you, but this is one of the best series i've ever read, and I'm not a massive TMNT fan. And you won't be charged for your preorder until this bad boy ships. Not a bad deal at all with that cheeky 25% off.</p></div><p id="final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-annive"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Annive">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230603"><div id="230603" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (Nintendo Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For Final Fantasy fans who haven't played the 2D old school games, or for those who are fans of the sprite-based RPG vibe, this is the deal for you. It features a re-arranged soundtrack by original series c omposer Nobuo Uematsu, improved gamplay, a user interface overhaul, auto battle options and more quality of life improvements. 47% off makes this collection a no-brainer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Let the games begin.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s nearly here: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday sales</a> are kicking off this week. And if you’re a fan of board games, you’ll probably want to have an idea of what to expect deal-wise on popular tabletop titles. You’ve come to the right place. I’m the board game editor at IGN, and I’ve been following all the Black Friday board game deals for years. Let’s dive in.</p><p id="buy-1-get-1-half-off-live-now"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Buy 1, get 1 half off - Live now">Buy 1, Get 1 Half Off on Board Games Right Now</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't actually have to wait for Black Friday to save on board games. Right now, both <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7NOL?object_uuid=dbf6e013-25fa-4772-8a91-36f95d8a53bd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdp0jv?object_uuid=dbf6e013-25fa-4772-8a91-36f95d8a53bd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target</a> have sales that get you <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-buy-1-get-1-half-off-board-game-sale-ahead-of-black-friday-2025">half off a board game</a> when you buy one at regular price. This applies to a decent number of popular games for board games, including Catan, Splendor, and Horrified. But tons of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">classics</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board games</a> are also eligible, like Scrabble and Mouse Trap.</p><p id="what-games-will-get-discounts"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What games will get discounts?">What Games Will Get Discounts?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to Black Friday board game deals, such a wide swath of games go on sale each year that basically nothing is off the table (please excuse the pun). If this year is like years past, you’ll be able to save on just about every board game on the market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The discounts we saw last year ranged from 20% off games all the way up to 65% off. You could save on popular standards like Azul and Pandemic. You could save on family-friendly games like Exploding Kittens and UNO. You could save on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">horror-themed board games</a> like Alien: Fate of the Nostromo and Arkham Horror: The Card Game. Whatever games you're interested in, you can likely find something on sale that you'll want to pick up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, for Cyber Monday last year, Amazon ran a “Buy 2, Get 1 Free” sale. Since many of the games were already discounted, that was like a deal on top of a deal. So keep an eye out during Black Friday 2025 for opportunities to stack discounts.</p><p id="which-retailers-will-have-sales"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Which retailers will have sales?">Which Retailers Will Have Board Game Sales?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the retailers where the deals can be found, the main ones to look at are Amazon, Walmart, and Target. If you want to branch out a bit, Barnes and Noble is usually a good place to look for discounts as well. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2025-start-date-and-sale-predictions">Amazon's Black Friday sale</a> kicking off on November 20 this year, that will likely be the first place you should start looking for deals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.
