That means the Left Behind Ellie-focused prequel DLC, as well as The Last of Us Part 2’s No Return and Lost Levels content are all included. If you’re a fan of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series">HBO TV series</a> retelling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-cast-whos-new-and-coming-back-to-the-hbo-show">starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey</a> but have yet to dive into the video games that started it all, you should know that the all-encompassing digital bundle costs $99.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As shared in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/10/the-last-of-us-complete-hits-ps5-today-physical-collectors-edition-coming-july/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation.Blog</u></a> post authored by Naughty Dog Head of Studio Neil Druckmann, a physical The Last of Us Complete Collector’s Edition is currently set to launch July 10 for $109.99, with <a href="https://zdcs.link/9lXJqd?object_uuid=95b6ecd1-3ca3-42cd-9d76-07aec5c8da0a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>pre-orders available now</u></a>.

Joel and Ellie’s adventure came to PS4 with improved graphics in 2014 and was then reimagined for PS5 with a remake in 2022. The Last of Us Part 2 continued Ellie’s story in 2020 and then went on to receive its own remaster in early 2024. Both stories have also since come to PC, with The Last of Us Part 1 arriving in 2023 and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered arriving just last week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Last of Us Complete brings all of Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic offerings together under one umbrella as yet another re-release. While many may be confused to see PlayStation revisiting Joel and Ellie’s world once again, the timing does coincide with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-spoiler-free">HBO’s The Last of Us Season 2</a>, which will premiere its first episode this Sunday.
