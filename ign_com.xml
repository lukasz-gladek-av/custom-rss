            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-team-fortress-2-comic-has-released-its-long-awaited-final-issue<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Team Fortress 2 comic has just released its newest update, seven years since the last issue and seemingly the finale to this long journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Fortress 2 Issue 7 "The Days Have Worn Away" is the first update to the online digital comic series since January 10, 2017, and it looks like it might just be the comic's finale based on this tweet from Valve writer Erik Wolpaw.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Pic from the last tf comics meeting ever. (not pictured: Ira Crosby) <a href="https://t.co/snfI2KiM27" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/snfI2KiM27</a></p>â€” Erik Wolpaw (@Wolpaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wolpaw/status/1870213443221106918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Did you know the construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was one hundred and ninety nine years late? Literally everyone alive when construction started was dead by the time it finished," The Team Fortress 2 team writes in a <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=235677" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post </a>announcing the new issue. A perhaps more extreme example of something taking a long time to complete than this comic, but an apt analogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For fans of Team Fortress 2, you'll find the gang all here including a newly married Soldier and even a maskless Spy. The issue also has a dedication to Rick May, the voice of Soldier who died in 2020 at the age of 79. The story itself concludes a long, winding journey that TF2 fans have been waiting a long time to see updated, so I won't spoil the rest of the comic here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The comics have served as an invaluable tome to find out more about the different TF2 characters, especially background characters like Miss Pauling and The Administrator. The comics are very much worth a full read if you haven't checked them out already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve is continuing the trend of emerging from what seems like some kind of gaming hibernation, first with the release of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a> and the testing of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valve-steam-announcement-page">new hero shooter, Deadlock</a>. This new comic issue serves that Valve creatives are still tinkering in the background, working on new stories for our favorite games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.
