Bloober said Konami will continue as both the publisher and rights holder of the mystery game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno:</p><blockquote>Konami, a legendary name in the gaming industry, sought a partner who could breathe new life into one of its most iconic franchises — Silent Hill. Bloober Team was selected for their expertise in horror and atmospheric storytelling, and in 2021, both companies signed a partnership agreement. In October 2022, during the official Silent Hill Transmission livestream, it was announced that Bloober Team was working on a remake of Silent Hill 2, widely regarded as one of the best psychological horror games in history. </blockquote><blockquote>The success of the remake proved that Bloober Team had perfectly captured the atmosphere and depth of the original while introducing crucial innovations. The game was well-received by players, earning an 86/100 rating on Metacritic and an 88/100 on OpenCritic, along with numerous awards, including Game of the Year 2024 from IGN Japan and Best Horror Game of the Year from the IGN Community Awards.</blockquote><blockquote>The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project. The deal aligns with Bloober Team’s strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework. </blockquote><blockquote>Our collaboration with Konami has been incredibly fruitful, and the success of Silent Hill 2 speaks for itself. By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 2 remake went on sale on PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam on October 8, 2024 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-console-exclusive-to-ps5-for-1-year"><u>there’s no word on an Xbox Series X and S version</u></a> yet), and just a few days later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week"><u>had sold one million copies</u></a>. This was thought to have made Silent Hill 2 remake the fastest-selling Silent Hill game ever, but Konami has yet to rubber stamp that potential record.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review"><u>Silent Hill 2 remake review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sales success of the Silent Hill 2 remake has clearly strengthened Konami’s plans for the franchise, which have ramped up significantly in recent years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-townfall"><u>Silent Hill: Townfall</u></a> are both still in the works, but perhaps Konami will also continue to remake past Silent Hill games. There's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-movie-first-look-pyramid-head"><u>a film adaptation of Silent Hill 2</u></a> coming, too. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/early-silent-hill-2-remake-mods-remove-hair-sheen-the-fog-and-even-turn-the-game-into-sunny-hills"><u>modders are doing eye-catching things with the Silent Hill 2 remake on PC</u></a>, including removing hair sheen, the game’s famous fog, and even turning it into Sunny Hills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, what is this new Bloober game for Konami? If it’s a new Silent Hill game, is it a remake of a previous game, or a brand new game in the franchise?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Silent Hill 2 remake features several new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/silent-hill-2-remake/Puzzle_Guide"><u>puzzles</u></a> and redesigned maps, so if you need help navigating through it all, head to our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/silent-hill-2-remake/Walkthrough"><u>Silent Hill 2 Walkthrough Hub</u></a>.
