            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has added health bars to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> more than three years after the game's release, prompting a mixed reaction from fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, Nintendo dropped an unexpected update to its inky shooter threequel, which originally launched for the original Switch back in September 2022. Alongside a new "Aura Flow" feature and other tweaks, the patch has notably added health bars — something which has come as a huge surprise to fans of the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In patch notes published alongside the game's 11.0.0 update, Nintendo announced that it would now be possible "to see an opponent's remaining health when they've been hit. Previously, you could only see how damaged an enemy was by looking closely at how much ink they were covered in – not so easy to do in the heat of battle!"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Apart from the surprise of such a major change being made so late in Splatoon 3's life, it's that latter sentence that has left fans with confusion. Splatoon has always featured a visual representation of damage without the need for health bars — how splattered in ink a character is — and health pools in general are typically quite low, with most weapons splatting foes in three or four hits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is an important part of Splatoon gameplay, of course, but only one component — as matches revolve around coating maps with ink to establish territory control. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You'll also be able to see the health bars of your teammates if they've taken damage," Nintendo continued. "Keeping an eye on these health bars is a great way to support your allies or chase down weakened foes – even if you've teamed up with Inklings and Octolings you're not familiar with."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">adding a health bar after the games update cycle finished like a year ago was certainly a choice <a href="https://t.co/glOvo4bme6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/glOvo4bme6</a> <a href="https://t.co/P1ZMDIA022" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/P1ZMDIA022</a></p>— sunny 🍓 corbeau posting (@sunnydr0pdraws) <a href="https://twitter.com/sunnydr0pdraws/status/2016077198583615687?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 27, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Health bars are even funnier when you consider Splatoon came up with a unique way to have health bars diegetically - by having the enemy getting covered in ink, that's the stuff that makes the game special," wrote one fan, <a href="https://x.com/eiectrodev/status/2016192013218050373?s=46&amp;t=CBN0_ccfDeNt8JVYODuUrQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EIectroDev</a>. "Correct me if I'm wrong but it really took the Splatoon developers three games and over ten years to add visible health bars," noted <a href="https://x.com/thinginator90/status/2016117231747584386?s=46&amp;t=CBN0_ccfDeNt8JVYODuUrQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thinginator90</a>. "The minds of Nintendo devs never cease to amaze."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This health bar is so ugly im so sorry i hope we can toggle it off," added <a href="https://x.com/candy_draws_o_o/status/2016155014897508654?s=46&amp;t=CBN0_ccfDeNt8JVYODuUrQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">candy_draws_o_o</a>, one of many fans to complain about how basic the health bar looks. (And no, you can't toggle it off.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week's update also added "Aura Flow," a gameplay feature that rewards competitive play — splatting multiple enemies in quick succession — with a burst of area-covering ink, plus a 30-second buff to speed and other stats. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I hates this and the health bar update," said <a href="https://x.com/kidatoasobou/status/2016306947281031216?s=46&amp;t=CBN0_ccfDeNt8JVYODuUrQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KidaToAsobou</a>. "It just makes Splatoon a more aggressive/competitive game. [Splatoon 3] already did that by making the maps smaller forcing players to fight more but this only further incentivizes people to attack the enemy team rather then inking."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's perhaps unsurprising to see a negative reaction to such changes from fans who have become used to playing Splatoon 3 a certain way for so long. But this only further begs the question of why Nintendo is adding these features now, years after launch. By way of an answer, several fans have suggested the possibility that Nintendo is now testing ideas it is experimenting with ahead of a new iteration of Splatoon, examining feedback and using Splatoon 3 as live gameplay environment to see how player behavior is impacted. "Testing splatoon 4 features I reckon," wrote <a href="https://x.com/pejic839/status/2016193004537524368?s=46&amp;t=CBN0_ccfDeNt8JVYODuUrQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pejic839</a>, "like when they added online to Super Mario party as a test for Superstars."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up for the Splatoon franchise will be Switch 2 single-player spin-off Splatoon Raiders, which will expand the series with a more story-orientated entry. As for Splatoon 4, while another game in the franchise feels inevitable, there's no word on that yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the showrunners of the Fallout TV series has discussed the fate of Mr. House as we approach the Season 2 finale, and explained how the show has still managed to avoid making a New Vegas ending canon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Fallout Season 2 follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-takes-the-fog-of-war-approach-to-avoid-making-any-new-vegas-ending-canon-creators-say"><u>the creators of the Fallout TV show told IGN that Season 2 avoids making any New Vegas ending canon by taking what they call "the fog of war approach."</u></a> Fans of the Fallout video games had wondered how Season 2 might reflect the various endings of Obsidian’s much-loved Fallout New Vegas, given the show is canon and is set 15 years after the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A quick reminder of where we’re at in the Fallout timeline: the Fallout TV show is set in 2296, nine years after the events of Fallout 4 and 15 years after the events of Fallout: New Vegas. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-fans-are-convinced-a-brotherhood-of-steel-airship-confirms-one-of-two-canon-endings-from-fallout-4"><u>We’ve already seen a debate about which Fallout 4 ending should be considered canon</u></a>, if any. But what about New Vegas?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on the choices the player, aka The Courier, makes throughout the course of the game, New Vegas can end with victory for the player during the Battle of Hoover Dam, which drives out all factions including Mr. House himself, a victory for Mr. House in which he remains in control of New Vegas and takes over Hoover Dam, a victory for Caesar's Legion, or a victory for the New California Republic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Episode 7 of Season 2, The Ghoul meets Maximus, and he uses the Cold Fusion diode that Maximus stole from the Brotherhood to power up the machine we saw back when Cooper met House in a flashback on the top floor of Lucky 38. The big terminal boots up, House appears on screen and says: "Well hello, old chum."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This led to a theory that New Vegas’ "The House Always Wins" ending was canon because that’s the only ending House survives. But in a new interview with <a href="https://ew.com/fallout-season-2-finale-cover-story-exclusive-11893674" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>, co-showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet said that’s not the case because what we’re seeing here is yet another version of House that needed the diode to exist.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2, Episode 1 Video Game Details - Characters and Factions</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It did seem to us like a version of himself powered by cold fusion would be sort of the ultimate possible incarnation of Robert House," Robertson-Dworet explained. "And as someone who is interested in robotics and artificial non-biological versions of selves, it made a lot of sense to us that this would've been something that he would've developed and sort of be the ultimate version of him. I've always seen it as something that allows for many players' experiences to have happened, but still Robert House had this other version of himself, that he was always ready to create and what he needed was the diode."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Entertainment Weekly then asked if this is in fact House's final <em>final </em>form, and Robertson-Dworet declined to properly answer. "That's an interesting question,” she said, keeping her cards close to her chest. “I'm not answering that, but I'm very intrigued by the question.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robertson-Dworet did go on to tease The Ghoul’s bargain with House, which Episode 7 sets up, and its impact on the much-loved character’s future. "He's just given House what he wanted after 200 years,” she said. “He's finally given him the thing that he's most desired. And the question, of course, is what will he get in exchange? He obviously is looking for his wife and daughter, and what will he find?"</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout TV Show Video Game Easter Eggs – Events</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Walton Goggins teased that Episode 8 will finally resolve one of the burning questions fans have had since Season 1, Episode 1: how did his pre-war character, Cooper Howard, come to be at that birthday party with his daughter, right as the bombs fell?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I mean, the whole first seven minutes of this experience in Season 1 was about [Cooper being] a guy at a birthday party,” he said. “Well, how did he get to that birthday party? What happened? It's all leading somewhere."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are now on the final episode of Fallout Season 2, which, given Season 3 is already confirmed, will no doubt pose just as many questions as it answers.
