            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This one's a ghost.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Razer Kraken Kitty V2 Gengar Edition gaming headset remains sold out everywhere except eBay, meaning you'll currently need to pay a premium to get your hands on this popular collaboration. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Razer's Kraken Kitty family has been one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-headset">most popular gaming headset</a> lineups in recent years due to its unique cat ear aesthetic. And of course, the only way you can make something so cute even more appealing is to brand it with an equally beloved property like Pokémon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it makes sense that Pokéfans would be after the Gengar Edition, which decks out the Kraken Kitty V2  in the ghost-type Pokémon's iconic purple style. But high demand left the headset out of stock on <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-kraken-kitty-v2/RZ04-04730300-R3M1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Razer's website</a> almost immediately after the product listing went live, leaving interested buyers having to head over to eBay for any chance at snagging this one even a month after its initial release.</p><div catalogid="38b61237-066c-4464-b605-225fc443133d" id="228622"><div id="228622" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Razer Kraken Kitty V2 - Gengar Edition</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Product sold over MSRP by a third-party seller.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Razer sells the Kraken Kitty V2 Gengar Edition for $139.99 — which is already $40 more than the standard colorways of the headset — but prices on eBay have already pushed well beyond that as sellers seem to be noticing the increasing interest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prices on eBay for the Kraken Kitty V2 Gengar Edition are currently ranging from around $165 - $190, with some listings even occasionally reaching over the $200 mark. So, if you're in the market for this collab, you'll have to decide whether you want to pay a noticeable premium or wait in hopes that Razer will restock soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, Razer has plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/razer-rolls-out-official-pokmon-pc-gaming-accessories">other Pokémon-themed products</a>, as well as a variety of collabs featuring other popular properties like Hello Kitty and Minecraft. And if you don't mind skipping out on the purple colorway, you can actually score some of the company's wireless headsets, such as the <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-barracuda-x/RZ04-04430100-R3U1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barracuda X</a>, for less than the cost of this special Gengar version of the wired Kraken Kitty V2. We loved the Barracuda X in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/razer-barracuda-x-review">our review</a>, so it's an easy one to recommend in the same price range.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But hey, no one's going to blame you if you hold out for the cuter one. It's Gengar. We get it.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 30, 2025 8:09 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/razers-gengar-version-of-the-kraken-kitty-v2-is-still-sold-out-everywhere-except-ebay]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-bring-much-needed-combat-and-visual-upgrades</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-bring-much-needed-combat-and-visual-upgrades.1312933/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Yakuza fan, I’ve recommended the series from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, otherwise known as RGG, to plenty of people, but it has long come with one big caveat: Yakuza 3. It’s not that there is anything necessarily wrong with it, but with high-quality remakes of the first games in the series, and the more modern and refined graphics and gameplay of the newer entries, it has stood out a bit as a bit of an odd duck, looking and playing worse than the games before and after. However, with the just-announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rgg-studio-direct-2025-confirms-yakuza-kiwami-3-remake-spinoff-dark-ties-and-more-heres-everything-announced"><u>Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties</u></a>, a twin pack combining a remade Yakuza 3 alongside a brand-new companion game, that might all be about to change. I had a chance to play both at Tokyo Game Show 2025, and I came away impressed by how much RGG Studio is trying to improve and expand on the original. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Yakuza Kiwami 3</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza Kiwami 3 isn’t just an up-rezzed port; it’s a full remake. Everything is rebuilt, from the graphics to the combat to the new cut scenes and voice acting – including some modern motion capture to better bring the characters to life. While it will still follow the story of Yakuza 3, some scenes will play out differently or expand. It’s an ambitious agenda, but probably the right one to bring the now 16-year-old game to modern audiences. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My hands-on begins with Kazuma Kiryu chopping wood outside the Morning Glory Orphanage, where he was raised and now runs, in Okinawa. The modern graphics look great as he swings his axe, his sweat glistening in crisp 4K (for those that are into that sort of thing). After the events of Yakuza 2, he’s moved on from being a Yakuza and is trying to live a peaceful life running the orphanage. An eviction notice arrives, and Kiryu heads into town to confront the head of the Ryudo family, the owners of the land on which the orphanage is built. He runs into Rikiya Shimabukuro, a member of the Ryudo clan and, naturally, a brawl ensues, giving us our first taste of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-official-combat-gameplay-trailer"><u>updated battle system</u></a>. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Charging Kiriyu’s Heat Gauge to execute brutal finishers like smashing a chair on an opponent’s head never gets old.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiriyu has two fighting styles to employ. The first is Dragon of Dojima, his classic brawling style, mixing punches, kicks, throws, and environmental weapons like street signs, traffic cones, and even the odd bicycle when the opportunity presents itself. It’s as flashy as ever, and charging Kiriyu’s Heat Gauge to execute brutal finishers like smashing a chair on an opponent’s (in this case, Rikiya’s) head never gets old. The real magic comes when I switch to his brand new Ryukyu style, however. This style is rooted in Okinawan culture, and while using it, Kiryu combos through eight different weapons, like a pair of tonfa, a weighted chain, or, my personal favorite, a boat oar. I put away my opponent with a mix of all of the above, which was enough to convince Rikiya to direct me towards where to find his boss. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This opened up an opportunity for a bit of open-world exploration, which I took full advantage of, exploring a nearby street market, beating up some ruffians with a crowbar, and taking in a quick round of a golf mini-game. Okinawa looks great on the modern engine, and getting around was a breeze thanks to the new Street Surfer Mk. 0, a Segway-like rideable that Kiryu seems to be able to summon out of thin air for some quick joyriding. Zooming around on that, hopping off to beat the snot out of some goons with my tiny shield (also part of the Ryukyu set), then making a speedy getaway was so Yakuza in the best way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, I turned my attention back to the main story. As Rikiya escorts me to his headquarters, we are interrupted by a commotion as a rival family trashes a local market, taking the shop owner hostage. Kiriyu, sweet guy that he is, agrees to help, leading to a massive nine-vs-two melee, as he and Rikiya take on the boss and his lackeys. This really showcased how much more refined the combat is, as I was able to take advantage of the smooth movement and dodging, creating windows to bash the bad guys and escape, with a slick double-team KO of one poor crony eating a massive kick to the face from Kiryi while restrained by Rikiya. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My time in Yakuza Kiwami 3 ended there, but I barely scratched the surface of everything new coming to it. There will be more personal moments with supporting characters, time dedicated to running the daily operations at the orphanage and taking care of the kids, even a new team battle mode where you build your own biker gang to fight for turf with others. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dark Ties</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The bigger surprise of the Yakuza Kiwami 3 announcement was the reveal of Dark Ties, an all-new companion story to the main game.  This places you in the role of Yoshitaka Mine, the antagonist of Yakuza 3. Dark Ties covers Mine’s rise from a disgraced businessman, driven from his own tech startup, to the underworld boss that acts as Kazuma’s foil in Yakuza 3. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-a0751c8f4adedccafc6ce8de3d09f3147e1c1ff7-1920x1080-1759256313741.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">His story begins with Mine reflecting on his life and the loneliness that drove him to pursue wealth and influence. By happenstance, he witnesses a deadly fight between rival Yakuza families, and seeing the bond of men willing to die for their boss, Daigo Dojima, acts as a catalyst, and he sets out to see if he can find that same loyalty in the criminal underworld. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo takes place early in the game, with Mine tracking down Tsuyoshi Kanda, an infamous Yakuza just released from prison. Mine hopes Kanda will be his entry point to begin his own rise, though as is Yakuza tradition, you don’t go more than a few early steps before some punks decide to pick a fight. Apparently, Mine's suitcase looks expensive, and they want whatever is inside. A bad decision. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-ba732b95bcacaf8be1e93757deb185452b404294-1920x1080-1759256328386.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The core battle system is roughly the same as Yakuza 3, but with a few significant twists. Mine’s fighting style is very different from Kiryu’s, relying heavily on quick boxing combos, technical wrestling moves, and new aerial attacks. He can jump and plant a foot on the chest of one enemy, then leap to another, dishing out damage all around as he delivers an array of flying moves, like springboard jump kicks or mid-air tackles. They look very cool, and make for a fun bit of planning ahead as you scope out which enemies to latch onto and jump towards. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The core battle system is roughly the same as Yakuza 3, but with a few significant twists.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the standard Heat Gauge that fills up to enable special moves, Mine has three chained hearts that fill up as he lands attacks. Once at least one is full, he can activate a powerful buffed mode called Dark Awakening. This functions like a new fighting style, with a different moveset unleashing extremely powerful attacks.  More than one chained heart can be activated at once, increasing the potency of Dark Awakening. It’s a neat twist to make Mine’s gameplay more distinct, and tapping into the rage behind his calm exterior fits his character well. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-9cba6bf65a0beef3fe9d84599989fa573efcdfb4-1920x1080-1759256341008.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It quickly became clear these punks picked the wrong suitcase to try to snatch, as I knocked them senseless to the cheers of onlookers who witnessed the attempted robbery. With the ruffians handled, I’m given the option to head to the prison to track down Kanda or kill some time exploring the city. This sorry mission seems important, so naturally I… immediately go find a karaoke bar to sing a song. Hey, it is Yakuza after all. I rent the room, and Mine pours his heart and soul into his solo performance, which is really funny given his normally extremely stoic nature. I nail rhythm on my button presses, delivering a perfect performance befitting a man of Mine’s talents. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buoyed by my outstanding singing, I decide it’s time to get down to business and try to hail a cab to the prison where Kanda is being released. One more group of punks tries to stop me (nothing a fireman’s carry followed by a quick kick to the face couldn’t solve), and I find myself outside of the prison as Kanda takes out his frustration on his paltry, two-man welcoming committee. Kanda is penniless, his branch of the Yakuza family disgraced. As Mine tails him through the streets of Kamurocho, my hands-on time ends just as he rounds a corner to meet his future right-hand man for the first time. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-f6d5496302d2de4c46d55e782221f7e6f0f03ffb-1920x1080-1759256356109.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As a sucker for a good organized crime story, I’m definitely intrigued to see how much we get to witness Mine channel his inner Vito Corleone and build his criminal empire from the ground up, especially if it means some proper bromance time with Mine and Diago. The fact that it comes as part of the package with Yakuza Kiwami 3 is great, and I’m excited to see how it all turns out when Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties release on February 12, 2026. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-bring-much-needed-combat-and-visual-upgrades]]></content:encoded>
