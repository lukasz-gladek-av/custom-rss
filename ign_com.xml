Combined with sales of its early access PC version, which released in December 2023, the game has now topped 10 million units sold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we launched Ready or Not on PC, it took about 36 days to reach 1 million units sold," said VOID CEO, Julio Rodriguez. "On console, it took about 3.6 days. I’m incredibly proud of the team and what we’ve accomplished together. It’s a huge moment — and one we don’t take for granted." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rodriguez then went on to thank Ready or Not's players and "everyone who believed in the project."  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ready-or-not-developer-void-interactive-proceeds-with-controversial-censor-changes-to-satisfy-console-makers-despite-fan-blacklash-heres-the-full-patch-notes"><u>Last week</u></a>, July 15, VOID Interactive proceeded with changes introduced to controversial shooter Ready or Not despite widespread condemnation from fans who <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/NoRandomAddsPlsThx/recommended/1144200/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>claimed</u></a> the developer was "censoring" the game's gore and violence by "appeasing console market regulators." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">VOID said it had to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ready-or-not-review-bombed-on-steam-as-pc-players-claim-shooter-was-censored-to-satisfy-console-makers"><u>adjust levels of gore, nudity, violence, and the "mistreatment of children" ahead of console release</u></a>, and rather than "maintaining multiple versions with different assets and mechanics" that would "increase the likelihood of bugs," some aspects of the PC version would also have to be revised. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, VOID insisted the changes were "small enough that most people here wouldn't notice if we didn't say anything," but it "wanted to be transparent" with its players.

This is a good deal in the current climate, snap this up.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Stock Update</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is finally killing it for Pokémon TCG elite trainer box stock and pricing, and some are the closest to MSRP the big box retailer has been for weeks. Not only is the Black Bolt ETB vastly undercutting the secondary market, Paradox Rift ETB is even cheaper (And an overlooked set in my opinion, stock up now). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's other great deals on ex boxes too, which are also near MSRP and around the same or just under listings on TCG Player. The sealed market is becoming more competitive, so it's more important than ever to give eBay a quick check before hitting buy.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Nintendo Switch 2 Stock Updates</h2></p><div><div id="225528" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><div id="225529" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As predicted, Nintendo Switch 2's launch window is seeing stock shortages. If you didn't preorder at launch, you've probably been waiting for stock drops since launch. Amazon currently has it's invitation system in place for both the standard console SKU and the Mario Kart world bundle, so it's always worth getting on the waiting list whilst you wait. If successful, your purchase link will be live for 72 hours.</p><p id="2-x-nintendo-eshop-50-gift-card"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="2 x Nintendo eShop $50 Gift Card">2 x Nintendo eShop $50 Gift Card</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225542"><p data-cy="paragraph">Why pay $100 when you could pay $88?

It includes my favorite one,  Hyrule Historia, that fills in more than a few gaps in the LoZ lore, although the timeline has already been slightly retconned. It also includes full and expanded official guides for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">KRK Kreate Powered Studio Monitors</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can personally guarantee a set of powered studio monitors will sound better than almost any sound system with or without a subwoofer. The new line of KRK Kreate studio monitors aren't just for recording music (Although they'd do an amazing job), they're a versatile sound option for content creation, editing, gaming, watching TV and movies and more. Buyers can even teather to them via Bluetooth for no fuss connections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been using the 8-inch speaker models for a couple of weeks now, and they destory my soundbar and subwoofer combo that cost's nearly double the price of these. There's precision adjustments knobs on the back, which I keep mostly in neutral with volume up by half for a crisp flat sound with the right amount of bass. Although that can be cranked up when needed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally I use an audio splitter so my Krate 8s can handle my Nano QuadCortex guitar amp moddler, my TV audio and gaming PC audio for the best experience. For me, going from a 3-inch to 8-inch speaker option is night and day. The clarity difference and range is top-tier, not to mention the jack, XLR and aux outputs available on each monitor that fits in perfectly in everyone's setup. You're getting top-of-the-range brand quality without the "gaming" brand tax, it's a win-win.</p><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2">Apple AirPods Pro 2</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225530"><div id="225530" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features. At $199, they offer a strong balance of value and performance. The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="iniu-portable-charger-10000mah-45w"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W">INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225531"><div id="225531" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is ideal for carrying around when you've forgot to stick your phone on charge overnight, 45W is more than enough power to charge anything whilst using it, from phones to Nintendo Switch 2.

Another agreed, writing: "Duuuuuuude whaaaat this looked cool at first, but the gameplay got me so hyped. This looks frickin' legit. This has more Fallout vibes than the last few actual games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given the quality of the teaser, you'd be forgiven for thinking the mod's release is imminent, but an infographic at the end of the teaser suggests development is only about 60% done. Berezin posits that he's about 30% of the way through creating the creatures, 50% done with making the weapons and UI, and completed 80% of walls, tiles, and scenery. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mod's release date is simply listed as: ??.??.202?... which takes us right up until December 31, 2029, unfortunately.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A new Fallout project has been spotted in the wild: Fallout: Bakersfield.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-donkey-kong-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-10-best-donkey-kong-games.1248700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being Nintendo’s original mascot and being one of legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto’s most iconic character creations, Donkey Kong has had a bit of a weird history of getting his own video games compared to that mustachioed plumber he’s frequently feuding with. Sometimes he’s the hero. Sometimes he’s the villain. Sometimes he’s a bongo drummer. But with Donkey Kong Bananza out now - DK’s first new starring role in over a decade and first new 3D platformer in over 25 years - it’s time to ride a rickety minecart down memory lane and look back at the big ape’s greatest games. Here are the ten best Donkey Kong games of all time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong’s Double Trouble</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dkc-3-1753093410807.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Dixie Kong’s Double Trouble (an admittedly strange name for the third game in a series) isn’t exactly a game where you play as Donkey Kong himself, it does continue to build on the momentum based platforming gameplay that kicked off with the first Donkey Kong Country. Double Trouble tags in Dixie Kong and her cousin Kiddy Kong for another adventure, bringing more collectible coins, rideable animal sidekicks, and incredibly catchy background songs along with them. New abilities like Dixie’s ponytail hover (which feels similar to Tails’ foxtail helicopter hover seen in the Sonic games) add some interesting new mechanics to the mix, and while Double Trouble doesn’t quite reach the heights of its predecessors, it’s still an excellent and occasionally tough as nails adventure on its own and one of the best looking games on the Super Nintendo. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Donkey Kong 64</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dk64-1753093280987.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong’s first (and until recently, only) foray into joystick-controlled platforming wasn’t quite as strong as when Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda’s Link made the jump from 2D games on the Super Nintendo to 3D games on the N64, but hey, those were the early days of 3D gaming and there were bound to be some growing pains. Donkey Kong 64 is often derided for its over abundance of often tedious collectibles but when levels open up and progression requirements get out of your way, it’s an absolute blast to explore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DK 64’s main hook is allowing players to control an entire family of Kongs for the first time instead of splitting them off into duos like the Donkey Kong Country series was known for. There are a ton of levels to hop around in, secret areas to unlock, and seemingly endless things to collect, plus a bonus multiplayer mode where Kongs run around shooting each other with guns, which may seem strange until you remember Donkey Kong 64 was made by Rare, the same company known for reinventing console multiplayer shooters two years earlier with their hit game GoldenEye 007. However, ask any kid who grew up playing Donkey Kong 64 and they’ll tell you their two fondest memories have nothing to do with the gameplay itself. First, the bright banana yellow cartridge the game was released on, and second and most importantly, the DK Rap theme song, possibly the catchiest title screen music in the history of video games. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dk-jb-1753093543875.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">During the GameCube era Nintendo experimented with a bunch of offbeat peripherals, but one of the strangest (and most adorable) were the DK Bongos, a large plastic pair of drums shaped like wooden barrels. The DK Bongos were most famously used for a series of rhythm games known as Donkey Konga, inviting players to smack the bongos in time with the beat to various songs. But the real star of the bongo supported GameCube game library was Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, a side scrolling platforming game that used bongo inputs to control Donkey Kong across a wide variety of stages. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By smacking the bongos individually or together, Donkey Kong can move around, interact with objects, and beat the bananas out of a ton of different enemies and bosses. And while Jungle Beat is a bit on the short side, players were encouraged to replay it to beat their high scores over and over again. Jungle Beat eventually made its way to the Nintendo Wii and Wii U with updated Wiimote motion controls so here’s hoping it gets ported to the Nintendo Switch 2 so more players can finally experience this often forgotten modern classic.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Donkey Kong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dk-arcade-1753093638939.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Donkey Kong game is still one of the greatest arcade games ever made, even decades later. At the time of its release in 1981, Nintendo was struggling to connect with arcade audiences and fast tracked a new game from then unknown game developer Shigeru Miyamoto. The result was the Kong Kong inspired Donkey Kong game, a unique arcade experience that showcased multiple levels, challenging platforming gameplay, and a little guy named Jumpman, now known around the world as Super Mario. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong was not only a massive hit for Nintendo, it also inspired two increasingly stranger arcade sequels, Donkey Kong Jr and Donkey Kong 3. It also served as the basis for the hit film King of Kong which documents the real life feud between two Donkey Kong high score world champions. For being a 40+ year old arcade game, the first Donkey Kong game ever made still holds up well today and brought the world Mario, Donkey Kong, and Pauline. Hey, wouldn’t it be cool if they let some Mario developers make a game with Donkey Kong and Pauline! Well, more on that in a bit.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Donkey Kong Country</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dkc-1753093816318.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to express just how revolutionary Donkey Kong Country was when it first came to the Super Nintendo in 1994. For starters, DKC was a total reinvention of Donkey Kong, his world, and his enemies. It gave us Diddy Kong, Donkey’s acrobatic sidekick who went on to appear in tons more games, including a few of his own. It featured groundbreaking pre-rendered graphics based on scans of 3D assets and an amazing soundtrack to boot. It gave us the Kremlings and King R. Rool and a bunch of other huge bosses. And it gave us Cranky Kong, Funky Kong, and Candy Kong. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Country was a massive success, spawning several sequels as well as Game Boy and Game Boy Advance ports and remakes. It’s absolutely packed with diverse environments, tricky platforming, animal sidekicks, and collectibles and the minecart levels are still tense and challenging to this day. At the time it was incredibly rare (pun intended) for Nintendo to outsource one of their most important characters to a UK-based studio instead of just making a game in house but the result was a redefining of Donkey Kong that still impacts how he’s seen today.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy’s Kong Quest</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dkc2-1753093922620.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you do with Donkey Kong after the groundbreaking Donkey Kong Country? Well, you lock him in a cage so he can be rescued by Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong, obviously. Coming out just one year after the original, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy’s Kong Quest improved on nearly everything from the first game and cemented itself as the best game in the original trilogy. The levels are tougher and more clever, the graphics are better, the soundtrack is somehow even catchier, and the two playable characters are a ton of fun to control. There are dozens and dozens of secrets and collectibles to unearth across its eight vast worlds and 52 levels and finding them allows players to ultimately display a “102%” next to their save file.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Donkey Kong Country Returns</h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2010/10/14/donkey-kong-country-returns-20101014073207929-3333506.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After Microsoft bought Donkey Kong Country creators Rare, the Donkey Kong games series was in a bit of a strange place. But 16 years to the day since the original Donkey Kong Country was released, Donkey Kong Country... well, returned again with Donkey Kong Country Returns for the Nintendo Wii, this time being developed by Metroid Prime creator Retro Studios. Returns was less of a total overhaul for the series and more of a return to form but it still managed to bring along a ton of new features and some seriously brilliant level design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Returns featured a totally new and distinct art direction for the series which also allowed the characters and world to be much more expressive and fun. Equally inventive were the stages and locales which were teeming with life and personality and more importantly, challenging and rewarding platforming, chaotic autoscrolling levels, and more. Donkey Kong Country Returns sold over 6.5 million copies on the Nintendo Wii and has been ported to every Nintendo handheld and console since. It’s a master class in how to bring a once dormant series back, a thing that Donkey Kong seems to have a habit of doing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Donkey Kong ‘94</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/dkc-94-1753094034300.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the original arcade game, you don’t actually play as Donkey Kong in the Game Boy’s incredible Donkey Kong ‘94 even though his name is in the title. But that’s not the only thing those games share in common. Like his first game, Donkey Kong has once again captured Pauline, leaving Mario to jump and hammer his way to her rescue. But after a clever revisit of the Donkey Kong arcade four levels, Donkey Kong ‘94 opens up ninety seven more stages full of platform puzzle challenges. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of how much fun Mario is to control, one of the best parts of Donkey Kong ‘94 is how expressive and charismatic Donkey Kong is here. He’s big and hulking and tough but also funny and goofy and seeing so much personality shine through the tiny and blurry original Game Boy screen was revelatory. The game saw a ton of spiritual successors in the Mario vs Donkey Kong series and spinoffs, although none were ever quite as good as Donkey Kong ‘94. Here’s hoping it gets a remake someday, but for now it’s totally accessible through the Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy app and it absolutely still feels great to play.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2013/06/11/wiiudkcountryscrn04e3jpg-30b8fb.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Diddy’s Kong Quest, Tropical Freeze once again took all of the solid foundation laid down in the game before it and built an even bigger and better sequel, making it the best 2D Donkey Kong game ever made. Donkey Kong’s once peaceful world has been taken over by snow themed bad guys, and as the title suggests, that means a beautiful mix of palm trees and ice everywhere, leading to some truly genius (and very tough) platforming sequences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you find things a bit too tough, just try out Funky Mode, an optional difficulty decrease that allows players to play as everyone’s favorite monkey that owns an airport. Speaking of which, Tropical Freeze features more playable Kongs than any Donkey Kong game before it including Donkey, Diddy, Dixie, and at long last, Cranky Kong who just couldn’t stay retired. Tropical Freeze is the culmination of all of the best things from the best Donkey Kong Country games mixed up in one perfect frozen cocktail. Once Retro gets Metroid Prime 4 in the rear view it would be amazing to see them return to this series one more time. But luckily for us, there’s another Donkey Kong game to hold us over.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Donkey Kong Bananza</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/03/dkpreview-1743659889915.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As it turns out, the latest Donkey Kong game is his greatest. Developed by the team behind the incredible Super Mario Odyssey, Donkey Kong Bananza gives DK a whole new bag of toys to play with and a whole new world to destroy. De-emphasizing the tight platforming that the Country series was known for, Bananza opts instead to celebrate Donkey Kong’s brute force and heavy fists, allowing him to punch holes in the earth in search of collectibles, rip out huge rocks to ride around and throw, and so much more. It also reunites him with Pauline, this time as friends and collaborators.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza is also Donkey Kong’s biggest game yet. It’s absolutely packed with secret areas, unlockable costumes, and optional challenge rooms and it can easily take players dozens of hours to find it all. It’s a loving celebration of this iconic and legendary Nintendo character, hopefully paving the way for more Donkey Kong games like it for years to come. For a character that has been reinvented a ton of times since 1981, it’s amazing to see Donkey Kong return for his first 3D game since 1999 and to do so with a game that feels both totally fresh and quintessentially Nintendo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it, the ten best Donkey Kong games of all time. Did any of the games on this list kongfuse you? Were there any other DK games we should have kongsidered? Well, go bananas and let me know in the kongments below. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-donkey-kong-games]]></content:encoded>
