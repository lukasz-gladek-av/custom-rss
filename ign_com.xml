            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Commodore 64 Ultimate is the most astonishing retro product I have ever reviewed. I was expecting it to be a straightforward, modern take on the all-time best-selling personal computer. I imagined it would be a newer version of the C64 Mini or C64 "Maxi," with a selection of games and software built in and accessible through a bespoke menu system. Seriously, I would have been totally fine with a modern C64 that hooks to modern 4K displays and televisions and let me experience the C64 ecosystem on the big screen. And it does that, extremely well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it also does so much more, more than I could have ever imagined it would. Better still, it does all those things amazingly well. From the spot-on design of the packaging down to the perfection of the keyboard in every way, the Commodore 64 Ultimate is the kind of modern take on retro hardware that all future endeavors in the space should aspire to. They won't. But they should.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">What's In the Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Commodore 64 Ultimate packaging looks the part of its predecessor, although dimensionally they differ. The original C64 box is a little taller and a little less wide, but otherwise the modern take evokes the exact same feeling as the original right from the packaging. It's an excellent combination of both old and new, listing the modern capabilities of the device while using old-school images of people using the original on CRT displays. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Commodore 64 Ultimate is what all future retro endeavors in should aspire to.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Right on the copy printed on the box, the Commodore 64 Ultimate positions itself as an antidote to the modern computing experience, which I'm completely into. As someone who's been using the Internet since before Netscape was even a thing, I often think back wistfully to how much simpler it was when a computer was a tool you used to create things, not a device that serves you ads. The tagline on the back says "Classic Form. Ultimate Function. Distraction Free." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those of you who weren’t born before 1980, the original Commodore 64 was not only the most successful 8-bit computer of the 1980s, it's the best-selling personal computer of all time. So many Gen-Xers grew up with a Commodore 64 as their first home computer, and if they didn't have one (like me), they knew someone who did. It debuted at $595 in 1982, but within a year, competition had cut the price in half. In the 1984 Sears Holiday Wishbook catalog it's listed at $229.99, while the Coleco Adam just a few pages later is $700. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7217-1765913719515.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The C64 was affordable, well supported, handled business and productivity applications while also having a huge library of games. You could load software from 5.25" floppies, cassette tapes, or cartridges. It was versatile, compact, extremely affordable and available everywhere. It also had a custom sound chip that let the C64 sing, literally, giving it a huge edge. The C64 produced an iconic sound modern chiptune artists like 8-bit Weapon still use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inside the box is the Commodore 64 Ultimate itself, which is actually available in three different versions. There's the classic beige, a fully transparent and LED-lit model, and a special edition gold translucent version only available for those who backed the device early on. I'm going to get into the design later, but as soon as I opened the box I was struck by just how perfect this is in terms of replicating the look of the original.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7219-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also not one, but two, small, double-sided sheets of Commodore-branded vinyl stickers. The stickers are great. They're high-quality, not garbage paper ones like I would have expected, and it's just another delightful part of the experience. There are a few for the logo, one for the classic "READY" prompt, a tiny tape drive and floppy drive sticker, and more. It's great. I'm going to stick these things everywhere (except for the C64 Ultimate itself, of course).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a transparent plastic AC adapter with different interchangeable plug styles for your region, and a generous 2.5 meter HDMI cable in a Commodore branded bag. The cable itself is not branded, however, which is maybe the only thing I can point to with the C64 Ultimate and say "I wish this were different." The cable itself supports Ethernet over HDMI, for reasons I don't understand, as well as 4K resolution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Underneath it all, nestled in a protective cocoon of bubble wrap, is probably my favorite addition to the C64 Ultimate box: an honest-to-goodness spiral-bound instruction manual just like the original. And it's an ACTUAL instruction manual, too. It's not just a 4-page quick start guide translated into 16 different languages to pad it out. This is an almost 250-page tome of goodness we just don't see anymore.  It's more than just a passing resemblance between the new and the old. Yes, there's a quick start guide, but beyond that, the manual teaches you how to use the Commodore 64 Ultimate in the same way the original manual taught you to use the C64. There's a section on BASIC, the computer programming language so many oldheads like me first learned, as well as Advanced BASIC.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The C64 Ultimate comes with an honest-to-goodness spiral-bound instruction manual.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is probably my favorite thing about the C64 Ultimate: the fact it's a modern version of the old hardware on which I love writing BASIC programs. If you're not familiar with the language, its primary purpose was to make computer programming easier for beginners. In fact, the name BASIC is an acronym for "Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code." No one uses it anymore, not for anything serious. Ask anyone now and they'll tell you to start with Python.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7213-1765913719517.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Well I'm here to say those people are wrong, and BASIC is the perfect place to start. One of the greatest things about having a hardware-indentical version of the original Commodore 64 is all those old magazines and books with page upon page of BASIC code will still work exactly as they were intended. You've probably seen engagement-farming social media accounts talking about how "back in the day" people would copy programs from magazines, by hand, into their computers line by line. Can confirm, we really did. And with the C64 Ultimate we can use those same programs, or just copy and paste them and load them in via USB. I think that's cheating but I'm also not above it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I haven't delved deeply into the world of programming the C64 Ultimate, at least not yet, so I can't speak authoritatively on whether or not there's some string of code somewhere that won't work on the Ultimate. Knowing what little I know about FPGA, I don't think that will ever be a problem I'll come across. The beauty of FPGA versus software emulation is the hardware works exactly like the original. Sure, someone out there writing in assembly might find some peculiarity with the system that wasn't present in the original, but for me? Hell nah, let's get some BASIC code going baby!</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Back in the day people would copy programs from magazines, by hand.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact you're taught BASIC in the manual, and then taught advanced BASIC, as well as sprite and sound manipulation, makes the manual even more of a valuable resource. This is exactly the kind of thing I love, and exactly the way computers used to be. You didn't just buy a computer to passively entertain yourself, you bought one to do rudimentary spreadsheets, play some games, and create your own experiences. I love it. The best thing about learning any computer language is the fundamentals are all pretty much the same. Once you understand if-then statements, or "for" loops in BASIC, you'll understand them in JavaScript, or C#, or pretty much any other language.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7215-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Peripherals, Modern and Classic</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">What was maybe the most surprising revelation to me about the Commodore 64 Ultimate was its support for the original Commodore peripherals. Things like the cassette deck and iconic 1501 floppy disc drive will work with the C64. I don't have the cassette deck, unfortunately, and while I have the floppy drive I don't actually have any floppies with which to test it. The big batch of floppies I picked up earlier this year were all unreadable, so sadly I can't speak to that, at least until I luck my way into another cache, one that hopefully works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I can say is the C64 Ultimate will work with a classic CRT monitor, and that just makes me all kinds of delighted. Is it more convenient to use it on a modern display? Yes, a thousand percent. Is it more fun? Not even close. Thankfully I have several CRT monitors compatible with the Commodore, including an original Commodore CM-141 monitor I drove two hours into the wilderness of Maine's coast to acquire. Weirdly, the default settings were in PAL and so I had to go in to change them, but once I did, I was absolutely delighted by the CRT-goodness. I don't have the correct cable to use the CM-141, but I do have one that let me hook it to an old Magnavox monitor that has a setting to output in a faux phosphor-green. Can't complain about that! </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7208-1765913719517.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I wish more retro-revival hardware had the option for analog video. I'm sure the people who want such a thing make up a very tiny percentage of the population, but for something as specialized as the Commodore 64 Ultimate, it is a perfect fit. The modern Commodore company sells the proper cables on its website, so I'm probably going to buy some just so I can plink away at my next BASIC program in front of the warm glow of a humming, 13" color CRT TV.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another odd peripheral I have is a Commodore 1670 modem, though the Commodore 64 Ultimate lacks the User Port from the original where it hooks up. Instead, the Ultimate has modern connectivity like Wi-Fi and an Ethernet jack. It’s probably for the best anyway – I've messed around with slow, retro modems on old hardware before and it's fun, but 1200 baud makes even BBSes slow to use. And besides, if I do want that old-school experience, there's modem emulation built into the system anyway. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While having Wi-Fi rules, at first I couldn't get the Wi-Fi to work. I entered in my Wi-Fi password and waited for a while, tried it again, rebooted and tried one more time and it never showed the "Link Up" message on the Wi-Fi configuration page. It wasn't until after I hooked it to a wired connection that it decided to come to life, after which I was able to disconnect from the Ethernet cable and have it maintain its wireless connection. Not sure if that was just a coincidence or a weird bug, but it gave me a brief jolt of disappointment.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7216-1765913719517.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm also sadly lacking in C64 game cartridges, which is a bummer since the Commodore 64 Ultimate can play those, natively, through the expansion port in the back of the computer. But since it can run those carts, it can easily run ROM files, ones that you of course own legally or are provided from reputable, legal sources. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Spot-On Design</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Commodore 64 Ultimate is indistinguishable from the original at first glance. Everything about it looks and feels exactly the same as the original. The beige case and brown keyboard is fantastically reproduced from the original, for better or for worse. It's not until you take a closer look do you start to notice the differences, with the modern ports, a transparent window on the side and a much smaller port for the AC adapter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Commodore 64 logo badge on the top? Perfect. The red LED power light? Flawless. The keyboard? OK, like I said before, absolute perfection – for better or for worse. Let me explain myself.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7207-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Typing on the Commodore 64 Ultimate gives you the exact same tactile feel of the original. The key travel is perfect, the "clunk" of the switches, even the subtle texture of the plastic feels exactly like the original. It's just fantastic. I think my love of modern mechanical keyboards can be directly traced back to this era of computing, and the feel is wonderful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping with the original in every possible way, however, is going to require you to unlearn some of the modern keyboard placements you've been using since things settled down to a standard layout. This isn't a fault with the design, it's unfortunately a byproduct of keeping things so perfectly retro. I find myself struggling with some of the key placement, like where the double-quotes are (they're over the 2-key, by the way). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the C64 is the computer you grew up on, your muscle memory might come back to you easily. But otherwise, there's a little more hunting-and-pecking here than I've done in years. It's not a fault of the design at all, and it can't be avoided, but it's just something that you'll definitely experience when you shift from the modern keyboard layout burned into your brain. And I wouldn't want it any other way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7206-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One major, positive design change is the power supply. The original C64 power supply was a brick almost literally, and pretty much every original C64 power supply is waiting to someday blast the original hardware with an overvoltage that will run it. The new one is cased in transparent plastic and doesn't take up half your desk like the original monster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It plugs in right next to the multifunction button, a rocker-style switch that turns the Commodore 64 Ultimate on and off and lets you switch to the special configuration menu. It took a little more effort than I was expecting, and it's just a touch too small for my large hands. Turning off the Commodore 64 Ultimate requires you to push down and hold for 4 seconds, and I don't like that. More than once, I thought I'd activated the button, but was instead standing there like an idiot with the button 90% pressed for 10 seconds. Given the change of configuration of slots and peripherals, I would have liked a two-position switch for power and a momentary switch to go between C64 and configuration modes. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Software </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In keeping with the retro-modernity of the Commodore 64 Ultimate, there's a USB stick in the shape of a cassette tape, complete with cassette case, included in each box. You plug it into a very modern USB port in the back and then access it via the configuration menu in a very old school, hierarchical file system type of way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7209-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The software on the drive is generous, to say the least. There is so much here, it's overwhelming. Rather than go through every single included piece of software (which I wouldn't mind doing, honestly), I'm going to touch on some of the more notable programs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But before I do that, I'm going to shout out a feature they didn't need to include, but they did anyway: when you start up a program from the file browser, the Commodore 64 Ultimate starts whirring and clicking, with the occasional buzz for good measure. It's making the sounds you would expect from a program loading from a floppy disc and it's absolutely wonderful. When I was a kid using computers, I loved the feedback of those mechanical drives. I always felt like I was listening to the computer "think." This little feature adds so much to the experience, in a way I didn't expect at all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to the software, there are dozens of demos on the USB drive, and not the ones we're all used to. The demo scene, while still around, is a pale reflection of its former self. Basically, programmers and hackers would flex their skills by creating demonstrations of their programming prowess. They would push machines to do things that didn't seem possible with custom animations and music, and you can see some of them here. One of the most notable and well-known demos is Bad Apple, presented here as Bad Apple 64. The Commodore 64 Christmas Demo is also on the USB, which is delightful. I'm nothing if not full of holiday cheer.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7218-1765913719517.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a huge selection of games on the USB, but maybe my favorite addition here is GEOS, a graphical user interface designed specifically for the Commodore 64. While I don't see myself switching from macOS to GEOS any time soon, it's so cool to see this rudimentary GUI running on original hardware. Unfortunately I can't locate my compatible Commodore 64 mouse, but there are still dedicated hobbyists out there making them in our modern times, and Commodore sells compatible devices on its own site.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's so cool to see a rudimentary GUI running on original hardware.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm a little surprised you can't use a modern USB mouse, which would have been much easier for the end-user. I don't think it would have taken anything away from the experience, either. In fact I'd argue it would enhance it, given most people own at least one USB mouse but very few people own compatible Commodore mice. I dug through the various menus and didn't find any options, but if there's a way, please let me know. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/geos-1765917516379.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm mildly obsessed with different GUIs, and will take any opportunity to try them out, so I'll probably scour eBay for a mouse, especially because it also has a whole suite of GEOS software. If I really wanted to (and I do), I have the option to hook up a Commodore printer and print off my own beautiful GEOSPaint creations, or I can use the Virtual Printer and save generated files to the USB as .pngs. From there I can just open it on a modern computer and print it from there. And friends, best believe I'm going to be doing that once I get a compatible mouse.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/commodore-64-ultimate-review]]></content:encoded>

Ponte stops short of explaining exactly why co-op will no longer be included but says the decision follows “months” of testing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic ‘Terminator’ experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, we would have to put aside the cooperative multiplayer,” Ponte says. “We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nacon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-open-world-survival-game-nacon-announced">announced</a> Terminator: Survivors in July 2022 as a survival experience set in the classic sci-fi universe, eventually going on to reveal a release date of October 24, 2024.
