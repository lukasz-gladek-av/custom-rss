It also sounds like a Game Boy, and comes with classic-looking cartridges — though these only play tunes from the original Pokémon games' soundtrack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a neat touch, the cartridges include images from Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue that reflect the music on that particular cart. So, pop in a cartridge with the games' title screen on it, and it's the title screen music that you'll hear. Pop in a cartridge with Cycling Road on it and... you get the picture.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Sound on to be transported back to the 90s!</p><p>Listen to the same iconic sounds of the Game Boy system with the Game Music Collection. Embark on a nostalgic audio journey with 45 cartridges featuring music from the original Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue video games that 🎶 <a href="https://t.co/A0VXq1bSmM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/A0VXq1bSmM</a></p></div>— Pokémon (@Pokemon) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/2027420572393812012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 27, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">45 songs are featured, stored on 45 cartridges. (Or are they all stored on the main miniature Game Boy, and these cartridges just tell it which to play? It is unclear.) Priced at $69.99, the Game Boy Jukebox is available to purchase now via <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/71-10211-101/pokemon-red-and-pokemon-blue-game-music-collection-game-boy-jukebox" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PokémonCenter.com</a> in celebration of the Pokémon franchise's 30th anniversary. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Relive cherished memories of your Pokémon adventures in the Kanto region by embarking on a new journey to listen to the songs and sounds that helped bring it to life!" reads an official blurb. "In this special collection, you'll find Game Boy Jukebox, a sound toy modeled after the original Game Boy system from Nintendo, along with 45 cartridges that you can insert into the device to hear a familiar melody or sound effect from the original Pokémon video games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, there does not appear to be any headphone jack — so you'll be listening to the tunes out loud. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon Gen 10 Reveal: Over 40 Stills From the Winds &amp; Waves Trailer</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to today's new creatures, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pombon-is-already-the-obvious-pokemon-winds-and-waves-starter-choice-just-look-at-his-little-face">there's a wave of love for fire pooch Pombon</a>, though also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-begging-new-fire-starter-pombon-to-stay-on-all-four-legs-when-it-evolves">calls for it remain standing on four legs after it evolves</a>.
