It’s a matchmaking tactic that has set the Arc Raiders community ablaze since the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-confirms-it-recently-added-aggression-based-matchmaking-but-its-not-a-full-science"><u>announced its implementation</u></a> earlier this month. While some of the more aggressive fans aren’t sure how they feel about being linked up with other bloodthirsty Raiders, gentler players are using ABMM to find lobbies where player-vs.-player violence is practically off-limits.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The type of lobby you get after not shooting someone for 20 games <a href="https://t.co/TAYzsiEd6e" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TAYzsiEd6e</a></p>— Arc Raiders Intel (@ArcRaidersIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaidersIntel/status/2010455941330927874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Multiple players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz5gfoy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>shared stories online</u></a> about finding friendly lobbies that see Raiders cooperate with one another by evenly sharing loot after taking down a Matriarch. Some runs have even been said to result in a group dance party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Took down a matriarch and everyone shared the loot equally and then danced together at extract,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz4vog4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player explained</u></a>. “After a week of pure PvP this is like a whole new world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Lately I’ve been running into nothing but friendly players," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz57uka/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another added</a>.

I’ll be the first to admit im not even good at this game, but the exploring, looting and meeting friendlies has been totally worth it for me."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders Cold Snap Update Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of fans, especially in the solo queue pool, who favor a more serene Arc Raiders experience. While players do their best to use ABMM to land them in friendly lobbies, some have begun <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pyca5k/comment/nwhn724/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offering advice</a> to those who would prefer to avoid PvP but can't quite crack the code. There are even some fans discussing their hope for official support for strictly peaceful lobbies, but for those who prefer to rummage for loot in Stella Montis with a hint of paranoia, ABMM can be manipulated in the other direction, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who keep the safety on when looking for rusted gears and light bulbs with friends may have some luck balancing their lobbies with both friendly and aggressive players if they don’t exclusively stick to PvE combat. With enough trial and error, a few fans say they've had luck tweaking matchmaking to add just a dash of mischief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I enjoy both lobbies,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz4xgok/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user commented</u></a>. “PvE for making new friends and looting properly. PvP with my mate terrorising the whole lobby and losing all the good weapons we brought [because] someone outplays us with a big smile on our faces and having a great time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark has been clear: ABMM isn’t a science. The aggression-based matchmaking tool is also likely still being tweaked as Arc Raiders rides <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms">success</a> through its third month since launching for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 30. Still, it’s proven to be at least somewhat useful for those looking to avoid PvP, and the tension that comes with it, as much as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While players argue over whether ABMM is right for Arc Raiders, Embark seems to have made up its mind. For the Stockholm-based game developer, Arc Raiders is better off without doubling down on competitive gameplay mechanics like leaderboards, with CEO Patrick Söderlund explaining in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=QKpGyvRhpr7r-Cdw&amp;v=vY3u7wOmm4w&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesBeat</u></a> interview that “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-arc-raiders-dev-explains-why-it-wont-add-additional-pvp-mechanics-like-leaderboards"><u>the game isn't about shooting other players</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can do that if you want to,” he added, “but the ethos of the game has never been to go in and shoot players. It's a part that we use to craft tension.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Arc Raiders community is still deciphering its favorite way to experience the evolving extraction shooter.
