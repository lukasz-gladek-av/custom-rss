            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a shake-up for TT Games' LEGO series, the newly-announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> features just a handful of playable heroes, even if many more DC Comics characters will appear in the game as enemies or NPCs — something that is prompting plenty of fan debate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Typically, TT Games' LEGO adventures include hundreds of characters to unlock and play as, with character collection a fun part of fully completing a LEGO game. TT Games' previous project LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga offered one of the biggest rosters yet — with around 400 characters depending on whether you owned the base game or all of its DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is taking a different approach, however, with an official Q&amp;A page for the game confirming just seven heroes will be playable — and no supervillains.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will feature seven playable characters, including Batman, Jim Gordon, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Catwoman, and Talia al Ghul," reads the game's official <a href="https://legogamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/43979623023123-LEGO-Batman-Legacy-of-the-Dark-Knight-FAQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Q&amp;A</a>. "Each character is equipped with unique skills, combos, and gadgets — like Batman's Batclaw, Jim Gordon's foam sprayer, Robin's line launcher, and Catwoman's whip."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This makes it sound like the game's focus is on providing a smaller number of distinct characters, rather than hundreds of options with many gameplay similarities. Indeed, speaking to IGN at Gamescom, TT Games Head of Production Jonathan Smith said Legacy of the Dark Knight had been designed to focus more squarely on the story of the "Bat Family."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is wholly a Batman game to focus on that character, to really bring that character," Smith said. "That means you'll still play as and with other playable characters, Jim Gordon, Catwoman, Robin, Batgirl, to round out the bat family. But we think we really need to focus on Bruce Wayne and his story for that player journey, that player experience in Gotham."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, for collectathon fans, the game's seven characters will have multiple costumes to unlock. For example, Batman's suit options include his look from 2022's The Batman movie, the animated Batman: The Brave and the Bold series, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, Batman's original Golden Age comics appearance, plus well as his colorful Rainbow Batman suit.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/21/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-gameplay-00-02-59-1755792967121.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Batman's Suit Options screen includes numerous unlockable appearances.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On stage at Gamescom this week, Smith confirmed the appearance of multiple characters from DC Comics within the game, including Bat-Mite and Condiment King — though to be clear, these will not be playable. Bat-Mite sounds likely to pop up as a friendly NPC, while Condiment King feels most likely to be another non-playable villain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(As a side-note, Smith also said that Superman and Peacemaker would not appear in Legacy of the Dark Knight, and gave a "no comment" to Harley Quinn, Bob the Goon, Terry McGinnis, "Nice Coat Guy from Batman Begins," and amusingly, Warner Bros. Discovery boss David Zaslav.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If it’s only seven in the whole game then I’m not buying lol," one fan wrote in a lengthy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/1mur2go/lego_batman_will_have_only_7_playable_characters/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> thread discussing the seven character limit. "Honestly shocked by this," wrote another, adding that "part of the fun of LEGO games is the big rosters."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Controversial opinion: I prefer seven completely different characters to play than 200 that only change their appearance," countered another fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said another: "I understand what made the huge minifig rosters cool and neat but I don't think it made for a better game over more refined play patterns that are super character specific instead of a handful of interchangeable abilities and tools."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have said this approach better fits a more story-led game, though others remain of the opinion that more LEGO characters should be playable in the game's open-world version of Gotham. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is set to launch on Nintendo Switch 2, PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong is almost over, with Team Cherry announcing today that the game will finally release on September 4, 2025, over six years after it was first announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it sounds like Hollow Knight lovers won't be done obsessing over Silksong news even then, because Team Cherry is apparently working on even more Silksong content for months, or even years down the road.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg interview</a> with Team Cherry co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen, which ends with the pair confirming they're already planning extra content for Silksong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Launching it is obviously quite exciting,” Pellen said. “What comes after for us is equally as exciting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next,” Gibson added. “We got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not shocking the pair have more they want to add to Silksong. The game originally started out as DLC for Hollow Knight, but grew and evolved as the team fleshed the idea out more and more. And Silksong kept growing throughout its development, with both developers saying they simply had so much fun continuing to add things that excited them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’re always working on a new idea, new item, new area, new boss,” Pellen said. “That stuff’s so nice. It’s for the sake of just completing the game that we’re stopping. We could have kept going.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching,” Gibson said. “Because I went, ‘Everything I’m drawing here has to end up in the game. That’s a cool idea, that’s in. That’s a cool idea, that’s in.’ You realize, ‘If I don’t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pair tell Bloomberg that their enjoyment of the development process and desire to keep adding more fun things was the entire reason development took so long. Gibson says the game was "never stuck", but they are a small team, and games take time. "There wasn't any big controversial moment behind it."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, despite the community's zeal around Silksong and the memes, obsession, and fanaticism around its eventual release, neither Gibson nor Pellen really paid much attention. They say they tried to stay quiet throughout development both to avoid spoiling the community, and to focus on development first. But then, development took a lot longer than they originally thought it would. Still, they didn't really read either Reddit or YouTube comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s nice that people are passionate about the game, and that they’ve obviously formed their own strange or very exciting communities around it,” Gibson said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Feels like we’re going to ruin their fun by releasing the game,” Pellen said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
