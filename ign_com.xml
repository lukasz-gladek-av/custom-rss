            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer of upcoming open-world action fantasy game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert"><u>Crimson Desert</u></a> has revealed its single-player open world adventure game has "unavoidably" slipped from a Q4 2025 release to Q1 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its latest call with investors, Pearl Abyss said this was due to "longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voiceovers, console certification, and other launch preparations." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company said a firm release date will be announced "at a more appropriate time based on business considerations," but did not specify what those "business considerations" would be. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can still expect to see Crimson Desert at Gamescom and PAX West, however, as well as Tokyo Game Show. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Currently, Crimson Desert has been in the process of [recording] voiceovers, while also carrying out tasks such as console certification in preparation for its release," Pearl Abyss announced in its <a href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/pearlabyss/pearlabyss.php?c=pearlabyss&amp;y=2979" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Q2 2025 earnings conference call</u></a>, as transcribed by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gematsu</u></a>. "In the case of marketing, we plan to participate in Gamescom and PAX West this August to showcase our open-world build. And in September, we will join the Tokyo Game Show to strengthen our marketing efforts in the Japanese market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The launch of Crimson Desert, our first large-scale AAA console game, has been unavoidably delayed by one quarter, from the previously announced schedule. This is due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voiceovers, console certification, and other launch preparations. We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet the originally promised fourth quarter launch schedule. Please kindly understand that this is a strategic decision aimed at insuring success on a meaningful scale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The release date has been internally confirmed for Q1 2026," the statement concluded. "However, given the change in launch timing, we will announce the date at a more appropriate time based on business considerations, rather than making an announcement at Gamescom next week. We are grateful for your continued interest in our company, and we will do our utmost to deliver an even better experience going forward.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the makers of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/black-desert-online"><u>Black Desert Online</u></a>, Crimson Desert is set in the fantasy world of Pywel in which you'll discover adventure, uncover wonders, and experience thrilling action as you "witness the saga surrounding Kliff, leader of the Greymanes, whose mission takes him on an incredible journey." It's set for release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of last year, Pearl Abyss responded to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-dev-responds-to-reports-it-turned-down-sony-ps5-exclusivity-deal-that-would-have-blocked-xbox-release-for-a-year"><u>reports indicating it had turned down an offer of PlayStation 5 exclusivity from Sony</u></a>, claiming that if it had accepted Sony’s offer, which allegedly included Sony's "marketing power and various unique incentives," Crimson Desert would have been exclusive to PS5 for a year, with no release on Xbox and with PC distribution rights also belonging to Sony. In the end, it determined that it would be better off self-publishing Crimson Desert than it would be had it partnered with Sony to share revenue with the PlayStation maker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
