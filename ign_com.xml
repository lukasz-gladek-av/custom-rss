            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-manga-deals-crunchyroll-store-viz-media-sale-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Last chance to save on Viz Media books. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crunchyroll Store is currently offering a 30% discount on all Viz Media books. Anyone familiar with manga knows Viz is a primary publisher of official English translations, so the sale includes a wide range of individual tankōbon volumes, as well as deluxe editions, art books, and even coloring books. With more than 2,000 volumes of manga on sale, every type of manga reader should be able to find something. While there are plenty of options for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-free-manga-sites-and-apps">reading manga online</a>, there's always something special about flipping through the pages of your favorite series and getting to see it on your shelf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Crunchyroll usually struggles to match Amazon prices, many of the manga deals I've listed here have actually gone lower. Otherwise, you can shop the full sale <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnbgy?object_uuid=628f438d-4e87-4a6b-9338-2ae0e75a4276&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It ends tonight, so if you’re trying to stock up, now’s your chance. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">30% Off Viz Manga at Crunchyroll Store</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The sale is a great opportunity to try out a new manga or pick up new volumes of something you’ve already been reading (online or otherwise). Highlights include every single volume of Dan Da Dan, which is about to start airing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dan-da-dan-season-2-announced-and-its-just-a-few-months-away">its second anime season</a>. In general, the sale is a great opportunity to check out the manga that inspired recent anime hits like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sakamoto-days-premiere-review-netflix">Sakamoto Days</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frieren-beyond-journeys-end-premiere-review">Frieren</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, if we’re talking about iconic anime, you'll also find discounts on classics like Dragon Ball, One Piece, and JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. One series I personally recommend that hasn't gotten an anime adaptation (at least not yet) is Kagurabachi. Otherwise, your best bet is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnbgy?object_uuid=628f438d-4e87-4a6b-9338-2ae0e75a4276&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">scrolling through the full sale</a>, which you can sort by individual series. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Art Books Also Included</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Viz Media also publishes a substantial amount of art books and other physical merchandise. Aside from the standard slate of popular manga, these publications highlight authors like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-junji-ito-manga">Junji Ito</a> and animation giants like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-studio-ghibli-movies">Studio Ghibli</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Do You Need a Crunchyroll Account to Shop the Sale? </strong></h2><div catalogid="ca43b5d5-9f77-4193-8c44-062eab8a5174" id="215876"><div id="215876" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Crunchyroll Premium</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Choose from the Fan, Mega Fan, and Ultimate Fan tiers.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nope! However, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crunchyroll-free-trial-and-subscription-tiers">Crunchyroll Premium members</a> do save an extra 5-15% on orders from the Crunchyroll Store. You can theoretically sign up for a seven-day free trial and get the bonus discount on top of the current sale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, a Premium membership is really only worth it long-term if you’re also in the market for an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-anime-streaming-sites-and-apps">anime-focused streaming service</a>. Starting at $7.99, a subscription's major perk is access to ad-free streaming of Crunchyroll’s entire library.

Included in its list of festivities are videos that fondly look back at The Witcher 3 as well as special events and unique merch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all starts with the trailer, below, celebrating the series’ monster-hunting protagonist, Geralt, highlighting some of his most memorable moments as fans are treated to actor Doug Cockle’s gravelly delivery. It’s not quite a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv"><u>Witcher 4</u></a> update, but it does do a good job of reminding viewers of what made The Witcher 3 so special in the first place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Cockle joined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlRkbwmlNsg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the latest installment in CD Projekt Red’s REDstreams</u></a> to reminisce about the 20 years he’s spent providing his voice for the English version of Geralt while sharing how he helped shape the White Wolf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to join in on The Witcher 3’s 10th anniversary celebration, CD Projekt has further outlined its plans to bring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-announces-concert-tour-for-the-witcher-3-10-year-anniversary"><u>The Witcher concerts</u></a> to fans this summer. The first is in Boston at the Emerson Colonial Theater, come May 31, with the second following in Poland at Poznan's Sala Ziemi. <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/pl/en/concert" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Tickets</u></a> for both events, as well as the European leg of an upcoming tour, are available now, and more tour dates will be revealed in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt said more surprises, including art from 10 different Witcher artists, are on the way in the form of a Displate collaboration, T-shirts, and mugs.

More details about what to expect will be revealed in the near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each item, stream, and event will help die-hard fans celebrate the critically acclaimed 2015 RPG, but it should also help with the wait for The Witcher 4. Since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-revealed-with-debut-trailer-cd-projekt-confirms-single-player-open-world-action-rpg-the-game-awards-2024"><u>pulling back the curtain</u></a> on the Ciri-focused follow-up at The Game Awards 2024, CD Projekt has (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-issues-psa-after-the-witcher-4-beta-test-rumors-catch-fire"><u>mostly</u></a>) kept its head down when it comes to its progress.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-19<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG market</a> is moving, and not quietly. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-where-to-buy">Black Bolt and White Flare</a> coming in hot, many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-9">Black and White</a>-era cards are suddenly on every collector’s radar again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're seeing massive jumps on cards that have sat stable for years, all because Gen V is back in style. If you're looking to trade, cash in, or just gawk at how weird card prices can get, I’ve got you covered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are five cards that are flying and five that are faceplanting. Some of these are smart buys. Others? Let’s say I wouldn’t want to be the one who paid full price three weeks ago.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/18/pixel-9-2025-05-18t121910-653-1747567332953.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1XAY?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon ex from Prismatic Evolutions</a> dropped 21% since mid-April, from $467.85 to $369.96. Still expensive, sure, but that's a big chunk of change to evaporate in just a few weeks. If you bought high, I’m sorry. If not, maybe give it a few more dips before you pounce.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJw3Y?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee ex</a>, also from Prismatic. Down 28%, now sitting at $172 after peaking above $240. Honestly, I think Eeveelution fatigue is real. There are just so many of them floating around that even good cards are struggling to keep their value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3O8W?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie’s Clefairy ex from Journey Together</a> has slid 26% this month, from $212 to $158. I still like this card a lot, but the dip is noticeable. Early adopters probably paid more than they should have, and now the market's correcting like it just remembered what money is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg5oM?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Salamence ex</a> is rough. It's down a staggering 63% since late March, from $242 to $90.50. That’s not a correction, that’s a full-on crash landing. I wouldn’t be shocked if it dips further. Might be worth watching, but I wouldn’t touch it yet unless you’re in it for the art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, we’ve got <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgM8w?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Crown ex from Prismatic</a>, down 19% just this month. It was sitting around $84 and is now at $67.75. That’s not terrible, but it’s still part of a clear trend. The set had a big debut and now the shine is fading fast.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/18/pixel-9-2025-05-18t122002-296-1747567351556.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll start with <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4wAW?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reshiram from Black &amp; White</a>, which has absolutely rocketed. It was sitting at a modest $33.92 in mid-March, and now you’re lucky to find one under $240. That’s a 150% leap for a card that’s over a decade old. I’ve seen faster elevators, but not many. With all 156 Unova Pokémon getting fresh prints soon, I think Reshiram’s still got room to climb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwLO3?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom EX from Next Destinies</a>, which has gone from $34.63 to nearly $392 since March. It’s another reminder that Full Art cards from the EX era aren’t just collectible, they’re volatile. In a good way, if you got in early. I’d still grab this if it fits your binder, because it's only going to get more attention once White Flare drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also watching <a href="https://zdcs.link/akKvjX?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sprigatito from Paldea Evolved</a>. The IR version has quietly crept up from $17.98 in January to $21.95 today. It’s not a moonshot, but compared to the general slump of modern IRs, it’s doing surprisingly well. Plus, it’s a smug little cat and people love smug cats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbdJe?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dialga-GX from Forbidden Light</a>. This one was hanging out around $14 just two months ago, and it’s shot up to $74.99. I wouldn’t call it graceful, but it’s definitely gaining traction. GX-era cards are getting more attention lately, and Dialga's age plus playable nostalgia make it a solid hold in my opinion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t laugh, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJgO1?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vileplume-GX from Cosmic Eclipse</a> is up too. It was stuck at $6.83 for what felt like forever, and now it’s over $10. It’s not exactly a gold rush, but it’s one of those oddball rares that sneaks up when no one’s looking. You’ll thank yourself later if you pull it out of a bulk box and it suddenly pays for lunch.</p><p id="sealed-boosters"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Boosters">Pokémon Card Sealed Boosters</h2></p><div catalogid="0fe4ac08-2aeb-4f0f-834e-a41eccfc1ee1" id="221171"><div id="221171" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>151 Booster Pack</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Dropped by 8% since beginning of May</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unless you're dead set on grabbing the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAwMx?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">promo cards and poster in the 151 poster bundle</a>, grabbing booster packs from TCG Player is where it's at (<a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJwZV?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Or just the poster and promos seperately</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently sitting at $10.33 a pack, it's obvious that Amazon is now going above MSRP and secondary market value.
