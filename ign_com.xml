Patel wrote in a brief update. Patel's new role at Night School will again be as a game director, though what she's working on remains unannounced. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Night School is most famous for its Oxenfree series of games, the most recent being 2023's Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals. The Netflix-owned studio launched Black Mirror spin-off Thronglets earlier this year, around the same time it suffered an unknown number of layoffs. Months before, Netflix completely shut down another of its studios, working on a AAA game project headed up by Halo veteran Joseph Staten.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patel had been a veteran of Avowed developer Obsidian, and over 11 years worked in various senior positions on games such as Xbox sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds and the classic Pillars of Eternity series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, Patel had taken on the reigns of directing Avowed after the game was rebooted early in its development. Avowed had initially been planned with a darker fantasy setting closer to The Elder Scrolls, with one big open world and multiplayer co-op. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, Patel steered the game to launch as a brighter, more unique-looking experience, now featuring multiple large individual maps to explore, and an entirely single-player experience.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Avowed - Xbox Developer Direct Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The response to Avowed was mostly positive, and Patel had initially discussed plans for the franchise to continue — either with expansions, a fully-fledged sequel, or both. Now, however, Patel won't be part of that future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-update-14-patch-notes-include-arachnaphobia-mode-and-2025-post-launch-roadmap">Avowed development roadmap announced last week detailed an array of mostly minor additions coming for free over the coming six months</a>, including a Photo Mode and New Game Plus offering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With awesome worldbuilding and stellar character writing, Avowed reminds me why I fell in love with Obsidian's RPGs in the first place," reads <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review">IGN's Avowed review</a>. "However, the bigger picture is that it plays it quite safe, with a by-the-numbers fantasy adventure that's more familiar than evolutionary."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian's next project to launch is The Outer Worlds 2, which is due to be shown off in detail at this year's Xbox Games Showcase in June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Movie</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Princess Peach has been given a slight redesign. The Mushroom Kingdom's ruler had her appearance switched on the box of her Switch game Princess Peach: Showtime! to an appearance more similar to her big screen version, IGN sister site <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kongs-new-look-in-switch-2-mario-kart-approved-by-former-rare-artist" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> previously noted.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Of course this post is popping off lmao.

After Donkey Kong's major presence in the first film (and a cameo from Diddy Kong), it seems likely we'll be seeing more of Nintendo's great apes there, redesign and all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
