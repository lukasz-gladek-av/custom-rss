Tekken 8 has a way to go before matching its competitors, then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Bandai Namco announced Anna Williams as the next Tekken 8 DLC character. She launches on March 31 for Character Year 2 Pass owners and April 3 for all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the roadmap of support for Tekken 8’s second year, summer 2025 will see a new stage and character, fall 2025 a new character, and winter 2025 / 2026 a new stage and character. That’s a total of four DLC characters for Season 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not been all plain sailing for Tekken 8. In December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-chief-katsuhiro-harada-says-hes-going-to-rethink-his-role-following-dlc-stage-backlash"><u>Tekken 8</u> boss Katsuhiro Harada stepped into a row over the sale of a premium DLC stage</a> after fans accused Bandai Namco of “corporate greed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the release of DLC character Heihachi Mishima and the accompanying free story mode expansion, Bandai Namco sold the Genmaji Temple stage for $4.99, sparking a backlash from fans who had expected the stage to be made available for free — as the stage that accompanied the release of prior DLC character Lidia Sobieska was.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Harada ended up saying he needed to reorganize not only the Tekken business but his role within it to ensure community expectations were met in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-review"><u>Tekken 8 review</u></a> returned a 9/10. We said: “Tekken 8 is an incredible evolution for the series, with tons of single player content, an excellent suite of training tools, a great online experience, and exciting new mechanics that make Tekken more dynamic than ever.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

"We want to reassure everyone that our studios in Paris and Montreal remain unaffected. We are continuing to develop our projects at full pace, with several open positions available in both locations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">de Fondaumière added that despite NetEase acquiring Quantic Dream as a wholly owned subsidiary in 2022, "Quantic Dream remains committed to the strategy outlined by David and I in 2019," insisting "NetEase has been a dedicated partner, providing us with creative freedom and the financial resources necessary for our studio to grow and strive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The CEO also revealed the studio's back-catalog had seen an "exceptional performance," contributing to the "highest revenue in [the company's] history" in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The developments of our current projects are progressing as planned, and we are fully committed to delivering and launching these innovative, high-quality titles in the future," de Fondaumière said, but did not provide any specific update on its upcoming Star Wars game, Star Wars: Eclipse. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement to IGN, a rep from NetEase Games’ Global Public Relations Department said: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As far as overseas business efforts are concerned, NetEase has not wavered in its global expansion plans. Our 'two-pronged' approach (combining self-research and investments to explore global markets), is still actively progressing and yielding positive results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For titles developed by the self-owned studios, we successfully launched games like Once Human and Marvel Rivals in 2024. These projects demonstrate NetEase’s ability, along with our talented development teams, to produce high-quality games loved by players worldwide. For 2025, we have an extensive pipeline of titles in development, featuring a variety of genres, including FragPunk, ANANTA and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As part of our investment strategy, every decision was based purely on business evaluations and was not influenced by other factors. Our studios in North America, the UK, Spain, France, and Japan all continue to refine and develop their ongoing game projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The company continues to invest in our global business and actively recruits and nurtures talent. At the same time, organizational structure changes aimed at improving performance are a necessary part of our ongoing growth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[CEO] Mr. Ding stated on the recent earnings call that NetEase is committed to supporting really high-quality studios and master creators. That is the company’s strategy, and there is no change in this plan. For any studio globally, it behooves us as a responsible commercial business to frequently evaluate the progress, viability and potential for success of our products and teams."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When pressed for an update specifically regarding NetEase subsidiary studios Nagoshi Studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, Pincool, GPTRACK50, and Quantic Dream, the NetEase Games rep added:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the studios you specifically pointed out, I haven’t heard any changes so far. As planned, we are expecting to bring some of the titles to the public this year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In reference to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/visions-of-mana-dev-reportedly-being-shut-down-by-netease">the closure of Visions of Mana developer Ouka Studios</a>, NetEase said: "It’s a self-owned studio, instead of a first-party or invested one. The studio’s challenging financial situation led to significant losses. We carefully considered every option under the circumstances and took the decision process very seriously."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just last week, we learned that despite netting 40 million players and securing millions for developer NetEase, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netease-founder-reportedly-almost-canceled-marvel-rivals-because-it-didnt-use-original-ip"><u>Marvel Rivals was nearly canceled</u></a> as Ding was reportedly reluctant to pay for the rights to use licensed IP.

Generative AI often struggles with hands, adding extra fingers where they shouldn't be.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/santa-claus-1733746080205.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Black Ops 6's 'Necroclaus' loading screen. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another image of a gloved hand was used to show off a new Zombies community event. It contained what looked like six fingers with no thumb on-screen, suggesting up to seven digits on this hand.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/25/bo6-1740485655900.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The central image includes a gloved hand with some odd things going on. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of the Zombie Santa image sparked a closer look at other images in Black Ops 6, which some in the Call of Duty community subsequently called into question. Redditor Shaun_LaDee highlighted three images included in paid bundles that have irregularities that could suggest the use of generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans then called on Activision to disclose the use of generative AI for art that is included in bundles that are sold, and following new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>AI disclosure rules</u></a> for Steam, it has now added a vague disclosure that covers the entirety of Black Ops 6 on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6’s Steam AI Generated Content Disclosure reads: “Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wired</u></a> reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic"><u>Activision sold an “AI-generated cosmetic” for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 last year</u></a>. The cosmetic in question was not named, but was linked to the Yokai’s Wrath bundle released in December 2023. The store did not disclose any use of generative AI for this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle cost 1,500 COD Points, the premium virtual currency sold for real-world money that generates hundreds of millions of dollars for Activision each year. 1,500 COD Points is approximately valued at $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wired pointed out that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard after its $69 billion acquisition of the company last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>cut 1,900 staff from its gaming business</u></a> just months after Activision sold this skin. The report alleged that 2D artists’ jobs were being replaced by AI at the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of 2D artists were laid off,” one anonymous Activision artist told the site. “Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.” Activision employees were allegedly “made” to sign up for AI training, with its use promoted throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Bloober said Konami will continue as both the publisher and rights holder of the mystery game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno:</p><blockquote>Konami, a legendary name in the gaming industry, sought a partner who could breathe new life into one of its most iconic franchises — Silent Hill. Bloober Team was selected for their expertise in horror and atmospheric storytelling, and in 2021, both companies signed a partnership agreement. In October 2022, during the official Silent Hill Transmission livestream, it was announced that Bloober Team was working on a remake of Silent Hill 2, widely regarded as one of the best psychological horror games in history. </blockquote><blockquote>The success of the remake proved that Bloober Team had perfectly captured the atmosphere and depth of the original while introducing crucial innovations. The game was well-received by players, earning an 86/100 rating on Metacritic and an 88/100 on OpenCritic, along with numerous awards, including Game of the Year 2024 from IGN Japan and Best Horror Game of the Year from the IGN Community Awards.</blockquote><blockquote>The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project. The deal aligns with Bloober Team’s strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework. </blockquote><blockquote>Our collaboration with Konami has been incredibly fruitful, and the success of Silent Hill 2 speaks for itself. By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 2 remake went on sale on PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam on October 8, 2024 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-console-exclusive-to-ps5-for-1-year"><u>there’s no word on an Xbox Series X and S version</u></a> yet), and just a few days later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week"><u>had sold one million copies</u></a>. This was thought to have made Silent Hill 2 remake the fastest-selling Silent Hill game ever, but Konami has yet to rubber stamp that potential record.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review"><u>Silent Hill 2 remake review</u></a> returned an 8/10.
