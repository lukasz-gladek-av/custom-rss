            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Major gameplay leaks have offered a glimpse at the next era of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, in which its ever-popular battle royale mode will transition to a fresh map based on the USA.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Previously, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-seven-teases-kill-bill-crossover-points-to-usa-setting">official hints from Epic Games have pointed to coordinates based in Hollywood</a>, while another leak suggested the game would feature a Las Vegas-esque location (and a Quentin Tarantino crossover). And now, thanks to footage that has leaked from a preview event attended by media and influencers, Chapter 7's USA-style setting has been confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Footage now widely circulating on social media shows an arid area with palm trees. In the distance, the game's map references an area named Sandy Strip. Signage names Chapter 7's first season as being titled "Pacific Break."</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>LEAKED CHAPTER 7 INFO FROM CREATOR EVENT 💀 </p><p>- Hot air balloons <br>- Driveable Reboot Vans<br>- Solo VS Bots mode <br>- Rift A Palooza events that spawn rifts<br>- Gameplay UI update<br>- Battle Pass has Marty McFly and The Bride <a href="https://t.co/l9lBrLZMIz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/l9lBrLZMIz</a></p></div>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991464160996344068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Other changes visible in the footage look to include driveable reboot vans, and the option for a new Solo vs Bots mode (although it's unclear if this was provided just for the preview event). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite has followed up the leaks with its own, official look at Chapter 7, via a top-down view of the game's new battle royale map that shows a more urban area, complete with wide city streets and homes with backyard pools. (The top-down view here is a bit GTA 1, isn't it?)</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A first look at the battleground to come. <br>Preparation = Victory <a href="https://t.co/4KO1whuy80" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4KO1whuy80</a></p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1991325705016340689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Last night, Fortnite also publicly shared footage of Quentin Tarantino appearing at the aforementioned event, standing next to a Fortnite version of Kill Bill's infamous Pussy Wagon car. Here, the word "pussy" has been replaced by a picture of Meowscles, the game's fan-favorite swole cat. Leaked footage from the event, meanwhile, shows a new in-game skin for Uma Thurman's Kill Bill character The Bride. Oh, and also Marty McFly from Back to the Future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite typically works on its big annual map change around a year in advance, and it's fun to consider the idea that, 12 months ago, Chapter 7's USA-inspired setting was being planned with the expectation that a certain other big game with a USA-inspired setting would launch at the same time. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The one. The only. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/QuentinTarantino?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#QuentinTarantino</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FortniteSeven?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#FortniteSeven</a> <a href="https://t.co/IYxD8w4Y62" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IYxD8w4Y62</a></p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1991320132698927573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> has now been delayed — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-how-does-this-impact-the-rest-of-the-industry">twice</a>. But up until May this year, Rockstar was still saying the game would arrive this week, around the time Epic Games has launched a fresh Chapter of Fortnite for the past few years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year, Fortnite will hold its big Chapter 6 finale event on Saturday, November 29. Chapter Seven will then launch imminently after, though some period of downtime is expected. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-finale-event-trailer-teases-godzilla-and-kill-bill-appearances-as-chapter-seven-looms">teaser trailer for that in-game event released officially last night</a> and featured Fortnite going full Ready Player One and Avengers: Endgame with its plans, while tying up story threads from the past few years.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent weeks, the secret bunkers in Fortnite's OG mode have been flashing messages in morse code, such as "Zero Hour", which we now know is the name of the upcoming event, and "Titans". After seeing that teaser trailer, fans think "Titans" refers to the game's current main antagonist, The Dark Presence, a towering demonic entity that rules Chapter 6's Spirit Realm, but also to the forces now squaring up against him. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the coming battle, players look set to fight alongside a series of other looming figures: the returning Godzilla and King Kong, plus the newly giant-sized Homer Simpson. Is there a clue to a much longer story arc here too? Think back to Fortnite's Chapter 5, which introduced the current era of storytelling focused on blue-haired hero Hope, and you could also link in the mysterious giant hand that erupted from the ground holding Pandora's Box. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Are all of these Titans? And how will Fortnite wrap all of these things together (plus Star Wars' X-Wings, Uma Thurman, and Marty McFly) as it moves to its new USA-based home? We've just over a week to go until we find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

We said: "Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s campaign is a wild one thanks to the scope of its ambition, but the big swings it takes don't always land, leaving it an uneven step down from last year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Activision acknowledged it used of "a variety of digital tools, including AI tools," in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, "to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios."
