As it's a GameCube game, it will only be available for Nintendo Switch 2 users.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game was previously announced for Nintendo Switch Online back when<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamecube-titles-are-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-with-nintendo-switch-2"> the GameCube Classics were first revealed last April</a>. However, the game was not given a release date at the time, and fans have anticipated its appearance for almost a year now. Also at that time, Pokémon Colosseum was shown, but that game was not given a release date today nor do we know when it will arrive on the service.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness first released on GameCube back in 2005, and was a successor to Pokémon Colosseum, taking place in the same region. The game is a single-player 3D adventure where the player travels the Orre region to fight, capture, and purify Shadow Pokémon. Pokémon XD was also compatible with Pokémon FireRed, LeafGreen, Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald at the time, allowing players to transfer Pokémon back and forth between games and use them to battle in a multiplayer Battle Mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it first came out, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/10/06/pokemon-xd-gale-of-darkness">we gave Pokémon XD a 6.8/1</a>0, saying, "Pokémon XD has merit on its own for players who may not have experienced the first GameCube design [Colosseum], but as a sequel this one doesn't have nearly the same 'oomph' as the original."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, not only did we not get a date for Colosseum, we also still have yet to see Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, Ruby, Sapphire, or Emerald on Nintendo Switch Online. The closest we've gotten is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-get-nintendo-switch-launch-next-week-priced-at-20-each">Switch port of FireRed and LeafGreen</a>, but it's not clear yet how, or even if, it would be compatible with XD.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-presents-february-2026-everything-announced-updating-live">today's Pokemon Presents right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It is certainly the best any Pokémon game has ever looked, and a notable response to the growing discontent among fans over the visuals in previous titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon Company made its hugely-anticipated Gen 10 announcement today during the finale of its big Pokémon Presents livestream, held to mark the franchise's annual birthday but also its 30th anniversary overall. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As ever, the broadcast also contained additional details on the franchise's many other spin-off games. But it was the 10th generation of the beloved series, featuring a whole new region and set of creatures, that fans tuned in to see. And they were certainly not disappointed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Pokémon Winds and Waves trailer opened with a nostalgic look back at earlier locations from the franchise so far via a book of illustrations, before a male and female Pikachu in vacation attire drop by to welcome our first proper look at the franchise's next generation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Pikachu are officially named Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu — yes, really — and will indeed be characters in Winds and Waves.

"The Pokémon that live in harmony with this region’s lush environment have developed their own unique ecosystems. During this adventure, you’ll team up with all kinds of Pokémon to overcome both the difficult road ahead and even the forces of nature that block your path at times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer concludes on a more ominous note, as the noises of swirling winds and crashing waves sound like they're being whipped up into a storm.
