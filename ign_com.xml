            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/after-announcing-a-helldivers-movie-sony-is-now-officially-rebooting-starship-troopers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is working on a new Starship Troopers movie reboot, according to various Hollywood sources.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/new-starship-troopers-movie-in-the-works-1236163598/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> said District 9, Elysium, and Chappie director Neill Blomkamp has signed on to write and direct a new adaptation of Starship Troopers, the 1959 military sci-fi novel by Robert A. Heinlein. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/starship-troopers-neill-blomkamp-1236327071/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/starship-troopers-remake-set-neill-blomkamp-1236338005/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> backed up the report.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new Starship Troopers movie is not a continuation of or related to Paul Verhoeven’s cult classic 1997 sci-fi satire <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/starship-troopers">Starship Troopers</a>. Rather it is a new adaptation of Heinlein’s novel, and comes from Sony’s Columbia Pictures.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/16/starship-troopers-1742154834885.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers satirized the novel upon which it is based.

Arrowhead's Helldivers is heavily inspired by Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers, and sees cannon fodder soldiers tasked with defending a satirized fascist Super Earth regime from alien bugs, among other enemy factions, while preaching Liberty and Managed Democracy to the masses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony now faces the prospect of having new Starship Troopers and Helldivers movies going up against each other, although The Hollywood Reporter said Blomkamp’s take is not a remake of the Verhoeven movie, rather a return to the source material. Heinlein’s book that Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers is based on differs strongly in tone from the film, with many believing it promotes the ideals the film satirizes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither this new Starship Troopers nor the Helldivers movie has a release window, so it may be some time before we see or hear from either project. Blomkamp’s last film was Sony’s own Gran Turismo, an adaptation of the long-running PlayStation-exclusive driving simulation series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by TriStar Pictures/Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-actor-ashly-burch-says-sonys-ai-aloy-video-left-her-feeling-worried-about-game-performance-as-an-art-form<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Horizon actor Ashly Burch has addressed the AI Aloy video that leaked online last week, using it to call attention to the demands of striking voice actors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Verge</u></a> reported on the emergence of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leaked-internal-sony-video-uses-horizons-aloy-to-show-ai-powered-playstation-character-prototype">an internal Sony video showing off tech that uses Aloy from the Horizon series to demonstrate AI-powered characters</a>. Sony has yet to respond to IGN’s request for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the now deleted video, Sony Interactive Entertainment director of software engineering, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, has a conversation with an AI-powered Aloy via voice prompts and AI-generated speech and facial animations. Raghoebardajal asks Aloy how she's doing, to which she responds: "Hello, I'm managing alright. Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice heard coming from Aloy's mouth is clearly not that of Burch, rather a robotic voice similar to those heard from text-to-speech voice generators. AI Aloy's facial movements are stiff and her eyes appear lifeless as she converses with Raghoebardajal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Burch, who has voiced Aloy in all four Horizon video games released so far (Zero Dawn, Forbidden West, Call of the Mountain, and Lego Horizon Adventures) took to social media platform TikTok to confirm that she had seen the video, and that Horizon developer Guerrilla had got in touch to let her know that the tech demo did not reflect anything that was in active development, nor did it use any of Burch’s performance (facial or voice data). That presumably rules out AI Aloy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">the upcoming Horizon multiplayer game, assuming the character is in the game, and the inevitable Horizon 3</a>. However, as Burch pointed out, Guerrilla (and parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment) owns Aloy as a character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all this in mind, Burch said the AI Aloy video left her feeling “worried about game performance as an art form,” and used it as a jumping off point to discuss the ongoing video game voice actors strike that has claimed a number of high-profile casualties in recent weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) issued an update to its members on the status of negotiations over video game actor AI protections, saying that while progress had been made, it was still "frustratingly far apart" with the industry bargaining group on key issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Currently what we’re fighting for is, you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form, you have to compensate us fairly, and you have to tell us how you’re using this AI double,” Burch said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I feel worried not because the technology exists. Not even because game companies want to use it. Of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements. I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it, that does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections, any way to fight back. And that possibility, it makes me so sad it hurts my heart. It scares me. I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances. I want to be able to continue to do this job. If we don’t win, that future is really compromised.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast,” Burch continued. “Certainly not Guerrilla. The technology isn’t the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology isn’t the problem. The problem is we’re currently on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I support the strike. I’ve always supported the strike. I believe fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and the longevity of this career that we all love so much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Burch then pointed to the temporary union contracts that currently give all the protections the striking voice actors are asking for, that any video game company can sign right now. “There’s the interim, the tiered, and low budget agreement contracts available right now for any game company to sign,” Burch said. “I believe we deserve to be protected.”</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch/video/7481742753991314734" data-video-id="7481742753991314734"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="@ashly.burch" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ashly.burch</a> <p data-cy="paragraph">let us speak on AI aloy</p> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7481742843657194286?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Ashly Burch" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - Ashly Burch</a> </section> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen"><u>Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assets</u></a> as part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an "AI slop" zombie Santa loading screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the voice actor strike has begun to impact a number of video games. Players have reported that games such as Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft appear to have certain NPCs left unvoiced in otherwise voiced scenes, likely due to the strike. Late last year, SAG-AFTRA struck League of Legends after Riot <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-strikes-league-of-legends-over-alleged-flagrant-violation-of-labor-law"><u>allegedly tried to subvert the strike by canceling a game in response</u></a>. And Activision confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 characters were recast</u></a> after players expressed concern about new voices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-voice-actors-say-they-found-out-they-were-replaced-when-the-patch-notes-went-live"><u>two Zenless Zone Zero voice actors revealed</u></a> they learned they'd been replaced when they saw the game's latest patch notes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-exec-says-ai-is-important-to-gen-z-and-gen-alpha-gamers-who-want-personalization-across-everything"><u>weighed in on AI to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers</u></a> who seek "personalization across everything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
