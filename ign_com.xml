This is $10 lower than the best price I saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. This discount is exclusively at Best Buy, although other retailers like Amazon may price match later.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">43% Off Stellar Blade (Save $30)</h2><div catalogid="a305be8e-3d12-4c3f-bfce-a950c047bdd4" id="209821"><div id="209821" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Stellar Blade</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade, the first stateside non-gacha from Shift Up, is a well-reviewed game that's best known for its challenging soulslike gameplay, outstanding graphics, killer soundtrack... and, of course, its suggestive character design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade review</a>, Mitchell Saltzman wrote that "Stellar Blade stands out as a gorgeous and well-crafted action game with very impressive strengths and very clear weaknesses. Both its story and characters lack substance, and some of its RPG elements are poorly implemented, like dull sidequests that very often require you to retrace your steps through previous levels with very little done to make the return trip feel unique or rewarding. But its action picks up most of that slack thanks to the rock solid fundamentals of its Sekiro-inspired combat system, a deep well of hideous monstrosities to sharpen your sword against, and plenty of hidden goodies that do a great job of incentivizing exploration throughout." IGN officially rated Stellar Blade a 7/10, although I personally loved this game and would have given it a higher score. It didn't make it into our list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-games">best PS5 games of 2024</a>, but only because it was too new (had to be out for 6 months or longer).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-performance-review">technically demanding game</a> and I run it in "Performance" mode to maintain 60fps. If you own a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, however, you'll get the best of both worlds and play in "Enhanced" 4K mode and still get great framerates. According to the official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ps5-pro-developers-share-how-theyre-using-new-tech-to-enhance-their-games/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation blog post</a>, “With PS5 Pro, players will be able to enjoy Stellar Blade in 4K resolution at 50fps or more, with smoother gameplay, and you’ll notice an improvement in grain and detail in the game in PSSR upscale mode. Plus, the HFR (high framerate) option is supported, allowing you to enjoy a fluid gaming experience at 80fps (120hz display support required).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
