            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/when-will-gta-6-trailer-2-come-out-take-two-boss-says-its-better-to-provide-marketing-materials-relatively-close-to-the-release-window<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It might be a while yet before we get Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 2, after comments from the boss of Rockstar’s parent company revealed his preference for releasing marketing materials relatively close to a release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-rockstar-officially-unveils-first-trailer-early-after-leak"><u>Rockstar released GTA 6 Trailer 1 to record-breaking viewership</u></a> in December 2023, but it hasn’t released a single asset since. The 15-month wait for more information has fueled increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories about when Rockstar will release GTA 6 Trailer 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These have included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/on-the-gta-6-trailers-1-year-anniversary-fans-are-debating-youtube-playlist-updates-and-batting-away-misleading-ai-generated-images"><u>counting the holes in Lucia’s cell door net</u></a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/were-now-at-the-bullet-holes-and-braille-stage-of-gta-6-fan-theory"><u>bullet holes in the car from Trailer 1</u></a>, and even registration plates. But chief among the conspiracy theories is GTA 6’s ongoing moon watch, which was, remarkably, proven to have accurately predicted the date Rockstar announced when it would release GTA 6 Trailer 1, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect"><u>debunked as a hint at the release date for Trailer 2</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the big question right now is, when <em>will</em> GTA 6 Trailer 2 be released? We’re no closer to finding out, but based on comments from Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick, fans may have to wait until much closer to GTA 6’s actual release date for their next look at the most anticipated video game in the world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/0M53-LKlECk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Zelnick was asked straight up: why is GTA 6’s release date such a carefully held secret?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property," Zelnick replied. "And I’ve been around the block a few times and I’ve been in every entertainment business there is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. And we do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance. And we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation. We don’t always get it exactly right, but that’s what we are trying to do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few things worth digging into here. The first is Zelnick’s comments about keeping GTA 6’s release date such a carefully held secret “to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.” That’s something fans and the media alike have assumed to be true, and indeed former Rockstar developers have tried to explain is true.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Key Art's Hidden Map..?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mike York, who worked as an animator at Rockstar New England for six years helping to build Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 before leaving the company in 2017, said on <a href="https://youtu.be/TnTIV8AFs2o?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>his YouTube channel</u></a> that Rockstar is playing up to the conspiracy theories, deliberately avoiding saying anything about the game or when Trailer 2 will be released in order to fuel even more speculation within the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They're reaching and pulling and trying to come up with these really cool theories to decipher when the next trailer will be,” he said of fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Specifically Rockstar, they're very secretive about what they do, and this is a really cool tactic because it creates allure and it creates mystery and it creates people talking about it without them having to do anything. The more they're silent the better it is, because the more people will be antsy and want to talk about it and have this feeling of not knowing what's going to happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">York went on to say that Rockstar is likely resisting pressure from its army of fans to announce the GTA 6 Trailer 2 release date for this exact reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They could easily release the trailer date and be like, ‘Hey this is when the trailer's coming out,’ but they don't do it. And they don't do it on purpose because it's a really, really good marketing tactic. If you think about it, it creates these really cool theories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This brings the fans together. This is a really cool way to get fans to talk about your game when you’re not releasing anything yet, in-between the times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All these theories are great. They only create hype, they create talk, they create mystery behind the games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second thing worth pulling out of Zelnick’s quote is the suggestion that GTA 6 Trailer 2 won’t be released until we’re closer to the game’s actual release date in fall 2025 (assuming it’s not delayed). If that’s true, it may be half a year before we get another look at GTA 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait for GTA 6 to come out, check out IGN’s coverage of an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, Take-Two boss Strauss <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6"><u>Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

More Than Just Pals, a dating sim set in its massively popular monster-catching universe — and no, it’s not an April Fools’ Day joke (this time).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind 2024’s Pokémon-like survival experience revealed its plans to inject a bit of romance into its catalog today, March 31. It’s an announcement that, on any other day of the year, fans would accept without question. However, April Fools’ Day gags, fake games, and more strange announcements from game developers will surely flood the internet as soon as the new month rolls in tomorrow, so most fans are already taking Palworld! More Than Just Pals with a grain of salt.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair wants to <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1906694803632644593" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>be clear for the non-believers</u></a>: Palworld! More Than Just Pals is indeed a real video game. The idea was seemingly born out of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep4kasLrZug&amp;t=2s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its 2024 April Fools’ Day stunt</u></a>, which saw the team announcing More Than Just Pals as a fake game for little more than a quick laugh. Well, now it’s real, and it’s coming to PC via Steam at an unspecified point in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld! More Than Just Pals sounds like an especially out-there addition to Pocketpair’s popular universe. Its description teases an experience that allows players to befriend and fall in love with a cast of student Pals who attend Palagos Private Academy. The project’s official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam page</u></a> highlights characters like the “cute” and “mysterious” Katress and the “timid” Chillet, with many names pulled directly from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a>’s library of creatures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You, the protagonist, enroll as a transfer student in the prestigious Palagos Private Academy,” an official description from Pocketpair said. “You will meet unique friends (pals) and enjoy school life through friendship and romance. It's up to you whether you stay friends with the pals, develop romantic relationships with them, or even dismember and eat them.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">This doesn't concern April Fools :)</p>— Bucky | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1906694803632644593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair’s Palworld celebrated its one-year anniversary this past January as it continues development with more updates. Its string of content will surely help with the wait for the Palworld dating sim, as players most recently got their hands on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-update-050-adds-crossplay-across-all-platforms-blueprint-upgrading-photo-mode-and-more"><u>an update that added</u></a> crossplay support, Blueprint upgrades, photo mode, and more. Meanwhile, those hoping for a Nintendo Switch 2 version of Palworld have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough"><u>a bit of hope to cling on to</u></a>, but even if a Switch port doesn’t work out, we can at least hope Palworld! More Than Just Pals will arrive on the console someday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-weve-played-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-weve-played-it.1149837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-weve-played-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I went into my hands-on with Doom: The Dark Ages I was prepared for intense violence and high volume heavy metal, but what I didn’t count on was such an exhilarating amount of demon-killing variety. By the end of my two-hour demo I’d used a saw-toothed shield to slice through demons like it was Beelzebub’s Beyblade, stomped around a war-ravaged city as a colossal Mecha-Slayer, and even brought a snarling Cyberdemon to an explosive end by breathing fire directly down its throat with my faithful dragon steed – which seemed as though it had come to life from one of the sketches I used to draw in the margins of my high school maths books. In fact, every aspect of it looked and felt incredible. It may take place in the dark ages of the Doom timeline, but the Slayer’s latest slaughterfest might well represent the peak of the series’s modern era.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with the most crucial new change: the shield. While 2016’s Doom was focussed on run and gun, and 2020’s Doom Eternal evolved into jump and shoot, the core combat principle of Doom: The Dark Ages is to stand and fight. That’s not to say I wasn’t immediately strafing through the strife as I met each new wave of Satan’s soldiers, but the Doom Slayer’s new shield allowed me to hold my ground and block or parry enemy attacks, and even deflect projectiles back at them whenever I managed to nail the timing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to which enemy attacks can be deflected and which can’t, it’s basically traffic light rules – red means stop and green means go. Or for Star Wars fans, red is bad and green is good. The point is, you must constantly stay on the move to weave your way through the red waves of enemy fire, but the moment you see a green burst you need to dash towards the danger in order to perfectly bat back everything from searing bolts of energy fired by enemy archers to the deadly volleys launched by the hulking Hell Tanks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Dark Ages’ shield makes the new Doom feel like the greatest unofficial Captain America game ever made.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It introduces a welcome new test of your timing and positioning on top of the already high intensity gunplay – which has also been revitalised by an awe-inspiring arsenal that includes a machine gun that crushes skulls and spits out shards of bone and just might be the most heavy metal weapon ever conceived – but the shield isn’t there simply to block and deflect. It can also bare the brunt of a powerful lunging bash that instantly closes the distance between you and your target, and you can even rev up its spinning saw-toothed edge like a chainsaw and hurl it. The shield will pinball through crowds of weaker enemies like the Imps, or it can be lodged straight into the sternums of the beefier Imp Walkers to stun-lock them in place while you mop up the lesser minions around them. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Doom: The Dark Ages - Preview Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Slayer’s shield can also work in tandem with your bulging bag of boomsticks in some incredibly satisfying ways. Come up against a platoon of soldiers marching behind seemingly impenetrable steel shields of their own? Just pump a few super shotgun rounds into their metal mobile cover to heat it until it’s visibly molten, before frisbeeing your shield straight at them to ignite the entire group and shower yourself in valuable armour pickups from the resulting explosion.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Ages’ shield is perhaps the most devastating interpretation of the phrase ‘the best offense is a good defense’, and it makes the new Doom feel like the greatest unofficial Captain America game ever made. Only, instead of fighting an army of Nazis you’re battling the most evil villains that Hell has to offer. Which, I suppose, are both one and the same.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any rate, no sooner had I settled into The Dark Ages’ sensational new shield-wielding combat system, than I was suddenly whisked into the cockpit of a massive Mecha-Slayer to take on the tallest terrors to ever emerge from a Hell portal. The Atlan assault mechs have only been teased in the past couple of Doom games, but in The Dark Ages they’re finally pilotable, and I was absolutely thrilled to get behind the controls of one of these green-helmed goliaths in order to raise some hell. Or should I say, raze some hell, as I stomped out tiny tanks and crashed through bridges lined with troops on my way to going toe to towering toe with each Titan demon trying to take me down.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best of First-Person Shooter Campaigns</h3><p>It’s easy to immediately think of classic multiplayer matches and modes when thinking about the history of first-person shooters, but the genre is full of captivating campaigns and memorable stories.  From the far-reaches of the galaxy to the literal pits of hell – and everywhere</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Doom: The Dark Ages takes the series’ signature ultra violence and literally elevates it into Kaiju-sized carnage. Its Atlan combat is simple in setup but seriously satisfying in execution, as you repeatedly pump the right trigger to unleash combos with a pair of school bus-sized fists, with each successful blow you land filling up a special meter consisting of two halves. Fill it halfway and you can deliver a powerful stomp that sends a shockwave through the earth below and opens up cracks of damaging lava that stagger your opponent. Fill it completely and you can deal a devastating finishing move to force Lucifer’s leviathans to go in peace. Or more specifically, in freshly shredded pieces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like your 50-storey-tall fisticuffs with a side order of gargantuan guns then fear not, because midway through the level a whopper of a weapon drop gave my mech access to a machine gun so large it could use an aeroplane hanger for a holster. Performing perfect dodges on incoming enemy attacks powers up both barrels of this not-so-mini-gun, and I was soon blasting gloriously gory chunks of flesh off each Titan’s torso that showered on the soldiers below. You don’t normally see this much raining blood without buying a ticket to a Slayer concert and sticking around for the encore.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You don’t normally see this much raining blood without buying a ticket to a Slayer concert and sticking around for the encore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately I was only given the smallest taste of these supersized shootouts, since my hands-on quickly switched tracks from Godzilla to Game of Thrones as I slipped out of the Atlan’s cockpit and into the saddle of a cybernetic dragon, complete with twin cannons and a pair of dazzling laser wings. Soaring through the skies above a humungous holy city, I took the fight to a series of Hell Carrier airships, again performing perfect dodges to power up my attacks to demolish the artillery along their sides and the deadly assault cannons atop their hulls. With each airship’s defenses down, I was then able to swoop down to its exposed landing zone, leap off my dragon to briefly blast through Hades’ hordes on the flight deck, before shield-bashing into its central power core and forcing the whole thing to erupt like a Hellspawned Hindenburg, as I flew to safety aboard my scaly skybound steed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both the Atlan and cyberdragon sections proved to be propulsive palette cleansers rich with spectacle, but I was itchin’ for more of that bitchin’ shield and shoot ’em up action. Thankfully the Slayer was soon brought back down to earth to unleash further terror on terra firma as my hands-on finished with a taste of one of Doom: The Dark Ages’ sprawling sandbox levels. While the previous gameplay stretches were dynamic but somewhat directed action set pieces, this bumper battlefield level dubbed The Siege gave me the freedom to tackle its objectives in any order and progress through it entirely at my own pace.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thus, in between exhilarating encounters with waves of heavily armoured Mancubuses and shield-based slugfests with super heavy Cyberdemons, I was also able to scour the landscape in all directions for gold to spend on weapon upgrades, collectible toys, and even brand new guns to add to my growing arsenal of demon-destroyers. This included the Reaver Chainshot, which delivered powerful charged up attacks that basically allowed me to fire a cannon ball to instantly mulch a monster, before retracting it on a chain and firing it again to crush their minion mate beside them. Kind of like a Chain Chomp but not nearly as adorable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The expanded map also provided plenty of nooks and crannies to hunt through for health and armour pickups, including melee ammo for the Slayer’s new flail and electrified gauntlet attacks. That’s right, as if the Slayer wasn’t already badarse enough, he now manually reloads his punches like he’s Henry Cavill in the bathroom brawl scene from Mission: Impossible - Fallout. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The overall impression I got from The Dark Ages’ Siege map is that, although it’s large in size, it’s still dense with breathtaking discoveries and diverse encounters. Some open-field fights locked mini-bosses behind a morale meter, keeping them immune to my attacks until I’d hustled to take out a few dozen of their underlings. Other caves I explored featured almost no combat at all, instead challenging me to use my shield for environmental puzzle-solving, either as a grappling hook to launch me to otherwise unreachable areas or a tool to manipulate the controls of a variety of arcane machines. There were wonderful surprises almost everywhere I looked, but also some not so wonderful ones… like the giant tentacle that suddenly emerged from the ground beneath my feet in a swamp area and turned me from unstoppable beast to recently deceased in an instant.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that, my time in the Slayer’s combat boots was up, and what a brief but utterly brilliant ride it had been. If this small taste is anything to go by, then I'm pretty sure that the only reason id Software is calling this one Doom: The Dark Ages is because the title of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-ultimate-doom">The Ultimate Doom</a> was already taken three decades ago. From its satisfying shield-based combat shake-up and enticing sandbox level structures, to its Pacific Rim-rocking skyscraper-sized beatdowns and its dazzling dragon-riding dogfights, the team behind Doom: The Dark Ages is seemingly throwing everything but Hell’s kitchen sink into making this the biggest and best campaign seen to date in the seminal shooter series.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Doom: The Dark Ages seems to have the flexibility to allow any level of player to become a god tier Slayer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also set to be the most accessible. If you’ve ever wanted in on the wanton demon destruction but have previously been too intimidated to try, Doom: The Dark Ages looks to have you covered. Not only is there an expanded number of difficulty settings to choose from this time, with six different levels of challenge from the exceedingly gentle Aspiring Slayer to the absolutely mental Ultra Nightmare, but there are also tools to tweak almost every aspect of the experience. That includes sliders to adjust everything from parry timing windows to the damage dealt from each attack, and the overall speed of the action. Whether you want it to be a friction-free power trip or a synapse-straining punishment, Doom: The Dark Ages seems to have the flexibility to allow any level of player to become a god tier Slayer. What’s more, since it’s a prequel to the 2016 reboot, you can go in completely fresh even if you have NFI what a BFG is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom: The Dark Ages is set to arrive on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 15th. Until then, if you want a daily dose of doom, you could just spend a few minutes scrolling through social media. But if you want more Doom: The Dark Ages, be sure to check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/doom-the-dark-ages-developers-discuss-the-future-of-doom">interview with the team at id Software</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/doom-the-dark-ages-gameplay-overview-xbox-developer-direct-2025">gameplay overview trailer</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a Senior Video Producer at IGN's Sydney office.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-ghost-of-ytei-gets-new-story-info-commits-to-2025-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">We haven’t heard much about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> in recent months, but after fans spotted a morsel of new story information published to the game’s website, they’re having fun speculating about how Sucker Punch’s hotly anticipated PlayStation 5 exclusive will actually play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official website</a> includes the following story snippet:</p><blockquote>300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima, a new warrior – Atsu – rises from the ashes of her homestead.</blockquote><blockquote>Filled with fury and determination, Atsu will hunt down those responsible for the death of her family and exact her revenge. Every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the Ghost, will be up to you.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">We already knew Ghost of Yōtei’s setting and the time period, and that Atsu was on a revenge mission of some kind. But what we didn’t know was that she’s hunting down those responsible for the death of her family after her homestead is destroyed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s the mention that “every odd job and bounty will provide the coin she needs for her journey. But how she fights, survives, and evolves the legend of the Ghost, will be up to you.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are speculating that Ghost of Yōtei will have a bounty hunting mechanic in which Atsu takes on jobs to earn money needed for other things in the game. There’s the potential here, then, for an actual in-game economy, where Tsushima didn’t really have any sort of money mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If true, this may tap into Sucker Punch’s stated goal of giving players more control over Atsu's story. Creative director Jason Connell has said that one of the changes compared to Ghost of Tsushima will be a less repetitive open world: “One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the  repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again.
