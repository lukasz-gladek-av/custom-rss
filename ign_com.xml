            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Prices for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Scarlet and Violet 151 Pokémon cards</a> have been moving fast this month. As more booster boxes get opened and singles flood the market, some of the set’s Illustration Rares have started to dip in value, especially the middle evolutions of the starter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon</a>. On the flip side, big Special Illustration Rares of fan favourite Kanto starter final evolutions are seeing steady climbs as collectors chase the best‑looking cards from the set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex, Blastoise ex and Venusaur ex are the top of the climbers hill this week with noticeable price jumps, while Zapdos ex and Alakazam ex are also gaining traction with collectors and competitive players. All five of these cards have strong artwork, great playability, or both, which is helping push prices higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same can’t be said for some of the Illustration Rares of Charmander, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and their evolutions. These cards spiked when the set first dropped, but with more supply on the market, prices have started to settle. They’re still popular pulls, just not commanding the same premium they did in June.</p><p id="crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers">Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/29/pixel-9-94-1753801366630.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Kanto starters’ final evolutions are climbing, their earlier forms have started to dip in value as more Scarlet &amp; Violet 151 product hits the market. Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur were among the hottest Illustration Rares when the set launched, but prices are cooling as supply catches up with demand. Charmander is down 14% to $44.44, Squirtle has dropped 7% to $43.80, and Bulbasaur has fallen 18% to $32.20. These cards are still popular with collectors who want to complete the evolutionary lines, but they no longer command the inflated early prices from the set’s release month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The middle evolutions are following the same trend. Charmeleon has dropped 14% to $30.54, while Wartortle is down 15% to $27.36. Both Illustration Rares have fantastic artwork and remain fun pulls, but they simply don’t hold the same appeal as the Special Illustration Rare ex cards of their final evolutions. As Scarlet &amp; Violet 151 booster boxes continue to be opened, the market has become saturated with these mid‑tier rares, bringing prices back down to more reasonable levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with these price drops, the Illustration Rares of the Kanto starters and their evolutions are still great pickups for collectors who want the full line. Prices are likely to stabilise at these lower points, making now a good time to grab them if you missed out early. The final evolutions will continue to be the big-ticket items, but these cards remain iconic pieces of the set for anyone who grew up with the original Pokémon games.</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/29/pixel-9-93-1753801271476.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex has risen to $210.00, up 14% from early July. It remains one of the most in-demand cards in the set thanks to its powerful Explosive Vortex attack, which hits for 330 damage, and the fantastic Special Illustration Rare artwork that collectors continue to chase. Blastoise ex has seen an even sharper jump, climbing 28% to $84.99, driven by both its intimidating art and competitive appeal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solid Shell makes Blastoise surprisingly tanky, and Twin Cannons can unload massive damage by discarding Water Energy from your hand.Venusaur ex is seeing a similar surge, up 27% to $69.99. While Charizard usually grabs the spotlight, Venusaur’s Illustration Rare version has become a favourite for collectors who love its vibrant, personality-filled design. Its ability Tranquil Flower lets you heal 60 damage every turn while in the Active Spot, and Dangerous Toxwhip spreads status conditions alongside 150 damage, making it a tricky card to deal with in grindy matchups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Legendary Pokémon aren’t being left out either. Zapdos ex has climbed 23% to $61.99, buoyed by a dynamic Illustration Rare that shows the Legendary Bird mid-strike. It isn’t just binder candy, though. Voltaic Float removes its retreat cost when it has Lightning Energy attached, and Multishot Lightning can deal big damage to both the Active and a damaged Benched Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the climbers is Alakazam ex, which has risen the fastest of the bunch, up 35% to $44.98. The surreal, psychedelic artwork on its Special Illustration Rare has kept collector interest high, but it’s also a flexible attacker. Mind Jack punishes opponents with full benches, while Dimensional Hand can be used even if Alakazam stays on the Bench, giving it options that most other attackers don’t have.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10 Most Expensive Cards In Black Bolt and White Flare</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-most-popular-cards">Black Bolt</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-white-flare-10-most-popular-cards">White Flare</a> are the final Scarlet and Violet expansions, released together earlier this month. Each half of the set has its own focus, with Black Bolt featuring Pokémon like Zekrom, Kyurem, and Genesect, while White Flare highlights Reshiram, Keldeo, and Hydreigon. What makes these sets unique is the new Black White Rares and the fact that every single Pokémon has at least one Illustration Rare or Special Illustration Rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/most-expensive-black-bolt-white-flare-pokemon-cards-right-now">most expensive cards</a> are the Black White Rare versions of Zekrom ex, Reshiram ex, and Victini, all highly desirable for both their powerful attacks and prestige foil treatments. Special Illustration Rares like Hydreigon ex, Keldeo ex, Genesect ex, and Kyurem ex are my favorites, plus they're cheaper than their Black White Rare versions.</p><p id="latest-stock-updates"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Latest Stock Updates">Pokémon TCG Price Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't believe I was singing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-july-22">Amazon's praises last week</a> for some <em>near </em>MSRP deals on sealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Pokémon TCG</a> product, as this week they're back up to ridiculous pricing. You should stay away until they lower their prices and stick to TCGPlayer and eBay right now, which in some cases are a clean $15 below Amazon's current pricing. The benefit of buying from TCGPlayer is the vetted sellers and full transparancy on market values, but if you can save even more on eBay then go for it. All links are above to make your life easier.</p><p id="last-weeks-update"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Last Week's Update">Last Week's Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet base set prices have been volatile lately, with Illustration Rares seeing steady gains while some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-july-14">Special Illustration Rares have cooled off</a>. The Ralts evolutionary line has been one of the biggest surprises this month, with Ralts and Kirlia both climbing around 28% in value. Their popularity seems to be driven more by collectors chasing the full evolution line rather than playability alone. Gardevoir ex has also risen significantly, up to $54.99, thanks to its strong Psychic Embrace ability and frequent appearances in competitive decklists. Miraidon ex and Koraidon ex have seen smaller but consistent gains, reflecting their continued use in Lightning and Fighting decks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, several Illustration Rares have dropped sharply. Dondozo and Starly saw the biggest falls, down 30% and 37% respectively, likely due to their limited competitive relevance. Fidough, Armarouge, and Pachirisu also dipped, correcting from their initial launch hype. Overall, Scarlet and Violet’s market is shifting as collectors focus on full evolution lines and competitively viable cards, while once‑popular lower‑tier Illustration Rares settle into lower price ranges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

As Obsidian plots out its future, players are showing up in droves to see what makes Grounded 2 tick.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly 50,000 players signed on to play Grounded 2 when it reached its Steam player peak yesterday (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2661300/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>). It’s a milestone that already towers above the 32,000-player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/962130/charts/#max" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the original Grounded reached</u></a> during its early access run in July 2021. With a little more than 45,000 players actively playing the sequel at the time of this story’s publication, it seems there’s plenty of room to grow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian is already planting seeds for the next few phases of Grounded 2, too. The team <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2661300/view/534356720697222970" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an early access roadmap</a> to coincide with its launch across PC and consoles, spelling out at least one year of updates with more in the pipeline for the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Highlights in the fall plans include AXL Recipes and AXL’s Arena for Brookhollow Park. Armor, weapons, and a Park Boss creature are also said to show up around this time as Obsidian pads out Grounded 2 with various quality-of-life improvements. Winter will then bring Steam Deck verification and ROG Ally support as well as Cricket and Earwig creatures, variants of other existing insects, a Ladybug Buggy, and more.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/30/grounded-2-early-access-roadmap-1753889620039.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grounded 2 Early Access Roadmap. Image credit Obsidian Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian doesn’t share exactly how it plans to fill the spring with more content for Grounded 2 but says summer will include ziplines, smoothies, and swimming improvements as well as Watery Creatures and Buggies. It means players can expect plenty of additions to roll out in the months ahead, but there’s so much more set to arrive at an unspecified point in the future, too. Highlights include Passive Mutations and Active Mutations 2.0, more creatures and Park Bosses, more armors, additional building materials, and a few secrets the team isn’t willing to share quite yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to see how Obsidian is planning to build upon Grounded 2’s early access foundation, you can see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grounded-2-exists-because-obsidian-was-running-out-of-room-in-grounded-1"><u>why the studio chose to dig into a sequel in the first place</u></a>.
