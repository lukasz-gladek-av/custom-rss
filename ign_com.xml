This video game movie has had the support of various toy marketing campaigns from the very beginning, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-minecraft-movie-lego-sets-where-to-buy">Minecraft Movie LEGO sets</a> as well as McDonald's toys targeted specifically at adults. But if you're in the market for a Nerf gun after seeing the movie in theaters, you also already have quite a few options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is offering new discounts on a variety of Nerf <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Weapons">Minecraft weapons</a> based on <em>actual </em>Minecraft weapons. Each of these Nerf picks have the ability to shoot darts, even if they don't necessarily appear to be able to. They are also all fairly cheap compared to other Minecraft toys on the market right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Nerf Minecraft Deals at Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four Nerf Minecraft deals at Amazon right now, and almost all of them are at their lowest prices of 2025. The best deal within this list is the Minecraft Pillager's Crossbow, which has only recently <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CSLJH4M5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">droppped to its lowest-ever price</a> of $19.99. This is one of the most affordable Nerf crossbows you can buy, and it also doubles as a wonderful Minecraft gift. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of this blaster, there's also the Nerf Minecraft axe and hammer, which are each under $20 and at their lowest prices in 2025. While they don't function as effectively as a standard Nerf gun, they look awesome and are still able to fire darts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last Nerf Minecraft option that is on sale is the Sabrewing Motorized Blaster. Although it is arguably the coolest thing on sale right now, it is nowhere near its lowest price of 2025. It is, however, still priced below $20 and is the most enticing actualy Nerf Blaster on this list. It also has the largest dart capacity at eight darts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Nerf Ammo</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After you’ve secured a Nerf Blaster, grabbing some extra darts or rounds is always a good idea. If you’ve ever played with one of these before, you know that ammo goes missing way too quickly. Luckily, a range of nerf darts are on sale. Big 100 packs for an epic war with friends or smaller, ultra-cheap sets to replace a few missing darts are all discounted right now. Just be sure to grab the right ammo.</p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 7, 2025 4:58 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
