The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-review"><u>PlayStation 5</u></a> and the more powerful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-pro-review">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> are built for stunning graphics and ultra-smooth gameplay, and to fully experience that, you need an HDMI cable that can handle all that power. Fortunately, there are some great options out there that will ensure you're getting the best possible performance from your console in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR – These Are the Best HDMI Cables for PS5:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 supports 8K@60Hz or 4K@120Hz, so you’ll want to choose an HDMI cable that’s designed to support the latest features of the PS5, including 4K resolution at 120Hz and even 8K resolution for future-proofing. Whichever cable you go for, upgrading to a high-quality HDMI cable can really enhance your gaming experience on the PS5. Clearer visuals, smoother gameplay, and reliable performance –  what’s not to love?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While an improved connection is a great start, you'll also want to upgrade to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">good PS5 TV</a> or one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-monitor-for-ps5">best monitors for the PS5</a> to get the best possible experience.</p><p id="best-overall"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best overall" id="powera">1. PowerA Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best HDMI Cable Overall</h3><div catalogid="daa9c4e2-1993-4e7f-800e-8fe74d192871" id="210393"><div id="210393" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PowerA Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Officially licensed by Sony, designed for PS5 consoles, it's the best option out there. </p></div></div><div><p>Features</p><p>Gold plated, officially licensed by Sony, 8K@60Hz</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With an officially licensed HDMI cable for your PS5, you can’t go wrong with the PowerA Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable. Yes, it comes with a premium price tag, but if you want the best of the best, you’ll have to part with a bit of cash. Supporting HDMI 2.1, this HDMI cable can output 4K@120Hz, and even 8K@60Hz.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Matching the console’s simple, clean, and white aesthetics, the PowerA Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable is durable, minimalist, and sports gold-plated connectors. And, at 10-feet long, you’ll have plenty of wiggle room between your console and your display should you need it.</p></div><p id="best-high-speed"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best high-speed" id="belkinhigh">2. Belkin HDMI 2.1 Ultra High Speed</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best High-Speed HDMI Cable</h3><div catalogid="daa9c4e2-1993-4e7f-800e-8fe74d192871" id="210394"><div id="210394" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Belkin HDMI 2.1 Ultra High Speed</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Capable of 48Gbps speeds, it far exceeds what the PS5 is even capable of outputting. </p></div></div><div><p>Features</p><p>2-layer shielding</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Belkin HDMI 2.1 Ultra High Speed is one of the priciest HDMI cables for PS5, but that’s because you’re paying to future-proof your setup. With HDMI 2.1, the cable can handle speeds of up to 48Gbps, more than your PS5 or PS5 Pro will ever output. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With slim profile connectors, this HDMI cable fits nicely into the back of your PS5 and your TV. Everything here is high quality. Knowing you can game in 4K@120Hz with a compatible display, or watch videos in 8K@60Hz warrants the higher price tag. It's likely you'll even be able to use this for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-6">PlayStation 6</a> when it eventually arrives, making this a worthwhile long-term investment.</p></div><p id="best-angled"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best angled" id="ugreenangle">3. Ugreen Right Angle HDMI Cable</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Angled HDMI Cable</h3><div catalogid="daa9c4e2-1993-4e7f-800e-8fe74d192871" id="210395"><div id="210395" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ugreen Right Angle HDMI Cable</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Need an angled HDMI cable to cleanly get to your TV's port?</p></div></div><div><p>Features</p><p>Right-angle connector</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If your TV is mounted to the wall or you’re limited on space, sometimes a standard HDMI cable won’t be the right fit. Enter the Ugreen Right Angle HDMI Cable. Instead of taking a risk and bending your HDMI cable, why not invest in a right-angle cable from the offset?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You do sacrifice a few things with this cable, however. For instance, it’s much shorter than many HDMI cables at only 3.3 feet. This might be fine for some people, but you should double check how much cable you need to connect your PS5 to your TV first. There’s also the fact that it only supports HDMI 2.0, so you won’t be able to enjoy the 120Hz refresh rate the PS5 is designed to be capable of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, if you need a right-angle cable at a very affordable price, the Ugreen Right Angle HDMI Cable is your best bet.</p></div><p id="cheapest"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cheapest" id="basics">4. Amazon Basics HDMI Cable</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Cheapest HDMI Cable</h3><div catalogid="daa9c4e2-1993-4e7f-800e-8fe74d192871" id="210396"><div id="210396" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Amazon Basics HDMI Cable</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>If you need a cheap HDMI cable, you can't go wrong with this one from Amazon Basics.</p></div></div><div><p>The price of a premium coffee</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re on a budget and need an HDMI cable that’s going to allow you to make the most of the PS5 and PS5 Pro's 4K resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, you simply can’t go wrong here. The Amazon Basics HDMI Cable does what it says on the box – there are no fancy features, braided cable, or right angles – it costs a little over $6 and is capable of speeds of up to 48Gbps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the length could pose a problem to some users, this HDMI cable is also available in 6-foot and 10-foot options. It’s incredibly affordable and can easily be a suitable replacement for the included HDMI cable you get with the PS5 if you have lost it, broken it, or need a spare.</p></div><p id="best-everyday"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best everyday" id="anker8k">5. Anker 8K HDMI Cable</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Everyday HDMI Cable</h3><div catalogid="daa9c4e2-1993-4e7f-800e-8fe74d192871" id="210397"><div id="210397" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker 8K HDMI Cable</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This Anker 8K HDMI cable is a great everyday cable, even if you don't have an 8K TV.</p></div></div><div><p>More expensive than similar cables</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Anker is a well-known brand; it’s reliable, and that’s what you need when you invest in a HDMI cable for your PS5 or PS5 Pro. The Anker 8K HDMI Cable supports 8K@60Hz and 4K@120Hz, making it the perfect PS5 console companion. Since it’s HDMI 2.1, you could use it to connect your monitor to your PC, too, should you need to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are definitely more affordable HDMI cables available, if you want a solid cable that’s going to last a long time, Anker’s is a no-brainer. The only thing you might want to do is spend a little more and get a slightly longer 6-foot or 10-foot cable.</p></div><p id="best-premium"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best premium" id="cablebraided">6. Cable Matters Premium Braided HDMI Cable</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Premium HDMI Cable</h3><div catalogid="daa9c4e2-1993-4e7f-800e-8fe74d192871" id="210398"><div id="210398" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cable Matters Premium Braided HDMI Cable</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>If you love braided cables as much as we do, this HDMI cable from Cable Matters checks all the right boxes.</p></div></div><div><p>Features</p><p>Braided, color variations</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Braided HDMI cables are a better choice if you tend to move your HDMI cables from one device to another, have kids, or perhaps aren’t as gentle with your cables. The Cable Matters Premium Braided HDMI Cable supports up to 8K – you can comfortably play your PS5 on your TV at 4K@120Hz, and enjoy Dolby Atmos when you’re setting up for movie night.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being high quality and having a more premium feel to it, the Cable Matters Premium Braided HDMI Cable is actually very affordable. It comes in a generous 6.6 feet, but if you need a longer cable for any reason, you can also upgrade to 9.8 feet.</p></div><p id="most-durable"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Most durable" id="snowkids8k">7. Snowkids 8K HDMI Cable</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Most Durable HDMI Cable</h3><div catalogid="daa9c4e2-1993-4e7f-800e-8fe74d192871" id="210399"><div id="210399" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Snowkids 8K HDMI Cable</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>This 8K HDMI cable from Snowkids is built to last.</p></div></div><div><p>Features</p><p>Braided, gold plated</p></div><div><p>Can be hard to get hold of</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Long-lasting cables at an affordable price are hard to come by, but that’s exactly what the Snowkids 8K HDMI cable is. Featuring a double-fiber nylon braid, this cable is incredibly durable. It’s another great option if you move your HDMI cable around between devices, or take it with you to the office.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 24K gold-plated connector is nice to have, too, ensuring your signal is transmitted accurately at all times. Snowkids claims the cable can withstand up to 25,000 bends – while we weren’t going to test it to that extreme, there’s no doubt the Snowkids 8K HDMI Cable is going to last a long time.</p></div><p id="how-to-pick-a-ps5-hdmi-cable"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="How to pick a PS5 HDMI cable">How to Pick the Best HDMI Cable for PS5</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You could spend a lot of money on a HDMI cable for your PS5 when you don’t have to. With lots of marketing jargon, it’s easy to get lost and spend over and above for what you actually need. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 can output 4K@120Hz; HDMI 2.1 is the standard that supports this, so if you have a TV capable of this resolution, you should look for a HDMI 2.1 cable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re on a tight budget, don’t have a compatible TV, or just need a spare, then you could get away with a HDMI 2.0 cable – but this can only reach 4K@60Hz.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, though, for around the same price, it’s not hard to find a suitable HDMI 2.1 cable. You just need to assess the distance between your PS5 and TV, ensuring you invest in a cable that gives you plenty of room. This is especially true of you don't have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-stand">good TV stand</a> that has holes in the back for cords to slip through,</p><p id="faq"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FAQ">PS5-compatible HDMI Cables FAQ</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Are expensive HDMI cables worth it?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have a modern 4K or 8K TV, you shouldn’t get sticker shock when looking for an HDMI cable. At these high resolutions, the amount of data the PS5 is pushing to your PC is massive, and cheaper cables run the risk of corrupting that data by using lackluster materials. However, if you’re playing your PS5 on an older display, you might want to consider either upgrading your TV, or opting for a cheaper HDMI cable.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What kind of HDMI cable does the PS5 use?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">To get the most out of your PS5, you should use a HDMI 2.1 cable. This supports 4K@120Hz, or 8K@60Hz, providing the best gaming experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Does the PS5 come with a HDMI 2.1 cable?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, the PS5 does come with a HDMI 2.1 cable. You don’t need to buy any additional cables unless you want a longer cable, one with features like braiding, or you need a spare.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Is HDMI 2.1 backward compatible?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, HDMI 2.1 is backward compatible. If you plug a HDMI 2.1 cable into a HDMI 2.0 port, it will still work. If you plug a HDMI 2.0 cable into your PS5, it will still work, but it won’t offer support for the same video output.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kegan is an avid gamer who has been playing games since his Atari days.

It’s a shorter list that positions the new update as one of the smaller in recent memory, but that doesn’t mean it won’t keep players locked in for the time being.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rivals fans often show up for the FPS gameplay and stick around for the guns, so the Gunblade already feels right at home. This two-in-one rifle doubles as both a ranged weapon and a giant blade. Using both to catch your opponents off guard may prove useful in the heat of battle, especially on the new Rivals Bridge map. This suspended, concrete location leaves no room for small talk by putting players into close-quarters combat from the jump with only a few concrete walls and a bus standing in between them. Nosniy says the arena is located in Seoul and comes from creator @GreatGuyBoom.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/22/roblox-rivals-update-9-1737584645781.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Rivals Update 9 adds the Gunblade to the Roblox FPS experience's arsenal.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, fans will notice that the Rivals Update 9 patch notes don’t mention any specific bug fixes, balance changes, or quality-of-life additions. The developers acknowledge their decision to ditch any other tweaks in favor of adding the Bridge map and Gunblade. Although there was room to “slightly” modify the skins for the Demon Shorty and Demon Uzi while renaming a few other weapons, Nosniy does promise more to come with the next major content update. Among the new additions will be one long-awaited feature: Ranked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hear all of your feedback and want to reassure you all that every necessary &amp; additional changes/improvements will be made in time for Ranked,” the team said in a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rivals fans have enjoyed regular updates since launch arrived last May. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rivals-update-7-patch-notes-outline-plans-for-weekly-weapon-drops"><u>Update 7</u></a>, for example, brought along the introduction of the Energy Rifle, Energy Pistols, Crossbow, and more.
