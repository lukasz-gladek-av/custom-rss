Microsoft acquired ZeniMax Media for $8.1 billion in March 2021 and operates it under the Microsoft Gaming division.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Video games have been the revenue titan of the entire entertainment industry for years, and the workers who develop these games are too often exploited for their passion and creativity," said Jessee Leese, a member of the bargaining committee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we all deserve. Our first contract is an invitation for video game professionals everywhere to take action. We’re the ones who make these games, and we’ll be the ones to set new standards for fair treatment.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ZeniMax QA workers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-zenimax-media-sees-300-qa-workers-unionize">first unionized in January of 2023</a>, following groups at Raven Software and Blizzard Albany, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-will-recognize-raven-software-union">Microsoft made a public commitment to labor neutrality</a>. However, the road to a contract has been challenging. In November of last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-elder-scrolls-and-doom-workers-go-on-strike-in-protest-at-parent-company-microsoft">workers went on a one-day strike</a>, citing a lack of progress at the bargaining table over remote work protections and allegations that Microsoft was outsourcing QA work without bargaining with the union. Then, in April, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workers voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike</a>, again citing concerns over remote work and low compensation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tentative contract is contingent on ratification by the union members in a vote which is expected to be concluded by June 20.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
