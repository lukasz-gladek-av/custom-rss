            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is a breakout hit for developer Saber Interactive, selling over 7 million copies in less than a year. As the game approaches its first anniversary, and with the hotly anticipated Patch 10 imminent, development chief Tim Willits has a lot to be happy about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has not been on any streaming service,” Willits told me in an interview at gamescom 2025. “You want to play it, you got to buy it. And it's just rocking and rolling. And it wasn't overpriced. It wasn't overscoped. It wasn't over-designed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Space Marine 2 was not a guaranteed success. No video game is. In fact, things were looking ropey when Saber and publisher Focus Entertainment <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-delayed-to-second-half-of-2024">announced a significant delay to the game</a>, from 2023 to the second half of 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This, Willits says, was the “smartest” move Saber has ever made - and you can see why. Space Marine 2 is easily the biggest Warhammer 40,000 video game of all time, impressing veteran fans of the famous grimdark tabletop game and newcomers alike. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-sees-highest-concurrent-player-peak-ever-for-a-warhammer-40000-game-on-steam">Huge player numbers followed</a> as well as record sales. As Willits told me last year, Space Marine 2 changed everything for Saber, and it wasn’t long before the inevitable Space Marine 3 was announced. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-year-2-roadmap-reveals-content-plan-for-patch-10-right-up-to-2026s-patch-15-including-new-weapons-a-new-class-and-much-more">A full second year of content for Space Marine 2 is also in the works</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With Space Marine 2, if you remember, we actually delayed that,” Willits said. “It was f***ing worth it! And that was the smartest thing we ever did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on Space Marine 2's first year, Willits admitted it is an ongoing challenge to release enough DLC, both free and premium, to satisfy fans who are always hungry for more content. He pointed to the free horde mode, dubbed Siege, as a particular high point of Space Marine 2’s first year. “Can you name any giant AAA games that release free modes within months after the game?” Willits wondered. “The team is passionate about it. They're super Space Marine nerds, and fan appetite for it is over the top.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Black Templars Champion Pack and Imperial Fists Cosmetic Pack</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber, who evolved its impressive zombie tech for prior game World War Z and applied it to the Tyranids for Space Marine 2, was prepared to provide DLC post-launch, Willits said. “We learned our lesson in World War Z. So when World War Z came out, we were unprepared to be honest. We were like, ‘Oh my god, this is a success. Go!’ And so we were way more prepared. We had people working on stuff a year plus before we released, because we knew. We knew. And we learned our lesson. But you're right, feeding the machine is hard.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 is certainly set for plenty of DLC in its second year, but will it get a story expansion? Or will fans have to wait until <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-the-inquisition-watching-tight-lipped-saber-chief-wont-say-much-about-warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-but-he-has-revealed-games-workshop-is-offering-up-some-ideas-that-are-amazing">Space Marine 3</a> comes out to find out what happens next to Titus and friends? “I mean we have some plans, but we have to work with Focus to get the right announcement,” Willits teased. “Nothing is off the table.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2’s success has even positively impacted the development of other Saber games, and given the company the confidence to delay again knowing how beneficial it can be in the long run. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-puts-an-80s-horror-spin-on-left-4-dead">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</a>, for example, was delayed out of this year and into early 2026, and Willits is perfectly calm about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Space Marine 2 was so successful for us that we wanted to make sure that we didn't rush out Toxic Commando immediately after that,” he explained. “And we wanted to make sure that the team had resources and the time and the testing. We've done multiple beta tests, we've got normal people playing it. We had sign-up a few weeks ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is one of the great things about Saber. We manage our business well and we do not over scope, over design and bloat our teams or our projects, which then allows us to be like, ‘Hey, you know what? Let's actually spend a little more time on Toxic. Space Marine's doing great, we're making content for that. People love it.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because gamers are smart. They always know when a game is rushed or like, ‘You could have done better if you’d spent a little more time with it.’ So we are in a position because of how we make games and how we do work, and that gives us the flexibility and freedom to focus on making sure the games are as good as they can be. So yes, it's a little longer past Space Marine, but I think it'll be much better.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/image1-wide-lmcl29nu75-1756463334899.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hats off to Titus and Space Marine 2. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Warhammer 40,000 was doing fantastically well for Games Workshop before Space Marine 2 came out, the video game has certainly lifted the setting to another level. Games Workshop recently announced the first ever officially licensed wearable Space Marine helmet — and it’s styled after Lieutenant Titus from Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprisingly, Willits didn’t know about it when I brought it up. “That's cool. I had no idea!” he said. “And I usually buy all that stuff.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

The content available will be in various stages of production, including items in alpha state, which may result in less polished and/or unstable builds. This allows the development team to balance and make adjustments much faster as it "shapes the future of the game with the community to shape the future of the game."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/bf-labs-resumes-update-1756460090903.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Battlefield Portal user interface.

And as part of this, we've been given our first look at the Battlefield Portal user interface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some of the most frequent questions from the community have been about Server Browser availability and functionality," the team explained in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-battlefield-labs-testing" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>community</u></a> blog. "In an upcoming Battlefield Labs play session, we will enable an early implementation of this Portal functionality within the Community tab. At this stage, our main goal is to observe how it works in practice, with initial feedback focusing on accessibility and UI clarity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players will be able to use the experience library to find a verified Conquest experience using a shortcode, after which players can then choose from a pre-filtered list of active servers, or host their own, where they'll be able to alter descriptions, rotations, tags, and so on. Of course, this should still be treated as a work-in-progress for now, and the Battlefield Studios would like feedback from Battlefield Labs participants as they play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The next batch of closed tests will also usher in new maps, Operation Firestorm and Mirak Valley, which are designed for combined arms combat and vehicles, including quad bikes, tanks, and aircraft. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're having a great time with what we've played so far, writing in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer"><u>Battlefield 6 review-in-progress</u></a>: "Right now, even in beta form, Battlefield 6 might be the most fun shooter I’ve played this year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't forget that from now until October 7 — Battlefield 6's launch day — EA has a "wave of content" planned for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-2042"><u>Battlefield 2042</u></a>, including a free new pass "celebrating the legacy of Battlefield," new hardware, and a reimagining of the fan favorite Iwo Jima map.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It is the driving force behind many of your favorite video games released in the last few years, but it largely flies under the radar. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> are just a few of the many games that were and continue to be supported by Virtuos, one of the largest independent video game companies in the world with over 20 studios globally employing about 4,000 staff. Still, the average gamer probably doesn’t know Virtuos exists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s starting to change though, with Virtuos’ profile rising with each new release. Oblivion Remastered is perhaps Virtuos’ biggest project yet, and its heavy involvement with its development was made a key part of the game’s announcement by Bethesda. Meanwhile, CD Projekt livestreams feature members of the Virtuos development team. Looking ahead, Ken Levine’s BioShock follow-up, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, and Riot’s League of Legends fighting game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a>, will both come out with Virtuos’ help.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it has not all been plain sailing. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/despite-laying-off-270-staff-development-studio-virtuos-remains-fully-committed-to-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-cyberpunk-2077-and-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Virtuos laid off approximately 7% of its global workforce</a>, or around 270 staff. In a statement, Virtuos said it was "evolving to meet the changing needs" of its partners and the wider video games industry. Most of the layoffs affected Virtuos’ Asian workforce.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a wide-ranging interview with IGN at gamescom 2025, Virtuos CEO Gilles Langourieux discussed the company’s history, its recent projects, and what it’s hoping to achieve in the future. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which has gone a long way to putting Virtuos on the map this year, was a big part of our chat.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/28/virtuos-gilles-langourieux-landscape-1756412895462.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Virtuos CEO Gilles Langourieux.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Langourieux said Virtuos’ expertise when it came to remasters (Batman, Final Fantasy, Dark Souls Remastered) meant it was a natural part of the conversation around Oblivion’s return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We managed to convince Todd Howard and his team that we could do it,” Langourieux began. “He had known us for a while. And then how does it work? You prove what you're capable of during a pilot phase. You deliver a convincing vertical slice or pilot. You align with the team at Bethesda on what they believe is the level of quality or detail required to meet their audience goal, and you continue all the way to final ship.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtuos developed Oblivion Remastered using Unreal Engine 5. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes went down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>. Bethesda, however, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-comments-on-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-changes-we-never-wanted-to-remake-it"><u>has explained why it went down the remaster route</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Langourieux said Virtuos knew it had to use a new engine for Oblivion Remastered to bring the classic RPG up to date in terms of graphics and performance, but also retain the original engine so veteran fans would recognize Oblivion’s gameplay. As Todd Howard himself described it, Bethesda was keen for the Oblivion remaster to have some of that “old charm.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We realized that one of the solutions would have to be to combine the original engine with a new engine. Virtuos happens to have a long experience working with Unreal,” Langourieux said. “We've done a number of projects like this where we combine — it's called engine pairing — we pair two engines to work together so that the gameplay comes from the original engine, but the rendering and the new modern bells and whistles come from the new engine. And our experience doing that, our experience with Unreal, was one of the things we had to bring to the table.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, hundreds of artists were mobilized to work on Oblivion Remastered to “nail” the Oblivion art style while also modernizing it. Virtuos had its studio in Paris lead the project, making technical, design, and artistic choices about the game, with the help of other Virtuos studios. At Bethesda, a small team under the direct supervision of Todd Howard monitored Virtuos’ work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At peak, around 400 people at Virtuos worked on Oblivion Remastered. This was a true AAA development effort spread out across a number of years. The end result was a successful release, a video game played by over 9 million people at this point, and a (largely) impressed fanbase. Virtuos itself was made a part of Bethesda’s official Oblivion Remastered announcement video, which Langourieux appreciated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sometimes when you tackle these kinds of projects, you worry about talking about a new developer because you're worried that new developer name might not resonate so well with the audience,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They put their money where their mouth is by supporting us very transparently and openly, and that has given us more visibility than other projects have. So credit to them for that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077, Oblivion Remastered, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater… what’s next? With all sorts of rumors swirling around about more Bethesda remasters, could Virtuos be helping out with, say, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-success-ex-bethesda-dev-expects-a-fallout-3-remaster-would-significantly-improve-the-not-good-gun-combat">a Fallout remaster of some description?</a> Of course, Langourieux won’t name names, but did talk generally about what Virtuos has up its sleeve, and teased “similar” titles to Oblivion Remastered coming from the company in the years ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I won't be able to share specifics,” he began, “but what I can say is that you've seen what we're capable of for a big, impactful remaster like Oblivion. You can expect more similar titles to come out of Virtuos in the coming years. And you can also expect to see us involved in expanding the life of large-life titles. Those would be two directions that I'm super excited about.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But will Virtuos break out of its support act status and make an original IP of its own? Langourieux seems happy with where his company is at right now, insisting “not everyone aspires to be the rockstar.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have a lot of ambition,” Langourieux said. “We've built one of the largest, most stable game developers in the business, and we intend to continue doing that. We've done it by being very clear about what we're good at and how we can serve our clients in the industry. And there's a lot of ambition with that. Not everything is about being the rockstar. Not everyone aspires to be the rockstar. We're playing a different role."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
