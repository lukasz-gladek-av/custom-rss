If there's a spelling mistake in the code then in won't work. Double check there isn't a typo, and also see if capital letters are in the right places as Roblox codes can be case sensitive too!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you checked and everything is correct then that means the code is unfortunately no longer working. Roblox codes tend to be time-sensitive, and are only active for a limited amount of time. So if you see a code you like the look of, don't delay in redeeming it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Lootify Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">New Lootify codes are shared by the developer Yes Madam on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/AW9EMShwQJ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Lootify Discord server</a>. While we check for new Lootify codes regularly, the quickest way to get new codes is to sign up to the experience's Discord, where you'll be able to see the latest codes posted in real-time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Lootify in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Lootify is an action RPG with a Dark Souls feel to it. The Roblox experience makes you face off against groups of fantasy-inspired enemies, which at first seem overpowered and tough to defeat. When you die, a FromSoftware-style "You Died" screen even appears! Like the Souls games, you can grind for EXP to level up your character and make them more powerful. But the best way to get stronger is via the game's loot mechanic, which lets you keep opening chests to try and find better gear to power up your character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dion has spent over five years doing games journalism for UK national newspaper websites and is now a writer for Gamer Network.
