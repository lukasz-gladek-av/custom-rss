            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">War. War never changes. What does change, however, are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a>. Those suckers change all the time, with thousands of new ones coming out every year, sometimes in big boxes, others in little ones, and occasionally ones <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">based on a popular property</a>. That’s the case with Fallout: Power Play, a small-area control card game designed by Resurrectionist Games and published by Modiphius Games, currently up for pre-order. It's a small game with some good bones to it, but its compact design is more of a hindrance than a benefit.</p><div id="234620"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234620" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout: Power Play</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout: Power Play puts two to four players in command of four possible factions, each with their own unique decks and special ability. These are the Brotherhood of Steel (good at completing missions to earn influence and hunkering down in a location), Super Mutants (lots of big and powerful unit cards to deploy at locations), the Enclave (excellent at disrupting other players' turns), and Raiders (thieves, every last one of them). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On their turn, players deploy agents to locations, complete quests to earn rewards, and use their faction-specific ability, all in a bid to earn the most influence in the different places, netting you victory points. Whichever player has their agent holding a location at the end of the turn gains influence over the spot, with the top play considered to be “dominating” and earning a victory point. The first player to reach 10 points triggers the end game and scoring, with whoever has the most points winning at the end of that round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things get shaken up a bit thanks to the random Wasteland Encounter cards you draw at the start of each round, and unique Power Play cards that each player has in their deck. These events can range from spawning ghouls that attack everyone’s agents to even detonating an Atom Bomb Baby and destroying everything at the location(s) where players have the most influence. That one is a particularly fun card to see safely from the sidelines, as all of your friends’ units are blasted out of existence all at once in the region they were fighting so fiercely over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the encounter cards are the right hand of chaos in Power Play, then the titular Power Play cards in your deck are the left hand of chaos. These cards have the potential to be played not only on your turn, but also in response to other players’ actions. Think an Instant spell in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game">Magic: The Gathering</a>. This resulted in some tense back-and-forth, play-and-counterplay moments with my friends, and I often found myself holding my breath whenever I would put down one of my more powerful cards in hopes they wouldn’t get countered or worse. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While at first glace, Power Play may appear to be more of a simple “bigger number better” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war game</a>, the more I played, the more nuance and strategy I found in it. Each location only has spots for four agents, and in games with fewer players, this allows for you to allocate multiple agent resources to a location. But regardless of how much you are overpowering the other players in a spot, you will still only gain a single victory point at the end of the round. On the flip side, every round where you don’t have an agent at a location will result in your losing an influence at that location (to a minimum of 1), so it pays to spread out your forces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This management almost makes Power Play into more of a worker placement game, and I often found myself opting to have one stronghold as my main “VP generator” and then spreading out and setting up at the other locations to pull off big influence gain turns by completing quest cards that would net me a boost in influence for a spot. Whenever I managed to pull off these well-laid plans, it tickled that good spot in my brain and never got old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resurrectionist Games, Power Play’s designer, has put together a card game with solid bones, and its focus on capturing and holding locations reminds me of the hot new TCG <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm8eKN?object_uuid=2024f377-3b29-410b-b422-66976da1388a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Riftbound</a>. That said, issues surrounding the delivery and presentation of the game blemish and knock Power Play down some notches. The most disappointing of which is that the whole product feels less like a Fallout card game and more like something with the beloved property slapped on the side of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the four factions and other nods to the Fallout universe, I never felt as though Power Play did much with the property. Instead of decks featuring notable characters from the games that fans would recognize, the designers opted for bland and generic fill-ins instead. Taking the Brotherhood of Steel deck, for instance, a group whose Power Armor is arguably just as synonymous with the series as the signature blue-and-yellow vault suits, your forces are composed of no-name cards like “Knight” or “Elder.” Instead of a generic Elder, why not have the lead agent be a character like Arthur Maxson or Sarah Lyons?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The home base locations of each of the factions feel rather soulless and are identical to one another from a gameplay standpoint. While “activate a location” is an option you can take on your turn, there are only two locations that have something to activate, with the others being the starting strongholds of each faction. They are “War Camp” or “Raider Fortress” instead of something memorable from the series, like Nuka-World or even a Vault. I would have appreciated these spots to be two-sided, with a generic, ability-less side and the other having an action associated with it and pulled from somewhere players would recognize if you were in the mood for a more advanced game mode. Alas, no such luck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This more uninspired approach extends into the art and even the card descriptions. Keeping on the Brotherhood train, the Initiate and Field Scribe agent cards feature nearly identical character faces, and cards like their “Knight” read as “Each time Knight kills an Enemy…” which feels generic. Do these things impact how the game plays? No. But if you're going to adapt a well-known property, you want it to feel meaningful, and considering the attention to detail I’ve come to expect from Modiphius, especially with Fallout, thanks to the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gX1nn?object_uuid=2024f377-3b29-410b-b422-66976da1388a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fallout TTRPG</a> they also publish, Power Play just doesn’t get there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My other main gripe with Power Play has to do with some of the quality control and decisions involved with how the game is packaged. Now, I’m all for a game being nice and compact; heck, one of the most prestigious awards I can give (in my mind anyway) is the Glovebox Award, given to games that are small and fun enough that I always want them with me wherever I go (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/flip-7-card-game-review">Flip 7</a> is an example). It’s rare that I’ve found a game that feels too small – but Power Play does. Inside its box are spots for two decks of cards, with a small gap in between. Now, these two spots aren’t quite deep enough to contain all of the standard-sized cards included, causing some annoying shifting, and unfortunately, you can just forget sleeving your cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout: Power Play also uses tokens to mark each faction’s influence in the regions and other little reminders. Unfortunately, these tokens are incredibly tiny. And while the faction tokens are at least color-coded, some of the reminder tokens, all of which are about 3/4 the size of a dime and contain text, are barely legible from anything more than maybe six inches from your face, let alone from across a table. Power Play may also be the first board game I have that uses tokens but doesn’t come with a small bag to keep them in. And to make matters more annoying, they easily slip into the small gap between the two decks. Thankfully, my cardboard hobby has granted me extra baggies that I was able to put them in, but beforehand, more than a couple of times, I spent more time than I care to admit trying to get some of these damn cardboard pieces out of the box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout: Power Play is a great example of how a bunch of little missed opportunities and annoyances can add up, and it’s a shame. This is one of those products that I can see potential and promise if Resurrectionist Games takes a bit more care into any future properties they adapt. The underlying game is fun, and I can imagine a day down the road where Power Play becomes the system, and you can buy additional sets, akin to, say, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPxADA?object_uuid=2024f377-3b29-410b-b422-66976da1388a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smash Up!</a>, and you can have the Brotherhood of Steel facing off against the forces of the Borg from Star Trek, or the demons of Hell from Doom pushing back Super Mutants. That's a game I would love to play, and if they put a bit more care into those sets, you can count me in day one. It may even make it into the glovebox.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 21, 2026 7:10 pm</p></div><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Despite some fun mechanics, Fallout: Power Play doesn't do service to the property on its box.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-power-play-card-game-review]]></content:encoded>

Here’s all we know coming to Disney Lorcana in the coming months, and we’ll update this as we hear more.</p><p id="winterspell"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Winterspell">Winterspell - February 20</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/stitch-1753964625824.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-at-gen-con-2025-everything-announced-about-fabled-whispers-in-the-well-winterspell-and-more"><u>Winterspell</u></a>, as we mentioned, has the unenviable task of offering cards related to Christmas almost two months late (or ten months early, if you’re an optimist). The set launches on February 20, with a prerelease on February 13, and will introduce snowy variants of characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the sweet snowy designs on the covers, if you're curious what comes with each of these items, here's the breakdown: the booster pack sets you up with 12 cards, including six Common cards, three Uncommon cards, two cards of either Rare, Super Rare, or Legendary rarity, and one random foil card. Preorders are now live, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-disney-lorcana-tcg-winterspell">Amazon being the best place to buy right now</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're hoping to have a bit more than just the booster pack on hand, the booster pack display comes with 24 packs. And for a little bit of everything, the Illumineer's Trove comes with a card storage box, six card dividers, eight booster packs, six damage-counter dice, and a lore counter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect Mickey Mouse, Snowboard Ace, to bump shoulders with Jiminy Cricket, Willie the Giant, and Lonely Resting Place pulling double duty as the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future. Get ready for more card reveals in the coming weeks ahead of launch. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMK1E4?object_uuid=efd0fe9f-9a27-4341-8ee1-8c70c8de27ca&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer also has listings</u></a> for individual cards, booster packs and boxes, and the new Illumineer’s Trove. </p><p id="scrooge-mcduck-gift-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Scrooge McDuck Gift Box">Scrooge McDuck Gift Box - March 13</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/13/scrooge-mcduck-box-1768335080709.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While not tied to a fresh set, there are two new releases on March 13 which Collectors will want to be aware of. The first is the Scrooge McDuck Gift Box. It’s not up for preorder right now, but will include an exclusive Scrooge McDuck, S.H.U.S.H. Agent in Glimmer Foil, and five random booster packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The curious thing to note is that those packs are from prior sets, so you could get five from Winterspell, or you could end up with some classics. Up next, the Collection Starter Set has a portfolio adorned with Stitch, Rock Star, a Glimmer Foil variant of Stitch, Carefree Snowboarder, and four booster packs.</p><p id="wilds-unknown"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Wilds Unknown">Wilds Unknown - May 15</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/13/wilds-unknown-prerelease-kit-1768335201522.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With all due respect to Winterspell, this is the set that’s likely to take up a lot of the oxygen in Disney Lorcana’s 2026 release schedule. It’ll lean into cowboy fantasies, and who better to lead that charge than Woody himself, alongside Buzz Lightyear. Wild Unkowns marks a significant change for Lorcana releases, as the TCG leans more into Disney's Pixar characters, starting with The Incredibles and Toy Story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will also add new Prelease Kits to the Lorcana product pool, each including a promo card, dice, six booster packs from the latest set, and a deck box. Honestly, Ravensburger, you had me at Toy Story, but I’m excited to see the game grow. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve also long lauded Gateway as a great starter product for new Lorcana players, but in May we’ll get also new 2-Player Starter Set with preconstructed decks, lore trackers, tokens, and some playmats, also as part of Wilds Unknown. This one launches on May 15, as recently confirmed, with prerelease from May 8.</p><p id="attack-of-the-vine"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Attack of the Vine">Attack of the Vine - Q3</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/21/lorcana-attack-of-the-vine-2026-ign-1769012000262.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking further ahead, we don’t know a <em>great</em> deal about what’s coming later, but a few details have already been confirmed by the Lorcana team. Attack of the Vine, featuring characters from Monsters Inc and Turning Red, will launch sometime in Q3 2026.</p><p id="coco-and-more"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Coco and More">Coco and More - Q4</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, towards then end of the year, Coco is set to make its first Lorcana appearance, but we know little more than that. Disney’s possibilities are seemingly endless, though, and while Star Wars and Marvel each have cardboard appearances in Unlimited and Magic: The Gathering to prepare for, don’t be surprised to see the House of Mouse and Ravensburger pull out some even more deep cuts in 2026, and beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.<br>
