            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Store has partnered with Bethesda Softworks and world-renowned artist Dave Rapoza to create Hellwalkers - the latest piece in IGN’s exclusive museum-quality IGN Artist Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Available only on IGN Store, <em><strong>Hellwalkers - IGN Artist Series 004</strong></em> vividly captures the menace and power of the legendary Doomslayer, as made possible by the equally legendary artist Dave Repoza, a lifelong Doom fan himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Store has <strong>400 premium weight art prints ($70)</strong> and <strong>100 premium acrylic art prints ($275)</strong> - both measuring a bold 18 x 24 inches. These pieces are brutal, iconic, and highly-collectible.</p><a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/ign-artist-series-doom" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each print is individually numbered and signed by Dave Rapoza and the acrylic print is truly fine art, backed on gator board and featuring a Certificate of Authenticity (laser-etched on the Doomslayer’s Shield Saw). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Id software has proven for more than 30 years that Doom truly is eternal. Since its world-shaping debut in 1993 to the epic, weighty, powerful play style of The Dark Ages, the Doom franchise’s Doomslayer has stood at the forefront of gaming as an immortal icon. This IGN Artist Series is a must-own for any serious Doom fan, and will not be reprinted once it is gone. The piece is destined to become a collector’s item, and is a perfect edition to any Doom fan’s wall. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dave Rapoza is a self-taught artist who grew up in Carver, MA.  For nearly 20 years his stunning artwork has been turning heads. Rapoza’s artwork has graced Marvel Comics covers, Magic: the Gathering, Paizo Publishing projects and a huge range of others. He has also contributed art to Diablo IV, League of Legends and the Witcher 3, among many other games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My first experience with Doom was playing the original in my neighbor’s kitchen on their ancient computer—it made a big impression on me, especially the music and definitely helped spark my love for games,” Repoza said. “Whenever I take on something like this, I try to tap into what made me a fan in the first place and boil that down into a single image. It’s a fun challenge, and I’m proud of how this one turned out. Hope you enjoy it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IGN Artist Series is IGN’s love letter to the pop culture icons we all love to watch, play, and discuss. Available for under a day, IGN Artist Series 001, 002, and 003 was produced in partnership with Bethesda and Amazon Prime Video and featured Fallout’s The Ghoul, Maximus, and Lucy MacLean, from artist Kevin Tong. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/limited-edition-ign-artist-series-hellwalker-prints-from-dave-rapoza-now-available]]></content:encoded>

Although projects like Devil May Cry Season 2 are currently top of mind, it sounds like something based on the legendary tongue-in-cheek first-person shooter franchise is currently in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm being approached with different IPs and companies that want to work with me,” Shankar said. “I bought the rights to Duke Nukem. Not the gaming rights, but I bought it from Gearbox.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Upcoming New Video Game Movies and TV Shows: 2025 Release Dates and Beyond</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Duke Nukem is an unmistakably ‘90s video game franchise that got its start in 1991, but it wasn’t until 1996 that it would find its FPS footing with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/duke-nukem-3d">Duke Nukem 3D</a>. Although a laundry list of sequels arrived throughout the 15 years that followed, its 2011 entry, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/duke-nukem-forever"><u>Duke Nukem Forever</u></a>, was heavily criticized by critics and fans alike. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360-era title did so much to damage the blond, buzzcut hero’s reputation that there has not been a new Duke Nukem installment since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shankar is already cooking up ideas for what a present-day take on Duke Nukem could look like. It’s unclear if fans can expect to see an animated Duke Nukem show in the vein of Shankar’s other projects, a movie, or something completely different, but it’s clear Shankar is trying to put together a project of some sort behind the scenes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I don't intend on having anyone tell me what to do on this one.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a middle finger to everybody,” Shankar said when describing his vision for Duke Nukem. “When Duke Nukem blew up, a bunch of people sat around trying to turn it into a brand, when it's just a middle finger. Duke Nukem can't be made by a corporation, because the moment a corporation makes Duke Nukem, it's no longer Duke Nukem. I don't intend on having anyone tell me what to do on this one.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll have to wait to see what Shankar has in store for the ‘90s icon. For now, no casting, plot, or release date details for the Duke Nukem show have been revealed. It's unclear how the recent rights aquisition will impact the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/duke-nukem-movie-in-development-from-cobra-kai-creators-and-legendary-entertainment">Legendary Entertainment Duke Nukem movie reported on in 2022</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Duke Nukem 3D 20th Anniversary Edition</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For a better look at what to expect, you can read up on his other Netflix projects.
