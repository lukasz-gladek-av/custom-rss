He's cute, he's mighty, and he has great deck utility (and great duck utility)...it's Farfetch'd!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who aren't playing Pocket, it's essentially a card collecting/pack opening sim with the ability to play a truncated version of the Pokemon TCG. The rules are simpler, the battles are shorter, and it's a lot easier to build an interesting competitive deck due to the game being free-to-play and the availability of booster packs for players who don't spend any money.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/01/screenshot-2024-11-01-090442-1730469929527.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: u/MacNPieces on Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ggayb3/senior_discount_to_those_who_remember/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ggayb3/senior_discount_to_those_who_remember/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now in Pocket, there's only one "set" of cards available to collect, called Apex Evolution. It's a great idea to start everyone off with just one set, from scratch, so there's a fairly even playing field at launch and the meta is still shaking out. But as <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-deck-cards-best-farfetchd/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted by ComicBook</a>, Farfetch'd specifically has been rising above the rest as a component of just about any viable deck you want to make due to its unique combination of advantages. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/01/screenshot-2024-11-01-090630-1730470033238.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: u/L3M0N5_2112 on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gg56nw/i_cant_be_the_only_one/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gg56nw/i_cant_be_the_only_one/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, it's a Basic Pokemon, so you can play it right from the start of the game without having to evolve it. Second, like most other Basic Pokemon, it has an attack that only costs one Energy, so it can attack pretty much immediately without any build-up. But more importantly, that attack (Leek Slap) does a whopping 40 damage, which is an enormous amount for a one energy cost, Basic Pokemon move. As a common card, Farfetch'd is easy for anyone to obtain, so there's no major expense or long effort to getting one or two in your deck. And finally, because Farfetch'd is a "colorless" card, it can be included in any deck and can use any type of energy, so it's very versatile.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/01/screenshot-2024-11-01-090857-1730470158083.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: u/raysayantan07 on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1g5up9f/one_little_duck_against_the_whole_world/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1g5up9f/one_little_duck_against_the_whole_world/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Farfetch'd ultimately isn't a long game winner. It's great if you want to play aggressively, as you can get it out on the board quickly, do a lot of damage, and then retreat for the cost of just the single energy it already had on it before its 60 HP gets too low. But in the Pokemon TCG, that's usually enough. Farfetch'd can keep your opponent busy while you build up your bigger monsters on your bench, and can help stall your opponent from making similar big moves as fast as you can. Truly a mighty bird, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1g460w8/farfetchd_appreciation_post_best_card_of_the_set/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans are praising it accordingly</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We did a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">preview of Pokemon TCG Pocket</a> back in September. As our previewer wrote, it's "mainly a card-collecting destination, and maybe thatâ€™s all it needs to be." But with Farfetch'd on the team, maybe dipping into the battles is worth it after all. Now when are we getting a full art of this guy, or an EX version?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The next Mass Effect is going to have a very tough act to follow, which is not something I ever imagined I'd be saying before I got swept away on this adventure. Enjoyable action combat, a fantastic cast of allies with sweeping story arcs all their own, top-notch cinematics, and moving, nuanced character writing are the wings on which this triumphant dragon soars, pulling out all the stops in a whirlwind tour of Northern Thedas and capping it with a terrific finale thatâ€™s built on memorably tough choices and consequences. If we never get another Dragon Age, at least it got to go out on a high note."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.
