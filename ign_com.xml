It started during a pandemic and resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-shortages-2021-microsoft-continue"><u>supply chain issues</u></a> that made the Xbox Series X hard to get for months, the potential-killer-app launch title (Halo Infinite) suffered an embarrassing but much needed yearlong <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-delayed-to-2021-for-xbox-series-x-pc-xbox-one"><u>delay</u></a>, Microsoft tried to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-activision-blizzard-buy-acquisition-acquired"><u>buy Activision-Blizzard for SIXTY-NINE BILLION DOLLARS</u></a> only to see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-verdict-has-been-reached-in-the-microsoft-vs-ftc-trial"><u>regulatory agencies</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-calls-cma-decision-disappointing-disputes-cloud-gaming-reasoning"><u>around the world</u></a> challenge it before the deal ultimately <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout-imminent-after-stock-halted-and-uk-clears-deal"><u>went through</u></a>, the company shipped one bona fide <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2021"><u>Game of the Year</u></a> (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-review"><u>Forza Horizon 5</u></a>) and also started <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-vision-of-the-future"><u>publishing its first-party games on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch</u></a>, and Xbox boss Phil Spencer even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-release-an-xbox-handheld-but-its-years-away"><u>confirmed</u></a> that a handheld Xbox is in the works, even if we might not see it during this hardware generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, outside of a kickass 2021 that saw the release of the aforementioned Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5 along with Psychonauts 2, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and Tunic, Xbox players have been waiting (and waiting) for a steady flow of first-party games. And it was looking a bit bleak this year – <em>again </em>– with Avowed getting pushed to February 2025 and the potential-packed pixel-art indie action-adventure exclusive Replaced slipping out of 2024. But Microsoft turned in all its homework right as the bell rang at the end of class, with STALKER 2, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle all landing in the final six weeks of the year – and all three getting A’s on the assignment. Let’s discuss the honorable mentions, runners-up, and Best Xbox Game of 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Xbox Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dungeons-of-hinterberg">Dungeons of Hinterberg</a> both just missed making the top of our list but are very worthy of honorable mentions. The psychologically focused sequel to Hellblade was the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/13/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-announced-for-xbox-series-x"><u>first-ever officially announced Xbox Series X game</u></a>, and when it finally shipped this year, it can lay claim to at least one title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review"><u>best-looking Xbox game ever made</u></a>. Ninja Theory’s Unreal Engine 5-powered narrative-driven adventure is a technical showpiece, a powerhouse of pixels that leverages all 10.2 teraflops of power that the Series X is packing. It’s a bit light in the gameplay department – more akin to a walking simulator than a proper action-adventure – but it is nevertheless beautifully acted and stunningly presented. It’s very much worth taking the time to go on this journey with Senua.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Dungeons of Hinterberg’s hooky concept – a European town becomes a hotspot for visitors to come and make friends and drink beers at night after a long day of monster slaying in the dungeons below – translates into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-of-hinterberg-the-final-preview"><u>a super enjoyable mix</u></a> of action-RPG and social sim gameplay. Its comic book-style visuals only enhanced the entire experience. This was a refreshing summer release in a season where we typically complain about the lack of interesting new games to play. But this year’s virtual summer trip to Europe to crush a bunch of monsters and collect loot while chatting with the locals about it at the pub afterwards proved to be just the kind of vacation we needed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/codblops6-1725926226920-1734501135279.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It may not be an Xbox exclusive, but Microsoft owns Call of Duty now, and the biggest first-person shooter franchise in the world bounced back in a big way this year. And Xbox owners did get to play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> on day one via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, so there’s that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More importantly, Treyarch, Raven, and the myriad Activision support studios that put in yeoman’s work on this series every year came together to craft the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review"><u>best single-player Call of Duty campaign</u></a> in years. Historically underrated developer Raven understood that the key to a great Call of Duty campaign is variety, and in Black Ops 6 you get to do all kinds of incredibly fun stuff, from going undercover at a casino to freely roaming an open-world desert to hobnobbing at a Bill Clinton fundraiser and so much more. Its story doesn’t quite punch you in the face with a twist as good as Black Ops 1’s JFK moment, but it’s a damn fine story nevertheless that positively reinforces the excellent and unpredictable campaign gameplay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Add in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review"><u>great, focused multiplayer mode</u></a> and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-review"><u>excellent return of Zombies</u></a>, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is one of the best overall gaming packages you can get in 2024.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/stalkerthumb-1723559698961-1734501135279.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> went through a literal version of Hell on Earth in order to get this deeply personal game about their home country of Ukraine made after Russia invaded it midway through development. That it got done at all is an incredible testament to their perseverance and human spirit, and how lucky we are that they did finish it, because <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review"><u>it is fantastic</u></a>. (Side note: the 90-minute documentary about the making of this game is an incredible human story that’s well worth watching. Find it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg620kmD6Dc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Xbox’s YouTube channel</u></a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This first-person shooter sequel mixes punishing survival gameplay with brutal combat in a brooding sci-fi atmosphere to create a gameplay loop that feels refreshingly old-school yet delightfully new and modern all at the same time. Though its initial launch was marred by a host of technical issues, its fixes and updates came so frequently that it’s impossible to hold its launch day against it. And if you’re just jumping in now, you’ll only ever see the current, more polished version of the Exclusion Zone. Enjoy playing in the world it creates, as its developers clearly did when building it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-blogroll-1732662931258-1734501135279.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-steam-reviews-collapse-to-overwhelmingly-negative-dev-admits-it-completely-underestimated-excitement-for-the-game"><u>rough takeoff put passengers in a sour mood</u></a>, but things quickly smoothed out as developer Asobo Studio reached cruising altitude with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review"><u>latest version</u></a> of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-review"><u>masterpiece</u></a> aviation simulator. The team somehow made Flight Simulator even more gorgeous, rendering an even more beautiful and realistic Earth than the one from 2021. They also added a lot more to do, from wildlife photo shoots to inconceivably dotting the in-game planet with every single helipad in the real world. Physics were improved, as were numerous other under-the-hood systems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In all, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> may not be a “game” for everyone (hence the “simulator” in the title), but what it sets out to do it does brilliantly. It is a love letter to anyone and everyone who loves aviation, in the same way that Forza Horizon 5 was a love letter to anyone who loved cars and driving.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/indianajones-xboxpc-performancereview-blogroll-1734193646590-1734501135278.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Lucasfilm chose wisely when partnering with MachineGames to make a AAA Indiana Jones video game. The talented studio revived and modernized Wolfenstein, and before that made one of the greatest licensed video games of all time and one of the best original Xbox games ever in The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. And so it is high praise when we say that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review"><u>best game</u></a> this group of developers has ever made – not to mention the best Indiana Jones <em>anything </em>since The Last Crusade, 35 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some gamers were skeptical when we found out back in January that Indy’s latest interactive adventure would be played primarily in first-person. But once everyone played it, MachineGames’s choice was quickly validated. The Great Circle completely immerses you as Indiana Jones, from the shadow of your fedora on a wall to the versatile whip in your hand to the leather jacket that squeaks as you walk – not to mention the absolutely S-tier performance of veteran voice actor Troy Baker, who completely disappears into the role of Indiana Jones and convinces your ears and brain that you’re somehow anachronistically listening to a 40-something Harrison Ford. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Great Circle has action, sure, but that action occurs as a complement to the real heart of it: adventure. Your whip can be used to stun enemies – or knock the gun out of their hands – but it’s mostly used for traversal as a makeshift rope to help you navigate the crypts, tombs, cities, and dig sites you’ll visit around the world. And the swelling orchestral score makes the big moments feel extra big, just as it did in the Indiana Jones movies. The writing is also spot-on, with humor being used to punctuate various scenes and make sure the tone always stays fun without ever getting too dark or serious. Oh, and you’ll be solving puzzles too. So, so many puzzles both big and small. And they’re all really enjoyable to figure out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle isn’t just the best Xbox game of the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-brings-back-the-magic-of-xbox-exclusives-unlocked-clips"><u>it’s the best game that Microsoft has shipped under any of its banners</u></a> since IGN’s 2021 overall Game of the Year winner, Forza Horizon 5. It’s a globe-trotting adventure-action romp that eschews shooting in favor of punching, puzzles, whips, quips, story, sidequests, and setpieces. It is brilliant, impossible to put down, and it plays unlike any other first-person game out there. It easily and deservedly wins IGN’s Best Xbox Game of 2024 award.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more discussion on all of your favorite Xbox games, don’t miss our weekly Xbox show, Podcast Unlocked.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout 2024, it felt as if a new amazin RPG was right around the corner at every moment. The year kicked off with a bang when Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth launched just before Persona 3 Reload showed us why the original is a timeless story. And we only had to wait until February to return to Final Fantasy VII when Rebirth expanded the horizons of a beloved classic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those may have been the headliners early in the year, but Unicorn Overlord worked its way into our hearts with its captivating art style and tactical depth, before Dragon’s Dogma 2 proved why the cult classic deserved a sequel. It was more than enough to hold us over until the big hitters like Metaphor: ReFantazio and Dragon Age: The Veilguard landed toward the end of the year, showing how two iconic RPG development teams can forge a new path in their own ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was an embarrassment of riches for the RPG sickos here at IGN, especially considering the aforementioned games weren’t the only RPGs that stuck with us throughout the year. We can only highlight a handful of them, however, so here’s our list of the best RPGs of 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best RPG of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Two RPGs from this year received an Honorable Mention, which we'd like to highlight before getting into our runner-up and winner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can spot a Vanillaware game from a mile away thanks to its painterly art style and expressive anime-inspired character designs. It's what gives Unicorn Overlord such a distinct fantasy aesthetic, but it’s the unique mix of real-time strategy and tactical gameplay that makes it stand out among a sea of great RPGs. Creating squads composed of different classes and deploying them strategically filled that Ogre Battle-sized void in our lives, and exploring the overworld to build up towns that join your cause brought all its mechanics together. Its story of political drama has intriguing twists and turns, but it’s the squad members we made along the way that left a lasting impression in Unicorn Overlord.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite it partly being a Hawaiian getaway for the crew from RGG Studio’s RPG debut Yakuza: Like A Dragon in 2020, the follow-up Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth was rather heavy. It’s an examination of family, legacy, and what you do with the time you have left. Series-long protagonist Kazuma Kiryu teaming up with his successor in Kasuga Ichiban made for a beautiful passing of the torch. I came for the detailed and nuanced recreation of Waikiki, but it’s the bittersweet and inspiring moments in Infinite Wealth that reminded us why there’s just nothing like the Yakuza franchise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Dragon’s Dogma 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/04/dd2-oo-ign-thumbnail-v1-1709594709352.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Many would consider the original Dragon’s Dogma from 2012 a cult classic for the ways it thrusts you into a harsh fantasy world with very little to guide you. And the sequel in Dragon's Dogma 2 did not forget that. Capcom didn’t sand off the edges, streamline systems, or make its dark world any more inviting, and that’s why it was able to stand out in 2024 despite being one of the biggest years for the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon’s Dogma 2 is all about its organic emergent moments. There is a main quest to follow, of course, but NPCs will tap you for sidequests and you never know what you run into along the way. Its mechanics may seem inelegant, but after giving it time, you realize how flexible and deep it is from a gameplay perspective, especially once you grasp how reactive the in-game physics are. The Pawn system adds another layer, letting you customize your own AI-controlled party members, or borrow members from others online to make the goofiest band of heroes. Dragon’s Dogma 2 is not a clean experience and it thrives off of a unique friction that’s tough to find in games these days. When you reflect on how much work you put into surviving in its massive and harsh world, the consequential world-altering events and its message are nothing short of awe-inspiring.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/05/ff7rebirth-vcms-1730774234294.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing Remake in 2020, it felt as if there were endless possibilities for what the rest of Final Fantasy VII would look like for a new generation. Stepping out into the Grasslands for the first time in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, when Aerith takes in the scenic view and shows excitement about a world worth fighting for, captures the exact feeling. The musical motifs played on our nostalgia and the recreation of its original world was undoubtedly impressive while evoking a sense of wistfulness – it felt like Final Fantasy VII grew up with us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have our qualms with how Rebirth ends and sets up part three in this remade trilogy, but that doesn’t necessarily define the entire game. Tucked within its reinvention of the existing story are moments that elevate beloved characters to feel like brand new heroes who’ve inspired us in new ways. Its open regions are a beautiful expansion of the original’s overworld, and they’re filled with things to do that are often more than just busy work – and don’t ask us about how many hours we sunk into the new card game Queen’s Blood. In many respects, Rebirth connected us to a world we thought we knew on a deeper level – it made for one of the year’s best RPGs and it has us incredibly eager for what’s next.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/da-1718021093156.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been 10 years since Dragon Age: Inquisition, and the way in which series fans were <em>thirsty </em>for anything related to Dragon Age in that time was wild to see. With a tumultuous development cycle, it’s kind of a miracle that The Veilguard exists at all, but it turned out to be a worthy successor and one of the best RPGs of the year. Through the lens of Rook, our new customizable protagonist, we get to pick up on the story of Solas that left us hanging from Inquisition and its DLC. Yet, The Veilguard was still able to establish a new direction that stayed true to the core concepts of a series so steeped in its own lore. Its warmer tone may not be what you remember from previous Dragon Age games, but you roll with a party full of bright personalities who create a sense of purpose reminiscent of the BioWare games of yore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat will be familiar for anyone who has played a modern action game without sacrificing the kind of depth you’d expect from an action-RPG. Every class feels great to play and retains a unique playstyle while being viable – which is important considering you only control Rook throughout the game. While your party members still play an important role in combat, it's their presence and where you stand with them that makes the journey worth seeing through. Either way, you’ll be treated to some great conclusions that show how The Veilguard carves its own path with confidence.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/28/metaphor-re-fantazio-key-art-1719595744252.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With a pedigree of the last three Persona games, I came into Metaphor: ReFantazio with high expectations, and even then, developer Atlus found a way to exceed them. To call it fantasy Persona isn’t necessarily inaccurate (and is a pretty good indication of what you’re getting into), but that would also undersell the nuances that make Metaphor the best RPG of the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using the context of a daily calendar system, Metaphor wields familiar mechanics to usher you through its fantasy political drama. Deciding how to spend your limited time makes those choices intriguing, whether it’s spending time with followers to level up bonds, explore dungeons for sidequests, or better yourself by increasing virtue stats – it’s the small moments like these that connect you to its world on the ground level. That’s the social sim element that leaves you naturally invested, and it gives its big moments more weight. So, when you see a character overcome their trauma or push themselves to do what’s right, it feels like it comes from a genuine place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than anything, Metaphor is the game of the moment. It doesn’t shy away from themes such as racism, inequality, religious extremism, and abuse of power and demonstrates an understanding of the material it's working with through a powerful story. Every character, every bond and follower, and every major story beat feeds into a thoughtful representation of our real world, showing us the ugliest parts of humanity but also what it takes to create a brighter future. Metaphor is very upfront about its message from beginning to end, and yet, what it says about the power of fiction might be the most inspiring part of it all. There’s just nothing like Metaphor: ReFantazio, and it represents the best of what games can offer, especially in 2024.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/alien-rogue-incursion-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the series most ripe for a virtual reality adaptation, few have greater potential than Alien. I mean, who aside from Ellen Ripley herself wouldn’t want to experience the thrill of being hunted by the perfect organism without that whole “risk of being dismembered” thing? Alien: Rogue Incursion is an admirable first attempt at delivering just that, with a compelling story, memorable characters, terrifying Xenomorphs, and a perfectly crafted world that couldn’t be mistaken for anything but the iconic Alien universe. There’s plenty of room to improve in its already-in-the-works sequel, however, especially when it comes to the simplistic combat, not-so-clever Xenomorphic foes, and occasional jankiness that could use some smoothing over. Even so, Rogue Incursion is a strong opening act for a series I’m already eager to play more of.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Alien: Rogue Incursion Gameplay Screenshots (PSVR 2)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve read the Alien comics, like Aliens: Defiance, then you’ll already be familiar with the badass protagonist whose boots you’ll be filling: Zula Hendricks. And if that name doesn’t ring a bell, Rogue Incursion does a great job of introducing you to her in short order so you don’t have to do any homework beforehand. An ex-colonial marine with a rough upbringing and chronic back problems, you’re sent to a classically deserted planet overrun by the most evil creatures imaginable, and accompanied by your trusty synthetic companion, Davis – don’t worry, he’s reformed, and not the type to betray you to please his corporate overlords… anymore. What follows is an extremely formulaic Alien tale that apes all the same beats for which the series is known, but thanks to interesting dialogue, great characters, and a relatively short runtime that doesn’t overstay its welcome, that familiarity doesn’t end up being such a bad thing. Zula and her relationship with her robot bestie is genuinely touching, oftentimes offsetting an otherwise relentlessly bleak situation, and the story has a few twists in store and an ending that sets up a sequel nicely.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zula's relationship with her robot bestie is genuinely touching.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the eight-hour story, you’ll tiptoe through the dark corridors and frozen wastes of a forgotten colony world while looking over your shoulder every few seconds for those eye-free freak shows that are never far off, and then painting the walls with their acidic blood whenever one pops out of a vent or sneaks up behind you. Going through each area slowly and doing your best to keep quiet can keep them off your back for slightly longer, but since ammo isn’t particularly scarce and Xenomorphs aren’t all that hard to kill on anything but the hardest difficulty, I found that running through areas and getting things done quickly could work just as well, so long as you’re up for a slightly more regular fight. And, of course, you’ll have to solve complicated engineering problems in a world where every piece of technology breaks as soon as a Xenomorph so much as looks at it, and then makes as much noise as possible anytime you try to troubleshoot, just in case those aliens in the next room over hadn’t heard you yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is rather simple, in that 95% of the time you’ll be attacked by Xenomorphs who climb out of vents seemingly installed for the explicit purpose of helping them get around, pull out one of your three weapons to make short work of them, and then move on. These encounters are divided nearly equally into either exciting sections that have some kind of unique tension or twist, and completely monotonous annoyances. For example, finding yourself cornered by a trio of Xenos and frantically trying to reload your weapon before you’re toast is extremely memorable, and setting traps as you hold off an onslaught of double-jawed monsters while performing IT support for some broken communications relays is an action-packed good time. But then you’ll go a long stretch of walking down some of the same hallways you’ve visited already, stopping every 30 seconds to kill a few monsters that run straight at you, completely devoid of any kind of intelligent attack strategy, then carefully reload your weapons before moving on and repeating the process moments later. These sections tend to make combat feel pretty mundane, and take away a lot of the initial fear when confronting a Xenomorph, which begin to feel quite commonplace after the first couple hours.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Initially scary Xenomorphs can soon begin to feel commonplace.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably the weakest part of combat is your limited and mostly unremarkable arsenal, which consists of a pulse rifle, a pump-action shotgun, and a six-shooter revolver. The pulse rifle, an automatic weapon that’s usually the most overall reliable choice for a variety of situations, is really the only weapon that feels recognizable in the Alien universe, while the shotgun and revolver seem oddly generic and low-tech for a sci-fi setting. Your only other tools are proximity grenades that can be set to go off when an alien draws near and a motion scanner that you won’t need to use very often, since Xenomorphs loudly scurry about and hiss at you to announce their presence most of the time. These items feel pretty par for the course for VR shooters, with little to set them apart. It’s also a bit weird that you don’t have a last resort melee weapon to fall back on, so if a facehugger jumps on your head, you’d better hope you can get your pistol pointed at an awkward angle to kill it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is an Alien game, so perhaps unsurprisingly, the enemy variety isn’t very strong either. You’ll go at least several hours before seeing a single enemy that isn’t a Xenomorph, and even when you do, it’ll be a facehugger or two before going right back to more Xenos. The good news is that these aliens can be pretty intimidating foes, killing in just a hit or two and rushing at you by crawling on walls, leaping great distances, and moving erratically to make them hard to pin down. Unfortunately, despite their best effort, their menacing appearance doesn’t always translate to them being particularly crafty foes, and after you’ve learned their small bag of tricks in the first hour or two, they begin to feel downright dim as they mozy on out through a vent before pausing in front of you for a few seconds, giving you ample time to score the kill while they stand in place helplessly. Between the first Alien movie’s depiction of the Xenomorph as an all-powerful monstrosity that can scarcely be beaten, and the second movie’s tendency to blast through dozens of the creatures within the span of a few minutes, Rogue Incursion certainly finds itself in the latter camp.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Alien Recommendations</h3><p>If you love Ridley Scott's pessimistic galaxy filled with things that want to kill you, here are my top recommendations!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It also suffers from minor, but noteworthy enough to be annoying, bugs. Sometimes characters will repeat the same lines of dialogue multiple times in a row, Xenomorphs will move through objects in bizarre ways, and your controls aren’t always as precise and responsive as you’d hope when you’re staring down a room full of facehuggers. None of these issues are particularly troublesome, but they do add a slight lack of polish that I hope they’ll work on for the sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And while this isn’t the fault of Alien: Rogue Incursion alone, one especially annoying PSVR 2 issue that felt like a particular problem here is that the little PlayStation logo buttons are a tad too easy to hit, especially when you’re clamoring for your handgun after a Xenomorph surprises you. Most of the times I died were due to a menu popping up at exactly the wrong moment, sending me scrambling to back out before I was killed, which I was rarely successful at. That added an extra level of stress in the wrong kind of way. Again, this is a controller design problem at the end of the day, but it came up enough here that there really ought to be some built-in protection against it – maybe make me hold the menu button down for a second or two before you cause me to get impaled on an alien’s tail, guys?</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Alien: Rogue Incursion is a faithful and entertaining stab at bringing Alien to virtual reality. The excellent story, spot-on Alien environments, and creepy Xenomorphs keep the horrifying times going throughout its eight-hour duration, even when repetitive combat, predictable AI, and the odd bug here and there make it clear this is the first attempt that it is. But while there’s plenty of room for this budding series to grow, I can already happily recommend Rogue Incursion as a strong proof of concept to Alien fans and newcomers alike – one that’s left me eagerly awaiting part two.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
