In this instance, however, the song in question is already a mega hit that has inspired a global meme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skrilla's 6 7 blew up earlier this year on TikTok and Instagram. It's a slang term referring to gun violence but became popular when it began appearing in clips about basketball players like LaMelo Ball, who is 6ft 7 inches tall. It then went viral when a boy known as the 67 Kid used it in a meme, and now kids the world over are saying it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/gettyimages-2240370184-1760434164118.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Skrilla spilled the beans on 6 7 appearing in GTA 6.

Yeah, 6 7 is on there. I’m going to be my own person on there, playing my own music."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has yet to announce any songs appearing in GTA 6, and it no-doubt won't until its good and ready. But Skrilla, at least, sounds convinced 6 7 is in there, and you'd like to think he'd know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time GTA 6 song talk has hit the internet. In July, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/travis-scott-is-either-teasing-hes-in-gta-6-with-his-new-music-video-for-2000-excursion-or-its-just-an-easter-egg">Travis Scott’s music video for '2000 Excursion' set tongues wagging after fans spotted what looked like a reference to GTA 6</a>. That sparked speculation that that Travis Scott was set to appear in GTA 6 in some way, either with his own radio station (as celebs have done in previous GTA games) or as a character we see in the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Faheem Rashad Najm, better-known as singer-songwriter T-Pain, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/t-pain-confirms-hes-working-on-gta-6-gta-5-nopixel">confirmed that he's contributing to GTA 6</a> (in the course of bringing T-Pain aboard, it seems that Rockstar requested he stop role-playing on NoPixel, a popular GTA 5 role-play server that runs on third-party servers).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do, of course, know at least one band that <em>won't</em> be appearing in the game. A founding member of British synth-pop band Heaven 17 alleged <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rock-star-tells-rockstar-to-go-f-yourself-after-extremely-low-offer-to-use-hit-song-in-gta-6"><u>Rockstar offered the three writers of hit song Temptation $7,500 each for its use in Grand Theft Auto 6 — a figure that was flat out rejected</u></a>. Founding member Martyn Ware tweeted to tell Rockstar to “go f*** yourself” after allegedly receiving what he called an “extremely low” offer to use 80s classic Temptation in GTA 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-development-began-in-earnest-in-2020-following-the-massive-success-of-red-dead-redemption-2-take-two-says"><u>Development of GTA 6 began “in earnest” in 2020</u></a> following the success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2"><u>Red Dead Redemption 2</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A swathe of upcoming Pokémon game projects have seemingly been detailed online, via the latest release of material originating from the so-called "Teraleak" of data hacked from the servers of series developer Game Freak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cache of information, which includes development plans, concept art and early screenshots, was revealed overnight following the disclosure yesterday of data obtained in the hack that pertained to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, which launches this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-year-on-from-the-teraleak-hackers-release-pokmon-legends-z-a-files-including-gameplay-videos-showing-cut-content-and-early-builds">IGN reported yesterday</a>, the suggestion is that the hacker behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-stolen-data-on-unannounced-games-as-well-as-nintendo-switch-2-codename-leaked-online">last year's Game Freak breach</a> has sat on this latest cache of data for almost a year, until Pokémon Legends: Z-A's launch. But now, it seems, the floodgates are open for everything else obtained from Game Freak detailing the franchise's future — and its product roadmap for the rest of the decade.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The largest cache of information relates to the franchise's highly-anticipated "Gen 10" games that are expected to launch next year, in time for Pokémon's 30th anniversary. Details now being shared online include the titles' planned name, early animation tests, in-engine footage and word of several planned gameplay ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this, there's information relating to a separate, ambitious-sounding Pokémon MMO project, as well as concept art for a third Pokémon Legends spin-off title. And beyond that, there's the suggestion that Pokémon's Gen 11 will follow at the start of the next decade. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a frankly astonishing leak of information, seemingly from the same source which yesterday revealed details derived from beta builds of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and last year leaked a vast treasure trove of development data on pretty much every previous Pokémon project launched to date.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon fans are already poring over the purported plans and discussing several eye-opening gameplay mechanics. There's even early fan art for a new Pokémon species spotted in one of the new pieces of conceprt art. But it's worth pointing out that some or indeed much of what has been shared may not ultimately come to pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As yesterday's Pokémon Legends: Z-A beta build leak showed, gameplay features get cut in development. And nothing in the Teraleak can be relied upon as reflecting Game Freak's current plans — as the hack itself took place back in August 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo previously attempted to track down the culprit behind the Teraleak, and launched a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-requests-subpoena-of-discord-to-track-down-user-behind-last-years-pokemon-teraleak">legal bid to subpoena Discord</a> to divulge the hackers' identity back in April this year.

The game now pauses when the controller disconnects, which is an important safety net for such an intense game.

There's a fairly wide variety of piece counts, from 300 to 3000, but I mostly stuck to 1000-piece puzzles here as they are the most popular whenever I've covered a puzzle sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are looking for some suggestions for what to buy, the Spider-Verse puzzle from Buffalo games has been on our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">best puzzles for adults</a> for over a year now. It's got a ton of different Spideys and is consistently one of the most popular marvel puzzles out there. There's also the Disney &amp; Pixar Shop puzzle from Ravensburger that offers something similar for fans of Disney instead of Marvel. There's a bunch of characters and easter eggs hidden in each one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd also recommend checking out The Drippy Trip puzzle. It's the latest puzzle made by The Magic Puzzle Company and actually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-series-five-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzle-features-art-from-an-adventure-time-designer">features a few fun secrets</a> from the popular cartoon Adventure Time. If you aren't familiar with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzles">Magic Puzzle Company Puzzles</a>, they are a mix between jigsaw puzzle and magic kit and are generally very popular with families.
