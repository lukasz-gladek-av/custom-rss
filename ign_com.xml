            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">At Gen Con 2025, Disney Lorcana celebrated its two-year anniversary in a big way by revealing A Goofy Movie and Iconic Mickey and Minnie cards headed to the Fabled expansion, details on Whispers in the Well, Winterspell, and Toy Story cards, and even a brand-new set of Disney Lorcana puzzles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a lot to look forward to in the ever-expanding world of Disney Lorcana, and you can check out all the latest news and cards below!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fabled's Iconic Mickey and Minnie Cards Are the Stars of This Expansion Alongside A Goofy Movie</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana - Fabled</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fabled is set to be released at local card shops on August 25 and everywhere else on September 5, and one of the biggest new additions it brings to Disney Lorcana is Iconic cards. These are even rarer than Enchanted and feature full alternate artwork, unique foil pattern, and foil hot-stamped text and stats. Kicking off this new rarity will be Minnie Mouse - Sweetheart Princess and Mickey Mouse - Brave Little Prince.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cards not only look great, but they also complete a picture when placed together. Furthermore, Minnie's Royal Favor adds Support to any Mickey Mouse cards, meaning their love for each other will also help you in-game!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new rarity being added with Fabled will be Epic, which are rarer than Legendary but more common than Enchanted, and one of these new cards will be A Goofy Movie's Stand Out. A Goofy Movie's arrival in Lorcana was long-requested, and Stand Out will celebrate this moment alongside Powerline - World's Greatest Rock Star and I2I.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dumbo is also getting some love in the new Fabled set, as Dumbo - The Flying Elephant, and Timothy T. Mouse - Flight Instructor will be just two of the card players that will be able to seek out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will also be a handful of promo cards to look out for in Fabled, including Alice - Accidentally Adrift (Buy a Box Promo), Cursed Merfolk - Usula's Handiwork (Weekly Play Promo), Sisu - Daring Visitor (Weekly Play Promo), Strength of Raging Fire (Weekly Play Promo), and The Queen - Conceited Ruler (Pre-Release Promo).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, Maleficent in her dragon form will be featured as Fabled's Set Championship, meaning there will be cards and play mats available to those who can win at tournaments held throughout the year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Collection Starter Set and Elsa Gift Box Are Made for Collectors and Newcomers</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana Collection Starter Set and Elsa Gift Set</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking for even more ways to celebrate their love of Disney Lorcana or jump in for the first time, the Collection Starter Set and Elsa Gift Box will be worth a look when they launch on October 3, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Collection Starter Set will cost $29.99 and will include a 4-pocket card portfolio featuring Mickey Mouse - Brave Little Tailor artwork, which had previously only been used at Disney Lorcana Challenge. There will also be a "Glimmer Foil" Tinker Bell - Giant Fairy promo card, four Fabled booster packs, and a Collector's Guide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elsa Gift Box, on the other hand, will also cost $29.99, and it will come with five Booster packs, one "Glimmer Foil" Elsa - The Fifth Spirit promo card, one storage box, and three punch-out card dividers.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Whispers in the Well Will Feature Zootopia's Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana - Whispers in the Well</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whispers in the Well is the next set after Fabled and will have its pre-release on November 7 and official release on November 14. For Disney Lorcana lore hunters, this set will introduce Whispers, which are partially-formed Glimmers that we'll encounter in the "depths of the Great illuminary." To find these Whispers, certain detective Glimmers like Mickey Mouse, Judy Hopps, and Nick Wilde will need to lend their expertise to the cause.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We were given a look at a few of the Zootopia cards that will be part of Whispers in the Well, including Judy Hopps - Uncovering Clues, Nick WIlde - Persistent Investigator, and Putting It All Together. The Deck and Booster Pack art was also revealed, and they feature such characters as Daisy, Demona, Gaston, Simba, Megara, Judy Hopps, and Robin Hood.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winterspell Promises 'Flurries of Fun' With Stitch, Angel, and More</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/stitch-1753964680733.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Q1 2026, Disney Lorcana will be releasing Winterspell, a new expansion that promises "Flurries of Fun." We don't know too much about this set yet, but the art you can see above features Stitch and Angel, and they appear to be in a tropical setting that is covered in snow! </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Toy Story to Arrive in Disney Lorcana in Q2 2026</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As one final surprise, the team at Disney Lorcana revealed Toy Story characters will be joining the TCG in Q2 2026. The only info we have is from a piece of artwork that features both Woody and Buzz on a seemingly alien planet. More details will be shared in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Disney Lorcana Puzzles From Ravensburger Feature Original Art from the TCG</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana Puzzles from Ravensburger</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Lorcana is venturing into the world of puzzles as it will be presenting six 1,000-piece puzzles from Ravensburger - one for each Ink color, that will feature original art from the TCG and each will even come with a Disney Mickey Mouse - True Friend promo card. These puzzles will cost $29.99 each in the US and Canada and will be released on September 1, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can check out the Amber, Emerald, Ruby, and Sapphire puzzles in the slideshow above, and there are still two - Amethyst and Steel - that have yet to be revealed.

YouTube livestreams and videos of this feat have drawn attention to the event, and the benefits that gaming can give players, regardless of their age.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with Japanese news site <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/13/154970.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game*Spark</u></a>, the tournament’s winner, Yoshie Murabe revealed that she chose to main Panda purely for the reason that she likes the animal. Murabe picked the pink version of the character; however, opponents should not be fooled by this cute appearance. Murabe’s winning bout shows her taking good advantage of Panda’s slow yet powerful attacks, giving her the edge over her opponent Sadayuki Kato, who picked King as his fighter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Murabe revealed that Tekken 8 is the first video game she has played in her life and that she really enjoyed her tournament debut. Asked about her feelings while playing games and whether she found anything difficult, Murabe’s answer is equally badass: "I'm happy I won. I didn't find anything particularly difficult." She added that she'd really like to try playing other games competitively too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/screenshot-2025-07-31-151536-1753971354672.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">73-year-old Panda main Yoshie Murabe won the Tekken 8 tournament.

It was founded in 2019 to give elderly citizens in Japan a new way to engage with others during the pandemic. They started out with slow-paced video game versions of board games like Shogi and Othello, but then decided to shake things up by adding Tekken 8 into the mix, starting with the 9th edition of the tournament.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/13/154970.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game*Spark</u></a>’s interview with the Care eSports Association's PR rep Shimpei Hama, this came about due to his background as a pro Tekken 8 player (he is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ouiuUxYqxlHBi6GAtgTuA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rox3Gaming’s Hama-chan</u></a>). He decided it would be interesting to see how the seniors got on with Tekken 8. Hama said the elderly residents, some of whom have dementia, reported that they really enjoyed it. Many became attached to their characters, showing determination to win at least once, with some staying up late to practice in the run-up to tournaments. He also thanked the carers for their hard work in introducing their residents to video games and the concept of online tournaments. “None of this would have been possible without the dependable cooperation of the staff onsite,” Hama noted.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/screenshot-2025-07-31-151832-1753971530210.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yoshie started strong.

However the recent 11th tournament is the first time it has been played competitively by care home residents. Livestreams and videos of the matches were posted on Care eSports Association's official YouTube channel, attracting attention online. Acknowledging the views, Hama noted, “We received way more feedback than ever before,” with voice actors and streamers among those who praised the event. Champion Yoshie Murabe is actually one of the younger participants in the tournament — there was also a <a href="https://youtu.be/3j-MdwkihME?si=ZbAHEgi2p2RchJhg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>fast-paced match between two 93-year-old women playing as Lili and Steve</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the process of introducing Tekken 8 to the Amigo Club Cup, Hama realized that "care home residents are more interested in video games than I thought." He said they plan to continue to offer Shogi and Othello, but would also like to add other fighting games, as well as "games that everyone can enjoy more casually — something like Geoguessr." He noted that some residents were not keen on the idea of fighting in a game. Geoguessr, a non-violent Google Maps deduction game, would be a good way to engage more residents and help them to keep their brains sharp. At the moment, Care eSports Association’s activities are limited to three Japanese prefectures but they eventually aim to hold a national tournament (source: <a href="https://careesports.com/careesports/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Care eSports official website</u></a>).</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/screenshot-2025-07-31-152225-1753971751223.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yoshie ended up victorious.
