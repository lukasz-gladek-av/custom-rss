            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-adds-rares-game-boy-platformer-donkey-kong-land<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-land">Donkey Kong Land</a> is out now for Nintendo Switch Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rare’s 1995 Game Boy platformer is available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription for the Switch, and joins a growing list of classic Game Boy games available to download and play. Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/nintendo-switch-online">all the games available on Nintendo Switch Online here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Land offers a condensed version of the side-scrolling gameplay in Rare’s much loved 1994 SNES classic Donkey Kong Country, with different level design and boss fights. As you’d expect, it stars Donkey Kong and his nephew Diddy Kong, who team up to defeat King K. Rool and collect many, many bananas.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1859764097480355961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The game did well enough to get three sequels: Donkey Kong Land 2 (1996), based on Diddy's Kong Quest; Donkey Kong Land 3 (1997), based on Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!; and a Game Boy Color version of Donkey Kong Country (2000).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Cranky Kong doesn't think Donkey Kong has proven himself to be a hero yet. So, he decides to work out a deal with the closest villain that he knows. K. Rool and his baddies have hidden bananas in new places across Donkey Kong Island in another attempt to outwit the best-friend duo. And the only response is for Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong to go off on another adventure!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Boy launched in 1989 with the likes of Super Mario Land, Tetris, Baseball, and Alleyway, all of which are now on Nintendo Switch Online. Other Game Boy games on the service include Metroid 2 – Return of Samus, Kirby’s Dream Land, Super Mario Land 2 – 6 Golden Coins, The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening DX, and Wario in Wario Land 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Donkey Kong, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, a remake of the Nintendo Wii original that was also ported to Nintendo 3DS, launches on Switch in January. Last week's Super Nintendo World Direct offered fans their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-nintendo-world-direct-reveals-donkey-kong-country-opening-date-while-offering-a-teasing-glimpse-of-its-rollercoaster">long-awaited first look at the new Donkey Kong Country-themed expansion</a> while announcing it will officially open December 11, 2024 in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
