Among the other retailers selling physical copies of FromSoftware's critically acclaimed and best-selling RPG, that's the best price you can get by far. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only other in the UK that comes close is <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wXO5b?object_uuid=eeed9564-dcfa-4465-acf9-74d197c63e82&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Argos</a>, selling most of the same versions for £21.99, but you have to pay at least £3.95 extra for home delivery—making the actual total £25.98 if you don't fancy the free store collection option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Elden Rings' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC still being enjoyed by plenty of players in the FromSoft community, even being a GOTY nominee at the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-winners-the-full-list">Game Awards 2024</a>, there's never been a better time for newcomers to get on board and become a Tarnished in the Lands Between for themselves. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a PlayStation player who still uses both a PS4 and PS5, we'd recommend buying the PS4 version, since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> is one of those early-gen games that still has a free upgrade to the PS5 included, while the base PlayStation 5 version in the white case does not. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the event you were planning to double-dip and play Shadow of the Erdtree whilst diving into base Elden Ring, the titular Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Edition has its own deals with different retailers—the PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S editions are <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wXO5p?object_uuid=eeed9564-dcfa-4465-acf9-74d197c63e82&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">£39.99 at HMV</a> while the latter is available for a mere <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YW5k?object_uuid=eeed9564-dcfa-4465-acf9-74d197c63e82&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">£37.99 at Smyths</a>. The PS5 version was also £37.99 at Smyths, but, at the time of writing, was out of stock.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aR3OWO?object_uuid=eeed9564-dcfa-4465-acf9-74d197c63e82&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Store</a> &amp; <a href="https://zdcs.link/a0n4Gr?object_uuid=eeed9564-dcfa-4465-acf9-74d197c63e82&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Games Store</a>, the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is still £32.99 and £34.99 respectively. So, by purchasing this complete edition of Elden Ring for just under £40, you'll save up to an extra £18.95 compared to buying the base version from The Game Collection and purchasing the DLC later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.
