            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon franchise has begun its 30th anniversary celebrations with the reveal of a special new logo, an animation featuring Fat Pikachu, and the promise of more to share in less than two months' time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2026 is the 30th anniversary of Pokémon, which began its path to world domination with the Japanese launch of Pokémon Red and Pokémon Green back on the Game Boy three decades ago. (The series then arrived in the USA two years' later, launching with Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the clock ticked over to January 1, 2026 in Pokémon's home region of Japan, the brand began its celebrations with the reveal of a new 30th Anniversary Pokémon logo featuring Pikachu, introduced by none other than Fat Pikachu — the mascot's far plumper original design that's now rarely glimpsed in official Pokémon media. Here he is in action:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ポケモン30周年、はじまる！<br>『ポケットモンスター 赤・緑』の発売から30年。<br>2026年2月27日（金）にポケモンは30周年を迎えるよ。<br>今年は最高の1年になる予感！<br>お楽しみに！<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B1%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B330%E5%91%A8%E5%B9%B4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ポケモン30周年</a> <a href="https://t.co/iPXR83Ib66" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/iPXR83Ib66</a></p>— ポケモン公式 (@Pokemon_cojp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/2006379822012911872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Pokémon 30th Anniversary, Here We Go!" the brand wrote in a post on social media. "30 years since the release of Pokémon Red and Green. On February 27, 2026 (Friday), Pokémon turns 30. We have a feeling this year is going to be the best one yet! Look forward to it!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expectations for this year's celebrations are sky high, following last year's so-called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-teraleak-reveals-unannounced-games-seemingly-laying-out-franchises-major-releases-through-2030">Teraleak of Pokémon game development data</a> that spilled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-year-on-from-the-teraleak-hackers-release-pokmon-legends-z-a-files-including-gameplay-videos-showing-cut-content-and-early-builds">various details of the franchise's highly-anticipated 10th generation of games</a>. Alongside a fresh roster of new creatures, fans expect these titles to feature new gameplay mechanics and procedurally-generated areas for the first time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">2026 will also see the launch of promising-looking Pokémon life simulation spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, which arrives exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 on March 5. A blend of Pokémon characters with gameplay more similar to Animal Crossing, the game seems likely to find success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More details on all of that are expected to arrive on the brand's big 30th anniversary, now less than two months' away on February 27. While not formally confirmed just yet, this date has now become the annual date fans expect to sit down and watch a new Pokémon Presents, the company's Nintendo Direct-style announcements showcase. There's not long to go now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

While the holiday season may officially be over, that doesn’t mean there aren't some epic deals still to be found. In fact, some titles have dropped back down to their lowest prices ever, or in at least one case, are seeing their deepest discount yet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aA81M4?object_uuid=f01736b3-356b-449f-b819-7e98fbd98408&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</u></a>, the Standard Edition for either PS5 or Xbox Series X, is only $29.99 today at Best Buy. That’s 57% savings. Anyone who's been debating grabbing a copy of the latest Assassin’s Creed main title will want to jump at these awesome savings while you still can. Unfortunately, you won’t see these discounts for the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game, which just came out in December.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save 57% on Assassin’s Creed Shadows for PS5 and Xbox Series X</h2><div id="234040" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="b9ebedfb-8fde-41ed-8686-195a81128075"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows Standard Edition - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><div catalogid="b9ebedfb-8fde-41ed-8686-195a81128075" id="234041"><div id="234041" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows Standard Edition - Xbox Series X</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in March 2025, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the newest mainline entry in the AC franchise. This massive open-world RPG is set in Sengoku-period Japan. And it switches things up this time with two playable protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke. Naoe delivers that nimble, stealth-like gameplay for the classic Assassin’s Creed familiarity, while Yasuke brings more of that heavy-combat, samurai action with a major focus on weapons and armour. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN writer Jarrett Green had a chance to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review"><u>review Assassin’s Creed Shadows</u></a>, giving it high marks, with an impressive 8/10 score. Green even went on to say, “By sharpening the edges of its existing systems, Assassin’s Creed Shadows creates one of the best versions of the open-world style it’s been honing for the last decade.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you’ve never played any Assassin’s Creed, the story of this game remains relatively self-contained, while fans will still find plenty of lore. But be sure to grab the game now, as this Best Buy deal, which takes $40 off the price tag, is set to expire today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Danielle is a Tech freelance writer based in Los Angeles who spends her free time creating videos and geeking out over music history. </p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 2, 2026 3:31 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/today-only-assassins-creed-shadows-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-is-nearly-60-off]]></content:encoded>

On January 1st, a further 11 were shifted, with prices ranging between $180 and $364.50. And now, dozens more copies have been listed for sale — with prices currently around the $300-$400 mark or even higher.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Why the sudden rush to buy boxed copies of a Star Wars racing game for PlayStation 4 that launched back in 2019? Well, Racer Revenge's code is reportedly crucial to fire off a new method of jailbreaking PlayStation 5 — essentially unlocking the ability to play illegally pirated games — when the game's physical disc is present.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn't to say that every copy sold or up for sale on eBay will be bought by someone who's definitely going to do this.

This area hosts a series of bosses that are designed to provide some of the toughest challenges in the hit role-playing game, though they still shouldn't take the average endgame player anywhere near eight hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Only reason it took me this long is because I haven't properly built Verso for damage in the millions yet," Recordbreaks admitted, saying his squad was still around level 80. "He was doing maybe 200,000 damage per hit and that's if Roulette was working in my favor which it wasn't most of the time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some fans have said Recordbreaks could simply have quit the battle, sorted their build then restarted, the vast majority of fans are praising the player for putting in an actual work shift's worth of time to beat the boss anyway. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Most surreal of all, however? Throughout the whole battle, Recordbreaks avoided dodging to the point where not a single successful dodge is recorded, opting instead for the tougher option to parry attacks every time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"22 parries a minute, pretty much one parry every three seconds," one fan noted, after doing the math. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Bro that's a full-time job spent for that boss and 10k parries damn," admired xXxZeroTwoxXx. "Congrats bud."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Why? Cuz I felt like it," Recordbreaks replied, when asked the reason for their perseverance. "How? With sheer will and determination. What's wrong with me?
