You’ll get to use the character realtor, play the story trial, and complete the Slay Doshaguma Quest. Capcom said those who played the first beta can transfer their character to the second beta, and then onto the full game release. Game progress, however, does not carry forward, but those who take part in the test get special bonuses that can be redeemed in the full game, including a decorative charm for your weapon or Seikret, and an item pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom warned fans that improvements it has already announced are set for the full release will not make it into the second open beta. This includes performance improvements, balance changes, weapon mechanics, and other known issues.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds’ second open beta goes live February 6 at 7pm PT, and runs until February 9 at 6.59pm PT. If you miss out on that, don’t worry: another beta weekend is set for the following weekend (February 13 to 16). Monster Hunter Wilds then launches proper on February 28.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-exclusive-oilwell-basin-ajarakan-and-rompopolo-gameplay-ign-first">Monster Hunter Wilds is the subject of the latest IGN First</a>, which kicked off with two brand new videos featuring gameplay of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Ajarakan"><u>Ajarakan</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Rompopolo"><u>Rompopolo</u></a> on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Oilwell_Basin"><u>Oilwell Basin</u></a> map. We visited Capcom’s offices in Japan, where we played the first five hours or so of Monster Hunter Wilds, and exclusively faced a few Oilwell Basin local monsters. Look out for more gameplay throughout January, along with in-depth interviews, fun details, and a final preview for Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
