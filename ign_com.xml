The latter is up to $4 thanks to synergy with the Blue Blur, with the card giving other creatures with counters flying and haste.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That becomes a nice cycle of triggering an attack with Sonic, adding counters to other creatures, and then having them get flying and haste. Then, you can turn that into Treasure tokens, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to try this combo, have fun - <a href="https://zdcs.link/985MAR?object_uuid=6c2f0190-76ef-4c45-9957-ad805ccd01b2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Sonic is just $3 right now</u></a>, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgm8l?object_uuid=6c2f0190-76ef-4c45-9957-ad805ccd01b2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Winged Hive Tyrant</u></a> is on the climb but still under $5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Developer "focused on making the game as [optimized] as possible for default users."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> doesn't have ray-tracing, and its developer has said there are no plans to add the feature down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While ray-tracing has been notably missing from Battlefield 6's open beta tests, it wasn't entirely clear if this was just because the game was in beta or if it was a deliberate choice. Turns out, it's the latter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being a popular inclusion in some games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-ray-tracing"><u>ray-tracing's more natural method of simulating lighting</u></a> can also prove to be draining on your PC or console's system resources — and it's for this reason that the competitive shooter won't include it. Indeed, Christian Buhl — studio technical director at Ripple Effect, one of the studios working on Battlefield 6 — has told <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-bf6-no-ray-tracing-pc-version/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Comicbook</u></a> that while the PC version of Battlefield 6 will have over 600 different options in its settings menu, "ray-tracing won’t be one of them and there’s no plans to bring it into the game in the near future."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“No, we are not going to have ray-tracing when the game launches and we don’t have any plans in the near future for it either,” Buhl said. “That was because we wanted to focus on performance. We wanted to make sure that all of our effort was focused on making the game as [optimized] as possible for the default settings and the default users. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, we just made the decision relatively early on that we just weren’t going to do ray-tracing and again, it was mostly so that we could focus on making sure it was performance for everyone else."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While most people would likely sacrifice visuals to preserve performance during multiplayers mode, this may be disappointing news for some players who'd hoped to have ray-tracing in Battlefield 6's upcoming single-player campaign, when the time comes to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, we highlighted a nine-minute slice of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6s-battle-royale-footage-has-leaked-heres-what-it-shows-us"><u>Battlefield 6's battle royale mode that has leaked online</u></a>. This particular video not only gives a good look at what to expect from the mode, but also reveals a couple of gameplay mechanics we didn't previously know about, too, including swimming, one of the gadgets, and its "massive map."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 releases on October 7.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Coming September 4, whatever it is.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> developer CD Projekt has issued a bizarre in-universe tease — with a date set for September 4, later this week. The message has since prompted an array of fan theories — and debates over the franchise's canon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This afternoon, a message for New United States of America (N.U.S.A.) citizens posted by President Rosalind Myers appeared on the game's social media channels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dated September 4, 2025, three days from now, the post asks for "brave netruners" to help defend the N.U.S.A. from a "mounting cybersecurity threat" by taking some kind of recruitment test. What exactly this all means, however, has left fans uncertain. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, some fans are wondering whether the message — which of course in reality has come from CD Projekt Red — has gone live several days early, and whether it was meant to point to some kind of early sign-up for information on Cyberpunk 2. Or maybe the message is appearing now to trail something happening on September 4, and this is the start of some kind of ARG?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's the fact that, well, this is an in-universe message from President Rosalind Myers — who doesn't become president until 2065. (As Cyberpunk fans have quickly pointed out, the current president should be Elizabeth Kress.) Has Myers figured out how to send a message back in time? Is this a retconning of the franchise's established lore? Or is this simply just a fun message from CD Projekt that fans shouldn't be reading this much into? Well, if it's the latter, it's already too late.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on the Cyberpunk <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1n5plxz/important_message_for_nusa_citizens_from/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, fan speculation on what to expect later this week ranges from details of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077-codename-orion">Cyberpunk 2</a>, more information on the already-announced Cyberpunk 2077 iPhone port, fresh news on the new anime spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2">Edgerunners 2</a>, or yet more content for Cyberpunk 2077 — which is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/despite-laying-off-270-staff-development-studio-virtuos-remains-fully-committed-to-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-cyberpunk-2077-and-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">still being worked on by support studio Virtuos</a>, even as the bulk of CD Projekt knuckles down on The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk's sequel.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Important message for N.U.S.A.

Citizens September 4, 2025</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Our great nation is once again facing a mounting cybersecurity threat — from those who hide in the shadows, too cowardly to publicly proclaim their beliefs, who are viciously determined to tear down our flag and the values it upholds. I will not accept this, and I know you won't either. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The N.U.S.A. is seeking brave netrunners to join our efforts and overcome this grave threat. Our brave agents work tirelessly to keep our country secure, maintain its dominance, and defend it from those so eager to undermine it. Now you can join us in our fight for freedom. I personally welcome all who believe they have what it takes. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Take our recruitment test. Prove yourself. Serve the N.U.S.A. </strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have pointed to the fact that Cyberpunk 2's associate game director Paweł Sasko has also shared the post, suggesting this has indeed gone live at the right time and is pointing to something to do with the game series itself. Others have also noted that Cyberpunk 2077 is, somehow, already approaching its fifth anniversary in December — a milestone CD Projekt may now be planning to celebrate in some fashion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Contacted for more detail by IGN this afternoon, CD Projekt declined to comment on what might be in store. Here's hoping later this week brings more answers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

First Light is the first chapter of this story, and will showcase an origin tale for an all-new original Bond incarnation unrelated to any specific book or film incarnation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Previously, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak explained how the studio would be keeping costs managable over the course of the Bond trilogy by building on each game in sequence, without unecessary expense — such as by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/io-interactives-secret-to-developing-james-bond-007-first-light-is-literally-down-the-pan">not producing multiple new toilets</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A previous look at the game, during a PlayStation State of Play broadcast back in June, left fans certain that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-bond-fans-think-theyve-worked-out-secret-identity-of-007-first-light-actor">Dexter: Original Sin star Patrick Gibson was the behind the new Bond</a>. Here's hoping IO Interactive finally gets around to acknowledging that this week, and maybe also a final release date for the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of now, 007 First Light is set to arrive sometime in 2026, for Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
