            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher Paradox Interactive has today taken the blame for the poor sales of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The long in development sequel launched in October and was met with a ‘mixed’ Steam user review response, with fans saying it failed to meet the expectations they had for the sequel to Troika’s 2004 cult classic Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 takes another flawed but unique and remarkable bite at the jugular, with plenty to love and loathe alike, but I certainly enjoyed my time as an elder vampire at the very least.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, after 30 days on sale, <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-ab-writes-down-msek-355-of-capitalised-development-costs-for-vampire--the-masque,c4273262" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paradox has issued a note to financial markets</a> signalling a write-down valued at 355 million SEK (approx. $37 million) of capitalized development costs for Bloodlines 2. This write-down, Paradox said, was based on an updated sales forecast now it has had a month to look at Bloodlines’ commercial performance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive, said the blame for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2’s failure lay at the publisher’s door, not that of The Chinese Room, which had been drafted in to save the project after years of development hell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is a strong vampire fantasy and we are pleased with the developers’ work on the game,” Wester said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve had high expectations for a long time, since we saw that it was a good game with a strong IP in a genre with a broad appeal. A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down. The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales. Going forward, we focus our capital to our core segments and, at the same time, we’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has two expansions planned as part of the game’s Premium Edition, and Paradox said it remains committed to delivering them. “Our post-release plan remains firm; we will deliver updates and the promised expansions to the game in the coming year,” Wester added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Swedish game company Paradox’s main focus is on grand strategy games, which have proven enormously successful over the years. Games such as Stellaris, Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, and Cities: Skylines have all enjoyed big sales, and, in total, Paradox games have six million players each month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, however, falls outside that core grand strategy genre, and always looked like it would struggle upon release. And while its development trouble began years ago, it suffered issues right up to launch. In September, a month before release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-adds-clans-to-base-game-after-fan-outcry-over-launch-dlc">Paradox and The Chinese Room announced that the Lasombra and Toreador clans would be available in the base <u>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</u> experience following a backlash from players</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paradox <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/22/bloodlines-2-announced"><u>announced</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2"><u>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</u></a> all the way back in 2019 with then-developer Hardsuit aiming for a Q1 2020 release window. That, of course, never happened, as Paradox would go on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-developer-removed-game-delayed-out-of-2021"><u>announce an indefinite delay</u></a> alongside Hardsuit's departure from the project. The Chinese Room was then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-with-a-new-developer-and-release-window"><u>announced as its new developer</u></a> in 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/iyWDyNLAo1E?si=H6x-u7AFGCe4F7Hz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the Goth Boss podcast</u></a>, former creative director Dan Pinchbeck said the development team tried to work out how to get Paradox to <em>not </em>call the game Bloodlines 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The tricky question around it was Bloodlines 1," Pinchbeck said. "Are you making a sequel to Bloodlines 1? We used to sit there and have these planning sessions of how do we get them to not call it Bloodlines 2? That feels like the most important thing we do here, to come at this and say this isn't Bloodlines 2. We can't make Bloodlines 2; there's not enough time, there's not enough money.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

A small number of popular mats, like fan-favorite <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBDeLV?object_uuid=6958a291-dcbb-44cb-a594-4da64607c061&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi, Stray Black Mage</a> are sold out, but there are many other mats with incredible art to pick from at new discounted prices. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Playmats On Sale</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're new to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/trading-card-marketplace-tcgplayer-has-a-special-offer-this-weekend">TCGs</a>, people use playmats as a way to show off their favorite art or accomplishments, and also for practical reasons: have you tried picking up cards off of a kitchen table? I assure you, it gets annoying <em>fast</em>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Final Fantasy crossover set that launched this past June, TCG accessory maker Ultra Pro released tons of playmats featuring some of the most iconic characters and moments from throughout the game series' long history, including Y'shtola from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiii">Lightning from XIII</a>. Mats for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII</a> characters Cloud and Tifa feature the new art from their cards, and some mats, like those for Clive or Sephiroth, are double-sided to represent mechanics of the cards they're based on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whichever Final Fantasy character speaks to you the most, odds are there's a playmat for you to bring to your game night or local game store for some cardboard slinging. These also make great mousepads if you're in the market to spruce up your home office or gaming setup. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've been on the lookout for MTG Final Fantasy cards, Amazon has the Revival Trance Commander deck featuring Terra <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-commander-deck-is-better-than-half-price">on sale for 53% off</a>, and Final Fantasy play booster boxes (30 packs) are at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-boosters-down-to-lowest-price-ever-for-black-friday">their lowest price ever</a> for Black Friday, down to $162.57 (22% off). </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">More Magic: The Gathering Gifts</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out our detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-the-gathering-gift-ideas">Magic: The Gathering gift guide</a> for inspiration while shopping for that special Planeswalker in your life.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a Nintendo Switch or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> owner, there is no better series of games to collect than Mario. The plumber has had some of his best adventures ever across the two systems, and this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday</a>, you can save on select Mario games for a limited time. Nintendo rarely puts its games on sale, so now is the time to pick these Mario games up before deals run out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Black Friday Nintendo deals</a> have been very popular so far and have mostly sold out at Amazon. We've included the other retailers that still have the games in stock.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Mario Switch Game on Sale for Black Friday 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">First up, it's hard to beat <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review">Super Mario Odyssey</a> for only $29.99. Mario's quest to stop Bowser from forcibly marrying Princess Peach sees him traversing various Kingdoms with a new friend named Cappy, a sentient hat creature and this game's central gimmick. Mario can throw Cappy to possess and take control of enemies, inanimate objects, and more. If there's one game from this list I cannot recommend enough, it's Super Mario Odyssey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another fantastic Nintendo Switch game on sale is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/28/luigis-mansion-3-review">Luigi's Mansion 3</a>, starring Mario's ghost-hunting brother. This time, Luigi enters a giant hotel with Mario, Toad, and Princess Peach for vacation, but as always, things go horribly wrong. One of the great new features involves solving puzzles using a cloned Luigi, named Gooigi, who can walk on spikes and squeeze through bars to get to places Luigi otherwise can't reach. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-black-friday-deal-2025">Paper-Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> was one of the best Switch games of 2024, and this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-video-games-best-early-deals">Black Friday</a>, you can save 50% on the beloved remake. Originally released for GameCube, The Thousand-Year Door brings a fantastic story, great characters, and a satisfying turn-based RPG combat system. The Nintendo Switch remake added numerous quality-of-life features, like the Partner Ring to switch Partners on the fly, a fast travel system to cut down on backtracking, and more. And that's not to mention the overhauled graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-showtime-review">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> is on sale for $39.99 for Black Friday. Princess Peach must defend the stage in multiple plays against threats from a new group of enemies in this action-packed adventure. Each play brings a different outfit and ability set for Peach, opening up a completely new gameplay style. This is unlike any other Mario adventure, so if this one went under your radar last year, it's a great time and a worthy addition to your Nintendo Switch library.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Great Nintendo Switch Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While there aren't any <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-console-best-black-friday-deals-2025">Nintendo Switch 2 console deals available</a>, you can still get the bundles before Christmas if you buy now. The Mario Kart World bundle includes a copy of the latest Mario Kart game while shaving off some of the cost of buying it separately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.
