To release and support The Last of Us Online we’d have to put all our studio resources behind supporting post launch content for years to come, severely impacting development on future single-player games. So, we had two paths in front of us: become a solely live service games studio or continue to focus on single-player narrative games that have defined Naughty Dog’s heritage.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naughty Dog went on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-heads-to-space-with-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-the-game-awards-2024">announce single-player adventure Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet at The Game Awards 2024</a>, its first new franchise in over a decade.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Naughty Dog Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-122597374" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacred Symbols+</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/yoshida-i-played-the-last-of-us-online-and-it-was-great" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Square</a>), Shuhei Yoshida touched on the internal decision-making that led to The Last of Us Online’s cancelation, saying feedback from Destiny developer Bungie, which Sony had acquired, helped to convince Naughty Dog to scrap the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The idea for The Last of Us Online came from Naughty Dog and they really wanted to make it,” Yoshida said. “But Bungie explained [to them] what it takes to make live service games, and Naughty Dog realised, ‘Oops, we can’t do that! If we do it, we can’t make Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.’ So that was a lack of foresight.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This tallies with prior reports that indicated Naughty Dog had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-needs-more-time-naughty-dog"><u>scaled back</u></a> development of The Last of Us Online due to an internal review from Bungie. In October 2023, Naughty Dog reportedly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dogs-troubled-the-last-of-us-multiplayer-spin-off-reportedly-on-ice-amid-layoffs"><u>suffered a round of layoffs</u></a> and that the multiplayer project was “put on ice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cancelation of The Last of Us Online came as part of a sweeping pull back from live service at Sony Interactive Entertainment following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-10-live-service-games-will-be-from-different-genres-and-for-different-audiences">a huge internal push to make more of these types of games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Arrowhead’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony’s other live service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s live service hero shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a> is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid eye-wateringly low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord's initial development deal was around $200 million according to a report by <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a>. It said the $200 million was not enough to fund Concord's entire development, nor did it include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk Studios itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And just last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony canceled two unannounced live service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a prior interview, Yoshida, who was President of SIE Worldwide Studios for Sony Interactive Entertainment from 2008 to 2019, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-wouldve-tried-to-resist-sonys-live-service-push">said he would have tried to resist Sony’s controversial live service video game push</a> and that Sony always knew its investment in live service games was risky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking to Sacred Symbols+, Yoshida said that as far as he was aware, no first-party PlayStation Studio was forced to make a live service game. Rather they saw an opportunity to successfully pitch a live service game given Sony’s video game strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“From my experience, when studios see the company has a big initiative, [they realise] riding on that gives them a better chance of getting a project approved and supported,” Yoshida said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s not like [current PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst] is telling teams they need to make live service games, it’s likely mutual.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of Sony’s live service push and pull is hundreds of millions of dollars wasted, widespread layoffs, studio closures, and years of work that will never see the light of day. Developers face enormous gaps in their CVs with nothing to show for it, and PlayStation 5 looks set for a light period for first-party games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there are a number of PlayStation Studios live service games Sony has yet to cancel, including Guerrilla’s multiplayer Horizon project, Bungie’s extraction shooter Marathon, and the multiplayer heist game Fairgames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Based on previous collaborations, these bundles are expected to cost 2,400 COD Points, or $19.99, each. So, if you want all four turtles you face the prospect of handing over $80’s worth of COD Points.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/bo6-s02-reloaded-announcement-027-1739968994419.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Leonardo Tracer Pack is expected to cost 2,400 COD Points, or $19.99. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. As it did with the controversial Squid Game crossover, Activision has created a premium event pass for the Turtles crossover, which costs 1,100 COD Points / $10. This includes a number of eye-catching cosmetics, chief among them Splinter. Again, there is no other way of getting Splinter than paying the $10 for the premium track of the event pass. The free track includes two Foot Clan soldier skins, among other cosmetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As many have pointed out, the Turtles crossover is heavy on the cosmetics but does not feature gameplay affecting items. No-one has to buy any or all of it to compete in Black Ops 6 multiplayer. And there are many within the community saying it's easy to ignore Call of Duty crossovers like the Turtles one and leave those willing to spend more to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that hasn’t stopped some players within the community from criticizing Activision once again for the high cost of these cosmetics, and are saying this second ever Call of Duty premium event pass suggests Black Ops 6 is now being monetized as if it were a free-to-play game like Fortnite.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/bo6-s02-reloaded-announcement-025-1739969056586.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Turtles event pass is just the second ever in Call of Duty. Image credit: Activision Publishing. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Activision casually glossing over the fact that they want you to pay $80+ if you want the 4 Turtles, plus another $10+ if you want the TMNT event pass rewards,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1isjv5b/activision_casually_glossing_over_the_fact_that/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor II_JangoFett_II said</a>. “Call of Duty's Gross greed strikes again... DESPICABLE!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Guess we can expect an event pass sold every season now,” Hipapitapotamus suggested. “Remember when events were good and got you cool universal camos for free.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Turtles don’t use guns," APensiveMonkey declared. "Their fingers wouldn’t even... I hate this..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth going into more detail on how Activision monetizes Black Ops 6. Each season brings with it a new battle pass, the base version of which costs 1,100 COD Points / $9.99. There’s an extra premium version of the battle pass, called BlackCell, which costs $29.99 (you can’t buy this one with COD Points). Then there is a constant stream of cosmetics available to buy from the store. The Turtles crossover, with its premium event pass, is on top of all this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So they expect the playerbase to buy the game itself, buy the battle pass/black cell and now this? Na that's too much,” PunisherR35 added. “If this is gonna be the norm moving forward, CoD needs to move to a FTP model (campaign, MP).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6s-squid-game-season-2-crossover-and-call-of-dutys-controversial-relationship-with-microtransactions">Activision’s aggressive monetization of Call of Duty is nothing new</a>. It’s just that the new premium event pass, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-squid-game-crossover-event-locks-its-best-rewards-behind-a-new-premium-battle-pass">which made its debut with Black Ops 6’s Squid Game crossover</a>, has pushed some fans over the edge. And as has been pointed out many times before, the standardized monetization across the $70 Black Ops 6 and the free-to-play battle royale Warzone does Black Ops 6 no favors. What might be acceptable for Warzone given it’s free-to-play isn’t necessarily acceptable for Black Ops 6, given it costs $70 just to be able to play Multiplayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where the calls for Black Ops 6 Multiplayer to go free-to-play come from. With each new microtransaction Call of Duty Multiplayer feels more and more like Fortnite, Apex Legends, Marvel Rivals, and of course Warzone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision and parent company Microsoft will of course stick to its guns, given Call of Duty’s incredible popularity. Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty launch ever, and set a new single day Game Pass subscription record. Sales on PlayStation and Steam jumped 60% compared to 2023's Modern Warfare 3. Clearly, Call of Duty is doing the business for Activision and new owner Microsoft, which the financial officers will no doubt be delighted with given the Xbox maker paid an eye-watering $69 billion for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

And so perhaps it comes as no surprise to see the community go into release date speculation mode with only an official create a character competition to go on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/2KceBLysMenA9JY9LsnSL3/bid-on-a-chance-to-create-a-character-for-the-elder-scrolls-vi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bethesda announced its next Make-A-Wish project</a>: you can bid on a chance to work with Bethesda Game Studios to create a character to appear as an NPC in The Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For the last several years, we have been lucky enough to work with Make-A-Wish to grant wishes, support some of their local events, and provide items and experiences, all to benefit children who are fighting life-threatening illnesses,” Bethesda said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This year, for their <a href="https://my.onecause.com/event/organizations/sf-0018000000bK8c8AAC/events/vevt:fd137384-5aab-481b-bcc9-95db4365f38b/auctions/silent-auction" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silent Auction</a> we are giving one winner the opportunity to work with Bethesda Game Studios to create a character to appear as an NPC in The Elder Scrolls 6. All of the money made from the auction goes directly to Make-A-Wish.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a wonderful cause and a great initiative from Bethesda, but for The Elder Scrolls 6 fans it could mean a whole lot more. And that’s because the community is comparing this Make-A-Wish project to the one Bethesda ran for Starfield, and have determined the point in development The Elder Scrolls 6 may be in currently, and thus its potential release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I know, the community has gone off the deep end here. But let’s run with it… for science.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The appropriately named redditor ‘FartingSlowly’ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TESVI/comments/1is8evx/the_chance_to_design_a_starfield_character_post/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a> that Bethesda’s equivalent 'chance to make a Starfield character' post was published two-and-a-half years before Starfield came out in September 2023. Ergo, The Elder Scrolls 6’s release date is set for September 2027. More specifically, September 27, 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is not a good indicator or metric for release by any standards,” FartingSlowly admitted. “Do not take this too seriously. But. It is finally something. It isn't just a piece of junk speculation based on nothing, it's based on something from Bethesda themselves. Yeah, it's not something to actually care about but it is a refreshing change in the world of speculation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, many within the community have cast similar doubt on the release date suggested by FartingSlowly. Some have pointed out that Starfield’s Make-A-Wish competition was announced when the game was due out November 11, 2022. Does that mean Bethesda is looking at releasing The Elder Scrolls 6 in November 2026?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a long, long time since Bethesda announced The Elder Scrolls 6. In January, The Elder Scrolls 6’s June 10, 2018 announcement <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced">became as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-officially-in-early-development-but-dont-expect-to-hear-about-it-soon"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 had entered "early development" in August 2023</u></a>, and "early builds" were available in March 2024. The six year anniversary of the announcement arrived in June last year and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>Bethesda development chief Todd Howard paused to say, "oh wow, that has been a while."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls 6 was thought to be set for 2028 at the earliest, presumably on the next-generation of consoles as well as PC. If it does launch then, it’ll do so an incredible 17 years after Skyrim.
