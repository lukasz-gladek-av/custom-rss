No further details were offered, outside a promotional image showing a bunch of Palworld characters fighting a rather large Pal.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/12/palworld-1741802752864.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Palworld gets crossplay late March. Image credit: Pocketpair.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair Communications Director and Publishing Manager John 'Bucky' Buckley teased "a few little surprises too" with the March update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's good news for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-hits-32-million-players-during-year-1-as-nintendo-pokmon-lawsuit-looms-over-the-horizon">the 32 million players that have picked up Palworld</a> since its early access launch in January 2024. The studio has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-crossplay-final-boss-and-more-coming-as-pocketpair-reveals-2025-roadmap">laid out a content roadmap for Palworld's 2025</a> that looks fairly lengthy; alongside crossplay, there is an "ending scenario" and more new content on the way for the hugely popular creature-catching survival game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC a year ago, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP, and launching the game on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looming over all this is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-officially-suing-palworld-developer-over-multiple-patent-infringements">a lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company</a>, who seek "an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages" on the grounds that Palworld has infringed on "multiple" patent rights. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for">Pocketpair has provided an update</a>, identifying the patents the studio is allegedly infringing, and it has since tweaked how players summon Pals in Palworld, apparently in response. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
