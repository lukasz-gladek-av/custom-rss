Each detail of this wrist-mounted computer remains faithful to the game. A fully functional IPS display delivers that vintage cathode ray tube look, complete with screen glitches and a huge gallery of media, including the Atomic Command minigame. The Wand Company spared no expense when creating this replica, from its die-cast metal front casing and memory foam cuff with a spacer to a rechargeable LiPo power cell and LED torch. It’s sure to elevate your cosplay to another level, but the included machined metal stand is ideal for displaying this exhibition-grade collectible — or using the Pip-Boy 3000 as an alarm clock; yes, it does that too. </p></div><p id="new-vegas-ranger-statue"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="New Vegas Ranger Statue">Fallout New Vegas Ranger Statue</h2></p><div catalogid="84737b41-6a12-4e0e-9a1a-40bee8f54287" id="230124"><div id="230124" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout New Vegas Ranger Statue</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The detail is incredible on this 8.4-inch resin statue of a New Vegas Ranger.

Nuka Mix isn’t the only Nuka-Cola flavor available; Bethesda’s Gear Store has a bunch of other kinds for an epic Nuka Mix Station at home.</p></div><p id="desert-ranger-battle-helmet"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Desert Ranger Battle Helmet">Fallout Desert Ranger Battle Wearable Helmet</h2></p><div catalogid="84737b41-6a12-4e0e-9a1a-40bee8f54287" id="230123"><div id="230123" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout Desert Ranger Battle Wearable Helmet</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Before the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/New_California_Republic_Rangers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New California Republic Rangers</a> formed, there were the Desert Rangers, and you can grab a piece of their history with a durable plastic helmet modeled after one found in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. It’s hand-painted with weathered detail to make each helmet unique. A green glow even comes from the eyes, thanks to the inclusion of LED lights.

You’ll find a 20L interior compartment, a laptop slot, pockets for various accessories, and, of course, the thick signature yellow blanket that rests on top.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Haha. Yeah, I know. "Half-Life 3". The long-fabled, often-rumored, still non-existent third numbered entry in the Half-Life series that fans have craved but never heard a credible whisper of. It's been a pervasive joke in the industry and among fans for years, a stand-in for a thing that doesn't exist and never would.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet, for some reason, a lot of people seem to think it's being announced soon. Possibly in the next few weeks. Maybe even today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might have seen it. The sudden flurry of mentions of Half-Life 3, some humorous, some quite serious. The surge of memes. A handful of people that seem to have lost their dang minds:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's going on? Why do people think Half-Life 3 is imminent, seriously or unseriously? We investigated:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Half-Hope</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life 3 rumors have existed pretty much since Half-Life 2 first released, so that's nothing new. But the last couple of years have seen a steady trickle of interesting little threads that have lead many to believe that a third entry was actually in development, quietly, at Valve. There were vague nods, such as the Half-Life: Alyx team <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-half-life-alyx-sequel">saying they wanted to make more Half-Life games</a> and a Final Hours documentary that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-left-4-dead-3-details-cancelled-valve">actually confirmed it was in development at one point</a> between 2013 and 2014. We've also seen dataminers pulling crumbs from various Valve releases over the last few years of what seems to be an in-development game internally at Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known only as "HLX",</a> using Source 2. Dataminers have worked out that it's a full-fledged, non-VR, Half-Life game of some sort, that's been in the works since at least 2021, probably earlier. That game is possibly the same one as was accidentally leaked by a voice actor in 2024, who referred to it as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Project White Sands"</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But this year there's been a marked increase in little breadcrumbs. Right after the new year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-rumors-ramp-up-after-g-man-voice-actor-issues-cryptic-tweet-his-first-in-years">G-Man's voice actor issued a cryptic post</a> teasing "unexpected surprises" in 2025 – it was his first tweet since he congratulated Valve on Half-Life: Alyx in December 2020. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-fans-are-doing-a-gta-6-and-losing-their-minds-over-hidden-half-life-3-clues-they-desperately-want-to-be-real">Fans proceeded to tear apart the post</a>, delving deep into an album cover image and the number 197 for what they believed were even more hints that something was in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But an already simmering pot of rumors turned into a full boil with the announcement last week of new Valve hardware: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-machine-hands-on-first-impressions">the Steam Machine</a>, complete with a new Steam controller, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-frame-preview-hands-on-with-valves-state-of-the-art-vr-headset">VR headset known as the Steam Frame</a>. Notably, there were no software announcements alongside these hardware reveals, which is a bit odd given that Valve tends to release new games alongside new hardware - recall Half-Life: Alyx and the Valve Index headset. Around the same time, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1ox4jzk/more_hopium/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a number</a> of Valve and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/uwn_XYk8Is8?t=2122s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">industry insiders</a> began mentioning Half-Life 3, saying confidently that it was planned for a 2025 announcement still. One leaker, who has a good track record of getting Valve stuff right, said back in May that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-is-not-just-in-development-its-now-playable-end-to-end-leaker-suggests" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Half-Life 3 was officially "playable, end-to-end."</a> There's a <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">massive Miro board floating around</a> that has catalogued every remotely credible recent mention of Half-Life 3, and is worth digging into if you want follow along.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Go, G-Man, Go</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many other weird little indicators floating around that are leading to wild speculation. For instance, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/valve" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve's "Upcoming Releases" tab</a> on its own Steam page only lists one game (Deadlock) despite the sidebar indicating that there are <em>two</em> upcoming game releases. A <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1991101144207085644?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet/X post</a> from the official The Game Awards account commemorating Half-Life's 27th anniversary today has sent everyone into a frenzy, even though it tweets this anniversary every year. There was a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weird amount of extra security at Valve</a> during the recent Steam hardware preview events – something noticed by IGN's own representatives and contrasted with my personal experience there for Half-Life: Alyx years ago, which featured a relatively normal and relaxed amount of security.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there was an incredibly silly saga where <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990519287032000600?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geoff Keighley posted a screenshot</a> that showed he had one game in his Steam wishlist. When <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1990526450005651771?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked what the game was</a>, he responded with an eyes emoji, and then <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990894100531306531?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showed the game Dadlympics</a>. Of course, the Half-Life nerds pounced. Keighley then posted a screenshot of his wishlist showing only the game "Dadlympics," but notably, this was added on 11/18, the same day he posted the screenshot, suggesting he's hiding <em>something.</em> Is he hiding Half-Life 3? Probably not! It doesn't have a viewable Steam page! That's not how Steam works! But that hasn't stopped Half-Life 3 fans from pouncing. Seriously, the replies are hilarious.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/t5L0zHW0Il" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/t5L0zHW0Il</a></p>— arda (@lornarcoss) <a href="https://twitter.com/lornarcoss/status/1990682190263251432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever you believe is happening here, the reality is that this has resulted in the community going completely bonkers. The Half-Life subreddit is overflowing with Half-Life 3 summoning and hope posts. A quick search for Half-Life on Twitter/X reveals an overflow of discourse, prayers, and memes. It's kind of nuts, and also really, really fun:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, so let's say everyone's right, and we really are getting Half-Life 3 announced soon. When? Well, some think it's as soon as today. November 19, as The Game Awards posted, is the anniversary of Half-Life – what better time to make an announcement? We've already passed the anniversary of Half-Life 2, and the anniversary of Half-Life: Alyx's announcement, but that particular anniversary is the reason you're likely seeing so much noise around this today. The other big possibility floated by some is an announcement at The Game Awards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">which is coming up on December 11</a>. That would be a little surprising, given that Valve doesn't need an awards show to command attention with such an announcement. But Valve also has a long history of friendliness with host Geoff Keighley, so maybe it's not so far-fetched after all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the case, one thing is certain: either Half-Life 3 is getting announced before December 31, 2025, or an awful lot of folks are going to have egg on their faces come January 1, 2026. I'm personally hoping for the former, but the community has been hoodwinked before with Half-Life rumors, multiple times even. Keep injecting that Hopium, folks. Perhaps the return of G-man is right around the corner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

Ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aliexpress-early-black-friday-sale-2025-starts-now">Black Friday</a>, Arzopa is hosting some big markdowns on its popular lineup of portable USB monitors via its official AliExpress storefront. Combined with some general AliExpress coupon codes, these deals are the lowest prices I've seen all year long. All of the portable monitors listed ship free from the United States, which means you don't have to worry about tariffs or long shipping times.</p></div><p id="magic-the-gathering-avatar-the-l"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The L">Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230696"><div id="230696" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The price on this has already dropped by nearly $100 to $455.88 compared to yesterday, so now is a better time than ever to get your preorder locked in. Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best things Nickelodeon put out when I was a kid, and its fandom still beats strong. This Universes Beyond MTG set hasn't only got me back into Avatar, but it's got me on MTG Arena to learn the game, not just collect it when I can. Collector Boosters aren't for playing, it's for those who want some solid binder material with far better pull rates than standard play boosters. There's a premium for that of course, but Amazon won't charge until it ships, which means you'll probably have a day or two to get the money you need together.</p></div><p id="final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-annive"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Annive">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230603"><div id="230603" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (Nintendo Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For Final Fantasy fans who haven't played the 2D old school games, or for those who are fans of the sprite-based RPG vibe, this is the deal for you. It features a re-arranged soundtrack by original series composer Nobuo Uematsu, improved gamplay, a user interface overhaul, auto battle options and more quality of life improvements. 47% off makes this collection a no-brainer.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Dragon Quest HD-2D Remakes</h2></p><div><div id="230773" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake</h3></p></div><div id="230774" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</h3></p></div><div id="230775" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Quest I, II and III HD-2D remakes are all out now on Nintendo Switch, with I and II also out on Nintendo Switch 2.

That's not bad when you're talking Elite Trainer Boxes and Booster Boxes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> team has reversed its defibrillator changes for the Support class after players reported recent difficulty reviving teammates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios delivered a series of new adjustments via a small update that is live for players across PC and consoles now. Details about the hot fix, which were published in <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991168660103180339?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X/Twitter</a>, highlight a fix for those pesky defibrillators, as well as tweaks to the new limited-time Sabotage game mode and additional challenges changes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Players took to social media to complain of inconsistent defibrillators following the launch of the Battlefield 6 California Resistance update yesterday. Where previous versions of the game had players using the Support gadget to slide and dive in for last-second saves, changes brought about by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1120-patch-notes-include-aim-assist-tweaks-and-bloom-adjustments-as-season-1-continues"><u>update 1.1.2.0</u></a> instead asked players to slowly and precisely use the tool if they wanted to revive their friends. It’s resulted only in confusion, as the demanding requirements left teammates with what has been perceived as either a new bug or a bizarre nerf without any explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At first I thought it was just a pointless range nerf,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1p0yjlv/comment/npn1bdq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a> says, “but it's also <em>much</em> more inconsistent and easy to get bodies bugged into a state where the defib doesn't work at all, and you have to grab / drag them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Overall, I hate it, but that second part of it makes me think it wasn't really intentional.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 team didn’t clarify what caused faulty defibrillators to pollute matches, but it sounds like they didn’t like the change either. Today’s hotfix reverts the gadget back to how it was before yesterday’s update by increasing hit-boxes and range.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Sabotage game mode has had its AFK kick timer increased from 60 seconds to 180 seconds. Bot backfilling for the mode has also been temporarily disabled and will be reintroduced in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, there’s challenges, which have benefited from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-major-overhaul-of-challenges-and-assignments-with-significant-reductions-to-challenge-requirements-available-now"><u>frequent adjustments</u></a> as BF Studios continues to fine-tune its progression system.
