            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has announced plans to build a new Warhammer World in the United States with a late 2027 target for opening its doors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer World, in Nottingham, England, is the focal point for Games Workshop’s various tabletop games and a social hub for the hobby. It includes an exhibition centre with dramatic, large-scale dioramas featuring everything from famous battles in the grimdark sci-fi setting Warhammer 40,000 to the fantasy world of Age of Sigmar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For competitors, a sizeable castle-themed gaming hall lets fans play matches, often in scheduled tournaments. There’s a themed bar and restaurant, areas to paint miniatures, and an in-house store with exclusive products.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/u6jqjmvz/a-warhammer-world-in-the-usa-get-the-details-here/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, Games Workshop confirmed its plans to start work on the new Warhammer World, to be built just outside Washington DC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This new Warhammer World will be a flagship venue that celebrates Warhammer in all its forms: gaming, painting, modelling, storytelling, events, and community,” Games Workshop said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The original Warhammer World in Nottingham, UK sets a very high bar. We’re not going to replicate it brick-for-brick, but instead build something equally uncompromising on quality and experience, something worthy of Warhammer’s rich settings and of course the title ‘Warhammer World.’ And of course, at the heart of all this is creating something extraordinary for all of you — the Warhammer fans!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, there’s a lot to do – but with a fair wind, and the might of the Emperor and his inexhaustible armies, we hope to open the doors late in 2027.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With this new Warhammer World, Games Workshop is clearly hoping to reinforce its explosive success and the ever-increasing popularity of Warhammer 40,000 in particular, which in recent years has grown far beyond the confines of a tabletop game. Its loyal fandom fusses over lore, analyzes new novels for fresh insight into the setting, and speculates about future development. The smash hit video game Space Marine 2 boosted interest in all things Warhammer 40,000 — so much so that playable character <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">Titus is now the poster boy of the tabletop game and is even at the heart of its next narrative expansion</a>. And former Superman actor Henry Cavill’s upcoming Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe for Amazon will undoubtedly take it to new heights. It makes a lot of sense to have a Warhammer World in place to capitalize on the army of newcomers Cavill’s Prime Video work will surely rally together. (Cavill once visited Warhammer World in the UK and posted a video of his tour on Instagram.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Warhammer 40,000 fans are bracing themselves for an announcement and release of the 11th Edition of the game, accompanying lore developments, and new model releases. And we’re arguably in the golden age of Warhammer 40,000 video games, with Space Marine 2 still receiving updates, Space Marine 3 in the works, and Dawn of War 4 and Total War: Warhammer 40,000 waiting in the wings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Larian Studios <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-2-is-getting-a-free-upgrade-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-nintendo-switch-2">presented console players of Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> with a special treat: an upgraded version of the game for PS5, Xbox Series, and delightfully, Nintendo Switch 2. But while Original Sin 2 has been on Nintendo's system since 2019, Larian's next game, Baldur's Gate 3, never made it to any Nintendo console. Why not? Well, Larian at least says it wasn't its decision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit AMA today</a> conducted by various members of Larian, CEO Swen Vincke took a moment to answer a question about whether or not Baldur's Gate 3 for Nintendo Switch 2 was "even possible". Sadly, his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">answer wasn't a happy one</a>: "We would have loved to but it's wasn't our decision to make."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke is speaking in the past tense because officially, Larian is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-notes-include-final-farewell-message-as-larian-looks-ahead">done with Baldur's Gate 3</a>. It's still supporting the game with minor bug fixes, but there's no reason to expect the studio to do a whole new release on a new platform now, especially since it's moved on to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">new Divinity game</a>. That leaves Wizards of the Coast in charge of the future of Baldur's Gate 3, meaning a port isn't happening without its blessing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which seems to be what Vincke is implying here - that Larian would have done one, but Wizards for whatever reason decided not to. Wizards of the Coast declined to comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is a shame for Switch owners, because Baldur's Gate is a fantastic game. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">gave it a 10/10</a> at launch, saying that "with crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We covered other topics from Larian's AMA today, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-writer-wishes-wyll-had-gotten-more-content-and-a-more-fulfilling-arc-too-explains-what-happened">what happened to Wyll's storyline</a> in Baldur's Gate 3 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-divinity-from-larians-reddit-ama">how Larian will (or won't) use generative AI for Divinity</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Nintendo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-new-switch-2-joy-con-colors-light-purple-and-light-green">recently announced</a> it’s releasing a Light Purple and Light Green color variant of the Joy-Con 2 Switch 2 controllers, and now it's available for preorder. It costs $99.99 per pair and is set to release on February 12. You can preorder now (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QG8bxW?object_uuid=81292efd-a9ed-422a-bd86-ce83ee260697&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see at Best Buy</a>). Read on for the details.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Joy-Con 2 Light Purple and Light Green </h2><div catalogid="23cbb7a0-2d78-4ddc-921c-19737646ae32" id="234333"><div id="234333" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Joy-Con 2 Light Purple and Light Green&nbsp;</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QG8bxW?object_uuid=81292efd-a9ed-422a-bd86-ce83ee260697&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get at Best Buy</a> - $99.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QV5OxY?object_uuid=81292efd-a9ed-422a-bd86-ce83ee260697&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get at GameStop</a> - $99.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aR75XO?object_uuid=81292efd-a9ed-422a-bd86-ce83ee260697&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get at Nintendo Store</a> - $99.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9gXMdB?object_uuid=81292efd-a9ed-422a-bd86-ce83ee260697&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at Amazon</a> - (not yet available)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Functionally, these Joy-Con 2 operate exactly the same as the red and blue ones that come with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a>. And since black is still the main color on the casing, they’re not as flashy as the color variants of the original Switch Joy-Con. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the new colors are visible under the thumb sticks, as well as on the connector part of the controllers. The included plastic bumpers for the wrist straps are also the same colors, so they’ll be more visible when the Joy-Con 2s are disconnected from the console or grip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you’re buying an extra pair of Joy-Con 2 for multiplayer sessions, having different colors for each player makes it easier to tell your controller from everyone else’s. For me, if I were in the market for an extra set of Joy-Con 2, I’d definitely get these instead of a second set of red and blue ones.</p></div><div catalogid="c49cc388-129c-45cb-84e8-738834eaacdc" id="228077"><div id="228077" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mario Tennis Fever</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I suspect it’s no coincidence that Nintendo’s next big first-party Switch 2 game is also coming out the same day as these new Joy-Con 2 colors. Mario Tennis Fever (see our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-where-to-buy">preorder guide</a>) is also set to release February 12. It’s a single or multiplayer game that lets up to four players join in on the action at a time. Preorder the game and a new pair of Joy-Con 2, and you’ll be all set to play with friends next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are currently only two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/All_Switch_2_Joy-Con_Colors">Joy-Con 2 colors</a> on the market, I expect the list to grow in the coming years. After all, the original Switch got a whole rainbow's worth of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch/Joy-Con_Colors">Joy-Con colors</a>, to say nothing of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch/Special_Edition_Joy-Con">special edition Joy-Con releases</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.
