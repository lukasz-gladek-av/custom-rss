It comes with news about all the maps, modes, guns, and changes set to arrive when Season 2 starts next week. Included in the rundown is information about how The Terminator will make its Call of Duty debut with a special limited-time event that comes with unlockable rewards and in-game store skins that look like they were cooked up in a Skynet factory.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Terminator Crossover Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Terminator Tracer Pack is the real headline here, as it comes with two skins modeled after the T-800 cyborg Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron made popular in the ‘80s. The Titanium Core skin is ripped straight out of the movie, featuring the machine’s iconic, cold facial features and glowing red eyes. The T-800 skin, meanwhile, aims to bring Schwarzenegger's appearance to the battlefield, though it doesn’t exactly look like the younger version of the action star it’s based on. Still, it’s no doubt a fun callback to a classic series that also comes with four Weapon Blueprints, a special finishing movie, the “Tracking…Tracking…” emote, “What Pain?” emblem, and “Lookin’ Fly” calling card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Terminator Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 2 crossover content doesn’t stop there. From February 6 to February 20, Warzone, Multiplayer, and Zombies players will enjoy The Terminator event, which sees players collecting skulls to unlock up to 13 rewards. This is in addition to two other events – Shadow Hunt and St. Patrick’s Day: Clover Craze – which will add even more unlockable upgrades in February and March, respectively. Activision and Treyarch tease more reveals for the upcoming Season 2 Reloaded patch set to arrive at a later date.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Terminator collaboration follows Season 1’s popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-call-of-duty-update-of-2025-ushers-in-squid-game-crossover-increases-mantle-speeds-and-adds-a-new-wildcard"><u>Squid Game crossover event</u></a>, which included more tie-in skins that coincided with the release of Netflix’s Squid Game 2.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-preview-an-rts-that-takes-me-back-to-the-90s</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tempest-rising-preview-an-rts-that-takes-me-back-to-the-%E2%80%9890s.1089273/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-preview-an-rts-that-takes-me-back-to-the-90s<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As soon as I fired up the Tempest Rising demo for the first time, I had a good feeling. Watching the opening cinematic, which set the tone with cheesy dialogue from bulky armored soldiers and a reedy scientist, I couldn’t help but smile. The music, UI design, and units seem tailor-made to take me back to high school, when I’d stay up late playing Command &amp; Conquer with my friends, hopped up on Mountain Dew, taco-flavored Pringles, and sleep deprivation. Recapturing the feeling through a new game in the modern era is a blast, and I’m excited to see what else the developers at Slipgate Ironworks have in store at launch and beyond. Whether I was jumping into Skirmish to play against bots with clever AI, or Ranked Multiplayer, playing Tempest Rising feels as comfortable as putting on my well-worn baseball glove.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My initial reaction is no accident, either. The developers told me they <em>set out</em> to create a nostalgic real-time strategy (RTS) game that evoked the classics of the 90s and 2000s, with quality-of-life improvements expected of modern games. Set in 1997, Tempest Rising takes place in an alternate history in which the Cuban Missile Crisis exploded into World War 3. In the wake of widespread nuclear bombardment, strange flowering vines started to grow. These plants contain vast amounts of electrical energy, ushering in a new era of power for those prepared to withstand the fallout to harvest them.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tempest Rising Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the build I played was focused exclusively on multiplayer, I’ll have to wait to see what story mode will bring, but it will feature two replayable 11-mission campaigns, one for each of the main factions available in the preview. The Tempest Dynasty (TD) is an alliance of Eastern European and Asian countries who were the most devastated by WW3. The Global Defense Forces (GDF) on the other hand, are an alliance between the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. There is a third faction, but we’ll have to wait to learn more until the campaign is available, as they aren’t playable in the preview build, the Steam RTS Fest demo, or at launch.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Tempest Dynasty called out to me, not just because they can create an incredibly silly ‘death ball’ vehicle called the Tempest Sphere, which rolls over enemy infantry, squishing them into a fine paste.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the two factions, the Tempest Dynasty called out to me, not just because they can create an incredibly silly ‘death ball’ vehicle called the Tempest Sphere, which rolls over enemy infantry, squishing them into a fine paste. The Dynasty also has access to something called ‘plans,’ which are used to activate faction-wide bonuses of three specific kinds. Your Construction Yard, the main building everyone starts with, can activate one plan at a time. All you need is a little extra power generation and, apart from the 30 second cooldown for switching plans, you’re good to go.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Logistics Plan let me build new structures faster and harvest resources more quickly. Mobile resource harvesters move more quickly, too. The Martial Plan boosted the attack speed of my units and gave them resistance to rockets and other explosives, as well as giving Machinist units the ability to drain their own health to gain 50% additional attack speed. Finally, the Security Plan cut the cost of making units and buildings, improved the Repair function certain units have, and expanded Radar vision. I found a fun rhythm by alternating between economy-boosting phases where I would gather more resources with the Logistics Plan, then sped-up building phases under the Security Plan, and finally going on the offensive with the enhanced combat potential of the Martial Plan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sort of flexibility extends to other aspects of the Dynasty, as well. Instead of having to establish a base with a Refinery to harvest nearby fields of tempest (like the GDF does), the Tempest Dynasty builds Tempest Rigs, vehicles which drive to a resource-rich area and harvest until the field is depleted, then are free to pack up and go somewhere else. Because of this, my favorite ‘fast expand’ RTS strategy is easier than ever, particularly because it doesn’t matter how far away from my base these self-contained units go. In fact, sending a few Tempest Rigs to faraway places was a great way to let them harvest in peace, generating reliable cash for me without being discovered by my opponents.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dynasty also has a fun unit called the Salvage Van, which repairs nearby vehicles. It can, however, also be converted into Salvage Mode, which destroys nearby vehicles no matter who they belong to, giving resources back to the salvaging player. I love sneaking up on opponents who aren’t paying attention, parking a salvage truck next to their vehicles, and destroying them to both deplete their army and claim those resources for myself.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I love sneaking up on opponents who aren’t paying attention, parking a salvage truck next to their vehicles, and destroying them to both deplete their army and claim those resources for myself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, power plants created by the Dynasty can switch from power generation to ‘Distribution Mode’ which speeds up the construction and attack speed of nearby buildings (yeah, some upgraded Tempest Dynasty buildings have cannons. It’s awesome), at the cost of taking damage while the mode is active. Thankfully, the mode will stop affecting buildings at critical health, so I didn’t need to worry about destroying my own base for the speed boost.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While I prefer the Tempest Dynasty, the GDF certainly has its allure, too. They focus more on buffing allies, debuffing enemies, and exercising control over the battlefield. My favorite synergy between GDF units revolves around the Marking mechanic. Certain vehicles and infantry can ‘mark’ the enemies they target. Marked enemies drop Intel when defeated (a currency used for creating advanced units and structures), but if you invest in certain Doctrine upgrades (Tempest Rising’s version of ‘tech trees’), Marked enemies will get various debuffs including dealing less damage, taking more damage, and even increasing the range of certain units who attack them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each faction has three tech trees to explore, which is where you’ll decide which part of your faction you’ll lean into. Like the GDF ‘Marking &amp; Intel’ tree, the Dynasty has a tree which boosts the effectiveness of their ‘Plans,’ and that’s just the start. In addition to fun tech trees,there are cooldown abilities enabled by constructing specific advanced buildings. They cost money to activate, and each has its own cooldown, but these abilities are powerful ways to swing the tide of battle while adding flavor to the type of strategy each faction excels at. While both factions have abilities which deal damage in an area, or spawn extra troops, the GDF can also create spy drones, spawn beacons to allow building in remote locations, and even stop enemy vehicles from being able to attack for 12 seconds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Because the Dynasty has fewer buildings, with each basic building capable of being upgraded into the advanced version, losing a structure to an enemy Engineer can be rough. To counter that, the Dynasty has a special ability called Lockdown, which prevents enemy takeovers, but simultaneously stops the building from taking action. The Field Infirmary was the ability I got the most use out of, which let me drop a stationary troop-healing area anywhere on the map. This ability is a great compliment to the Dynasty, which already has both special infantry units and vehicles to repair mechanized allies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is more to dig into, and I can’t wait to do it, particularly because the launch version will let me jump into Custom Lobbies with friends, letting us team up against the very clever AI bots (which used impressive hit-and-run and harrying tactics on me during Skirmishes). Until then, I’ll have to settle for fighting alone, squishing my bot enemies with swarms of death balls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Brian Barnett writes reviews, features, &amp; more for</em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/Ribnax"><em> </em><u><em>IGN</em></u></a><em>, GameSpot, &amp; Kotaku.

            <title><![CDATA[Synduality Echo of Ada Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/synduality-echo-of-ada-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/synduality-echo-of-ada-review-in-progress.1089210/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/synduality-echo-of-ada-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The first time I lost my mech in Synduality Echo of Ada was on my second sortie, and lot of things went wrong. I didn’t buy insurance beforehand and I took way too much stuff out with me because I hit the wrong button, and then I chose not to take a moment to repair right before I got into the encounter that killed me. I made a series of avoidable mistakes followed by a bad decision, and this mech-flavored extraction shooter made sure I lost everything I had for it – so it’s a good sign that, after I was done cursing Synduality and then myself, I was immediately excited to try and get it all back. I have much more to do and see before I am ready for a final review, but that trial by fire will certainly stick with me until the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Synduality has a pretty cool premise: In the far future, humanity has been nearly wiped out by a mysterious blue rain called the Tears of the New Moon. In addition to killing humans on contact, the blue rain also made animals and plants gigantic and aggressive. To survive, society has moved underground and adopted the use of enormous mechs called Cradlecoffins to explore the surface world and gather energy-producing AO Crystals to survive. You step into the role of a nameless, faceless Drifter — someone who pilots a Cradlecoffin. Your goal? Get up there, get the things you need to upgrade your base and make some cash, and get out before the locals turn your Cradlecoffin into a grave.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Synduality Echo of Ada Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cradlecoffins aren’t your traditional mechs. They’re slower than something you’d find in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review"><u>Armored Core</u></a> – though similarly armed, as they’re still bipedal and wield weapons – but faster than the behemoths you’d see in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mechwarrior-5-clans-review"><u>MechWarrior</u></a>. Ready for a deep cut? They’re actually a lot like the mechs from 2002’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/04/phantom-crash-review"><u>Phantom Crash</u></a>, which is to say they are a nice balance of being reasonably fast but still heavy and limited in terms of, shall we say, vertical mobility. Armored Core mechs can dunk like Jordan. Cradlecoffins got no ups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But you’re not alone. In addition to your mech, you’ve got a Magus — think a humanoid AI you can fully customize and play dress up with — helping to guide you when you’re out on the surface by marking objectives on your map, alerting you to threats, and even keeping track of the weather. You can be as normal or as strangely intimate as you want about the creation process, though it kinda seems as if Synduality assumes you’re more likely to pick a robo-girlfriend than a robo-boyfriend based on the clothing choices available. (Even the AI-controlled Cradelcoffins have robo-girlfriends.) There are several different personalities to choose from, including supportive mentor lady, demure, eager-to-please girl; encouraging big brother, and spicy athlete who just wants you to be the best version of yourself. They’re a weirdly likeable little crew — I chuckled when my spicy athlete robo-girlfriend essentially told me to stop whining and eat my veggies (read: weeds that we had removed from the base) or she’d beat me up. And since they’re the only companion you’ll have for most of your time with Synduality, their presence is welcome.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Most of the other players I've seen aren’t out there to kill you.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to their clothes and look, you can also customize the special abilities and focus of your Magus, whether that’s finding AO Crystals, providing more info about different Enders (the name for that superpowered flora and fauna I talked about earlier), or giving you the low-down on the other Cradlecoffins you’ll run into once you pop out on the surface. So far I’ve liked both the one that’s good at protecting me from the evil rain and the one who has a knack for spotting other Cradlecoffins at range because hearing another engine in this game is <em>stressful</em>, but I appreciate that you can tailor your Magus to assist you be the best Drifter you wanna be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll run into other players in Synduality’s world, but in my experience, most of them aren’t out there to kill you and take your things. Usually, an encounter with another player means the two of you being very cagey, aiming your guns at each other, until one of you finally uses the wave emote. Then the other returns it and you both go on your way. It’s admittedly tense, and an extraction shooter like this should be, because you’re never more than a single insurance-less run away from losing all your things. The whole “we’re all working together to help humanity” thing sets up that cautious camaraderie, but there is always the danger that someone’s gonna see your shiny shotgun and think “I want that and I don’t wanna work for it,” so… you know. This does seem (so far) like a kinder, gentler extraction shooter, but you should still be careful around other people, even if they do the wave emote.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Managing each mission means making a lot of interesting choices. How far from the elevators that bring you to and from the safety of the underground are you willing to venture? What kind of materials are you looking to collect for your base, and how much are you going to risk to get them? How much ammo will you head out with? What kind of mech? Will you prioritize carrying capacity or defense? All of these choices matter, and you may regret your words and deeds when you’re sitting at low health with no repair kits, far away from an elevator in a world where everything wants to kill you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far Synduality has mostly just been this loop played over and over again, but it’s at least an amusing one, with a little bit of fun base building and dress-up in-between that I haven’t had a chance to dig too deeply into yet. What’s less amusing are the microtransactions and battle pass (we live in hell!) that can speed up the process of getting a better Cradlecoffin substantially despite this not being a free-to-play game. You get almost nothing in the free track of that pass, which is a standard-issue problem to some degree, but I’ll need to play more to see how much these systems feel like they impact the overall pace of progression without spending any money. I don’t think I would have all the nice things I have now, which replaced the stuff I lost, if I didn’t have that battle pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I am at least enjoying Synduality for now, though I have yet to unlock the single-player missions or the second map. Once I put some time into those, expand my base, and just generally Do More Stuff, I’ll have a better idea of where Synduality falls. Until then, I’ll be out in the world, trying not to die too much. Buy insurance, kids. It’s a scam, but it may save your life – or, at least, your mech.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first thing you'll want to double check is whether there are any typos or spelling mistakes. Roblox codes have to be entered exactly as the developers intended, and can even be case sensitive. Make sure there aren't any spelling errors, and that the lower and upper case letters are all in the correct place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If everything has been typed in correctly then that means the code is, unfortunately, expired. Roblox codes typically only last for a short amount of time, so if you see a code you like, you need to act quick and redeem it while it's still active.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Anime Guardians Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">New Anime Guardians codes are shared by the experience's creator, Zero Developer Studio, on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MdXq9qZG3k" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the game's official Discord server</a>. We update this page regularly, but if you want to get codes as soon as possible, it's best to join the Anime Guardians Discord server where you'll see codes posted in real-time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Anime Guardians In Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime Guardians is a Roblox tower defense game that should appeal to fans of experiences like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-world-tower-defense-codes">Anime World Tower Defense</a>. The aim of the game is to defend your base from wave after wave of enemy forces. To protect your base, you'll have to place auto-battling characters, known as units, on a map in the best positions possible so they can strategically defeat the opposition quickly and efficiently. On the battlefield units can be upgraded so you can easily take on tougher enemies, while during your downtime you can also add new characters to your anime-inspired army via the game's gacha-style summoning system. Characters in Anime Guardians are inspired by a range of beloved shows including Bleach, Jujutsu Kaisen and Re: Zero.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dion has spent over five years doing games journalism for UK national newspaper websites and is now a writer for Gamer Network.
