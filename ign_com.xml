But for a game like this, that’s not particularly surprising — fans are saying they’re way too busy doing other stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m one of those fans! I’ve been playing and enjoying Oblivion Remastered since it shadow-dropped on April 22, and upon leaving the sewers and handing over the Amulet of Kings to Jauffre at Weynon Priory, I’ve done everything BUT the main questline. I’ve joined <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/The_Fighters_Guild_Walkthrough">the Fighters Guild</a>, explored <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil">Cyrodiil</a>, and completed loads of side quests. I’ve even tried to brute force my way out of the map, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-player-escapes-the-confines-of-cyrodiil-to-explore-valenwood-skyrim-and-even-hammerfell-the-rumored-setting-of-the-elder-scrolls-vi">as one player managed to do</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why? Well, the side quests in Oblivion are brilliant fun (I won’t spoil any story stuff here), but I'm also trying to avoid the main quest (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-players-are-warning-newcomers-to-do-that-kvatch-quest-before-the-level-scaling-makes-it-an-absolute-nightmare">and potentially difficult parts of it like Kvatch</a>) for the time being while keeping leveling up to a minimum.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, I’ve decided to enjoy Oblivion until I get bored enough to play the game properly. Although there is no <em>properly </em>with a Bethesda game like this one, is there? That’s why they’re brilliant. You do what you want whenever you want, and the game still works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems a lot of other players are doing the same thing. “I'm BUSY doing OTHER STUFF like hunting for SLAUGHTERFISH in Lake Rumare,” the wonderfully named redditor MrCrispyFriedChicken said in response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1knuwip/only_277_of_people_have_beaten_the_main_quest/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the percentage completion stats for finishing Oblivion Remastered’s main questline</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spend 160 hours in already and Kvatch is still waiting for me,” added Roffear. “I'm one of those weirdos who actually likes the Oblivion gates so I purposefully don't finish the main quest until I've found all 60 gates in my world and closed them,” said Ellert0. “44 hours and an actual in-game year, and I haven't even been to Weynon Priory,” said PlayaHatinIG-88. “Those poor Kvatch city guards never stood a chance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this article’s publication, a paltry 2.97% had completed Oblivion Remastered's main questline on Xbox and a slightly better 4.4% had on Steam. Why the difference? I presume that’s because Xbox factors in Game Pass, which will have seen a number of players dip their toe into Oblivion Remastered before bouncing. Steam players are all in, of course, because they actually bought the game outright.</p><div id="ranking-the-best-races-in-oblivion" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ranking the Best Races in Oblivion</h3><h3>Ranking the Best Races in Oblivion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, it’s still a low percentage for Oblivion Remastered, which has so far seen over 4 million players. But in truth most video games have a surprisingly low campaign completion rate, whether it’s an epic, 100-hour open-world fantasy role-playing game like Oblivion Remastered or a five-hour story like Call of Duty. Indeed, a lot of games have a surprisingly low percentage of players who stick around after an hour or so or continue playing after the tutorial. Such is the fickle nature of the gamer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Oblivion Remastered, the stats may be skewed further because it’s a remaster of a beloved game many of its players finished back in the day. If you completed Oblivion's main quest 20 years ago, perhaps you’re less inclined to do it again now, and would rather focus on all the pretty new visuals and upgraded bits and bobs. Or, as one player has done, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-player-continues-bethesda-tradition-and-spends-7-hours-lining-up-books-for-in-game-dominoes">spend seven hours lining up books to get a Dominoes chain reaction just right</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thaddeus122 said they were almost 100 hours in and hadn’t even completed three of the main quests. They have, however, completed the Arena and the Mages Guild. And the rest of the time? “Leveling, getting money for homes, closing all the Oblivion gates, the Nirnroot quest, a bunch of little quests. To be fair, also don't fast travel anywhere.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Nintendo's legendary action-adventure franchise has seen over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-legend-of-zelda-games">25 mainline games</a> and a handful of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review">great spinoffs</a>, and if you own a Nintendo Switch and subscribe to their online service, you have access to just about every single Zelda title to date. But the green-clad Hero of Time transcends just video games, so we've put together a gift guide for that special Zelda fan in your life. From the video games and controllers, books to apparel, and even an amazing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-great-deku-tree">LEGO Deku Tree set</a>, there's quite literally something for both new and old Legend of Zelda fans alike. </p><p id="video-games"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Video Games">Legend of Zelda Video Games</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Nintendo Switch 2 just around the corner and both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom receiving performance upgrades, you can still pick up two of the best games the system still has to offer. And if you're waiting a bit to pick up the Switch 2, there are still plenty of other Legend of Zelda games to keep you occupied. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review">Skyward Sword HD</a> and the<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/19/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review"> Link's Awakening</a> remake are the best ways to revisit these older titles, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">Echoes of Wisdom</a> finally allows players to take control of Zelda. The first two Hyrule Warriors titles are incredibly fun action games, so be sure to check them out before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> releases on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p id="themed-accessories"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Themed Accessories">Legend of Zelda Controllers and Accessories</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now what if you already have all these Legend of Zelda games, what are you supposed to play them with to show your support of the franchise? Luckily there are tons of great Zelda-themed controllers and accessories to deck your system out with. From official Zelda Joy-Con (I have Skyward Sword HD set, they look incredible!) and pro controllers to third-party Nintendo Switch dock covers, you'll be sprucing up your game room setup in no time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more things like this without the Zelda theme, you can check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-accessories">best Switch accessories</a>.</p><p id="coffee-table-books"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Coffee Table Books">Legend of Zelda Encyclopedias</h2></p><p id="manga"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Manga">Legend of Zelda Manga</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are an impressive amount of Legend of Zelda manga and encyclopedias that look great a shelf or coffee table.

The encyclopedias are great collectibles for any Zelda fan, as they offer closer looks at the lore and history of Hyrule, complete with old concept art and sketches. </p><p id="tabletop-games"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tabletop Games">Legend of Zelda Puzzles, Cards, and Board Games</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are tons of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">great jigsaw puzzles for adults</a>, and the Legend of Zelda-themed puzzles are among our favorite. The 1.000-piece Hyrule map puzzle would look right at home framed over a fireplace once complete. You can also find a handful of classic board games with a Legend of Zelda skin, such as the Monopoly Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition or Legend of Zelda Uno.
