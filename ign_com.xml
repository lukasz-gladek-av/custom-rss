            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Every August, 70,000 gamers head to Indianapolis to attend the largest tabletop gaming convention in North America, <a href="https://www.gencon.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gen Con</u></a>. This year's event had large crowds packing the convention center and spilling into the nearby streets. Over 500 vendors filled the hall and a slew of new releases made their debut. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After four days of glorious dice rolling and cube pushing, 10 board games have emerged as the most compelling and unique titles I saw on offer. Most of these will be available in general retail shortly, and many are already open to preorder. This list is organized alphabetically.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't have time to read blurbs? These are them. If you do have time for blurbs, though, read on, because we have lots of info about why each one deserves a spot on this list.</p><p id="age-of-galaxy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Age of Galaxy">Age of Galaxy</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226507"><div id="226507" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Age of Galaxy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a difficult task cramming a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/genre/4x-strategy"><u>4X space conquest</u></a> into a small box, but this intriguing card game from Portal Games does just that. Each player controls an interstellar alliance of three unique factions drawn from a pool of 40 distinct options. This creates an asymmetric suite of abilities that informs and influences strategy. Utilizing a selection of multi-use cards, players explore new systems, settle planets, research advanced technologies, and build shiny galactic cruisers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While quick and sharp, the main focus is on executing tough decisions on how to use cards for either long-term benefits or short-term bursts. The inclusion of a solo mode is also a very nice addition that extends the life of the game. </p></div><p id="ace-of-spades"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Ace of Spades">Ace of Spades</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226508"><div id="226508" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ace of Spades</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games"><u>Solo gaming</u></a> is not a new concept, but it’s certainly exploded in recent years. Ace of Spades is the latest noteworthy title in this category, allowing a lone player to utilize a hand of cards to battle progressively tougher bosses. On the surface, it looks a lot like the tabletop version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>, but a closer gander reveals an interesting card game brimming with identity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wild setting helps as you head to Sweet Haven, Arizona seeking vengeance upon a vile necromancer. This leads to a cemetery where you are confronted by horrific denizens of hell intent on claiming your soul. Best of all, if you get tired of facing these terrors alone, you can call in a partner and play the game in two-player <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> mode. This works surprisingly well, even if the core engine feels more comfortable as a solo endeavor. This is a heavy-metal charged experience with distorted riffs and a thick tracklist of content.</p></div><p id="dying-message-card-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dying Message Card Game">Dying Message Card Game</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226506"><div id="226506" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dying Message Card Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the oddball entry of the list, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party game</a> for a collection of people where one is ruthlessly murdered and the others attempt to solve the crime. The twist here is that the victim tries to form clues from a randomly dealt allotment of cards. These contain symbols and characters of various types, requiring some creative thinking from the murdered participant. You’re given a few minutes to arrange the clue cards how you’d like, using them in conjunction with several suspect cards placed off to the side. The idea is that in the last moments of life, you’ve done what you can to leave a message for those who find you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After arranging the murder scene, the victim sprawls out on the table capturing their final position at time of death. The ensuing discussion as people try, often in vain, to tease out the meaning of the scene and decipher the clues can be riotous and engaging. Ultimately, the group guesses the murderer and either succeeds or fails. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a quirky design that absolutely requires the right set of people. Acquire the wrong crowd or a misaligned mood and it runs the risk of firing blanks. However, with some performative buy-in and a deductive attitude, Dying Message will hit its mark and result in a tabletop game that is wholly unique. </p></div><p id="high-tide"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="High Tide">High Tide</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226509"><div id="226509" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>High Tide</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Cozy games are all the rage right now. These are designs that present a relaxed experience which is more focused on meditative play and chill vibes over brutish competition. High Tide is the latest to break out in this category, selling out at Gen Con due to its stellar aesthetic and intriguing play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a small game, easily portable and completely unassuming. But it boasts a surprising amount of depth. Tiles are arranged randomly in a grid and players take turns stacking pieces upon ones that are higher. You may only move your own or neutral tiles, however. It teases out just the right level of strategic thought without tipping over into a cerebral grind. High Tide is a neat, novel work that stood out among the swathe of new games.</p></div><p id="lightning-train"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lightning Train">Lightning Train</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226510"><div id="226510" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lightning Train</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of the buzz surrounding Lightning Train is the pedigree of designer Paul Dennen. His previous work, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review"><u>Dune Imperium</u></a>, is a modern classic that has caught on like wildfire in the gaming community. This new release uses a similar concept of bag building as players add various resources to their bag in a strategic bid for developing their company. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal is to open train stations and railroad lines across North America, facilitating the delivery of goods to cities in need. The interesting detail is that players can share each other's infrastructure, sending cargo along another participant’s route. Both receive benefits from this cooperation, birthing a more nuanced and fuzzy strategic space. Unlike most games in the train category, Lightning Train is a more approachable design that slots in as a step up from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions">Ticket to Ride</a>.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-f"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the F">The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226511"><div id="226511" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pandemic-board-game-buying-guide"><u>Pandemic</u></a> has dozens of spinoff games at this point, and The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship appears to be just another iteration on Matt Leacock’s modern classic. That is not the case. This new design does contain some faint indicators of that previous game’s DNA, but it’s so much more than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a rich adventure game where players cooperate to take the One Ring to Mount Doom while evading the attention of Sauron. It’s part tower defense, with players recruiting Free World troops to battle invading Orcs and Southrons, and it’s part stealth thriller as Frodo must constantly sneak past armies and Nazgul. This is a tense affair, and it’s far more detailed and thematic than expected. In fact, it barely feels like a Pandemic property at all, which may take some people by surprise. Regardless, this is perhaps the most exciting game I played at Gen Con this year, and I’m enraptured by it.</p></div><p id="nature"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Nature">Nature</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226512"><div id="226512" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nature</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/91jYRn?object_uuid=fb854556-6e2a-4fc7-b3cb-9e9864335368&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0725LRH1W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Evolution</u></a>, the board game that captures the pressures of a dynamic ecosystem and how this influences species, has been wildly successful over the past 10 years of its life. It’s spawned numerous expansions and spinoffs, and may have just found its final state with Nature. This latest version of the system is pared down to a straightforward and approachable core game that retains the interesting card play of its predecessor. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the elements have been simplified, and it’s easier than ever to introduce this game to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">beginners</a> and non-hobbyist of any age. The magic resides in the game’s module system. Multiple add-ons exist that can be inserted to layer on sub-systems for flight, dinosaurs, and environments. This slightly increases the complexity, while boosting the strategic potential. A huge boon is that it changes up the feel of each session, and allows North Star Games to expand this properly infinitely. Nature is poised to have the longest legs of any game in the Evolution line.</p></div><p id="star-wars-battle-of-hoth"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Star Wars: Battle of Hoth">Star Wars: Battle of Hoth</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226513"><div id="226513" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: Battle of Hoth</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle of Hoth was the most talked about game heading into Gen Con. This was for good reason, as it puts a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">Star Wars board game</a> spin on the popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/27/days-of-wonder-announces-memoir-44-online"><u>Memoir 44 series</u></a> of games. Players take on the role of either the contingent of Imperial AT-ATs and snowtroopers, or the Rebel soldiers holding the line in order to protect the planet’s shield generator. Each takes turns playing cards from their hand to activate one portion of the battlefield, choosing from a selection of units occupying that flank. This restriction of the card system is a hallmark of the Memoir series, forcing tough decisions with only a modicum of rules overhead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">wargame</a> of sorts, it’s also a very streamlined and rules-light design. It’s a dramatic game, full of dice rolling and big moments where units are scattered and lines are broken. The Star Wars backdrop only helps.</p></div><p id="spooktacular"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Spooktacular">Spooktacular</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226514"><div id="226514" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Spooktacular</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the 1986 Spooktacular horror film festival, a freak accident occurs involving a lightning strike and a little bit of mystery. This results in dozens of monsters spanning the length of cinematic history being released from their fictional bonds. Now they are free to terrorize the festival goers and wreak havoc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This dynamite concept is realized through a highly asymmetric yet still smartly restrained system. Players take on the roles of movie monsters animated from the screen, competing to scare and devour guests. Each of the 20 included monsters is unique, featuring its own suite of abilities and cards. Yet, this is not an overstuffed game and the core processes are direct and sensible. The concoction here is magnificent, and this monster mash is full of delight and terror.</p></div><p id="vantage"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Vantage">Vantage</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226515"><div id="226515" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vantage</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vantage-board-game-review"><u>review of Vantage</u></a>, I declared it as possibly being the top game of 2025. It seems the crowds of Gen Con agreed, as this game was everywhere. This is a fully cooperative adventure where players crash land on an uncharted planet and must navigate its many mysteries in order to fulfill a collective mission. While this was clearly designed in the tradition of modern narrative adventure games, it goes about things its own way, massively improving on the pre-existing approach. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, it’s not a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign game</a>. Each individual session has a complete arc, which makes it far more approachable for most groups. It also does away with narrow objectives requiring players head to specific locations. Instead, many of the missions may be fulfilled in numerous ways. This highlights the game’s focus on creativity and freedom, allowing you to wander and explore whatever catches your eye. Finally, the mysteries of the world are special and worthy of the effort required. This is a fantastic game, and it was the closest thing to a singular standout title of the convention. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Charlie Theel is a tabletop games freelancer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january">announced it would shut down BioWare's Anthem</a> on January 12, 2026. And now, after a rocky six years for the game, its executive producer Mark Darrah has come forward to share details on exactly how Anthem came to be, and what went wrong in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_QY8F8z_4c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">part one of a planned multi-part video series</a>, Darrah spends an hour walking viewers through Anthem's development as he understands it from 2011 through the moment he took over as executive producer in 2017. Admittedly, his perspective isn't 100% complete, as Darrah was not working directly on the game throughout much of this time. But as a higher-up at BioWare and eventual executive producer, he was nonetheless positioned to see a lot more than most.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah was only executive producer for the final 16 months of the game's development. Even so, he opens the video by taking ownership of Anthem's failings and struggles:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some of this video is going to look like I'm trying to shift blame around, but ultimately the responsibility for this game does mostly rest on me," he says. "I have a list of people that I won't share that I also feel share blame on this project. Almost everyone on that list is more senior than me. The team worked really hard on this game, the team put a lot of excellent work on this game, and there are things that are amazing in this game even now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah goes on to walk through the first six years of development, outlining a number of pitfalls Anthem ran into along the way. He talks about Anthem's original conception at a time within EA where its executives believed single-player games were no longer desirable, leaving BioWare in a challenging position as an historically single-player-focused studio. BioWare lead Casey Hudson's early vision of Anthem, he says, was to do BioWare storytelling in a live service, always online format, and he proposed they come up with a new, never-before-seen business model to do it. That's how Anthem initially got momentum internally among EA's executive leadership. As Darrah puts it, "What if BioWare game, but it could do FIFA numbers?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, early on, Anthem ran into trouble because it struggled to get personnel to actually work on it. At one point, BioWare workers were shown a presentation intended for executives that outlined the game's more live service-y vision, and this put many developers off the idea. Additionally, as BioWare shipped Dragon Age: Inquisition, staff kept being moved to Mass Effect: Andromeda, leaving Anthem without the staff Hudson wanted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another trouble with Anthem highlighted by Darrah was the repeated shifting of what the game actually was. While the original pitch was to make something wholly unique, Darrah talks about how difficult that actually is when you can't offer reference points to developers or explain it to executives via familiar touchstones. So over time, Anthem did actually become more like familiar games such as Destiny and Borderlands.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In an early design document, Anthem was going to have six javelins. Where did this number come from? It got pulled out of someone's ass.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet another issue, says Darrah, was the level of secrecy involved. While he acknowledges it's important to keep things locked up to avoid leaks, there's a certain level to which he believes it's good to share details more widely. In the early days, he recalls Hudson would strategically share certain elements of Anthem within the wider organization, which allowed him to create excitement and gather feedback. But when Hudson left, no one stepped into that role, and Anthem became aggressively secretive. As a result, Darrah says, it was easier to hand-wave issues, tailor messaging to a very small group of people who were more susceptible to groupthink.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah also tells a pretty pointed story about how being too specific about expectations too early on can lead to disaster. Here's his full recounting of why Anthem didn't have six javelins when it launched:</p><blockquote>In a pretty early design document, Anthem stated that it was going to have six javelins. Where did this number come from? It basically got pulled out of someone's ass. I guess to be more fair, it was effectively broken down like this: We're going to have light, medium, and heavy javelins, so we're going to have two of each kind...and unfortunately this number, six, got presented in early 2017 to EA executives, that Anthem was going to have six javelins.</blockquote><blockquote>Pretty close to that presentation, the team realized that it couldn't do six javelins, for two primary reasons. One, because it couldn't completely figure out how to differentiate six different kinds of javelins, but also because it realized that it didn't have time to make six entirely different archetypes of gameplay. So now, the team is forced to present that no, in fact they're going to have four javelins at launch, and even though that six was based on nothing, was based on a number we said because it kind of seemed pretty logical at the time, but there's nothing behind that, became a source of immense pressure and anxiety from the executives.</blockquote><blockquote>I wouldn't be surprised to find out that one of the reasons that everything came to a head in 2017, with the massive changes that occurred on the project in 2017, culminating in me taking over the project, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that this was triggered by this change from six javelins to four. Again, that number six was based on nothing, but it was seen as the team falling apart.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah goes on to say that he remembers one of the cut javelins was a tanky paladin javelin that was more of a support class, while the other was a medium-class that he cannot remember at all — highlighting how nebulous the idea was to begin with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Toward the end of his video, Darrah talks about a push at EA in 2016 for all its AAA franchises to be "billion-dollar franchises", which would have involved Dragon Age releasing a game every two years. This push is also what sealed Anthem's fate as a live service game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darrah also cites three different occasions where he told leadership he thought they should push Anthem's release date out further, let Anthem define itself more, ship Andromeda first, and then bring Andromeda people over to finish Anthem. All three times, he says, he was turned down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_QY8F8z_4c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can watch Darrah's full video here.</a> He says he has at least a part two, and perhaps also a part three planned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem eventually launched in February of 2019 to middling reviews, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">with our own reviewer giving it a 6.5/10</a> and criticizing the grindiness, lack of polish and variety, and mismatched story. It fell short of EA's sales expectations, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anthem-development-ceases-bioware-to-focus-on-dragon-age-mass-effect">EA ceased active development in 2021.</a> EA will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january">shut the game down entirely</a> on January 12, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan, a well-established charity speedrunning contest, has removed Nintendo games from its upcoming Summer 2025 event, despite showcasing them for the past nine years. This is because they suddenly received a warning from Nintendo about using games without permission. The non-profit hopes to feature Nintendo titles again in future events, likely having to lodge individual applications on a per-game, per-event basis. But why has Nintendo suddenly done this now?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First held in 2016, RTA in Japan is a charity speedrunning event. Contestants apply to play through all or part of their chosen game, aiming to break records or just smash their personal best in front of an audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, a huge number of games have been featured in previous events, ranging from NES classics to recent titles. Their upcoming event, RTA in Japan Summer 2025, takes place in Tokyo from August 9-15, with proceeds going to Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières). The line-up includes Cuphead, Castlevania Dracula X, Final Fantasy IX, Silent Hill 2 remake and Wattam, to name a few. However, all the Mario and Kirby titles that have been part of the event in previous years are glaringly absent.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/gettyimages-2217743482-1754500679089.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Don't expect Nintendo games at Japan's biggest charity speedrunning event. Photo by RICHARD A. BROOKS/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On August 4, RTA in Japan posted an <a href="https://rtain.jp/rtaij/nintendo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official announcement</u></a> on their website, explaining exactly why the Summer 2025 event will not feature any Nintendo titles. According to the announcement, Nintendo pointed out to the non-profit organization on June 13 that “organizations require prior permission to use Nintendo games,” adding that RTA in Japan’s previous use of Nintendo titles was “unauthorized,” as permission was not obtained in advance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon receiving this notification, RTA in Japan began negotiations with Nintendo, in the hopes of using the Japanese game giants’ titles again for future events. As of August 4, it has been decided that RTA in Japan will apply for permission on a per-event, per-game basis, basically having to ask Nintendo every single time one of their contestants wants to play through a game (even if it has been featured at a previous RTA in Japan event). In their announcement, RTA in Japan revealed that they were unable to establish clear guidelines on this process in time for the Summer 2025 event, hence the decision to omit Nintendo titles this time round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan also apologized to those who had applied to speedrun Nintendo games for the Summer 2025 and had their hopes dashed. Considering the number of Nintendo titles including classic games like Super Mario 64, in previous RTA in Japan event line-ups, it seems likely that many applicants were disappointed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, this seems like over-protective Nintendo picking on a small charity event. However, the majority of Japanese-speaking users commenting on the matter via Twitter / X took a balanced view of the situation or even sided with Nintendo, with many saying they understood why Nintendo had taken this action now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RTA in Japan started off as a small, volunteer-run effort. However, over the past few years it has grown into a large public event with major sponsors, and the organizer is now registered as a general incorporated association, with all the bureaucracy and responsibility that brings. The event’s growing prominence is likely what made Nintendo sit up and take notice. Some <a href="https://x.com/wsSe4nneZyMWvW1/status/1952515228874559675" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenters</u></a> even said RTA in Japan should have been more responsible and proactively taken measures to ensure that they had Nintendo’s permission to avoid disruption to speedrun events (comments archived on <a href="https://togetter.com/li/2585429" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Togetter</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a side note, with the Summer 2025 event, RTA in Japan will be doing <a href="https://x.com/englishrestream/status/1949258455589548514" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>restreams of speedruns with English commentary</u></a> for the first time, making the event more accessible to viewers overseas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by RICHARD A.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken spinoff <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-tag-tournament">Tekken Tag Tournament</a> won over a generation of fans not just for coming out alongside the PS2 in the year 2000 (and having an amazing Tekken Bowl minigame built in), but for being a quality Tekken game in its own right. A sequel followed in 2011, but since then Bandai Namco has remained quiet on the prospect of a series return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is now the time, given tag fighting games are back in vogue with the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a> in the works, for Tekken Tag Tournament to finally return?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We asked Kohei Ikeda (Nakatsu), game director on Tekken 8, Katsuhiro Harada, Tekken Project director, and Michael Murray, Tekken 8 producer exactly that. Harada’s response makes for interesting reading for fighting game fans. He said, essentially, that a new Tekken Tag Tournament would be too much for casual fighting game fans to contend with because it would force players to learn multiple complex characters and how they work together. And so, it’s far more likely for Tekken Tag Tournament to pop up as a separate mode within a standard Tekken game, should Bandai Namco ever decide to return to it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Back in '99 when I made the original Tag Tournament… each character has so many moves in a 3D fighter, right, compared to these other games that there's so much to learn just for one character,” Harada began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then to pair that with two, even though back then in Tag 1, a lot of the characters were called compatible or you'd have versions that look different, but they share a similar type of move list. Whereas the Tekken series progressed, the characters became more unique in their move sets, etc. So it's even more involved to try to learn and master a character, and then another one on top of that. And then when you throw in the combination of the two and your opponent's characters, there's just so much more knowledge that's necessary to enjoy the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the hardcore, they ate it up, for example, in Tag 2. But for your average player, it was very hard to gain a more casual audience, I guess you could say. So if we were to do it again rather than have a standalone game, it would probably be better to have it as some kind of a separate mode within a normal Tekken franchise, right?”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/gettyimages-2221602697-1754482065283.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Harada has thoughts on a potential Tekken Tag Tournament return. Photo by Sia KAMBOU / AFP.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Michael Murray, Tekken 8 producer, chimed in to agree with Harada’s point about tag fighters being harder to learn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nakatsu and myself, we probably grew up in the arcades playing while he was making Tag 1, so we really enjoy the game,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I guess we're more on the hardcore side of being able to use several characters and such, and we loved Tag 2. But we are fully aware that there were just so many people that couldn't get a handle on it because of all the knowledge that's involved.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it seems Tekken Tag Tournament is consigned to history. But Tekken 8 continues. It’s worth reading the interview in full to get an idea of what’s to come, and what Harada and co have up their sleeve for the coming years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A group of rhythm game genre veterans has re-established the RedOctane Games brand, via a new studio set to launch a fresh Guitar Hero-style title. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the name RedOctane sounds familiar, that's because it was the original studio that partnered with Harmonix to create Guitar Hero back in the early 2000s. That earlier version of RedOctane was then quickly acquired by Activision (which also ultimately shut it down).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, this new incarnation of RedOctane has been established as part of Embracer, and will be led by Simon Ebejer, who worked as production director on various Guitar Hero titles during the franchise's Neversoft heyday, before later moving on to Vicarious Visions and Blizzard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game won't be Guitar Hero, DJ Hero, Guitar Freaks or Rockband," RedOctane teased in a <a href="https://www.redoctane.games/https/redoctanegamessquarespacecom/news/blog-1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> today. "This is something new. A rhythm game built with love, by people who care, with the community at its core in this fast-changing modern world we live in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We firmly believe the expert here is the community and a new generation of development talent, the folks that have kept the lights on these last few years."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Staffed by a mix of new and veteran developers, RedOctane's rhythm project will be overseen by brothers Charles and Kai Huang, founders of the original RedOctane, as part of a special advisory board. Further details on the game, including a name and project release date, currently remain under wraps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn't the first attempt at a rhythm genre revival. Back in late 2023, Epic Games launched <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite-festival">Fortnite Festival</a>, a Guitar Hero-style mode developed by Harmonix (now a part of Epic) that allowed players to tap along via standard controllers or more recent instrument accesories. The offering is still kept updated with weekly tunes, but has not attracted the same player numbers as Fortnite's main battle royale modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-fortnites-biggest-challenge-is-convincing-people-its-the-everything-game-and-not-just-a-battle-royale">Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney told IGN earlier this year</a>, "more just in Battle Royale and elsewhere. Our next step is to figure out music at a large scale." Now, it seems like Epic Games and Harmonix has some competition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
