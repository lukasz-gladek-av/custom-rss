            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans think they've uncovered proof that 2009 action game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/prototype">Prototype</a> could be getting a new lease of life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game has mostly remained dormant on Steam since its release 16 years ago, eagle-eyed fans spotted a flurry of updates behind the scenes via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/10150/subs/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>, as well as a revealing datamine effort that has discovered a mysterious change to the game's credits that adds in remaster studio, Iron Galaxy, and a curious reference to Ubisoft Connect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all, though. "So one of the OG modders for the game data mined the recent update and has found a lot of interesting things," StanleyMitchel explained on the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>subreddit</u></a>. "For Prototype 1, they have added some test maps and quite a few new names in the credits. There might be some hope for a remaster after all."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">They then linked to <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/WV75q76C/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>two text versions of the game's credit roll</u></a>, which highlights the changes. These include a new "downloadable content" team, another team for "Ubisoft Connect Version," "Activision Localization," "Demonware," and finally, "Iron Galaxy Studios." In all, 753 changes were made to the original credits list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One of the new studios in the credits worked in [sic] the Spyro remasters," Nixson wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>. "This is 100% confirmed. They're remastering the games. Likely using the same engine/code or some hybrid like Oblivion. There's a lot of new names in the credits, mainly other Activision studios," they added. "I'm starting to think the new Prototype game in-the-works thing may be true."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the strange Ubisoft Connect reference? Don't forget that when Microsoft acquired Activision as part of its historic $68.7 billion deal in 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-a-complete-timeline-of-events"><u>Microsoft agreed to sell Activision's cloud gaming rights to Ubisoft</u></a>. So while none of this is confirmed, it's possible Prototype is one of the games Ubisoft will be adding to its subscription service. Watch this space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prototype sees you take control of Alex Mercer, a dark, genetically mutated shape-shifter with no memory of his past, hell-bent on solving the mystery of his existence as he tears through New York City. We had a good time with it when it released way back in 2009, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/06/10/prototype-review">calling Prototype</a> a "game with many cool features [but] lack[ing] many of the finishing touches that make for a great and memorable game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield Studios has outlined the roadmap for content coming to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> in Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first major free update, Season 1 will "deliver a game-changing amount of brand new content every month," kicking off on October 28 (Battlefield 6 itself comes out October 10). There will be three phases: Rogue Ops, which brings new map Blackwell Fields, new weapons, and a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint; California Resistance, which introduces new SoCal map Eastwood and a 8v8 mode called Sabotage — that's coming on November 18; and the final phase of the first season, Winter Offensive, which rolls out on December 9. That includes "seasonal map" Empire State and an unannounced themed event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The development team said all seasonal content will be released on a "consistent basis," adding maps, modes, weapons, and more, with all "gameplay-impacting features free or earnable as part of our commitment to fair play and access for all players."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/01/screenshot-2025-10-01-at-10-02-34-1759309362444.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 Season 1 overview.

Image credit: EA.</figcaption></figure></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Blackwell Fields - Map, Support for All Combat Sizes, Land and Air Vehicles</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as the fires of war from the single-player campaign start to cool, Pax Armata double agents launch a series of attacks on NATO targets. These strikes begin at a recently recommissioned American air base in the California badlands.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Strikepoint - Mode, Designed for 4v4 Combat</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Strikepoint is an intense, small team tactical mode where a squad fights another squad across multiple rounds to capture a key objective. There is only one life each round, so make it count.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">APC Traverser Mark 2 - Land Vehicle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This Armored Personnel Carrier seats four: one driver, one roof gunner and two backseat passenger side gunners, serving mostly as an infantry support vehicle.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">SOR-300C  - Carbine Rifle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A low rate of fire, subcompact carbine chambered in the higher damage .300 Blackout ammunition compared to the platform’s 5.56 version.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mini Fix - Sniper Rifle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember the Scout Elite? Then consider this  lightweight, bolt-action sniper rifle designed for the aggressive Recon soldier a “Mini Fix” to your needs.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">GGH-22 - Sidearm</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A high-capacity, high fire rate and low damage pistol meant to bail out a soldier when their primary (and in the case of Assault, both their primaries) run dry.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rail Cover &amp; LPVO - Attachments</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Available for a variety of rifles and light machine guns, these two attachments - the Rail Cover and the  Low Powered Variable Optic (LPVO) - are the first of several to drop after launch to make you rethink how you spend those attachment points.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">California Resistance - Launching November 18</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 1’s second phase is around the liberation of SoCal; prepare for combat on a new map and mode, as well as with two new weapons and more.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/01/screenshot-2025-10-01-at-10-02-05-1759309362445.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 map Eastwood.

Use your creativity and your arsenal to do so. Each team has one round each to go on offense and defense; the team who successfully detonates the most sites wins.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Battle Pickups - Feature</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Veterans will be familiar with Battle Pickups: unlike weapons that appear in a loadout, Battle Pickups are high-tech, powerful weaponry that are limited in ammo and availability throughout a given map. Where will these pickups live exactly? That’s up to you and your squad to find out…</p><h3 data-cy="title3">DB-12 - Shotgun</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A dual barrel pump-action shotgun that feeds from two different tubes. One trigger pull fires a shell (or slug) from one barrel, a second trigger pull fires the other, then the pump action rechambers both barrels.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">M327 Trait - Sidearm</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">High damage with a low rate of fire, this eight-round revolver is strong up close with a considerable damage drop-off compared to its .44 Magnum comrade.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Slim Handstop - Attachment</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The third attachment to come in Season 1, this grip offers an alternative choice for underbarrel choices with its unique blend of ergonomic and handling changes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winter Offensive - Launching December 9</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 1’s final phase challenges your squad to break through an icy stalemate - expect the Empire State to freeze over alongside several other wintery updates.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/01/screenshot-2025-10-01-at-10-01-55-1759309362446.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 map Empire State.

Gear up, stay warm, and take complete control of the borough with this limited time visual update to the Empire State map.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ice Lock - Limited Time Event</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ice Lock looms…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Limited Time Event is centered around a mechanic called Freeze, which is a gameplay modifier that is only active in specific experiences.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ice Climbing Axe - Melee</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Designed to make an enemy’s blood run cold or pick through more delicate environmental pieces, expect this new melee tool to compliment this category typically reserved for knives and the sledgehammer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 releases on October 10, with pre-loads available from October 3.
