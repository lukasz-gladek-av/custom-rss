His sheathed blades rest at his side in a sling, a bold reminder to his enemies of his roots in the Hokushin-Itto-ryu school of swordplay. His intricately detailed haori and hakama ripple in the wind, embodying a legacy that shapes his journey. Every detail echoes past traditions, adorning a hero with hope to bridge the past and the future together. His base evokes a timeless Edo street, stone pathways flanked by traditional lanterns with Ryoma forging the pathway of change in a time of transformation.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Rise of the Ronin: Ryoma Statue is cast in polyresin and sculpted by Bigshot Toyworks, with prototyping and paint by Gentle Giant Ltd.

In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rise-of-the-ronin-review">IGN's review of Rise of the Ronin</a>, Will Borger wrote, "Rise of the Ronin marries a cool historical setting, Team Ninja’s mastery of tough-but-fair combat, and some smart RPG design to make a game that is immediately compelling, and even more fun with friends. It’s full of cool little touches, whether it’s throwing something at an enemy with the grappling rope or dropping from your glider onto your horse. Unfortunately, it’s also a game full of map clutter, bloated systems, and a truly absurd amount of junk loot, and the time I spent clearing out everything that didn’t spark joy and dealing with all these non-essential systems made me pine for a leaner, meaner, more focused game. Rise of the Ronin is excellent when it has the courage to be itself and lean into its challenging, rewarding fighting; too often, however, it feels stuck in indecision, torn between what it wants to be and what it feels it’s expected to be, and not even the best samurai can overcome that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.
