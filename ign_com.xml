            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Get ready for the non-VR version of the "next evolution of Alien combat" this September.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN can exclusively reveal a brand-new gameplay trailer for Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One: Evolved Edition, the previously VR-exclusive shooter that is set to be released on PS5 and PC on September 30, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new footage, which you can see below and is filled with blood and snow, shows plenty of Xenomorphs stalking the main character - ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks - and the terrifying and exhilarating action that will follow, complete with Pulse Rifles, Motion Trackers, jump scares, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the story, for those who didn't play Alien: Rogue Incursion when it first launched on PlayStation VR2 and PCVR via Steam in December 2024 (And on Meta Quest in February), it is set on the planet Purdan (LV-354) in Gemini Exoplanet Solutions' Castor's Cradle research facility that is now "hauntingly desolate." Oh, and it's set between the events of Alien and Aliens and Zula will be traveling with a Synthetic companion named Davis 01.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new version features everything included in the original plus "elevated visuals, immersive environments, and deadlier Xenomorphs." It also runs at 60 FPS and promises to be the "next evolution of Alien combat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alien-rogue-incursion-review">review of the original Alien: Rogue Incursion,</a> we said it is "a faithful and entertaining stab at bringing Alien to virtual reality. The excellent story, spot-on Alien environments, and creepy Xenomorphs keep the horrifying times going throughout its eight-hour duration, even when repetitive combat, predictable AI, and the odd bug here and there make it clear this is the first attempt that it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But while there’s plenty of room for this budding series to grow, I can already happily recommend Rogue Incursion as a strong proof of concept to Alien fans and newcomers alike – one that’s left me eagerly awaiting Part Two."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Part Two, we don't know much besides that it is currently in development and that it "continues Zula's story, pitting her against deadlier enemies and more difficult challenges."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from SDCC, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-coming-to-ign-san-diego-comic-con-2025-live-show">all the details of our live-show</a> that will feature Project Hail Mary, King of the Hill, Peacemaker, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.
