Saving in Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode is only available to solo players, and you can only save one solo match at a time, which means if you leave the match without saving, there is no save to return to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MrRoflWaffles, who has 2.11 million subscribers on YouTube, set out to break his personal best of round 141 and to hit round 200 before the disastrous mistake put an end to the attempt.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">do NOT do this on round 147 in black ops 6 zombies 😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/QftwaSjISE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/QftwaSjISE</a></p>— Milo (@MrRoflWaffles) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrRoflWaffles/status/1854317500126626153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The disaster began when a confident MrRoflWaffles signaled his intention to save and quit then load back into the match. "This is how this works chat," he declared. "You quit the game, you reload in, and you try not to get bugs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MrRoflWaffles, perhaps moving too fast through Black Ops 6’s pause menu for his own good, accidentally selected ‘leave match’ rather than ‘save and quit.’ Despite the ‘leave game?’ warning pop up, MrRoflWaffles proceeded, putting an end to the run forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, MrRoflWaffles’ chat couldn’t believe what they’d witnessed, with various messages of disbelief littering the screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Realization then kicked in, and, as you’d expect, MrRoflWaffles couldn’t believe what he’d done. “I left?!” he said. “What?! What?! What?! Are you kidding me?! You’re kidding me! You’re joking chat. Noooooooo!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“12 hours of my life,” MrRoflWaffles eventually sighed after a period of silence. “The bugs won. I’d rather have fought the bugs! I can’t believe I just did that. I’m in pain.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, who’s to blame? MrRoflWaffles for accidentally pressing the wrong button, or developer Treyarch for putting the 'leave match' and 'save and quit' buttons right next to each other in the Zombies pause menu? For his part, MrRoflWaffles said it was entirely his mistake, but called on Treyarch to make the leave match button a 'hold for three seconds' selection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I really want to blame Treyarch for putting the leave button next to the save button,” MrRoflWaffles said. “I want to blame them, but honestly this is my fault. I pressed the button.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/07/screenshot-2024-11-07-095630-1730977686676.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">MrRoflWaffles reacts in disbelief after accidentally ending his Black Ops 6 Zombies run.

But, alas, the game remembered. No save files were available upon loading back in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A clearly devastated MrRoflWaffles decided to end his stream early, saying that starting all over again “tilted” would only cause him to die early on in a subsequent run. But he insisted he would continue his bid to hit round 200 — perhaps once he’s had a lie down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking on Zombies mode yourself?

The recently released character creator demo saw life sim fans recreate real people and pop culture characters —  check out some of the best attempts in the slideshow of images below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Inzoi Players Recreating Real People and Pop Culture Characters</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a letter to the game’s community, producer and director Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim apologized to fans for the delay, citing “a commitment to delivering the experience fans expect and deserve for a strong foundation of inZOI, following overwhelming positive feedback from the community over the past few months.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The letter in full is below:</p><blockquote>Hi everyone,</blockquote><blockquote>This is Kjun, Producer &amp; Director of inZOI.</blockquote><blockquote>First, I want to express my sincerest gratitude to inZOI fans around the world. Your immense love and interest mean everything to us. I was especially touched by the wonderful reception we received at gamescom, and it was incredible to see everyone creating such unique Zois during our 'inZOI: Character Studio' demo period.</blockquote><blockquote>Initially, we were uncertain about introducing 'Canvas' to the world, not knowing how many people would actually participate. However, the turnout was amazing, with an enormous number of uploads. Seeing so much engagement brought us immense happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with inZOI. Your feedback and insights made us realize the responsibility we have to provide players with the most complete experience possible.</blockquote><blockquote>This message is about that realization. After reviewing your feedback from inZOI: Character Studio and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have decided to release inZOI in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we couldn't bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving inZOI the best possible start.</blockquote><blockquote>It's said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care required to nurture a child to adulthood is how I see our journey with inZOI — a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date reflects our commitment to building a stronger foundation for inZOI, so we can embark on this journey in the best way possible.</blockquote><blockquote>Until the release date, we'll continue working to improve any areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation. Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for a long time to come. We'll keep you updated on our development progress, and we hope you'll join us on this journey toward inZOI's Early Access and beyond.</blockquote><blockquote>With love,</blockquote><blockquote>Kjun</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-first-preview-beautiful-and-full-of-potential-but-still-a-bit-hollow"><u>In IGN's preview if Inzoi</u></a>, we said: "The game’s world is extremely beautiful but somewhat empty in motion, permeated by a lack of grounding lore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
