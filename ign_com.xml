Some affected players are hoping they will see lost loot return once the issues are fixed. “Was just rubber banding and died because it was of course in front of a shredder, and now stuck on the loading screen while trying to join a new lobby,” said one affected player.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders Headwinds Update 'Bird City' Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unfortunate timing for Arc Raiders in particular, given the DDoS attacks come hot on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-big-arc-raiders-update-of-2026-adds-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-bird-city-and-more-tomorrow">Arc Raiders’ Headwinds update</a>, which added a solo vs. squads matchmaking option, a Bird City map condition, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Embark said it’s working on a hotfix that will “solve some of the issues and unintended changes” made by the Headwinds update. That should be out later today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders is one of the biggest games in the world, having sold an incredible 12.4 million copies in just 10 weeks. The enormously popular extraction shooter has seen impressive staying power, too, setting a new concurrent player peak of 960,000 in January 2026. To put Arc Raiders' success into context, the similarly priced Helldivers 2 set a record for the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time by selling 12 million in 12 weeks. Arc Raiders, which launched on Xbox as well as PC and PlayStation, hit the 12 million sales mark even faster. It's done so well so quickly, that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-surprise-cameo-on-south-park-shows-just-how-close-to-the-wire-trey-parker-and-matt-stone-make-each-episode"><u>it crossed over into the world of South Park with a surprise appearance that was put together in just a few days</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Headwinds is the first of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026">a four-phase roadmap</a> that has content scheduled out through April 2026. Next on the docket is the Shrouded Sky update, which adds a new map condition, Arc threat, player project, map update, Raider Deck, and more sometime in February. Flashpoint will then arrive in March with another map condition and Scrappy update, with Riven Tides rounding things out with a new map and a new large Arc in April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this has tempted you into giving Arc Raiders a try, check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Best_ARC_Raiders_Settings"><u>best settings</u></a>, find out what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Skill_Tree_and_Best_Abilities"><u>skills we recommend unlocking</u></a> first, and see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/How_to_Deliver_Field_Depot_Crates"><u>how to earn loot by delivering field depot crates</u></a>… or you can just wait for the inevitable TV show or movie adaptation, although Embark says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-arc-raiders-movie-and-tv-show-offers-are-already-coming-in-and-the-boss-of-embark-studios-sounds-up-for-it"><u>it hasn't been swayed just yet</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
