            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Time to level up.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The November 17 release date on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373990/Solo_Leveling_ARISE_OVERDRIVE/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive/9mvhcq7cjx01" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Xbox PC</a> for action RPG Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE is quickly approaching, and to celebrate, it will have a booth at TwitchCon in San Diego this week where players can try out a new demo and win special merch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE lets you step into the world of the massively popular Solo Leveling franchise, centering on protagonist Sung Jinwoo. It’s been built for PC and console (it’s scheduled to release on consoles in 2026) and includes the original story along with new adventures that are exclusive to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with the series, it takes place in a world where people with supernatural abilities known as Hunters must protect mankind from a never-ending onslaught of monsters. Usually, Hunters’ abilities and strength level are determined when their powers first manifest. But Jinwoo gets a unique ability: he can level up. So even though he starts off as a low-tier Hunter, he can grow more powerful the more foes he defeats. And now he’s on a personal quest to become the world’s strongest Hunter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It should be pretty obvious why this premise lends itself to a game, it basically already has RPG progression systems baked in. Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE builds on that base with a skill tree that branches into eight different job advancements. Through the course of the webtoon, Jinwoo transforms into the Ultimate Monarch of Shadows, and now you can experience his evolution for yourself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can see in the video above, Jinwoo can switch between weapons and combine basic attacks with flashy special abilities to build up combos. But you can’t just mindlessly attack, you need to keep an eye on enemies and respond to their strikes and AoE attacks. You can execute perfectly timed parries or dodges to cancel out damage and unleash powerful counterattacks to keep the fast pace flowing and combo meter climbing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However you defeat enemies, they’ll drop loot that you can use to craft new weapons, including ones pulled directly from the original webtoon, like Kasaka’s Venom Fang and the Demon King’s Daggers. There are several weapon types available, and your combat style will be determined by your weapon and skill tree choices. That makes for a variety of styles, like in the original story, giving you the opportunity to try out different options and figure out what works best for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll face off against a ton of enemies and bosses solo, but some are too strong for even a leveled-up Jinwoo to deal with. That’s where multiplayer comes in. You can team up in four-player co-op raids to take on commanders that series veterans will recognize, and you can play as Jinwoo or one of the other available Hunters with their own set of unique skills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re interested in seeing more, don’t miss TwitchCon, which starts Friday, October 17 and will be open until Sunday, October 19. The Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE booth is open to the public, so any in-person attendees can come by and try out the demo. And there will be some popular streamers playing the game at the booth (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/iitztimmy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">iiTzTimmy</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/RDCGaming" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">RDCGaming</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/esfandtv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">EsfandTV</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/agent00" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Agent00</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/extraemily" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">ExtraEmily</a>, and more).
