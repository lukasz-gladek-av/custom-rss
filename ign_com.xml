Online retailers generally have more inventory, and you don't have to leave the comfort of your home. Some stores even offer the option to secure your purchase and then pick it up when you're ready. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for the best places to buy a new Xbox online, we've got you covered. Read on for a full breakdown of pricing on current Xbox consoles, the best time to buy an Xbox Series X or Series S, information on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-xbox-game-pass-cost">Xbox Game Pass</a>, as well as where to trade in your existing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-xbox-console-release-dates-in-order">Xbox consoles</a> and games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Xbox Consoles Online</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to buy a new Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, or Xbox One, here's where you can purchase Xbox consoles online in 2024. If you're looking for savings, it might be worth waiting for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-deals-black-friday-what-to-expect-2024">Black Friday Xbox sales</a>, but you can also check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals">latest Xbox deals</a> for discounts sooner rather than later.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Series X</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft's flagship console, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-review">Xbox Series X</a>, retails for an MSRP of<strong> $499.99</strong> and features 1TB of storage and true 4K gaming. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Series S</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-s-review">Xbox Series S</a> is the less-powerful, all-digital variant of Microsoft's current console lineup that starts at an MSRP of <strong>$299.99</strong>.

You can also get the Carbon Black Series S console, which starts at an MSRP of <strong>$349.99</strong> and comes with 1TB of storage space.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox One</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/xbox-one">Xbox One</a> is Microsoft's previous generation console that released in 2013. While it's not currently being manufactured, you can still find refurbished models online at some retailers. There are three standard models available: the original Xbox One, a slimmer redesign called Xbox One S, and the more powerful Xbox One X. It's worth noting that Xbox Series X|S are backwards compatible with Xbox One games, so your money may be better spent on the current generation consoles.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Much Does a New Xbox Cost?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox has a variety of different consoles at different price points to satisfy the needs of any gamer. The flagship console, Xbox Series X, retails for <strong>$499.99 </strong>but can also be financed via Xbox All Access at select retailers for <strong>$36.99/mo for 24 months</strong> which also includes 2 years of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. It's worth noting that you'll need to qualify for a line of credit with Citizen's Pay Line if you opt for Xbox All Access.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox Series S, the smaller, all-digital console, retails for <strong>$299.99</strong> for the 512GB model or <strong>$349.99</strong> for the 1TB model.

On the plus side, Black Ops 6 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record">did end up being available through Game Pass on Day One</a>. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Game Pass Core</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox Game Pass Core is <strong>$9.99/month</strong> and includes online multiplayer for Xbox consoles, a catalog of 25 games to play, and exclusive member discounts and deals.

To see the games available to you on this membership, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/game-pass-ultimate">IGN Playlist of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate games</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Best Time to Buy an Xbox</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally, the best time to buy an Xbox console is during major yearly shopping events such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-cyber-monday-deals-and-sales-2023">Cyber Monday</a>, and the various <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-deals-for-october-prime-day-2023">Amazon Prime Day</a> sales. Often times, you can scoop up the console at a discount, or purchase limited-time bundles that include additional games, Xbox Game Pass trials, accessories, or in-game content.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Trade in Your Old Xbox</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to trade in your old Xbox consoles, you can do so at select retailers in-store and online. Often, the most widely available retailers are <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/trade/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameStop</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/services/best-buy-trade-in/pcmcat133600050011.c?id=pcmcat133600050011" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy</a>. However, you can also trade your used devices online at retailers such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/l/9187220011" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/microsoft-trade-in" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some retailers will offer you cash for your used goods, while others may provide you with a gift card that can be used in-store and online. This is a great way to offload your old gaming gear and get some money that you can put towards a newer console and games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While trading devices in at retailers will often net you the lowest amount for your used consoles, there are also online marketplaces such as eBay, Craigslist, and OfferUp that may fetch higher prices, but you'll often be responsible for packing and shipping costs, or be required to meet someone in person for the transaction, the latter of which poses its own risks.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Trade in Xbox Games</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to Xbox console trade ins, you can also trade your existing games in at specific retailers. The most widely available retailer accepting used video games is <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/trade/?cgid=video-games&amp;tileView=list" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameStop</a>, but they are notorious for giving you pennies on the dollar for your pre-owned titles. However, if you're looking for an easy way to offload some of your library for cash or in-store credit, this is a convenient option. You can always look up the expected trade-in value on GameStop's website before heading into a store, so you know exactly how much you'll receive. Additionally, you can trade in your used games online through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/l/9187220011" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> in exchange for an Amazon gift card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matthew Adler is a Commerce, Features, Guides, News, Previews, and Reviews writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokemon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Flip a coin until you get tails.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As the current Pokemon TCG Pocket meta continues to shake out, players are quickly figuring out which decks, cards, and strategies are powerful, which are safe, and which are...wildly inconsistent. And there's one card that everyone seems to agree they hate, whether they're using it or facing an opponent with it: Misty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Misty is a Supporter card, essentially a type of card that can be played once per turn to give yourself an advantageous effect. Misty is explicitly designed for use in decks featuring water-type Pokemon, and comes with the following effect: "Choose one of your water-type Pokemon, and flip a coin until you get tails. For each hads, take a water-type Energy from your Energy Zone and attach it to that Pokemon." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon need energy to use attacks on opponents, but typically you can only attach one energy to one Pokemon per turn. So the idea behind Misty is to quickly power up a single water-type Pokemon so it can use an Energy-intensive attack right away, rather than having to wait two, three, four, or more turns to blast away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Misty's efficacy depends entirely on coin flips, meaning she can either be completely useless (if you flip tails right away) or so overpowered as to be ridiculous (if you flip more heads than you need). So of course, people who are using Misty in their decks are complaining about constantly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1fu4o9f/misty_card/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flipping tails </a>right away, and people who are facing Misty are posting...well, this:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/screenshot-2024-11-06-130544-1730919966599.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: u/Money_Tap2401 on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gi1rlo/ok_misty/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gi1rlo/ok_misty/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The frustrations with Misty's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gc6uyu/misty_is_a_lie/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">luck-heavy</a> potential are resulting in a lot of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1fw52i6/is_misty_badly_designed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussions</a> as to whether or not the card design needs to be changed.

The biggest issue players are citing apart from her luck-heavy mechanic is that if a Misty-user gets luck and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gi9jex/how_are_you_supposed_to_come_back_against_a_turn/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">draws her turn one</a>, they can then use her to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1fw3zl8/misty_lets_you_attack_t1_and_its_bs/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially attack their opponent on turn one</a>. Typically, players are not able to attack on the first turn due to the game prohibiting attaching an energy on turn one, a fairness mechanic intended to ensure going second isn't a massive disadvantage.
