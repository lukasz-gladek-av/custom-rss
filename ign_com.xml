It also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laid off 17 people earlier in the year</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-is-latest-embracer-studio-to-suffer-layoffs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 others back in 2023</a> as a part of a massive restrcturing at parent company Embracer Group, which acquired Crystal in 2022. At the time of the acquisition, Crystal Dynamics had 273 employees across its Austin, Bellevue, and San Mateo offices. It's unclear how many employees it now has.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the moment, Tomb Raider is the only known project in the works at Crystal Dynamics, with Amazon Games expected to publish. Earlier this year, it released Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered, and last year remasters of the first three Tomb Raiders and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 and 2. Its last wholly original project was Marvel's Avengers in 2020, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-avengers-review-2">which received lukewarm reviews</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to Crystal Dynamics for comment and more details on the cuts, but the company pointed us back to its LinkedIn statement with no further comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
