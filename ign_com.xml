While the set is home to some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-best-cards-to-chase-and-buy-today"><u>fantastic chase cards all of its own</u></a>, it’s also led to some price increases on cards that play nicely with the new Universes Beyond additions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only that, while there's been a rapid price increase, none of these cards are overly expensive to buy standalone on the secondary market right now (maxing out at $15 at most). From card draw engines to Saga skippers, these are three of the best cards you can snap up right now, and what to use them for.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Harmonic Prodigy - Modern Horizons 2</h2><div catalogid="a45e6fa8-6038-4b99-9157-52f0f0917838" id="223122"><div id="223122" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Magic The Gathering Harmonic Prodigy</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Harmonic Prodigy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Harmonic Prodigy has seen a significant price jump because it pairs so nicely with <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAxBY?object_uuid=83c80e00-0500-4094-9cd1-495eceb3eeab&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi Ornitier</a>, a great Commander option from the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the Prowess, Harmonic Prodigy triggers abilities of a Shaman or Wizard a second time. Not only does that mean Vivi can grow in power and turn into a mana source, but it also means you can ping rivals for an extra point of damage, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's up by +272.96% in the past year, and +131.78% this month, currently sitting at around <a href="https://zdcs.link/985P3R?object_uuid=83c80e00-0500-4094-9cd1-495eceb3eeab&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$11.45 market value</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Barbara Wright - Universes Beyond: Doctor Who</h2></div><div catalogid="a45e6fa8-6038-4b99-9157-52f0f0917838" id="223123"><div id="223123" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Magic The Gathering Barbara Wright</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Barbara Wright</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, I have no interest in Doctor Who (but my editor does!). Still, even if you don’t like timey-wimey sci-fi shows, Barbara Wright is certainly now worth a look for any Final Fantasy decks you’re building.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Her History Teacher perk allows players to select a step on a Saga (including Final Fantasy Summons) and jump right to it. That means you can get to <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJg81n?object_uuid=83c80e00-0500-4094-9cd1-495eceb3eeab&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bahamut’s Megaflare</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeb83l?object_uuid=83c80e00-0500-4094-9cd1-495eceb3eeab&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Primal Odin’s Zantetsuken</a> without delay. Sure, it’ll mean your Summons are gone sooner than they otherwise would be, but let's be honest, your opponents aren’t going to know what hit them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She's up an unbelievable +4230% in the past year, +2835.71% in the past three months, and even +415.48% just this month. With <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgrZl?object_uuid=83c80e00-0500-4094-9cd1-495eceb3eeab&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">market currently sitting at $4.58</a>, she's still pretty affordable, but considering it was $0.15 in March 2025, that's some big stonking gains. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Danny Pink - Universes Beyond: Doctor Who</h2></div><div catalogid="a45e6fa8-6038-4b99-9157-52f0f0917838" id="223124"><div id="223124" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Magic The Gathering Danny Pink</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Danny Pink</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More Doctor Who? (Sigh) OK, but it’s still a great inclusion if you’re a big fan of drawing cards (and who isn’t?). He's up 189.84% just in the past few months, rising to <a href="https://zdcs.link/91j18A?object_uuid=83c80e00-0500-4094-9cd1-495eceb3eeab&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$12.68 market value</a>, up from $4.33 in March. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Danny Pink is a 4-cost 4/3 on his own, but he also gives other creatures +1/+1, which then allows for additional draw. If you’ve been keeping an eye on the latest batch of Commander Decks, you’ll know where this is going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Put simply, Danny Pink gets out of hand quickly when used in the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXW4NB?object_uuid=83c80e00-0500-4094-9cd1-495eceb3eeab&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Counter Blitz</a> precon deck. Its mix of additional counters, and its focus on proliferating said counters, means you can rack up a frankly obscene amount of card draw per turn.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where Can I Buy Final Fantasy x Magic: The Gathering?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy x Magic: The Gathering cards can be found non-foil in both Play Boosters and Collector Boosters, with foil versions of the cards only available in Collector Boosters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, the best avenue to get the cards you want, without spending an absolute fortune, is by purchasing singles, so keep that in mind as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're here for FF6’s Terra, FF7’s Cloud, FF10’s Tidus, or FF14’s Warrior of Light, these sets are stacked with heroes and villains from across the series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s just the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">Commander Decks</a>, the full release runs deep.
