Some of the original criteria did not fully reflect that intent, and we have updated them to make their difficulty and purpose clearer.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first set of changes went live today, November 5, through a server-side update and are available immediately. Any progress you’ve already made will automatically be applied when you enter a match, unlocking any challenges or assignments you now meet based on the updated criteria.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios said the scale of its plans for Challenges and Assignments is “large and will take place over multiple server-side and client-side updates,” so players can expect additional updates in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Battlefield 6 has enjoyed a record-breaking launch, some have critisized the pace of in-game progression, which this update looks to address.

Below we’ve highlighted a few examples.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Class Challenges</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon challenges now complete much faster.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Assault 2: </strong>Have Squadmates deploy on your Spawn Beacon.</li><li>Reduced from 50 deploys to 5.</li><li><strong>Support 2:</strong> Revive teammates as Support.</li><li>Reduced from 200 revives to 60.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Weapon Assignments</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">All weapon-type assignments (ARs, SMGs, LMGs, Shotguns, DMRs, Snipers, Carbines) have been significantly simplified.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Rapid Fire 1/Assault Rifle:</strong> Inflict damage with Assault Rifles.</li><li>Reduced from requiring 10000 inflicted damage to 3000.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mode &amp; Unit Assignments</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The majority of our mode-specific assignments (Conquest, Rush, Breakthrough, Domination, and others) have been standardized to require two wins per tier. This change makes it easier to pursue these challenges with clear intent.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Conquest 2: </strong>Wins in Conquest.</li><li>Reduced from 5 wins to 2.</li><li><strong>Conquest 3: </strong>Objective kills in a round of Conquest.</li><li>Reduced from 30 objective kills in a round to 10.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay &amp; Mastery</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">General “Expert” and “Master” assignments that require multi-kills, headshots, kill streaks, or revives have been adjusted to better match the natural rhythm of gameplay. For example, multi-kill and streak goals now align with average round performance rather than rare, outlier achievements.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Explosives Expert 2:</strong> Get Multi Kills <em>(2+ Kills Onwards)</em> with explosives.</li><li>Reduced from 20 Multi Kills to 5.</li><li><strong>Adaptable 2:</strong> Repair damaged Vehicles in a life.</li><li>Reduced from requiring 3000 damage to 500.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
