Jim B helps V out on this treasure hunt by providing images that point players in the right direction, complete with card-based puns. You'll know you're in the right spot by the joker image sprayed on a surface. It‚Äôs basically a fun collectathon / exploration side quest themed after Balatro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for quest rewards (<strong>spoiler warnings end here!</strong>), the hunt ends with the Joker of Night City package, which includes a new joker shirt and a Balatro trophy displayed in your apartment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt Global PR Director Radek Grabowski tweeted to add some context, saying the quest came about after he asked the quest design team about the possibility of putting Balatro cards in Cyberpunk 2077. Quest designer Maria Mazu then created the Balatro quest for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-patch-22-fully-revealed-and-its-out-now">Patch 2.2</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Some time ago, I asked the Quest Design team at CDPR: ‚ÄúYou liked the Cyberpunk cards in Balatro? What if we had Balatro cards in Cyberpunk 2077?‚Äù Thanks to the talented Quest Designer Maria Mazur, we now have the Balatro quest in Update 2.2. üÉè Amazing work, Maria! üëè <a href="https://t.co/unjw4XzYyT" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/unjw4XzYyT</a></p>‚Äî Radek (@gamebowski) <a href="https://twitter.com/gamebowski/status/1866824502988185901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of a number of secrets game director Pawe≈Ç Sasko teased were added by Patch 2.2, and that‚Äôs on top of secrets from the base game that still remain undiscovered even now, four years after Cyberpunk 2077‚Äôs launch. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1hblgob/unlisted_patch_22_updates/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Players are documenting unlisted Patch 2.2 updates</a>, which so far include a street race and more color variants on weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

"If the angels bring some sort of script that‚Äôs written in gold ink that says to me that it‚Äôs going to be really important for people to see, I might continue down the road, but I‚Äôm taking a break."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sonic 3 may or may not be that film, but Carrey laughed that his previous comment "might have been hyperbole."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Carrey is just one of several big names attached to the film. The live action Sonic franchise already stars Ben Schwartz in the titular role alongside Idris Elba as Knuckles, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-reveals-keanu-reeves-shadow-dr-robotniks-father-and-a-whole-bunch-more">Sonic 3 adds Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog too</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paramount Pictures seemingly has no plans to slow down either, already teasing that this film, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-december-2024-release-date">which hits theatres on December 20</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-will-tease-another-new-character-to-set-up-potential-fourth-film">sets up another big character's appearance in its closing scenes</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
