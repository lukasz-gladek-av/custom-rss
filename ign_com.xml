            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-classic-announced-new-mode-2016-release-blizzard<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 is taking a page from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/14/world-of-warcraft-classic-preview">WoW Classic</a> and returning to the beginning, announcing a brand-new Overwatch Classic mode featuring the original 21 heroes and 12 maps from the 2016 release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nostalgia mode, which launches Tuesday and continues over the course of three weeks, will feature key moments from Overwatch history, Blizzard says. It'll begin with the original 1.0 version from launch, with no limits on which characters you can pick, meaning you can theoretically have a team full of tanks or Torbjörns. And yes, it will be 6v6, though Blizzard says it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-is-looking-at-bringing-6v6-back-to-overwatch-but-it-wont-be-easy">unrelated to its experiments with bringing the format back to Overwatch 2</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Overwatch Classic is separate from our broader 6v6 plans. Overwatch Classic is meant to be a nostalgic experience, taking heroes, players, and the game back to moments in the game’s history for limited time events," Blizzard explains in its official <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/a-blast-to-the-past-begins-with-overwatch-classic/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ </a>about the event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch Classic's gameplay will largely match up with the original game's mechanics, with characters regaining their original abilities and Ultimates charging up much more quickly. However, maps like Dorado, Numbani, Route 66, and Watchpoint: Gibraltar will retain their changes from Overwatch 2, including match timing and how elevator platforms work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the event progresses, Blizzard plans to progressively layer in changes, including single hero limits. Future updates will return to "popular moments in the game's history," with Blizzard citing the 2017 Moth Meta — in which Mercy was one of the most powerful characters — and the triple-tank, triple-support style of "Goats" as two examples. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/11/overwatch-2-classic-1731353883370.jfif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The first part of Overwatch Classic will let players choose any character they want with no restrictions. Image source: Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans for their part have been generally positive about the news. Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1gox6jy/classic_overwatch_trailer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, one player joked, "Mass rez is back, I'm scared mom come get me." Others are asking for it to be a permanent arcade game mode, though Blizzard is being cagey about its plans for the future, saying it plans to measure player response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch Classic officially commences on November 12 and will continue until December 2. It'll be playable as a mode within the standard Overwatch 2 client, and will not include legacy features like loot boxes, the original UI, or the Competitive mode. Available modes include Assault, Escort, Hybrid, and Control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

"Just nominated for my fourth Grammy in a row," he said. "So thrilled to be nominated alongside [Silverman] for our co-arrangement of Last Surprise from Persona 5 for The 8-Bit Big Band. Long live video game music."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Surprise has been nominated for Best Arrangement, Instruments and Vocals and is up against the likes of John Legend's Always Come Back, Willow's Big Feelings, and more. The winner will be announced on February 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Persona 5 will be familiar with Last Surprise because, as mentioned, it is the main battle theme of the 100 hour plus role-playing game. Those who've played through even a small portion of it will therefore recognise its jazzy beats, and it's also featured in Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight and Persona 5 Strikers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 5 arrived in 2016 and, despite its critical acclaim, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-royal-review">with the enhanced version being dubbed a masterpiece in IGN's review</a>, developer Atlus hasn't released another entry since.
