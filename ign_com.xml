            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting a group of friends together to learn and play a board game can be a daunting task. Not only does it require everyone in-person, but between setting up, learning the rules, and actually playing through the game it can end up taking multiple hours. Thankfully, there's an online solution that solves many of these issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena might be one of the best-kept secrets, despite having more than 10 million registered players. Still, the flexibility to play many of the most popular games today whenever you desire makes it a must for board game enthusiasts. With a massive catalog spanning every genre, it's got plenty to offer for both casual and hardcore players alike. Check out our full breakdown below to learn more about Board Game Arena, some of the included games, pricing, and what devices are supported.</p><p id="what-is-board-game-arena"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is Board Game Arena?">What Is Board Game Arena?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena is a <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> that allows you to play more than <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/gamelist" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,000 popular board games</a>—completely free. What's the catch? Surprisingly, there isn't one. It really is as good as it sounds. A metaphorical board game buffet just waiting to be devoured.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The browser-based website is pretty lightweight, allowing it to run seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. You can play games in real-time with players from across the world or set up a turn-based match that lets players take turns when it's convenient for them. While this significantly increases the time it takes to complete a game, it's a flexible option that's perfect for those with a busy schedule who can't dedicate the time it takes to sit down and play longer games.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">How it works</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Most games include a step-by-step guided tutorial, which is the perfect way to learn a new game that doesn't require combing through a massive rulebook. Many also have links to educational videos if you prefer to learn by watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best part about Board Game Arena is that the entire experience is automated. That means no more worrying about the rules or players potentially cheating. Each game features a simple interface that clearly indicates which moves you can make at any given moment. This also helps games move along at a brisk pace, as there's no setup, teardown, or fiddling with components.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can create digital tables and indicate the number of opponents they are looking for before starting a match. Generally, finding players is quick, with tables often filled in a matter of seconds. Some games even include expansion content, which you can decide to enable when setting up your table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each game features a built-in text chat option to interact with your friends or opponents. And, if you want to host a virtual game night and get the full experience, optional voice and video chat are also available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because many board games require a lot of time and commitment, Board Game Arena leverages a <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/news?id=304" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reputation system for all players</a>. Anyone who takes too long to make a move or leaves a game before it's finished receives a penalty. This allows you to quickly identify potential problem players and avoid matching with them to ensure a positive play experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For players looking to test their ability, Board Game Arena also offers ranked matches and tournaments for every game. This is a great way to face off against some of the best players in the world and improve your skill.</p><p id="subscription-tiers"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Subscription Tiers">How Much Does Board Game Arena Cost?</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena is available in two tiers: free and Premium. The free tier only requires that you create a free account in order to access the catalog of games. However, you'll quickly find that many of the most popular games have the "Premium" badge on them, which means you can't start a table unless you have a paid subscription. If you're patient, though, you can wait for another premium member to set up a table and join for free.</p><div catalogid="9b93e6b9-077f-4e03-9675-f0d3733462be" id="225356"><div id="225356" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Board Game Arena</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, to experience the best of Board Game Arena without any restrictions, you'll want to sign up for a Premium account. Like most <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-subscription-services">game subscription services</a>, you can pay monthly or yearly, with the latter being a bit cheaper in comparison. Board Game Arena's is priced at <strong>$5 per month</strong> or <strong>$42 per year</strong> (which works out to about $3.50 a month). For less than the price of a new board game you can experience more than 1,000—with more added every week.</p></div><p id="games-included"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Games Included">What Games Does Board Game Arena Include?</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/01/25/wingspan-board-game-review-1674676696680.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena features some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">most popular board games</a> available today, including: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building games</a> like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review">Wingspan</a>, Splendor, and Res Arcana; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family games</a> like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/azul-board-game-review">Azul</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/15/ticket-to-ride-review">Ticket to Ride</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harmonies-board-game-review">Harmonies</a>; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative games</a> like Pandemic, Sky Team, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-review">The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick-Taking Game</a>, and many, many more. The best part—new games are added weekly, so there's always something to look forward to and play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more experienced players, there are plenty of longer, more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategic games</a> that typically need a well-versed group to play including Terraforming Mars, Ark Nova, and Terra Mystica. While these games can take hours in-person, the instant setup and automated turn structure helps them move much faster than their real-world counterparts, making this the ideal way to play many of these heavier games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although most games require two or more players to enjoy, Board Game Arena has a vast catalog of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo games</a> for players who prefer that format. Many modern games also include a solo variant, allowing you to play against an <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/2414/blogpost/109521/what-is-an-automa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automa</a> and learn the strategy without the pressure of additional players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you only have a few minutes to spare, Board Game Arena also features dozens of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">quick board games</a> that can be played on your phone to give you your fix. The beauty of its massive catalog is that you can choose the perfect game based on how much time you have available.</p><p id="available-platforms"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Available Platforms">Board Game Arena - Available Platforms</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Board Game Arena is browser-based, it's available on just about any modern device that can access an internet browser. While you <em>can</em> play games on mobile, I find that some games' visual aspects don't scale well for the smaller screen. Your best bet is to play on PC, Mac, or even a tablet as each of these can fit more visuals and information on the screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matthew Adler has written for IGN since 2019 covering all things gaming, tech, tabletop games, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it’s the difficulty of gathering your game group together consistently, you prefer playing solo, or you're just looking for new players to test your strategies against, physical board games and tabletop experiences may not be enough. Luckily, some fantastic games have been adapted into digital formats that allow for gaming wherever your gaming group may be and for tense matches whenever you want. It really is an exciting time to be a fan of tabletop games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This guide will point you in the direction of digital adaptations that will scratch that itch you have to play some board games, but also serve as learning resources to introduce new titles into your game night rotation.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Just a note: This list won’t include digital adaptations for TCGs such as Magic: The Gathering or Virtual Tabletop platforms for TTRPGs; it focuses solely on board games. </em></p><p id="root"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Root">Root</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225994"><div id="225994" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Root</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Root from Leder Games disguises rich asymmetric area control under the facade of cute and cuddly woodland critters. Anywhere from one to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a> struggle against one another, attempting to take control of areas and complete unique faction-specific goals to earn Victory Points. Whoever reaches 30 points first wins. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This digital adaptation successfully captures the visual style of Kyle Ferrin’s art and benefits from different aspects being automated. Root offers both Local and Online play in addition to some wonderful tutorials, which are especially helpful and a great resource in learning all of the factions. Speaking of factions, developer Direwolf Digital (expect to see that more on the list) continues to release expansions, unlocking new maps and playable factions.</p></div><p id="dune-imperium"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dune: Imperium">Dune: Imperium</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225995"><div id="225995" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dune: Imperium</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With the physical version winning <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/news/2022/2022-sxsw-gaming-awards-winners-announced/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SXSW’s Board Game of the Year in 2022</a> and the digital adaptation recently winning <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3508413/19th-annual-golden-geek-winners-for-2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BoardGameGeeks' 2024 Golden Geek</a> award for Best Board Game App, Dune: Imperium is an easy recommendation. This mixture of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-worker-placement-board-games">worker placement</a> and deck-building title set in the Dune universe is a modern classic that offers a fun time for board game hobbyists while not being overly complicated to get into for newcomers. Players take turns placing their spies around Dune, improving their standing with different groups, and waging war in an effort to earn enough points to trigger the end game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's really neat about this digital version is that not only does it feature a good tutorial, solo play against computers, and online play (ranked, events, and casual options), but you can also test your skills with special Challenge games with unique rules. Regardless of how you play it, anyone even remotely interested in board games should try Dune: Imperium – or its sort of 2nd Edition, Dune: Imperium - Uprising – at least once. Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review">Dune: Imperium board game review </a>for more details about the game itself.</p></div><p id="spirit-island"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Spirit Island">Spirit Island</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225996"><div id="225996" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Spirit Island</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You are a powerful spirit, and your island and its inhabitants, the Dahan (who are also your worshippers), are in danger from foreign invaders who are laying claim to portions of your home. It’s up to you and your fellow spirits to deal with this problem. Spirit Island is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> deck-building and area control game, where you and your friends will have to use your spirits’ special abilities and build out a power deck to force these colonists off your island. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This digital implementation streamlines the process, offloading all of the upkeep between turns like spawning more colonists and moving them around, making this feel like an overall much faster game. Despite being a cooperative title, this game can be challenging, but luckily, the various spirits are ranked in terms of complexity, so even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">board game beginners</a> can have a good time. Adding in the expansions will provide you with even more spirits to choose from, more customization choices for your island, with Horizons of Spirit Island designed as the ideal jumping-in point for those learning Spirit Island. </p></div><p id="machi-koro-with-everyone"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Machi Koro with Everyone">Machi Koro with Everyone</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225997"><div id="225997" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Machi Koro with Everyone</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s even better than getting one digital board game? Getting two! Machi Koro with Everyone is a digital bundle that provides players with both the first and second versions of this delightful and charming game. In Machi Koro, players spend coins to buy new properties for their small cities and roll dice to try to earn money, with the end goal of being the first person to build three special buildings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This adaptation features colorful art and cute customizable avatars. It is an excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">board game for families</a> to enjoy, thanks to its local play functionality and short game time of approximately 20 minutes. When you’re ready, though, you can go online and test your skills against other players around the world. Machi Koro with Everyone is the easiest game to learn on this list, and arguably one of the most charming.</p></div><p id="scythe-digital-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Scythe: Digital Edition">Scythe: Digital Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225998"><div id="225998" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Scythe: Digital Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in an alternate version of the 1920s Europe where giant mechs exist and help with farming (and war), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/scythe-board-game-buying-guide">Scythe</a> is an engine-building / worker placement game where players manage not only gathering resources but also waging war on one another. This digital adaptation of the game captures all of the tense moments and rich strategy that players have fallen in love with in the physical board game, but speeds things up thanks to the automation of various systems that only a digital game can provide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a nifty added bonus, Sythe Digital allows you to customize the paint scheme of your units. If you're looking to play against your friends instead of just the computer or random folks online, Scythe: Digital Edition features crossplay, allowing you to play with others regardless of the platform.</p></div><p id="gloomhaven"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225999"><div id="225999" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gloomhaven</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be argued that one of the games that has defined this new era of tabletop was 2017’s behemoth of a game, Gloomhaven. This sprawling campaign title featuring 95 unique scenarios, branching storylines, a ton of characters, and intricate card-based combat has left it’s mark on the scene, but one thing that has always held it back somewhat are the space it takes up and the large amount of time investment it takes to get to the end. Thankfully, Gloomhaven has a digital version that allows you to play online with your friends, instead of trying to organize 50 in-person game nights with friends, regardless of what platform someone may own the game on. If you find yourself a master Gloomhaven player already, then you can take on the 100 special Guildmaster missions or build your own levels with the game’s built-in level editor, and share with the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our love for Gloomhaven here at IGN is well established, being featured on a number of our various board game buyer’s guides including “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-board-games">The Best RPG Board Games Worth Playing</a>”, “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">The Best Campaign Board Games</a>”,  “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/board-games-like-dungeons-and-dragons">11 Board Games Like Dungeons &amp; Dragons Worth Playing</a>”, and now you can add one more to the list. The game really is just that good, and this is the easiest way to play, including its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review">Jaws of the Lion expansion</a>.

In Dominion, players take turns buying cards from a shared pool of available options, determined by the expansions and sets they have, creating unique scenarios. What makes this game beloved is how different card effects and triggers play off of one another, requiring you to plan out not only what cards you will purchase, but also the order in which to play them from your hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This digital version continues to see strong support, with many of the physical game’s expansions seeing release in this format as well, and with the option to play not only against computer opponents of various difficulties, you can also play online against friends and random players around the world, regardless of the platform. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact that the base game, which can provide hours of fun on its own, is completely free, when paired with just how many expansions you can also get for this digital game, make it an easy inclusion on the list, and we have also featured Dominion on some of our other lists too, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games"><u>best deck-building games</u></a>.</p></div><p id="werewolf-mafia"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Werewolf / Mafia">Werewolf / Mafia</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="226001"><div id="226001" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>One Night: Ultimate Werewolf</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">How well can you tell when your friends are lying, and how well can you hide when you are?

If your family or game group is one of those who adores collecting these feathered friends, this digital version of Wingspan is a must-have.

Playable straight from your phone, tablet, or computer’s browser, BGA lets players connect with other players around the world, take part in tournaments, play either in real time or asynchronously over the span of a week or longer, and even create a friends list so it’s easy to connect with loved ones. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Classic and beloved titles like Catan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions">Ticket To Ride</a>, River of Gold, and Wingspan are all available, in addition to some brand-new games that aren’t even out yet. A vast majority of the games on BGA (917 currently) come with in-depth step-by-step tutorials to help you learn the game, too. This is a handy tool for individuals who want to make sure they like a game before spending a bunch of money on the physical product. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want access to the entire catalog that Board Game Arena offers, you will have to pay to get a Premium account, but at only $5 a month or $36 a year, the price is well worth it just for the additional games you get alone. However, free players can still play those games, they just can’t make a table of those games, meaning they are still able to join other premium players’ tables without having to drop a dime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of all the games on this list, Board Game Arena is by far the best value for your buck. The service runs on your normal internet browser, so anyone with a smartphone can join and play, though we recommend playing it on your computer or tablet instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the very opposite of the idea behind this list, check out our picks for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">best board games based on video games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.
