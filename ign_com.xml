To celebrate the occasion, as well as Halloween, creator Toby Fox took to X/Twitter with an adorable illustration and some news: he's releasing Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4 in 2025 "100%".</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm very eager to show you what we've made since 6 years ago.</p><p>Chapter 3&amp;4 will 100% come out in 2025.</p><p>The specific time is still relying on localization and console porting.</p><p>Please hear me clawing at the door trying to escape the shallow coffin I have been buried in.</p></div>â€” tobyfox (@tobyfox) <a href="https://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/1851836949847281963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 31, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune first came out in 2018 in a surprise launch, with the initial version of the game being released on PC for free <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/31/undertale-creator-announces-and-releases-mysterious-new-project">as a strange application called "SURVEY PROGRAM"</a> that was actually the first chapter of the turn-based RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It received subsequent releases under the name Deltarune on Nintendo Switch and PS4, and Chapter 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapter-2-release-date-this-week-pc-mac">was released also for free in 2021</a>. Fox has previously stated that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/toby-fox-will-release-deltarune-chapter-3-4-and-5-at-the-same-time">a third, fourth, and fifth chapter were in the works</a>, and that he intended to release them all together as a single paid game alongside one and two; however, he later amended that to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-will-be-released-once-chapter-4-is-done-toby-fox-confirms">just chapters three and four</a> due to the length of development time. The in-game menu has room for seven chapters total.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though seemingly not a direct sequel, Fox has described Deltarune as "intended for people who have completed Undertale" and as Undertale "parallel story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game features many of the same cast of characters, though some in very different roles, and its music, design, and themes frequently make callbacks to Undertale. The name "Deltarune" itself is an anagram of "Undertale." However, Deltarune features a new protagonist, Kris, who finds themselves transported into a mysterious "Dark World" along with the school bully, Susie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Together with a familiar-looking goat creature named Ralsei, the three "Lightners" set out to close mysterious "Dark Fountains" that have sprung up all over the world, throwing off the balance between light and dark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though we haven't yet reviewed what's available of Deltarune, we gave its predecessor Undertale a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/18/undertale-review">coveted 10/10 score</a>, calling it a "masterfully crafted experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It enjoyed the highest player numbers, hours logged, and total matches played in its opening weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 is undeniably a huge success, not only because <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review">critics have praised its fast-paced multiplayer modes</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">return to form single player campaign</a>, but there are some caveats to the figures boasted by Microsoft and Activision Blizzard.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Call of Duty Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout-imminent-after-stock-halted-and-uk-clears-deal">The former now owns the latter</a>, meaning Black Ops 6 was the first Call of Duty to launch straight onto Xbox Game Pass. Microsoft said Game Pass set a new record for new subscribers in one day, but didn't reveal how many sales were lost as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-boost-game-pass-by-up-to-4-million-subs-but-at-the-cost-of-6-million-lost-sales-analysts-predict">analysts expected Black Ops 6 to boost Game Pass subscribers</a> by between 2.5 million and four million, but at the cost of six million lost sales. There's also nothing to stop these new subscribers cancelling their subscription before it renews in November, effectively awarding them Black Ops 6 for $19.99 instead of the usual $69.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record">Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella attempted to offset these concerns in an investors call</a>, saying Black Ops 6 sales were up 60% compared to 2023's Modern Warfare 3, but this entry was universally panned so naturally provided a bigger jump to Black Ops 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-single-player-campaign-review">IGN's review of the single player game awarded it a 4/10</a>, for example, calling it "underbaked, rehashed, and cobbled together," and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-multiplayer-review">it otherwise peaked at a 6/10 with our multiplayer review</a>. "Modern Warfare 3 reheats and reserves the same multiplayer from Modern Warfare 2 with some extra maps and tweaks," we said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As these reviews insinuate, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-2023-report">Modern Warfare 3 was reportedly just an expansion for Modern Warfare 2</a> that Activision Blizzard moulded into a full entry as to not miss an annualized release. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-report-reveals-that-modern-warfare-3-development-time-was-half-that-of-a-normal-call-of-duty">Its development time was reportedly just half what a normal entry is given</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-devs-are-a-little-peeved-at-christopher-judges-dig-during-the-game-awards">even industry peers poked fun at its release</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This let <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-beats-modern-warfare-3-as-best-selling-game-of-2023-in-the-us">Hogwarts Legacy become the first non Call of Duty or Rockstar game to top U.S. sales charts</a> since 2008, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-dev-raven-didnt-react-to-modern-warfare-3-campaigns-terrible-reception-we-were-already-pretty-locked-in">Black Ops 6 campaign developer Raven Software even commented on its reaction publicly</a> amid concerns for its new game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's this historically low Call of Duty performance that Nadella said Black Ops 6 was performing 60% better than, so while still impressive, it's not as grand a proclamation as it seems at first glance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-outperforms-modern-warfare-2-and-3-on-steam-though-still-falls-to-warzone">Black Ops 6 does appear to have outperformed 2022 release Modern Warfare 2 as well</a>, however, as Steam data shows it enjoyed a higher opening weekend.
