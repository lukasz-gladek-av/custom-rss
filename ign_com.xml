            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-first-network-test-plagued-by-server-issues-fromsoftware-issues-apology<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> FromSoftware has said it's considering an additional Elden Ring Nightreign network test session in response to the server problems that affected the first session that ran today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first session of the #ELDENRING #NIGHTREIGN Network Test has ended," the developer <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1890404327560208502" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> at the conclusion of Elden Ring Nightreign's first test session.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We apologize for the inconvenience caused by the game server issues. Work is currently ongoing to improve the stability of the Network Test. An additional Network Test session is being considered."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second session is set for later today, February 14, 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> Elden Ring Nightreign’s first network test — ongoing at the time of this article’s publication — is suffering from significant server issues that have prevented many from playing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN staff with access to the test reported server problems so extreme they were unable to access the game for the test’s first hour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issues were bad enough that <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1890361803944718443" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FromSoftware issued a statement on social media</a>, confirming that players were struggling to find a match due to server congestion. The developer apologized, but encouraged players to try matching again after a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It appears the PlayStation servers in particular are having problems, and indeed were brought down for maintenance. "The #NIGHTREIGN PlayStation servers are currently under maintenance," FromSoftware <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1890375493611851834" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. "Work is ongoing to restore server functionality. Further updates will be provided. Thank you for your patience and understanding."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exacerbating the problem is the fact the Elden Ring Nightreign network test is only available during five three-hour periods on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S from February 14 to February 17. Here’s the current schedule:</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign network test session timings:</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>February 14: 3am-6am PT / 6am-9am ET</li><li>February 14: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li><li>February 15: 11am-2pm PT / 2pm-5pm ET</li><li>February 16: 3am-6am PT / 6am-9am ET</li><li>February 16: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The network test is a “preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch,” Bandai Namco said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This large-scale Network Stress Test is designed to evaluate various aspects of the online system's functionality and performance. We are looking forward to your cooperation to make Elden Ring Nightreign even better."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is of course better that Elden Ring Nightreign suffers server issues now than when it launches in May, but players who had earmarked time to try out the game now have expressed their frustration. Hopefully subsequent play sessions will run more smoothly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is FromSoftware’s standalone co-operative spin-off set in a world parallel to that of 2022’s Elden Ring. The network test will allow three players to team up and take their chosen Nightfarers to battle "against new terrors, and explore an ever-changing map to defeat increasingly challenging bosses and ultimately take on the Nightlord," Bandai Namco added, before confirming the network test features a three day-and-night cycle squads must try to outlast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year IGN had the opportunity to visit FromSoftware and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-we-played-it"><u>go hands-on with an early build of Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a>. We came away impressed, stating that Elden Ring Nightreign “takes the cautious dungeon crawls of Elden Ring and turbocharges them into propulsive, slash ‘n’ dash speedruns.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service"><u>IGN's interview with game director Junya Ishizaki for even more on Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a> launches on May 30, 2025 priced $40 across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC via Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">What happens to GTA Online when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> comes out? That’s a question a lot of GTA Online players have been asking ever since GTA 6 was announced. And now, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">GTA 6’s fall 2025 release date</a> approaches, they’re no closer to an answer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online">GTA Online</a> is Rockstar’s hugely profitable live service that continues to pull in players even now, well over a decade since launch. Its enduring appeal and ability to print money is thought to have influenced Rockstar’s decision to prioritize the live service over story DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5, much to the annoyance of some fans. But there is a more pressing concern looming over the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When GTA 6 eventually comes out, it is expected to bring with it a new and improved GTA Online. Perhaps this will be GTA Online 2. Perhaps it will be called GTA Online, as before. Either way, players of the existing GTA Online have expressed concern that all their time, effort, and money spent in the current GTA Online will be left behind for a potential clean break later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why invest time and money into GTA Online now, in early 2025, when the new GTA Online is potentially due out in perhaps eight months or so? That’s a question IGN put to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick during a recent interview ahead of the company’s third-quarter financial report, and his answer makes for interesting reading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Zenick wouldn’t be drawn specifically on any new GTA Online because it has yet to be announced, he did talk generally about Take-Two’s form when it came to NBA 2K Online, a free-to-play online-focused version of 2K Sports’ hugely successful basketball franchise aimed at the Asian market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NBA 2K Online launched all the way back in 2012, and then 2K Sports released NBA 2K Online 2 in 2017. Both games were maintained simultaneously, so fans of the first version could continue to play and invest their time and money safe in the knowledge they wouldn’t be left behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm going to speak theoretically only because I'm not going to talk about a particular project when an announcement hasn't been made,” Zelnick began. “But generally speaking, we support our properties when the consumers are involved with those titles. As an example, we launched NBA 2K Online in China, I think originally in 2012 if I'm not mistaken. And then we launched NBA 2K Online 2 in China in 2017. If I'm not mistaken. We did not sunset Online 1. They both are still in the market and they serve consumers and they're alive and we have this massive audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we've shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last line is of particular importance. It suggests — but doesn’t confirm at this stage — that if there is a GTA Online 2, it won’t come at the cost of GTA Online falling by the wayside. If people keep playing GTA Online, Zelnick is suggesting here, then Rockstar will continue to support it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that there’s still a huge amount we do now know about GTA 6, given all we’ve had so far is Trailer 1 and a release window. But if GTA 6 is definitely due out fall 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boss-of-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-owner-take-two-says-it-will-time-its-releases-to-respect-the-consumers-need-to-spend-a-lot-of-time-playing-these-hit-games-before-they-go-on-to-the-next">potentially after Borderlands 4’s just-announced September release date</a>, Rockstar will have to reveal more sooner rather than later. In the meantime, check out Zelnick's comments on whether <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">skipping PC for GTA 6's launch is a mistake</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Highlights included Housemarque’s reveal of its Returnal successor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saros-is-housemarques-successor-to-returnal-arriving-in-2026">Saros</a>, and the long-awaited release date for Konami’s Unreal Engine 5 remake, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-finally-confirmed-officially-this-time">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. But one notable video game was a total no-show: Bloodborne.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">the persistence continues 😭 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bloodborne?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#bloodborne</a> <a href="https://t.co/GOcAO4Bi5g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GOcAO4Bi5g</a></p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1889812558040932572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As the 40-minute show wrapped up, most fans wiped off the clown makeup so they could inevitably rebuild expectations for some sort of comeback in the future. For others, the absence stung more than usual. March 24, 2025, marks the 10-year anniversary of Bloodborne’s launch on PS4, making this year feel like a now-or-never moment for PlayStation and developer FromSoftware to do... anything with the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne remaster campaigners have slowly grown their numbers over the last five years, but hopes for an announcement took on a new form when Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-bloodborne-60fps-patch-says-sony-has-sent-him-a-dmca-takedown-but-why-now"><u>issued a DMCA takedown</u></a> to Lance McDonald, the creator of a popular Bloodborne 60fps mod for the action RPG, late last month. Sony was calling for links to the patch to be scrubbed from the internet, and only one week later, a PlayStation 1-style demake called Bloodborne PSX <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-the-bloodborne-psx-demake-becomes-the-latest-fan-project-to-suffer-a-copyright-claim-the-creator-of-bloodbornes-60fps-mod-has-offered-his-copium-official-remake-theory"><u>suffered the same fate</u></a>. It’s not exactly a surprise to see Sony taking action against community creations like this, but the timing had many, <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1886240572660457506" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>including McDonald</u></a>, raising their eyebrows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My copium theory is that Sony DMCAed the 60fps patch and the video about the Bloodborne demake so that when they announce a 60fps remake, Google searching for ‘Bloodborne 60fps’ and ‘Bloodborne remake’ won’t have collisions with our fan projects,” McDonald said. “Let me cope.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, just days after Sony moved to pull these fan-made projects down, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow-february-12th"><u>State of Play was announced</u></a>. After years of begging and nearly a decade since launch, this had to be it, right? Well, whether you were surprised or not, not one frame of Bloodborne found its way into the presentation, and fans haven’t been taking it well.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">another year no bloodborne <a href="https://t.co/XCB8LZ3Ds7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/XCB8LZ3Ds7</a> <a href="https://t.co/VVohE0C4gp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VVohE0C4gp</a></p>— ۟ (@scadutree) <a href="https://twitter.com/scadutree/status/1889809555003154451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">some of you clearly didn't watch amazon's secret level playstation episode when Sackboy turned to the camera and said, "We will NEVER remake or remaster bloodborne!" <a href="https://t.co/Y89LwShCVh" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Y89LwShCVh</a></p>— Gene Park (@GenePark) <a href="https://twitter.com/GenePark/status/1889814583868792917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/2BCcceRz2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2BCcceRz2z</a></p>— Micky D (@DeMickyD) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeMickyD/status/1889902996856947048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Driving the cleaver deeper was Sony’s promise to bring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/days-gone-remasered-revealed-with-april-2025-release-date">Days Gone Remastered</a> to PS5 owners in April. This re-release of Bend Studio’s post-apocalyptic narrative adventure arrives on the six-year anniversary of its original launch on PS4 and sees it joining a list of other first-party remasters that includes Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, The Last of Us Part I, and The Last of Us Part II Remastered. No-one outside Sony is sure on what qualifies a game to be deserving of a remaster. With so many players begging to return to Yharnam’s beastly streets and with FromSoftware titles more popular than ever, it’s hard not to walk out of a Bloodborne-less State of Play without a question mark above your head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, as quiet as Sony has been when it comes to Bloodborne content, fans haven’t been completely starved of an explanation from it or FromSoftware. Former Sony Interactive Entertainment executive Shuhei Yoshida, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-retiring-from-sony-in-january"><u>retired last month</u></a>, touched on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory"><u>his theory</u></a> as to why we’ve not seen more Bloodborne during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a recent conversation with Kinda Funny Games</u></a>. He suspects that director Hidetaka Miyazaki is too busy and too attached to the IP to let anyone else get involved other than himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on,” Yoshida said in January, “but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So, I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Everyone thought with Bloodborne's 10 year anniversary approaching and Sony DMCA taking down the 60FPS patch that something was coming but uhhh...</p><p>Nope.</p><p>We get Days Gone Remastered lmao <a href="https://t.co/Q8DzgbSJNi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Q8DzgbSJNi</a></p></div>— Michael (@LegacyKillaHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/LegacyKillaHD/status/1889816510497169759?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Miyazaki, meanwhile, has also addressed desires for a Bloodborne remaster and PC port. When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5"><u>speaking with IGN last year</u></a>, the Dark Souls mastermind clarified that he wasn’t “at liberty to speak to it” because FromSoftware doesn’t own the IP rights. It’s fair reason to dodge the conversation around Bloodborne, though Miyazaki also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested to Eurogamer</u></a> that he believes a remake could benefit from modern hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans,” the FromSoftware lead told Eurogamer early last year. “It does make me very happy to see that there are still so many people passionate about it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There has never been an official mention of a Bloodborne remaster, and 2025 is shaping up to be another year without some form of PS5 or PC port. As the PS5 barrels through its fifth full year on the market, one can only wonder when or if Sony will have anything to announce.
