Perhaps not. From what I know, this decision is final, at least for the first content year of BL4.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Alright I guess we're gonna talk about it:</p><p>AVA WAS CUT FROM BORDERLANDS 4</p><p>There are numerous files related to her in the game, more specifically outlining that she was completely replaced by Amara late in development.

But there's no moment that says 'she's learning.' She just kind of 180s from I'm angry at the world for my own mistakes!! to wow look at Lilith go, [some sage saying]. It would've been nice to have her have some kind of reflection during the fight reigniting the vaults with Tychon or even after. It's possible I missed a single voiceline somewhere but in general her change in demeanor is just jarring as hell.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Ava got Maya killed by being there when she was told not to go,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/d6ry4o/comment/f0vhj44/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented zeal3000</a>. “Maya wanted to run and Ava believed she could take them and put Maya in a situation where she had to put herself in danger to save Ava. So it was Ava's fault and then to add more salt to the wound she blames Lilith for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The entire scene has the same review from me as the final season of Game of Thrones. I don't mind what they did in terms of story telling. It was the how they did it with lazy writing and rushed points that bothers me.”</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox declined to comment when contacted by IGN, but EpicNNG believes that Ava being in the Borderlands 4 files was an “intentional blunder,” suggesting whoever left the files in did it on purpose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This game is airtight on datamining,” <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975223565248299443" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they continued</a>. “Nothing pre-or post release is in the files as of now. More credibility to this being intentional left in by a dev.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans reacted positively to the alleged change, praising Gearbox for making the right decision. “Regardless of if this was late or early in development it was the right decision,” said Agent-Vermont. “Amara and Zane have great chemistry together and it's always good to see previous Vault Hunters return and be badass.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Video game development is a messy business, of course, particularly with big budget, AAA games like Borderlands 4. The developers will have a long list of cuts and changes — some incidental, some significant — under their belts. Perhaps the decision to cut Ava was in response to a realization that fans might not have responded well to her inclusion. Or perhaps there was another reason — or multiple reasons — for making the change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that outspoken Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1840461497371402481" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked his Twitter followers</a> what they thought of Ava in September 2024, just a year before Borderlands 4 came out. Most of the responses were negative, with some even pleading with Pitchford not to include her in Borderlands 4. Did this social media response have something to do with the decision?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Gearbox continues to update Borderlands 4 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-patch-makes-big-balance-changes-with-all-vault-hunters-getting-buffs">performance improvements and balance changes</a>. A new Vault Hunter, C4SH, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-think-he-and-i-have-a-lot-in-common-borderlands-4-developers-used-first-person-footage-of-randy-pitchford-throwing-cards-to-help-animate-the-games-first-dlc-vault-hunter">is due out next year alongside plenty more content</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Activision hasn’t come out and said this trial is a direct attack on EA’s Battlefield 6 launch, fans are under no illusion about the optics here. It’s worth noting that Black Ops 6 is already playable via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, but the trial will benefit Essential and Premium users on Xbox and of course players on PlayStation and Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the latest salvo in what has become a popcorn-worthy back-and-forth between Activision and EA, with each mega publisher’s big budget FPS vying for the hearts and minds of the gaming community this holiday season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In August, Activision shocked the Call of Duty community when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-battlefield-6s-commitment-to-gritty-realism-activision-makes-shock-call-of-duty-change-for-black-ops-7-we-hear-the-feedback"><u>it confirmed that Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 would no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7</u></a>. This came as a big surprise to players who had expected content they’d bought for Black Ops 6 to carry forward, as it has done with previous entries. Explaining the decision, Activision said Black Ops 7 “needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The feeling was that Activision felt the heat from Battlefield 6, which is going for a more grounded aesthetic. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-call-of-dutys-obsession-with-goofy-skins-firmly-entrenched-battlefield-6-dev-commits-to-gritty-realism-i-dont-think-it-needs-nicki-minaj"><u>Developer DICE has indicated it has no plans to release crossover skins that would break the aesthetic Battlefield 6 is going for</u></a>, and promised the developers were listening to fan feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DBLTAP</u></a>, Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil doubled down on EA's commitment to grounded realism, and even pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-call-of-duty-season-5-snoop-dogg"><u>Call of Duty's infamous Nicki Minaj skin</u></a> as something Battlefield 6 doesn't need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has to be grounded," he said. "That is what BF3 and BF4 was — it was all soldiers, on the ground. It’s going to be like this,” Uchil said, pointing at the key art featuring soldiers in soldier gear looking out over a wartorn New York City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “I don’t think it needs Nicki Minaj. Let’s keep it real, keep it grounded.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, last month, EA ramped up its Battlefield 6 marketing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-love-how-we-all-know-exactly-what-this-was-a-middle-finger-to-battlefield-6-live-action-trailer-takes-aim-at-call-of-duty">taking a direct jab at Call of Duty with a new live-action trailer</a>. More recently, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-extended-by-24-hours-ends-just-a-day-before-the-battlefield-6-release-date">Activision extended the Black Ops 7 open beta</a> to run an additional 24 hours to October 9, taking it right up to Battlefield 6's release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both games are crucial releases for their publishers. Battlefield 6 leads the charge, releasing October 10 before Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 counter-attacks on November 14. It will be interesting to see which of the two mega publishers is happiest when the dust settles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
