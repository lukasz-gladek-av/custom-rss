Blizzard’s end user licence agreement specifically warns players that account boosting or power-leveling, in exchange for payment, is prohibited.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/gettyimages-2194433763-1737715737822.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Elon Musk has reportedly admitted to cheating in Diablo 4 and Path of Exile 2. Photo by Julia Demaree Nikhinson - Pool/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Musk’s admission this week, Diablo 4 developer Blizzard Entertainment and Path of Exile 2 developer Grinding Gear Games have faced questions about whether they will now take action and ban Musk’s accounts for cheating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So now billionaires can buy their way to the top of the HC ladder as a vanity project like owning a football club. Are the TOS not being enforced even when openly broken?” <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3704300" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked one Path of Exile player in a post on the game’s official forum</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Are there any comments from GGG regarding this? Maybe in [Early Access] it's not a high priority, or it's garnering too much free press, but as a longtime supporter, this is a massive blow to the credibility of RMT [real money trading] enforcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not trying to shitpost or troll with this, I'm just extremely disappointed that GGG isn't getting out the ban hammer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Anyone else feel this is undermining the integrity of the game?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a similar sentiment on Battle.net. “Is boosting against the rules?” <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/is-boosting-against-the-rules/212110" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked one player</a>. “If it is, then shouldn’t Elon Musk’s account get banned since he flat out admitted that he boosts his account? I assume he doesn’t get to break the rules just because…”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When contacted by IGN, Grinding Gear Games declined to comment. Blizzard also declined, saying it does not comment on individual player account behaviors or enforcements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Musk had bragged about his gaming prowess on multiple occasions, most notably in <a href="https://youtu.be/7qZl_5xHoBw?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan</a> in which he said he was in the top 20 players in the world for Diablo 4. More recently, Musk had a hardcore level 97 Path of Exile 2 character, although it has since perished. <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1879520605634220362" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He has said</a> he plays video games “to quiet my mind.” “Some days are real tough, so playing video games is my strange solace,” he added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Musk's self-proclaimed gaming prowess was brought into question as players began to take a closer look at his performance and knowledge of the games he plays. Some had questioned whether Musk was capable of dedicating the huge amount of time that would be needed to reach his high levels in Diablo 4 and Path of Exile 2 given his commitments as boss of Tesla, SpaceX, X/Twitter, and now as Donald Trump's efficiency tsar. Then <a href="https://youtu.be/4gxRyXsPoXI?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an early January livestream that saw Musk tackling endgame tasks in Path of Exile 2</a> drew criticism from fans who said he failed to demonstrate a basic understanding of the game’s mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many had assumed that Musk might have been paying others to boost his Path of Exile 2 character for him, and so it proved. <a href="https://x.com/NikoWrex/status/1880845217525588330" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A video posted on</a> Sunday by the Diablo player NikoWrex showed a direct message conversation with Musk on X in which Musk admits to account boosting, insisting it was the only way to compete with players in Asia.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Have you level boosted (had someone else play your accounts) and/or purchased gear/resources for PoE2 [Path of Exile 2] and Diablo 4?” asked NikoWrex. Musk responded with a 100% emoji. He later added: “It’s impossible to beat the players in Asia if you don’t, as they do!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But when I post a video of a game or am streaming, that's 100% me," he added. Musk was asked whether he intended to take credit for having a high level hardcore Path of Exile 2 character. "No. Never claimed that," he replied. "The top accounts in Diablo or PoE require multiple people playing the account to win a leveling race." Musk then went on to question the need to apologize for his actions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the revelations, the musician Grimes, who has three children with Musk from a previous relationship, <a href="https://x.com/Grimezsz/status/1880685503009443921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> in his defence, saying: "Just for my personal pride, I would like to state that the father of my children was the first American druid in Diablo to clear abattoir of zir and ended that season as best in the USA. He was also ranking in Polytopia, and beat Felix himself at the game. I did observe these things with my own eyes. There are other witnesses who can verify this. That is all."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Monday, further allegations of cheating were levelled when <a href="https://youtu.be/-ftqfehTL2Y?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Musk’s Path of Exile 2 character was seen as active in the game while he was in Washington attending Trump’s inauguration</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Julia Demaree Nikhinson - Pool/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
