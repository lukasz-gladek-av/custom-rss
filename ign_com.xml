It’s a matchmaking tactic that has set the Arc Raiders community ablaze since the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-confirms-it-recently-added-aggression-based-matchmaking-but-its-not-a-full-science"><u>announced its implementation</u></a> earlier this month. While some of the more aggressive fans aren’t sure how they feel about being linked up with other bloodthirsty Raiders, gentler players are using ABMM to find lobbies where player-vs.-player violence is practically off-limits.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The type of lobby you get after not shooting someone for 20 games <a href="https://t.co/TAYzsiEd6e" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TAYzsiEd6e</a></p>— Arc Raiders Intel (@ArcRaidersIntel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaidersIntel/status/2010455941330927874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Multiple players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz5gfoy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>shared stories online</u></a> about finding friendly lobbies that see Raiders cooperate with one another by evenly sharing loot after taking down a Matriarch. Some runs have even been said to result in a group dance party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Took down a matriarch and everyone shared the loot equally and then danced together at extract,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz4vog4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player explained</u></a>. “After a week of pure PvP this is like a whole new world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Lately I’ve been running into nothing but friendly players," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz57uka/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another added</a>.

While players do their best to use ABMM to land them in friendly lobbies, some have begun <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pyca5k/comment/nwhn724/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offering advice</a> to those who would prefer to avoid PvP but can't quite crack the code. There are even some fans discussing their hope for official support for strictly peaceful lobbies, but for those who prefer to rummage for loot in Stella Montis with a hint of paranoia, ABMM can be manipulated in the other direction, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who keep the safety on when looking for rusted gears and light bulbs with friends may have some luck balancing their lobbies with both friendly and aggressive players if they don’t exclusively stick to PvE combat. With enough trial and error, a few fans say they've had luck tweaking matchmaking to add just a dash of mischief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I enjoy both lobbies,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qapdfr/comment/nz4xgok/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user commented</u></a>. “PvE for making new friends and looting properly. PvP with my mate terrorising the whole lobby and losing all the good weapons we brought [because] someone outplays us with a big smile on our faces and having a great time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark has been clear: ABMM isn’t a science. The aggression-based matchmaking tool is also likely still being tweaked as Arc Raiders rides <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms">success</a> through its third month since launching for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 30. Still, it’s proven to be at least somewhat useful for those looking to avoid PvP, and the tension that comes with it, as much as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While players argue over whether ABMM is right for Arc Raiders, Embark seems to have made up its mind. For the Stockholm-based game developer, Arc Raiders is better off without doubling down on competitive gameplay mechanics like leaderboards, with CEO Patrick Söderlund explaining in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=QKpGyvRhpr7r-Cdw&amp;v=vY3u7wOmm4w&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesBeat</u></a> interview that “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-arc-raiders-dev-explains-why-it-wont-add-additional-pvp-mechanics-like-leaderboards"><u>the game isn't about shooting other players</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can do that if you want to,” he added, “but the ethos of the game has never been to go in and shoot players. It's a part that we use to craft tension.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Arc Raiders community is still deciphering its favorite way to experience the evolving extraction shooter.

Still, a small cluster of fans had been tracking Anthem's final hours, and a few dozen had been playing the game on Twitch to see out its final moments. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At around 10.03am Pacific, in-game players reported getting suddenly booted as the plug was pulled. After warnings of a connection problem, players were left sitting back on the Anthem's startup screen, showing the game's logo and its characters — now left to forever tinker with their amored Javelin suits, which will never fly again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of all the dead live games, this is one of the most painful, as the game was so very close to greatness," wrote Anthem fan <a href="https://twitter.com/Com_Raven/status/2010807200458117385" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marcel Hatam</a> on X/Twitter. "Great core gameplay with fun combat and flying, an intriguing world and great customization. Freelancer signing off 🫡."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Damn wanted to get a few more hours before closure, sad," wrote new fan Regis via BioWare's Discord, who said they'd only given Anthem a try this month after learning it was shutting down. "Got to play the game for just a week but it already leaves a hole in my chest."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/12/playing-anthem-until-the-servers-shut-down-01-33-45-1768250034127.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">BioWare's Anthem, 2019 - 2026.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem launched in February 2019 to lukewarm reviews, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/anthem-review">including IGN's own</a>, which criticized the game's grindiness, lack of polish and mismatched story. The game sold more than 5 million copies but failed to meet EA's own internal targets, set after a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bioware-executive-producer-breaks-down-what-really-happened-to-anthem">long and troubled development</a>. Despite some effort to further update and improve the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anthem-development-ceases-bioware-to-focus-on-dragon-age-mass-effect">BioWare ceased active development on Anthem back in February 2021</a>, citing a need to prioritize Dragon Age: The Veilguard (which launched in late 2024 to its own set of mixed feedback) and Mass Effect 5 (which is still seemingly years away).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem publisher EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-will-shut-down-anthem-in-january">announced last year that it would stop running the game's servers today</a>, and confirmed that users would no longer be able play at all after this point. Premium in-game currency was withdrawn from sale last summer, and the game was delisted at the same time from EA Play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">An online-only action RPG spread across a large multiplayer map, Anthem had no offline option — meaning that the game's world, characters and lore are now officially gone for good. But as IGN reported last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-biowares-failed-live-service-anthem-gets-ready-to-die-players-rush-to-unlock-platinums-and-say-their-goodbyes-while-others-work-on-custom-servers">there are fledgling efforts underway by fans to bring Anthem back online via custom servers</a>, though it is too early to tell exactly how far this option might progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <guid>1403917</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Run that one by me again?</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Peak, a popular cooperative climbing game, costs $5. Except it actually costs $8, which is basically $5. And it's on sale right now for just under $5, which is also $5, but if it dropped down to $3 it would actually be $2, which is basically free...</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>"What.", </em>you are probably thinking right now, but hear me out. It kinda makes sense. This goofy pricing scheme comes directly from Peak co-creator Nick Kaman in an <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/peak-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Game File</a>, where he explains how his team came to the game's actual sale price of $7.99. In the interview, he shares a theory about indie game pricing vibes that the team floated around as a bit of a joke that still has some truth behind it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We had this joke of, like, how much is a game really? In a player’s mind, what does it mean to spend five bucks? Well, that’s five bucks. But six bucks? Well, that’s still five bucks. Four bucks is also kind of five bucks. Three bucks is two bucks. And two bucks is basically free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we’ve got these tiers: You know, twelve bucks… that’s ten bucks. But thirteen bucks is fifteen bucks. “And we found that eight bucks is still five bucks. It doesn’t become ten bucks. Seven ninety nine, that’s five bucks, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, eight bucks going to five bucks is the biggest differential we could find in pricing, so we found it very optimal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're still reeling from this a bit, what Kaman is trying to say here is that a person getting ready to spend money on a game might see a price tag for $7 or $8, and psychologically not feel it's that different from $5. But if a game is $9, it feels more expensive, closer to $10. And if a game is $2, it feels basically free to them.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no exact science behind that, to be clear, but Kaman is working off his seven years of experience at Aggro Crab, and it seems to have worked out for the team. Peak launched in June 2025, and by August <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/peak-sells-10-million-copies">it had sold 10 million copies</a>. Though its playerbase has (naturally and understandably) shrunk since launch, it's still pulling in tens of thousands of people per day, which is a huge feat for such a small game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Peak is currently on sale for $4.95, which is almost actually $5, and the lowest price it's ever been offered for. It's also significantly cheaper than basically everything AAA, as major publisher game prices in recent years have slowly crept up from $60 to $70, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raised-xbox-console-and-game-prices-analysts-say-playstation-and-everyone-else-could-be-next">now even $80</a>, a price that definitely doesn't feel like $5 or $10. Meanwhile, discussions in the indie game community about what to charge for a game remain ongoing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indie-developers-are-worried-silksongs-20-price-tag-will-make-it-harder-to-price-their-games">following a $20 price tag on Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> causing some to panic about how it would impact their own prices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
