After various jump scares (Espurr! A Clefairy doll!) we finally see the new Mega species.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/21/screenshot-2025-08-21-150629-1755781658156.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mega Victreebell.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends Z-A features a long-awaited return to the Kalos region, home to the series' popular Mega Evolution mechanic. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mega-pokmon-species-revealed-for-pokmon-legends-z-a">previous trailer announced Mega Dragonite</a>, the franchise's first new Mega Pokémon in over a decade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not confirmed, Legends Z-A expected to feature several dozen new Mega Pokémon designs, as well as familiar Mega Pokémon such as Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Absol, and Mega Charizard X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the game's main story, it involves the seemingly-spontaneous Mega Evolution of local wild Pokémon, dubbed Rogue Mega Pokémon. You'll need to utilise your own Mega Pokémon to take them down, and you can also bring in help from one of your allies to battle alongside you.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Overall, Legends: Z-A didn’t feel like a full action game to me," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-system-first-impressions">first hands-on impressions of Pokémon Legends Z-A's battle systems</a>, "but kind of more like an MMO, with its casting times, cooldowns, and behind-the-scenes math happening. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but I do hope Legends: Z-A gets challenging enough to make me more intentionally dish out commands and think about switching Pokémon at just the right moment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends Z-A arrives for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans believe they've worked out the setting of Forza Horizon 6, based on a teasing social media post from a car import company connected to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a now-deleted Instagram post, vehicle import firm Cult and Classic shared an image purporting to show a Forza Horizon staff member digitally scanning a car made by Japanese manufacturer Kei for use in the series' next game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The post went on to state that the staff member had travelled to its premises in Australia to scan a series of Kei models, which are unusual to find outside of Japan. And it's because of this (as well as the post's subsequent removal) that fans now believe Japan is Forza Horizon 6's setting.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Exciting news!" the post read. "We have Cody here, from @forzahorizonofficial, shooting cars for the next installation in the series. As there are no late-model Kei cars in America, he has flown out from the states to use our cars as the basis for their digital versions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are HUGE gamers here at Cult and Classic, and it is an honor to be supporting Forza and making Kei cards accessible virtually for people who can't have them IRL."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Knoebel goes GamesCom (@Knoebelbroet) <a href="https://twitter.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1958294206205858164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Japan has ranked highly among the most-requested locations for Forza Horizon 6, following previous series entries set in Australia, Mexico and the UK. Xbox boss Phil Spencer recently confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-teases-return-of-halo-in-2026-and-its-reportedly-a-halo-combat-evolved-remaster">the next Forza game would arrive in 2026</a>, and this is widely expected to be a new Forza Horizon game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the original Forza Motorsport series, Microsoft's most recent round of staff cuts in July heavily impacted developer Turn 10 Studios, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-motorsport-team-is-no-more-former-developer-claims-with-remaining-turn-10-staff-left-to-support-the-horizon-side">one former employee stating that the Forza Motorsport team was "no more"</a>, though some staff remain to assist on Forza Horizon development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
