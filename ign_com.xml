            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Get ready, Nightfarers — an overview trailer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign"><u>Elden Ring: Nightreign</u></a>'s upcoming ultra-hard Deep of Night mode just dropped alongside patch notes for Update 1.02.2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new mode comes after the new update brings balance changes for Nightfarers and Everdark Sovereigns, as well as numerous bug fixes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Deep of Night mode teaser, below, comes just in time to whet our appetites for tomorrow's (September 11) release of the highly anticipated mode, giving us "an in-depth look at this new, high-difficulty challenge for seasoned Nightfarers."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring: Nightreign's rumored ultra-hard difficulty mode was first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-say-theyve-uncovered-an-entirely-new-ultra-hard-game-mode"><u>uncovered by dataminers back in August</u></a>. And after lots of speculation about what the mode would and wouldn't include, we now know enemies will be stronger across the board, and players won't get a heads up about which Nightlord they'll be fighting, nor if they'll get a Shifting Earth event in advance, so you won't be able to prep a build for any specific type of run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, to counterbalance this, players will be able to collect new types of weapons and relics with even more powerful effects, though they may also have some new drawbacks attached as well. The more you play, the deeper you'll descend, going at least as far as Depth 5. Each new Depth gets even more challenging, with losses pushing you back up to easier Depths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And just in case there was any lingering doubt about the wild success of FromSoftware's juggernaut series, publisher Bandai Namco recently confirmed Elden Ring's DLC, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree"><u>Shadow of the Erdtree</u></a>, has sold over 10 million copies, and its co-op spin-off title, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a>, 5 million.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-it-actually-worth-preordering-borderlands-4-or-should-you-wait.1294023/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's what you need to know.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 is officially<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-global-release-times-confirmed"> releasing on September 12</a> for <em>most </em>platforms. The exception to that is the Switch 2 edition that won't arrive until later in October. It's one of the most anticipated games of 2025 and fans of the Borderlands series have been eagerly awaiting its arrival since it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-with-teaser-trailer-at-opening-night-live-gamescom-2024">first announced last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the release date upon us, however, you may be wondering if it's actually worth preordering the game now or waiting. I've played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-games-in-order">every mainline Borderlands game</a> with my dad over the years, so this is a question that I'm especially interested in. My dad has informed me that he's planning on preordering the Super Deluxe Edition of the game purely for the added DLC, but I'm thinking I'll probably wait a bit longer to see if I can get a discount later down the line. There's a lot to consider, but to start here's a quick rundown of the main editions you can preorder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Borderlands 4 Preorders - What Comes With Each Edition</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are really only two editions of the game worth preordering. There's the standard edition, which comes with the base game <em>and</em> a preorder bonus as well as the super deluxe version, which comes with a bunch of extras as well. Here's a quick breakdown of each:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Standard Edition</h3><div catalogid="28a64a86-ee8f-4f65-82e1-797e39965a10" id="223086"><div id="223086" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The standard edition of the game is exactly what it sounds like. It's the base game for whatever platform you choose. If you decide to preorder it ahead of release, you will get a preorder bonus called the <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/gilded-glory-pack/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gilded Glory Pack</a>. This includes a Vault Hunter Skin, a Weapon Skin, and an Echo 4 Drone Skin. Beyond that you will get your copy of the game on day one and will be able to play it right away.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Super Deluxe Edition</h3></div><div catalogid="28a64a86-ee8f-4f65-82e1-797e39965a10" id="223087"><div id="223087" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 Super Deluxe Edition - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The super deluxe edition of the game is almost double the cost of the base game. It includes the full base game, the Firehawk's Fury Weapons Skin, the Ornate Order Pack, the Bounty Pack Bundle, the Vault Hunter Pack, and the preorder bonus Gilded Glory Pack. The main reason to get this edition, however, is for the additional DLC content and playable characters that come with the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4-bounty-pack-bundle/9MWDKHJH6G7B" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bounty Pack Bundle</a> and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4-vault-hunter-pack/9PG964GJNRF8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vault Hunter Pack</a>. These two add-ons include new areas, missions, bosses, regions to explore, and two additional playable characters that don't come with the base game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is It Actually Worth a Preorder?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're on the fence about deciding whether or not it's worth preordering, I'd say it really comes down to whether or not you're willing to pay full price for the game, whether or not you care about the preorder bonus, and whether or not you care about playing the game on day one. It's unlikely that the price of the game is going to really drop until next year, so if you <em>do</em> really want to dive into it on day one then there's really no reason not to grab a preorder now. The bonus you get is just some additional skins and weapons, so if you don't care about that the real benefit is getting your copy as soon as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like with any AAA title, however, it's worth noting that there will likely be bugs you'll be contending with in the early days of gameplay. Randy Pitchford has already made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-day-1-patch-does-a-lot-randy-pitchford-says-but-dont-expect-miracles-from-older-pc-hardware">comments about the day 1 patch</a> you'll have to download once you actually have the game, and it's highly likely even more patches will come. So if you want the best possible gameplay experience, it's probably worth waiting a bit until all of the kinks are worked out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I plan on waiting until the game gets discounted simply because I can't stand paying the full price for any video game anymore. I'm definitely excited to play co-op with my dad, but since he's retired he'll blow through the whole thing on his own multiple times before I'm actually going to be ready to jump in there with him so there's no rush for me to buy now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">No one can accuse <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> of being a short game, or lacking more reasons to stick around after its main campaign wraps up. Ubisoft itself recommends you set aside 60 hours to reach its end credits, which eventually roll after you complete missions meant to cap off the personal journeys of its dual protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke. Six months after launch, my save file is now north of 100 hours, as I continue to explore further untouched corners of its map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that said, Shadows' story still feels incomplete. When those credits eventually do roll, several key story threads remain unresolved, such as the location and true status of Naoe's monther, as well as the last of three mysterious boxes — the hunt for which drives much of the game's plot. Yasuke, meanwhile, declares his mission to hunt down Templars is only just beginning. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's something of an odd note for a finale — but then, with the 10-hour Claws of Awaji expansion set to continue the story (and release free for those who pre-ordered Shadows, as an apology for the game's delay), it's clear that Shadows' end wasn't really the finale of its story at all. Assassin's Creed games have long had DLC to continue the adventures of its heroes, but never before has an expansion been so closely tied to the story of its base game, something which should make Claws of Awaji feel more essential, while also upping the pressure on its makers to ensure it delivers. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Claws of Awaji is the work of Ubisoft Bordeaux, the team behind the enjoyable but inessential Assassin's Creed Valhalla DLC Curse of the Druids that went on to lead the well-received Assassin's Creed Mirage. In a recent visit to the studio, I sat down with Claws of Awaji content director Simon Arsenault to find out how his team worked closely with Shadows' lead studio Ubisoft Quebec to continue Naoe's story and deliver "proper closure" to fans awaiting answers at last.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we started, we pitched a couple of ideas," Arsenault said. "Eventually we met with Quebec. They had thought of stuff before because they've been working on the project like two or three years before we jumped in. But that doesn't mean that they wanted to realize it — it was just an idea. Everyone can have ideas — that's kind of the easy part. You come up with an idea and then you trash it. That's easy. But trying to kind of act on it and figure out every detail of it, that's where the real craftsmanship is. So they had thought of stuff, but they weren't necessarily attached to everything. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Ubisoft Quebec] already had some backstories prepared for Naoe's mother and how she and [Naoe's father Fujibayashi] Nagato had met, for example. So it was kind of easy to grapple those ideas and say 'Okay, how can we make it? Well, she was the first Japanese-born Assassin. Cool. How does that translate in their relationship?'"</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Without spoiling too much of Shadow's introduction, it's safe to say that Naoe heads to the game's new island of Awaji after being given strong reason to believe her mother Tsuyu is being held captive there. Upon arrival, Naoe then uncovers the truth about Tsyu's status — and hears word of that final mystery box — which sets her off on the expansion's main adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The main game didn't have as much personal relationship," Arsenault says, discussing the scenes scattered throughout Claws of Awaji where Naoe learns more about her family. "[There's] a lot at the beginning with Nagato, a little bit with Tomiko, with Junjiro for sure. But the ending, we couldn't necessarily have a relationship. The mother is still not there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So [we said] 'let's bring in something personal to that character' — and it was also helpful to have it [set] after," Aresnault continued, referencing the fact that Claws of Awaji is chronologically set firmly as a coda to the main game, and cannot be played until after the credits have rolled. "And for Yasuke as well — if we had done it somewhere else in the story, well, Yasuke wouldn't have finished his own storyline, so he had not even talked to Naoe about his own mother."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We didn't know if there would be a second box or a third box or all the boxes"</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Bordeaux wasn't necessarily always set to make this story, Arsenault revealed. Claws of Awaji's focus on the mysteries of Naoe's mother, and that third box, were both part of the discussions the studio had with Quebec as development began. For example, Bordeaux knew the expansion would introduce a new weapon to the game, but which it would be was not set in stone. (It's the Bo Staff, which all players will receive free whether they own Claws of Awaji or not.) As for Naoe's mother, did Bordeaux "have to make an expansion about her specifically?" Arsenault questioned. "Maybe not."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also sounds like there was some flux within Shadows' main storyline as development on it, and Claws of Awaji, both progressed. Fans have long wondered about Shadow's main macguffins, the three boxes ultimately said to contain the Japanese Imperial Regalia. Was it always the case that only two would be found in the main game, with a third left for the expansion?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It happened very fast," Aresnault replied. "It happened very fast, as soon as we started talking. If I remember correctly, because the game was still moving at that time, there was only one box total in the game, so we didn't know if there would be a second box or a third box or all the boxes. So they were still competing their own game. That's when we started talking about closing a little bit, the arc of the Regalia, that's when we started [saying], 'okay, well maybe we can bring in another box.'" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was at this point that Bordeaux also decided to feature the returning character of Hattori Hanzo in Claws of Awaji as well, Arsenault continued. "That's when Hanzo came in, so yeah, it's a back and forth. Since the expansion is released kind of close to the release of the main game, both of them have to be produced at the same time in the timeline. Otherwise you don't ship this amount of content with this amount of quality."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this talk about Naoe's personal story, I was curious how Claws of Awaji would feature Yasuke. "So we focus his story more on — he still has a Templar hunt ongoing," Arsenault said, "but he's more in as a support role to Naoe emotionally at this point. He's kind of helping her go through what she's living." Where Naoe and Yasuke often had their own journeys in Shadows, they are "on one path together" in Claws of Awaji, Arsenault continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a story so closely tied into that of the base game, Claws of Awaji is being positioned as an experience that Assassin's Creed fans will want to return for. And after that — once my save file has reached at least 110 hours — will Bordeaux's expansion now provide a final finale? Or has it been tasked with passing Shadows' story baton on to yet anoher team?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're trying to make a closure for now, give Naoe a closure for her personal story," Arsenault concluded. "You can always reopen things, we've seen TV shows do it, we've seen movies do it. It's easy to do. So there's nothing closing the door completely. But we can expect at least to have proper closure to Naoe's story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on the expansion, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-knows-youve-already-played-100-hours-of-assassins-creed-shadows-but-hopes-you-return-for-claws-of-awaji-to-play-the-expansions-cool-metal-gear-solid-inspired-stealth-boss-fight">IGN's report on Claws of Awaji's Metal Gear Solid-inspired stealth boss fight</a>, and Arsenault's thoughts on keeping players entertained with fresh ideas, even 100 hours of gameplay later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
