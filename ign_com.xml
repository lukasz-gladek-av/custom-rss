            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Get ready for the non-VR version of the "next evolution of Alien combat" this September.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN can exclusively reveal a brand-new gameplay trailer for Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One: Evolved Edition, the previously VR-exclusive shooter that is set to be released on PS5 and PC on September 30, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new footage, which you can see below and is filled with blood and snow, shows plenty of Xenomorphs stalking the main character - ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks - and the terrifying and exhilarating action that will follow, complete with Pulse Rifles, Motion Trackers, jump scares, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the story, for those who didn't play Alien: Rogue Incursion when it first launched on PlayStation VR2 and PCVR via Steam in December 2024 (And on Meta Quest in February), it is set on the planet Purdan (LV-354) in Gemini Exoplanet Solutions' Castor's Cradle research facility that is now "hauntingly desolate." Oh, and it's set between the events of Alien and Aliens and Zula will be traveling with a Synthetic companion named Davis 01.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new version features everything included in the original plus "elevated visuals, immersive environments, and deadlier Xenomorphs." It also runs at 60 FPS and promises to be the "next evolution of Alien combat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alien-rogue-incursion-review">review of the original Alien: Rogue Incursion,</a> we said it is "a faithful and entertaining stab at bringing Alien to virtual reality. The excellent story, spot-on Alien environments, and creepy Xenomorphs keep the horrifying times going throughout its eight-hour duration, even when repetitive combat, predictable AI, and the odd bug here and there make it clear this is the first attempt that it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But while there’s plenty of room for this budding series to grow, I can already happily recommend Rogue Incursion as a strong proof of concept to Alien fans and newcomers alike – one that’s left me eagerly awaiting Part Two."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Part Two, we don't know much besides that it is currently in development and that it "continues Zula's story, pitting her against deadlier enemies and more difficult challenges."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from SDCC, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-coming-to-ign-san-diego-comic-con-2025-live-show">all the details of our live-show</a> that will feature Project Hail Mary, King of the Hill, Peacemaker, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“Why would you guys bring that up?"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cast your mind back to 2023. At the time, MCU fans didn’t know who exactly would go on to play The Sentry in Thunderbolts*, but the rumor mill pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/invincible">Invincible</a> star Steven Yeun. So when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-walking-dead-star-steven-yeuns-top-secret-mcu-role-revealed">Invincible creator Robert Kirkman let slip that Yeun would be playing Robert Reynolds</a>, aka The Sentry, in Thunderbolts*, Marvel fans went wild.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s that original quote from Kirkman two years ago:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, he [Yeun] called me, he went in for a costume fitting. I hope I’m not... I don’t think this is a spoiler or anything that will get anybody in trouble. I don’t know, maybe. We’ll see. I don’t care. I don’t work for Marvel. What are they going to do to me?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, he called me and he said, 'I just came back from a costume fitting for The Sentry. I guess I only do superheroes that are yellow and blue.' He said he was at the costume fitting and was like, 'Aww, crap. I forgot Invincible was yellow and blue.'"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward two years, with Thunderbolts* out the door, and we know The Sentry eventually went to Lewis Pullman after Yeun himself dropped out. But at the time, Yeun as The Sentry felt like a sure thing. After all, Kirkman had confirmed it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, it seemed, caused Kirkman all sorts of trouble. In an interview with IGN at San Diego Comic-Con 2025 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-kirkman-teases-massive-roster-of-playable-characters-for-invincible-vs-thats-a-spoiler-i-might-get-in-trouble-for-that-sdcc-2025">to promote fighting game Invincible VS</a>, we asked Kirkman <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aang-avatar-movie-adds-invincibles-steven-yeun-to-its-cast">who Yeun will play in the upcoming animated The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender movie</a>, given how much he seemingly knows about the actor's schedule.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't want to lose any more sleep spoiling Steven Yeun news!” Kirkman said. “I cannot tell you how much that Thunderbolts thing affected me.” Then, Kirkman joked: “Why would you guys bring that up? I'm so angry.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Avatar: The Last Airbender Episodes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirkman wenton to reveal that he actually <em>does</em> know who Yeun plays in The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender, but this time stopped short of spilling the beans - perhaps with his Thunderbolts / Marvel run-in in mind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The best part is he told me who he's playing in The Last Airbender and I was like, ‘I wish I didn't know. I wish I didn't know.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirkman continued the joke, saying Steven Yeun is set to play Abraham Lincoln in the unconfirmed hit TV show based on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skinbreaker-skybound-exclusive-preview-robert-kirkman-david-finch">Skinbreaker</a>, his new comic book series he’s working on with artist David Finch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At Comic-Con this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-4s-dinosaurus-has-a-voice-actor-robert-kirkman-says-7-9-seasons-needed-to-do-the-complete-comic-arc-jokes-season-5-will-be-out-in-2032-sdcc-2025">Kirkman announced Invincible Season 4's Dinosaurus voice actor</a>, revealed how many seasons the show will need to complete the story of the comics, and joked Season 5 will be out in 2032.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting together for a game day with your group of friends is a special experience. Imagining what you will play, finally getting those couple of games to the table to try, or being surprised by what new thing your friend got is all just part of the charm of these events. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some games, however, are events unto themselves – games that take most, if not a whole, day (or more) to play. That's where the games on this list fall. Titles that may require a weekend getaway with your close friends to one of those nice cabins in the woods, or on one of those giant tables you can find at a game convention. It may take a while to plan, but playing these games will still provide you with memories that can last a lifetime.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in This Article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're too busy playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a> to read blurbs, you can see all the games on the list in the catalog above. But if you want to dig deeper into what each of the games is, keep on scrolling and reading.</p><p id="axis-allies-1940"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Axis &amp; Allies: 1940"><strong>Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Global (A&amp;A 1940 Europe + 1940 Pacific)</strong></h2></p><div id="225829" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Europe Second Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225830"><div id="225830" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Pacific Second Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Axis &amp; Allies series of wargames has been around for over 40 years at this point, letting fans of World War 2 fight one another to their heart's content. Composed of two separate games – Axis &amp; Allies 1940 Europe and 1940 Pacific – Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Global is by far the largest of the franchise, with a combined board that dwarfs the already impressive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/axis-allies-40th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review"><u>Axis &amp; Allies 1940 Anniversary Edition</u></a> and requires a large table to play on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with its large footprint, this game still accommodates between <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two players</a> and six players, with one team assuming the roles of the Allied Powers and the other the Axis, as they take turns buying units, moving them around, and rolling dice to wage war. Even with experienced players, this is a game you should plan a weekend to play, when factoring in short breaks for things like food or sleep. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These versions of Axis &amp; Allies add in new types of ground and air units, different types of factories, and other adjustments that make Europe, Pacific, and Global arguably the most intricate of entries of the main series, and may not be the best option for folks new to the games. But, if you do plan to play this option a lot, it may be worthwhile to invest in the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akK0X5?object_uuid=0c69ce94-1081-4ba2-9419-d8d18336260e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">neoprene map</a> Renegade offers, which is the global map and is scaled up slightly to make it easier to fit all your units on spaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To get a better idea of just how long this game can take, the world tournament that's held at <a href="https://www.gencon.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gen Con</a> has a rule that limits the game time to nine hours. A nine-hour match for folks who are considered experts in the game, and even then, sometimes it isn’t long enough!</p></div><p id="twilight-imperium-4th-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Twilight Imperium: 4th Edition"><strong>Twilight Imperium 4th Edition + Prophecy of Kings Expansion</strong></h2></p><div id="225831" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Twilight Imperium: 4th Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225832"><div id="225832" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Twilight Imperium 4th Edition - Prophecy of Kings Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of all the games on this list, Twilight Imperium is probably the one whose legend is most known for how long it takes to play, and the most current iteration, 4th Edition (especially when paired with its Prophecy of Kings expansion) continues that Legacy. Twilight Imperium is a massive space 4x game (eXpand, eXploit, eXpore, eXterminate) where players not only have to navigate the hazards of space, but also of one another. It's a game I'm quite fond of, ranking it among one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games"><u>best wargames</u></a> on the market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While at first glance TI may appear to look like just another wargame set in space, you spend more of your time negotiating and making deals than shooting out missiles if you want to succeed. While it’s almost a running joke that anyone who owns this game never actually plays it, if you should find yourself so lucky to play it or have the tablespace for it, there are few games out there that can offer such a memorable experience. If you start a game in the morning, you should be able to complete a game in a single day, even though you may be a little late getting home.</p></div><p id="mega-empires"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Empires">Mega Empires <strong> (The East + The West)</strong></h2></p><div id="225833" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Empires: The East</h3></p></div><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225834"><div id="225834" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Empires: The West</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Axis &amp; Allies: 1940 Global, Mega Empires is also the amalgamation of two large games, merged into an even larger monolith that can accommodate 18 – yes, you read that right – players. Despite its size, the actual flow and play of game isn’t all that complicated, with players taking control over advancing a specific ancient civilization, spreading out their troops, building cities, and trading resources with one another in an effort to create large pairs of the same type of resource, with more matching cards earning more victory points. There isn’t much in the way of war in this game, as it's much more focused on trading and negotiating trades with your neighbors to get cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big twist, however, is that in addition to having to trade at least three cards, you only have to tell the truth about two of them, which can be dangerous as the person who is promising you one thing, could be in fact, handing over one calamity card, too. These make for all sorts of trouble, but they also keep things exciting and tense. This game you should probably factor in a weekend to play comfortably, though it does have rules specifically for when players have to leave the game partway through. That should tell you just how long a game can last.</p></div><p id="war-of-the-ring-2nd-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="War of The Ring 2nd Edition">War of The Ring: 2nd Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225835"><div id="225835" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>War of The Ring 2nd Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Often described as “Lord of the Rings in a box,” War of the Ring by ARES Games puts players in the role of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth and the other as the Shadow as they rewrite the epic confrontations from Tolkien’s masterpiece. How would things play out if Boromir didn’t fall in battle, or the Strider split off early from the group to rally the people to war? Do you think you could have won the war for the Dark Lord where Saruman failed? Well, it’s time to put your gold where your dragon is and prove it! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For experienced players, this is a game that won’t take all day, and can be played in a few hours, but you will still feel exhausted and worn out from just how tense this game can get. And for newer players, you can expect a good six-plus hours of gameplay ahead. Between its strategic army play, action cards that can turn the tides of an encounter, and the slow-but-steady progression of the Fellowship towards delivering the One Ring to Mt. Doom, this game is a must-own for fans of Lord of the Rings. Here at IGN, we think its one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><u>best board games that you should play this year</u></a>.</p></div><p id="diplomacy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Diplomacy">Diplomacy</h2></p><div catalogid="887c903f-436c-4631-a61e-620e319d9fc0" id="225836"><div id="225836" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Diplomacy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in 20th-century Europe prior to the outbreak of World War I, Diplomacy places up to seven players in the roles of the heads of Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey as they strive to gain territory. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games"><u>classic board game</u></a> is far less about rolling the dice and waging war, but is more about making backroom deals with other players and backstabbing each other for your benefit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each turn begins with a 15-minute phase where players can go and negotiate their deals and decide on their plans, before returning to the board and writing their orders out – yes, you physically write out your orders – for their armies and naval fleets. No dice rolling is involved. Your goal is to be the first person to control 18 of the various Supply Centers around the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diplomacy is jokingly referred to as “the friend killer” as this game can be nasty, and lead to tempers rising, but that is also part of the fun. If you have a good group of friends, you can make a game of this into the event, perhaps with period-appropriate food and dress from the country you are controlling for added fun.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.
