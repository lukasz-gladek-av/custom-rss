The Ghost of Tsushima sequel did show up for a brief appearance during the tail end of the presentation but mostly served simply as a reminder that Sucker Punch is still hard at work to meet its October release date.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it may have been disappointing to see Ghost of Yōtei come and go so quickly, it sounds like the July State of Play gameplay deep dive will do more to help with the wait. Sucker Punch’s showcase doesn’t have a release date yet but is said to focus entirely on Ghost of Yōtei and its “evolved gameplay mechanics, including exploration, combat, and much more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch formally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">announced</a> its Ghost of Tsushima sequel last September, promising to place players in the shoes of new protagonist Atsu as she embarks on a bloody journey through Japan in 1603. Although the wait for story and gameplay details has been painful for those hoping for a sequel since the original game launched in 2020, director Nate Fox has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-director-vows-to-deliver-a-respectful-representation-of-japan-on-par-with-ghost-of-tsushima">said the experience will be "a respectful representation" of Japan</a>, just like its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Yōtei has a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-confirms-ghost-of-ytei-ps5-release-date-with-new-trailer"><u>release date</u></a> of October 2, 2025 for PS5.

We later see Bond as a young recruit in the Royal Navy, from which he is recruited by MI6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's here that players pick up Bond's story as he becomes an agent, picks up an Omega watch, and starts annoying Q by trying out his gadgets in the lab. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A press release issued alongside the game's State of Play appearance lists Bond's age in 007 First Light as "a young 26-year-old". Players will be traverse the globe in what is described as "a story-driven action-adventure game" where you can choose how to navigate various challenges — either with brute force or 007's trademark charm.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">007 First Light screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What looks like gameplay footage shows James Bond on a mission, stealthing around, using gadgets — and his fists — to subdue enemies, as the hero is sent off to target a rogue agent. "009 is a master manipulator," Greenway says at one point. "Whatever the endgame is, we won't see it coming." Oh, and yes you can dress up in disguises, as you'd expect from the Hitman studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive's James Bond game was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-developer-announces-new-bond-game-project-007">first announced back in 2020</a> as Project 007, and since then we've learned very little about it. Still, from the off, IO said that it was developing a fresh James Bond origin story and a wholly original piece of work, rather than anything that followed the events of any particular film. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak has said he hoped 007 First Light would be the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy">start of a new trilogy of games</a>, though unfortunately the studio's beloved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-franchise-on-hiatus-as-io-interactive-focuses-on-james-bond-game">Hitman franchise is on hiatus</a> while IO works on this game. We also learned just this past April that in addition to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-bond-origin-story-game-project-007-officially-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">007 First Light is getting a Nintendo Switch 2 release</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

A demo is live now on PS5 until June 18. Players who complete the demo will unlock an exclusive in-game helmet at launch. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb, from <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/nioh-3-announced-for-ps5-limited-time-demo-available-today/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>:</p><blockquote>In Nioh 3, the protagonist is a young warrior poised to become the next Shogun. Why is he dedicated to battling against yokai? We’ll save those details for another day, but what we can tell you today is as the battles unfold, players will now be able to fight using two distinct combat styles: Samurai and Ninja.</blockquote><blockquote>The Samurai style provides a gameplay experience similar to previous Nioh titles. New actions such as Arts Proficiency, which enhances the power of martial arts, and Deflect, which allows players to block enemy attacks at the last moment have been added, helping create a series of intense and deadly face-to-face confrontations.</blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, the Ninja style excels in quick movements like dodging and aerial actions, giving ninjas the advantage of being able to attack from outside of the enemy’s range by utilizing a variety of “Ninjitsu” techniques according to the situation on the battlefield. Players have the ability to use techniques like Mist, which leaves a clone after an attack, and Evade, which allows for narrowly avoiding enemy strikes. Both techniques help players outmaneuver foes while delivering devastating speed attacks from behind.</blockquote><blockquote>Players will be able to switch between battle styles instantly at any time, playing in their preferred style in a storyline defined by the strong, the swift, and the wicked. Based on the tendencies of the enemies and stages, some players will prefer to switch seamlessly between Samurai and Ninja techniques, while others will choose to fight using only one style continuously based on the challenge ahead. Feel free to play with the style you like best as you battle some of the fiercest enemies we’ve created to date!</blockquote><blockquote>Aside from the new battle styles, Nioh 3 also enables players to enjoy an open field that offers a new freedom of exploration to the unique tension and confrontations that have become a defining characteristic of the Nioh series. Experience unexpected encounters with formidable yokai, explore suspicious villages riddled in violent secrets, and take on the daunting challenges of The Crucible. Enjoy the thrilling, hostile new environments as you fight to survive the cursed kingdom!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">We're pretty big Nioh fans here at IGN. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nioh">gave the original Nioh a 9.6/10</a>, calling it "an epic, unforgettable adventure carried by a fierce combat system that cleverly balances style and strategy." We similarly praised Nioh 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-2-review">with a 9/10</a>, saying that its "many systems may be a little overwhelming, but the stellar combat and satisfying difficulty make it worth it." The Nioh series has been very, very quiet ever since the 2020 release of Nioh 2, though Team Ninja itself has kept busy with releases such as Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, Rise of the Rōnin, and the upcoming Ninja Gaiden 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you missed it, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Sony's State of Play June 2025 showcase</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

You play as an astronaut man, Hugh, who's come into some unexpected enconter in space that's left him vulnerable. He's saved by a little girl whose name is actually DI0367, but who the astronaut dubs Diana.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though she's small, Diana's far from helpless - she has some sort of magic-techno-hacking powers that enable her to help out her astronaut friend as they fight off the weird robot-alien creatures trying to "neutralize" them. You'll play as both characters simultaneously, with Diana riding on Hugh's back. Per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/pragmata-coming-to-ps5-2026-new-gameplay-revealed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, it looks like the main threat is a lunar station AI that's preventing Hugh from returning to earth...from the moon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pragmata was first unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pragmata-capcom-release-date-2022">way back in 2020</a>, with a trailer of an astronaut, a little girl, and some weird yet beautiful imagery, but little explanation as to what sort of game we were looking at. It was originally planned for a 2022 release, but was then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-delayed-2023">later delayed until 2023</a>, and then paused indefinitely <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-delayed-indefinitely-as-capcom-apologizes">with an apologetic trailer</a>. We haven't seen anything of it since, so this re-unveiling hopefully means that its development is finally making some serious progress, and we'll get our hands on it soon...in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
