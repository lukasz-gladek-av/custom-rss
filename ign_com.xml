            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Get a major discount on what we called "one of the best 3D action games in recent memory."</h2></p><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Best Buy's latest Deal of the Day has dropped the critically acclaimed <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gXPLB?object_uuid=97efdc70-2715-41e9-9ce5-0c48d8de995c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ninja Gaiden 4 down to just $42.99</a> for<strong> one day only</strong> on Xbox. Not only that, but this is the Deluxe Edition as well, making this discount all the more impressive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Deluxe Edition of the game retails for $89.99, so that's a serious $47 saving, and available for just a few dollars more than the game was listed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-deal-best-buys-winter-sale-2026">on sale for at the start of the year ($40)</a>, and you're getting a whole lot more for it as well.</p><div id="235440"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235440" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>NINJA GAIDEN 4 - Deluxe Edition (Xbox)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's included? For just over $40, you're getting the base game, future gameplay content (The Two Masters DLC), exclusive character skins (Traditional Dark Blue, Legendary Black Falcon for Ryu; Divine Chimera, Raven Master for Yakumo), the Blade of the Archfiend weapon skin, 50,000 bonus NinjaCoin, and additional in-game items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The standout is definitely the DLC content, The Two Masters, which is still expected to release in early 2026, so stay tuned for more news on that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, as I mentioned, this deal is also not long for this world. You've got until the end of the day at 11:59 PM ET, February 12, 2026, to secure the discount. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yeah, yeah, this is also on Xbox Game Pass, but you remember when we used to own games? Those were the days! I have personally been trying to buy more physical games and more physical media in general, and I'd highly recommend others do the same as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Think about it this way as well: Game Pass Ultimate is $29.99 per month, and at just $13 more, you can <em>own </em>the game to revisit and play the DLC on as well. That's worth it, at least in my opinion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-review">review</a> from IGN’s Mitchell Saltzman said, “Despite its disappointing story and bland level design, Ninja Gaiden 4's excellent combat still make it one of the best 3D action games in recent memory.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It even earned a runner-up nomination for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-action-game-of-2025">Best Action Game of 2025</a>, as it’s a “pure action fan’s action game, featuring some of the best melee combat we've seen in years, bolstered by aggressive enemy AI, excellent weapon design, and the ability to let your creativity run wild by giving you the freedom to hotswap between all of your weapons on the fly.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is IGN's Senior Commerce Editor and resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

You can also find preorders for <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8pXq?object_uuid=3e8bdab4-0b4c-4b4d-b60f-5ab22c875c7b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Secrets of Strixhaven boosters</a> down to $149.99 as well right now. That's another serious discount for some cards that aren't even out yet, and worth checking out if you haven't locked in your preorder yet. Just as a reminder as well, Amazon won't charge you for preorders until at dispatch closer to release day for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-marvel-super-heroes-tcg-where-to-buy">Marvel</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-secrets-of-strixhaven-tcg-where-to-buy">Strixhaven</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-next-precon-deck-is-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-themed-and-its-already-discounted-just-a-few-weeks-from-launch">TMNT</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving away from preorders, another notable set on sale is Bloomburrow's Play Booster Display, down to just <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPx7jA?object_uuid=3e8bdab4-0b4c-4b4d-b60f-5ab22c875c7b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$142.99 at Amazon</a>.

There are usually 5 Commons, 4 Uncommons, 5 Rare or Mythic Rare cards, a Land and a Token, but the rub here is that 6 of the included cards have a 'booster Fun frame' and 12-13 of them are foil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other TCG news, there are also some great deals on Pokémon cards right now at Amazon and TCGplayer, including a great deal on the most recent expansion's booster bundle, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-phantasmal-flames-booster-bundles-amazon-update-2026">Mega Evolution - Phantasmal Flames</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After years of wait and fan expectation, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> players will finally be able to capture Mewtwo once more — in just a few months. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fan-favorite Legendary Pokémon was last available to battle in Pokémon Go all the way back in July 2022, though its Shadow form was available more recently — over a weekend in March 2024. Still, fans have been clamouring for another chance to add the creature to their Pokédex ever since — and now it's almost time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further details for this summer's Go Fest celebrations have now been announced at a press event held in Tokyo, which will host one of three in-person meetups, ahead of the game's usual global Go Fest celebration. Artwork shown at the event confirms that Mewtwo will return — and hints at the debut of a Mythical Pokémon species, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/hofqczmawzig1-1770896578342.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go Fest 2026 artwork.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Artwork for the Tokyo event shows the usual array of Kanto species, as well as popular croc Sandile. Of most note, though, is the Mewtwo floating within the image — confirming its long-awaited return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can't say anything specific, but look forward to the Pokémon featured in the key visual," a spokesperson told Japanese Pokémon outlet <a href="https://x.com/rocketnews24go/status/2021811416643383764" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rocketnews24go</a>, via machine translation. "Especially Mewtwo — I think it'll be heart-pounding excitement for people who’ve been participating in GO Fest since the early days."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will this finally be the moment Mewtwo's Mega Evolutions become available, after years of wait? Mega Mewtwo X and Y remain the only missing evolutions from the franchise's original batch of Mega Pokémon. Meanwhile, the game will soon be moving on to the release of Megas from Pokémon Legends: Z-A, with the arrival of Mega Malamar and Mega Victreebell later this month. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Mewtwo is only shown here for Pokémon Go Fest's Tokyo event, artwork such as this usually shows species also available (to a greater or lesser extent) at the following global Go Fest — and it seems inconceivable that the creature would only be made available in a local version, when there has been such hype for its return generally. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same is true of this year's Go Fest logo, which as ever features a subtle hint at the latest upcoming Mythical creature to become available. Looking at the mini blue lightning bolts on the 2026 design, Mythical Pokémon Zeraora seems a safe bet. The creature recently gained a new Mega Evolution, which would also make for a fitting release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year is, of course, the 30th anniversary of Pokémon and the 10th anniversary of Pokémon Go — a pair of milestones that fans expect to be celebrated fully this summer. Word on what else is coming to the Pokémon franchise this year will follow shortly on Pokémon Day — February 27 — which is when it's expected that the series' 10th generation of games and creatures will be unveiled. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
