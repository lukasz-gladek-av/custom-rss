One developer has said it’s closer to the Xbox Series S than the PlayStation 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wild-hearts-s-qa-switch-2-is-closer-to-the-series-s-than-ps4/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wccftech</a>, Takuto Edagawa, producer of Koei Tecmo's Wild Hearts S, said that while it’s difficult to generalize about the power of the Switch 2, the Series S is a decent comparison.</p><blockquote>There are a lot of characteristics when it comes to raw computing power so it's difficult to generalize, but I think it can be thought as closer to the Series S.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-specs-battery-life-4k-and-up-to-120fps-storage-and-more">Switch 2's tech specs</a> include a custom Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores. Ahead of the console’s launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-says-its-custom-gpu-means-nintendo-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">Nvidia said the GPU enables 10x the graphics performance of the Nintendo Switch</a>, with AI upscaling via DLSS and ray tracing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox Series S is the less powerful alternative to the Xbox Series X. It launched alongside that console in 2020, in direct competition with the PlayStation 5, and this November turns five years old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the Switch 2 is similar in power to the Xbox Series S, that suggests it will run most third-party games. Microsoft mandates that any game that launches on the Xbox Series X also launches on the S, so any developer working on a game for the current-gen Xbox must ensure the S is capable of running it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also worth noting that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-its-working-with-nintendo-to-get-call-of-duty-on-switch-but-will-black-ops-7-be-on-switch-2">Microsoft and Activision are still working on bringing Call of Duty to Switch</a>. The recently announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> isn’t confirmed for Switch 2 yet, but we do know it’s planned for release on the last generation of consoles (PS4 and Xbox One). That should mean it’ll run fine on Switch 2, based on Edagawa’s comments.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Switch 2 released with a number of third-party games to flesh out its launch lineup, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2">including CD Projekt’s demanding Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Where the Switch lacked many third-party multiplatform games, perhaps the Switch 2 will thrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 2 is off to a great start, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-becomes-fastest-selling-nintendo-hardware-ever-with-over-35-million-units-sold-worldwide-in-just-four-days">selling 3.5 million units in just four days</a>.

Sorry — Barone didn't elaborate. "The world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley" is the full extent of his <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">message</a>. If he's referring to the length of the game, however, <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/34716" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Long to Beat?</a> has the average Stardew Valley playtime listed as over 50 hours for just the main story, and around 168 hours for a completionist run. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, these 10 words sent a ripple of excitement through his fan communities, with one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hauntedchocolatier/comments/1l8mvvb/comment/mx62e32/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>exclaiming</u></a>: "[Concerned Ape] STOP TEASING. I MEAN- DONT STOP TEASING. I MEAN- IDK IM SO EXCITED BUT I DONT WANT U TO RUSH TAKE UR SWEET ASS TIME WE LOVE U."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Barone admitted that he "didn't want to just be the Stardew Valley guy," explaining that was why he's currently working on Haunted Chocolatier. We shouldn't expect a release date anytime soon, though — there's "still a lot to be done," Barone recently admitted, particularly as he feels it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-says-he-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2-but-its-so-much-easier-to-add-more-stuff-to-stardew-valley-than-make-a-new-game-from-scratch"><u>"got to be better" than Stardew Valley</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, he also suggested that he may <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-says-he-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2-but-its-so-much-easier-to-add-more-stuff-to-stardew-valley-than-make-a-new-game-from-scratch"><u>"eventually make a Stardew Valley 2."</u></a> Before you get too excited, however, the developer also said it's "so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's all the systems — all the major systems — are already all done. That’s the stuff that’s not fun to do. When I make an update [for Stardew Valley now], it’s like, you know, oh, throw in this, throw in that. Let’s add green rain — like, these random, whimsical ideas."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-haunted-chocolatier"><u>Barone announced Haunted Chocolatier back in 2021</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launch-helps-street-fighter-6-hit-5-million-sales-2-years-after-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> has now sold over 5 million copies, Capcom has announced. That’s up from the 4 million reported in September 2024. The latest sales milestone was helped by the fighting game’s launch on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom said it aimed to “maximize the game’s userbase” by bringing Street Fighter 6, now two years old, to the Switch 2 at launch. The Switch 2 version has exclusive modes designed for the console, and new gameplay features that utilize the gyro functionality of the Joy-Con 2. It’s worth noting the Switch 2 version has crossplay, maximising the pool of players available for matchmaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These initiatives have contributed to Street Fighter 6’s wide appeal, expanded global sales and resulted in the title achieving the milestone of 5 million units sold,” Capcom said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-punches-through-3-million-copies-sold"><u>Street Fighter 6 hit 3 million copies sold back in January</u></a> 2024, seven months after launch. Capcom has said Street Fighter 6 is “generally progressing in line with our expectations,” but before launch it revealed it had aimed for the sequel to outsell Street Fighter 5, targeting over 10 million copies sold over the course of its lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While we do not communicate specific figures for internal budgets, we look to outperform the title’s predecessor, Street Fighter 5, and are aiming for more than 10 million units over the life of the title,” Capcom said. Street Fighter 6, then, still has a long way to go before it beats Street Fighter 5’s sales total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put Street Fighter 6’s sales into context, 1993 SNES hit Street Fighter 2 Turbo sold 4.1 million copies, the seminal Street Fighter 2 sold 6.30 million, and Street Fighter 5 has sold 7.8 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another interesting comparison is with fighting game rival <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1"><u>Mortal Kombat 1</u></a>, which has also sold 5 million copies since going on sale in September 2023. Mortal Kombat is typically the best-selling fighting game franchise, outselling the likes of Street Fighter and Tekken by some margin. But Mortal Kombat 1 is seen as a sales disappointment, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-mortal-kombat-1-wont-get-any-more-dlc-characters-or-story-chapters-as-netherrealm-needs-to-shift-focus-to-the-next-project">developer NetherRealm recently confirmed it had left it behind to work on its next project</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom, meanhwile, continues to support Street Fighter 6 into its third year, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-confirms-year-3-roster-for-street-fighter-6">recently announced a set of four brand new DLC characters</a>: Sagat is out this summer; C. Viper this fall; Alex early spring 2026; and finally, Ingrid late spring 2026. The announcement was made in a trailer starring pro wrestler Kenny Omega, who dressed up as each DLC character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-review">Street Fighter 6 review</a> returned a 9/10. We said: "Street Fighter 6 is the most feature-rich a Street Fighter has ever been at launch, but even beyond that, it's roster of 18 characters is excellent, the new mechanics revitalize the one-on-one fighting formula, and it absolutely nails all of the little things that make for a stellar fighting game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
