And at the Game Developers Conference last week, IGN learned at least one mystery it won’t explain: the base game’s buck-wild twist of a final cutscene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who haven’t yet finished Lies of P, here’s the spoiler-free version: there’s a cutscene that plays at the end of the game that seems to suggest where Neowiz might be taking the Lies of P universe next. It’s a pretty wild twist of a scene, which has left fans speculating how it might be implemented and whether we’ll get an explanation in the DLC. However, Lies of P director Jiwon Choi confirmed that this cutscene isn’t DLC-related. All he’d say beyond that was, “Please stay tuned for additional announcements in the future.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/26/lies-of-p-overture-conceptart-glasshouse-wm-1743004263842.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Concept art for Lies of P: Overture</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Neowiz has already announced a full-blown sequel to Lies of P, which means it’s likely this cutscene is instead related to that. But we don’t really know any details about Lies of P 2 either, just that it’s being worked on. And Choi wouldn’t share any sequel hints in our chat with him, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I can certainly tell you is when we share such news or media and assets with you, you'll know for sure that we are ready to present it to you. And that follows very our strict focus on quality [amid] all the pressure that we talked about in the past. So that is the one promise that I can share with you, that when we actually share those contents with you and the news, we will be ready to share that with you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE ENDING OF LIES OF P. READ BELOW THE VIDEO AT YOUR OWN RISK.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The scene we’re referring to that we asked Choi about is, of course, the Dorothy scene. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spoiler-warning-lies-of-ps-post-credits-scene-hints-at-a-surprising-sequel"><u>wrote about this in detail here</u></a>, but the short version is that the game’s final cutscene depicts Paracelcus speaking to someone on the phone, eventually mentioning that he will “find her, for sure. Another key of ours: Dorothy.” We’re then shown the unmistakable striped sock legs and ruby slippers of Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, suggesting that whatever comes next for Lies of P, it will tie into other public domain “fairy tales”. But we still don’t know how or why, and we now also know it won’t be in Overture.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SPOILERS END HERE.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We did manage to glean a few hints about what <em>will</em> be in the DLC. Choi recommends that while they want for Overture, Lies of P fans should replay the base game, as there are clues in the world of the game already that suggest what might be coming:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you play through the base game again, you'll see many hints that we scattered throughout the whole experience,” Choi said. “A lot of hints and a lot of windows into the world, and you'll be able to actually see that and experience that in expansion…There are many things that I actually wanted to accomplish when we were working on the base game. It didn't get put into the base game, and all of that, at least key elements of that are going to be included in expansion.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/26/lies-of-p-overture-conceptart-carnivaltent-wm-1743004238316.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Concept art for Lies of P: Overture</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He adds that some fans are already onto Neowiz’s tricks, saying that he regularly reads fan theories online and that “some of them are quite close.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also learned a few other tidbits: Choi told us that the DLC should take roughly between 15-20 hours to complete “for experienced players” and will become available to players once they’ve passed a “certain” chapter of the game, and then accessible all the way to the end. And we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-overture-revealed-during-sony-state-of-play-2025"><u>know from the game’s announcement</u></a> that the DLC is technically a “prequel”, with the main character getting transported back in time to Krat just before its fall. The DLC will feature new locations, new enemies and bosses, new characters, and new weapons – though again, Choi was keen on keeping the details on these a surprise for the release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Built with Unreal Engine 5, you must keep pedaling on your bike in order to keep the fog around you – and the horrors within it – from consuming you. It doesn't have a release date as of yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Goodwin describes it, "You travel by bicycle through a foggy rural landscape filled with eerie secrets and monsters lurking in the dense mist. The game's atmosphere and themes draw inspiration from Stephen King's works and iconic horror films of the '80s and '90s." Check out the announcement trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Quite a Ride - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Your phone's battery drains over time and must be recharged by continuing to pedal your bike. And that phone will keep sending you strange messages that might help or hurt you. Meanwhile, as you go, you'll encounter oddities like deserted towns and bizarre laboratories. The road is always changing, but Goodwin says there's a unique pseudo-multiplayer twist: "Players' collective global efforts can change the environment, unlocking new locations, hidden characters and secret quests over time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3166050/Quite_a_Ride/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlist</a> Quite a Ride on Steam if you're interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

The Flash, for example, has excellent speed and agility, while the Star athelete can leap like no other. Redeeming the codes above will give you chances at Lucky Spins, which unlock the Styles and Zones, while the cash will enable you to unlock emotes and goal effects, to really celebrate the wins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lauren Harper is an Associate Guides Editor.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/honor-of-kings-world-the-first-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/honor-of-kings-world-%E2%80%93-the-first-preview.1145493/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/honor-of-kings-world-the-first-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you didn’t already know it, Honor of Kings is one of the most played games in the world. Taking the number one spot in the Chinese MOBA charts, the TiMi Group is taking its free-to-play characters – and world – in a new direction with Honor of Kings: World. While its scale and monetization screech in dissonance, its flashy combat, diverse roster of playable classes, and multiplayer-flexible modes do carry some promise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During my half-hour-long hands-on with Honor of Kings: World at Tencent’s GDC booth, I took some time to toy around with a couple of World’s different classes, take on a boss inspired by Chinese folklore, and see a brief glimpse of the story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Honor of Kings: World - First Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it boasts many of the same characters as its mobile MOBA predecessor, Honor of Kings: World is no MOBA. Instead, it’s a class-driven action game – for PC as well as mobile, by the way – with the kind of over-the-shoulder, action-driven combat you might expect from something like Genshin Impact. But rather than locking mechanics or gameplay behind randomized drops like in MiHoYo’s game, Honor of Kings offers players different classes to choose from. And while the same overall control scheme unifies each class – a dodge, three standard abilities, and an ultimate of sorts – the roster of different classes struck me as fairly diverse, each with its own abilities and special perks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Honor of Kings: World is no MOBA. Instead, it’s a class-driven action game – for PC as well, by the way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Usually, you’ll be able to play with two separate classes, though sometimes you might need to stick with just one for story purposes. It seems like TiMi’s put a lot of effort into the dual-class system, allowing you to switch between the two during combat. The most interesting example they showed during my demo was starting a long, multiple-attack combo and switching characters once the target was launched into the air to extend a combo. It kind of reminded me of a tag system in a fighting game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With 11 different classes in the demo I played, I’m certain there are tons of different combinations and ways to style on your opponent. But since this was my first time playing, I looked for balance above all else: I stuck with an even-keeled loadout, using a sword-wielding class for my primary role and a ranged gunner for the second. The two nicely filled in gaps left by the other during my attempt at a boss fight: I’d lay down fire using the gunner’s active reload mechanic to improve my damage and rate of fire when the boss was spitting out attacks in a frenzy, making sure to dodge the occasional flaming projectile and then rush him down with my sword, laying on the damage with a vengeance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This swapping was easily my favorite part of the demo. I enjoyed hammering away at the boss’s stance meter, breaking his stance, and shooting the gunner’s R ability as I closed the distance, swapping to my sword class, and unleashing a devastating ultimate attack of sorts to juice every second from the boss’ temporarily weakened state.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking the boss down to a certain point also revealed an interesting story beat that eventually led to me playing as a completely separate character from the pre-built avatar provided for the demo. TiMi didn’t offer much information on how frequently to expect this kind of change, only that it would happen from time to time. The demo took place somewhere closer to halfway through Honor of Kings: World’s runtime, opening up my two classes’ skill trees just enough for me to have some fun with them without overcomplicating its combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The boss itself was a giant monkey character with various different masks, with a personality and attacking style for each. According to the developer leading my demo, this mechanic has its roots in a traditional style of Chinese theater called <em>Bian lian</em>. One mask might see him spitting fire in a massive area of effect on the map, while another might see him throw around a few melee attacks. I loved this melding of culture, history, and story with a gameplay mechanic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from briefly seeing another journalist in my demo in a hub area before the tutorial, I didn’t have a chance to check out any of World’s multiplayer offerings. TiMi showed a few clips of four-person squads crawling dungeons and taking on bosses before our demo, but teased something that sounded more like an MMO. That part is still a work in progress, so they didn’t share much beyond acknowledging that there would be a bigger scale multiplayer mode in the full game, so I’m curious to see what that looks like given my demo’s single-player scope.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I left the demo concerned about monetization.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Before the demo, one of TiMi’s developers walked me through some of World’s premise and setup, saying that Honor of Kings: World was a gift of sorts to the MOBA’s loyal fanbase that’s propelled it to massive success in the ten years since its launch. True as that may be, I left the demo concerned about monetization.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When another journalist asked about how TiMi plans to make money with Honor of Kings: World, the developer leading our session gave a concerning answer. “The game’s gonna be based around social, so outfits and stuff,” they said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On its own, funding a free-to-play game with cosmetics isn’t necessarily a problem – especially since the developers made it clear that there wouldn’t be any pay-to-win – but given Honor of Kings: World’s scale, with flashy cutscenes, tons of playable characters, and epic boss fights, I can’t help but feel concerned about whether or not World’s model is financially sustainable, regardless of whether or not it’s based on one of the most successful games of the century.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Honor of Kings: World undoubtedly has a bright future ahead of it, provided TiMi can stick to its promise of giving fans of its MOBA hit a celebration worthy of its success. Even though I’m still a little worried about the amount of microtransactions that Honor of Kings: World could potentially need to fund its high production value, I still had a ton of fun dodging the big primate’s swings.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s out now across PC, console, and VR for free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When new bones are discovered, players can piece them together to their own design, Hello Games explained. They can even create their own museums, or share their collections with other players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There is a truly huge variety of procedural prehistoric bones, in all shapes and sizes, to excavate and collect,” Hello Games added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s up to you how you reassemble them and there’s a lot of fun to be had building ever-more outrageous skeletons to put on display in your bases-turned-museums or share with your fellow Travellers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fossils out there to be discovered vary hugely in rarity, so you never quite know what you’re going to unearth. There’s a real buzz when you find something truly rare. The most uncommon finds hold huge value. For those trying desperately to finish their collection, we introduced a specialist who can be bartered with at the Space Station.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the launch of Relics is a community expedition focusing on palaeontology, which challenges players to compete for the rarest finds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Players should be wary where they choose to excavate though,” Hello Games warned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some things have been buried for a reason. Dangerous creatures guard the greatest treasure and may be awoken from their slumber, including Stone Ghosts, and the colossal Stone Golem. New creatures have been introduced too, along with their skeletons. Including the awesome skeletal Titan Worm!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Man’s Sky continues to receive free updates even now, years after launch. And it’s clearly keeping players interested. Hello Games said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-skys-massive-worlds-part-2-update-adds-billions-of-new-solar-systems-and-trillions-of-new-planets">the recently released Worlds Part II update</a> fueled some of No Man’s Sky’s highest player numbers early in the year.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">No Man's Sky Relics Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In November, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-dev-hello-games-hails-very-positive-steam-rating-8-years-after-overwhelmingly-negative-launch"><u>Hello Games hailed No Man’s Sky hitting a ‘very positive’ Steam user review user rating</u></a> for the first time, eight years after the game’s controversial launch was slammed by players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Man’s Sky launched in August 2016 on PS4 and PC to tens of thousands of negative reviews on Steam, with players complaining about broken promises and a lack of meaningful content, particularly on the multiplayer side. The game quickly settled on the dreaded ‘overwhelmingly negative’ Steam user review rating, a clear sign to anyone who visited its Steam page that something was very wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Guildford, England-based developer Hello Games has continued to update No Man’s Sky over the years, improving player sentiment to the point where it is now considered superb. It took two years to hit ‘mixed,’ then another three to hit ‘mostly positive.’ At the time, five years after launch, Tim Woodley, Head of Publishing at Hello Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-gets-mostly-positive-steam-review-5-years"><u>explained how hard it was to claw back Steam user reviews from such a low base</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Hello Games continues to work on No Man’s Sky, it’s developing its next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-no-fire"><u>Light No Fire</u></a>.
