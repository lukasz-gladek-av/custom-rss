Also, it’s an ideal, ready-to-race package that will rev the engines of anybody who dreams less of shaving PBs on a track and more about shredding POS cars in Wreckfest 2.</p>That’s pretty much what I decided to throw my Moza R3 at. I took a lovely, metal-twisting holiday away from my usual MO of testing Direct Drive wheels with hypercars and perfect lines. Was that an unorthodox test bed? Kinda. But I maintain that the Wreckfest series is a low-barrier gateway racer that can create serious rally addicts eventually. <p data-cy="paragraph">Better than that, though, it’s just big gobs of fun with physics a-go-go and punchy force feedback aplenty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the 3.9Nm thrumming in this wheelbase doesn’t exactly redline with its peak power, it’s still a solid and stylish DD unit that hums along like a finely tuned machine. Unlike its clunkier, noisier gear-and-belt-driven rivals at the entry level, the R3 is whisper-quiet and ridiculously compact in comparison. Better yet, the bundle is extremely mod-friendly, so upgrading your ride down the road is a cinch—no need to swap out the whole chassis.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Moza R3 PC Bundle – Photos</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Moza R3 – Design and Features</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Moza R3 Racing Wheel and Pedals bundle is a full-throttle, plug-and-play racing system. Inside the box, you’ll find Moza’s new 3.9 Nm R3 wheelbase, a 280mm PC-compatible steering wheel, a set of SR-P Lite pedals, and a separate table clamp is also included. Believe you me, you’re going to need that last bit of kit once the FFB gets going. Nothing jerry-rigged or half-arsed is going to hold this sucker down when the cars start cartwheeling.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said clamp is made entirely of steel and is rigid as hell—quite sturdier than the plastic alternatives, and it has a generous 50mm of clamp space. Via the chaos of Wreckfest 2, I certainly gave that rigidity a run for its money. Thanks to a beefy desk and a straightforward system of four mount holes to secure the R3 wheelbase, this setup holds up well under the stresses of force feedback. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Via the chaos of Wreckfest 2, I certainly gave that rigidity a run for its money.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Weighing in at just 2.29 kilos and measuring a compact 120mm high, 135mm wide, and only 93mm long (excluding the steering shaft), the R3 is a pocket rocket of a wheelbase. Its boxy, industrial design gives it a serious motorsport aesthetic—far more race-ready-looking than some of the older, plastic clamshells that are out there competing.</p><div catalogid="bc8e4b87-8511-42d5-b60f-ad814276dea7" id="218220"><div id="218220" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MOZA R3 Bundle for PC</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also like that the ports on the back are neatly arranged for easy access, with slots for pedals, a dash display, a shifter, a handbrake, and even an emergency stop device. Out of the box, the only one you’ll need is the pedal port, but expansion is as easy as adding aftermarket mods to a project car. There are also two threaded holes up top for mounting Moza’s dash display.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wheel-wise, the one you’re getting default here is a comfy D-shape affair with a grippy polyurethane wrapping. I like the feel of the clicky, short-throw paddle shifters that are crafted from sturdy black metal. And I dig that Moza allows for some customisation here—the brushed metal wheel rim is removable, and alternative rims are available to better serve your race discipline of choice.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/06/screenshot-526-1743902518354.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Size comparison between the R3 (top) and R9 wheelbases.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heading below the equator, we have the R3’s pedal set, which is only an accelerator and a brake. If you’re searching for a clutch experience—and that’d make perfect sense for OG muscle cars in Wreckfest 2—you can make an extra pit lane purchase of a third pedal. Prices seem to be reasonable for that, and I know from experience that Moza’s ecosystem is all about easy installation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, these metal pedals feel a heck of a lot more robust than some of the plastic-heavy alternatives on the market. Resistance comes from springs rather than a load cell, so while they’re not championship-grade, they should be more than enough for entry-level sim racers. There’s also a surprising degree of adjustability, with pedal pads that can be repositioned higher or lower, and the entire pedal units can be moved left or right.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Moza R3 x Wreckfest 2: Performance</h2><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>With 3.9 Nm of peak torque, the R3 isn’t exactly a torque monster, but it’s right in the slipstream of other entry-level contenders with similar price pricepoints. It’s also perfect for some low-stakes, throw-around fun in a physics-heavy (yet nonetheless arcade-y) title like Wreckfest 2.</p><p>I’m not going to lie to you, though; I did need to do some tinkering to make Wreckfest 2 speak correctly with the R3, at least initially. However, thanks to the ever-changing landscape of Early Access, a few hotfixes meant I no longer had to constantly rebind/reverse my pedals in Moza’s (usually quite capable) Pit House software. Everything works pretty much as it should now, and, obviously, support will only get better as yet more fixes roll out.</p></div><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/26/wreckfest-2-early-access-blog-1742971666798.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pictured: things rolling out that will <em>definitely need fixes</em>.</figcaption></figure></output></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>The R3’s FFB feels wonderful when you laterally thunk into other cars—typically when you’re using “dodgem cars” cornering logic to pinball past an apex while pinging some competitor off into a tree. Likewise, the feelings you get through the wheel when you’re on the receiving end of such tactics and are forced to shred through some random fence or tyre pile are nice and visceral.</p><p>Car-nage collisions aside, I’d also be remiss if I didn’t highlight how satisfying a stretch of clean racing can be—that basic yet intimate FFB conversation between balding tyres and terra firma. Obviously, with Wreckfest 2 having closer DNA to a rally experience than a staid, single-surface track racer, every lap can (literally) feel like a series of plot twists. You’d better believe your hands will notice the difference when you drift in and out of bitumen to gravel to mud and back again.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and it goes without saying that any time there’s a momentary lull in any and all force feedback followed by a wrist-rattling jolt, that is just…well, a chef’s kiss experience. I can furnish you with two memorable examples of this. One, whenever you get some sick Dukes of Hazzard air and land on something you shouldn't have. And two, reversing from a bad corner upset, flicking into neutral, and then getting utterly and unexpectedly blindsided by some AI trying to break the<em> land speedbump record through you</em>.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Incidentally, I would like to say that POV racing in Wreckfest 2 with a decent FFB wheel such as this is the rough racing equivalent of a mini horror game. With your peripherals increasingly blinkered by the cabin of a crumpling car, every race is basically a series of untelegraphed jump scares that reach out and grab you through this wheel. Obviously this “driving on eggshells” sensation becomes more pronounced when you’re engaged in an actual demolition derby event, and some bastard has just bent your bonnet up over 80% of your windscreen.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/04/wreckfest2earlyaccessreleasedatetrailer-ign-blogroll-1738679001752.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Tis but a scratch. It'll buff right out.</figcaption></figure></output></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>I honestly shudder to think what those unexpected crashes will feel like for any gamer gripping a Moza R12 or higher. Those impacts you’ll get with 12 or 16 Nm worth of grunt will surely be the stuff of warning label justification. Hell, even a surprise bash through the 3.9 Nm force of the R3 delivers a respectable hand rattle. As unthinkable as it may sound, you may actually find yourself turning it down.</p><p>All that being said, multiplying the Moza R3 Bundle with the Early Access antics of Wreckfest 2 is one of the funnest things I’ve done all year thus far. Even as a proud owner of a Moza R12 wheelbase and pretty much every fancy add-on that comes with it, I was impressed by the performance and value proposition of this younger brother bundle. If you have budget aspirations of joining the simming scene—or you just wanna <em>feel</em> stuff crash harder than a stock market after tariffs—I say turn the key on an R3.</p></div><p> Adam Mathew is our Aussie deals wrangler.
