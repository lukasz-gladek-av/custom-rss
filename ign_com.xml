DLC episodes like Mass Effect 2's Lair of the Shadowbroker, the Dragon Age 2 prequel Leliana's Song, and the aforementioned Trespasser include some of BioWare's best-loved stories, offering a deeper look at their worlds and characters. But having finally finished its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">decade-long journey with The Veilguard</a>, BioWare seems ready to focus its attention on Mass Effect, which has been largely on hold due to the studio focusing all of its efforts on shipping Dragon Age.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Modern RPGs</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, fans are busy digging into BioWare's latest RPG after Dragon Age's release on Thursday, propelling it to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-beats-jedi-survivor-to-makes-it-eas-biggest-ever-single-player-game-on-steam">new highs for an EA game on Steam</a>.
