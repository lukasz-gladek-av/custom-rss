Hot on the heels <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-dev-expects-over-1-million-players-to-turn-up-for-early-access-release-date-asks-fans-to-download-the-launcher-now">of predicting over 1 million players for tomorrow’s launch</a>, its developer has said Hytale has already made enough money to cover the next two years of development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media post</a>, Hypixel Studios founder Simon Collins-Laflamme said that the next two years of dev costs are now covered through Hytale pre-purchases. He added: “combined with my personal commitment of 10 years, we are looking very strong for the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three pre-purchase options are available: the Standard Edition costs $23.99; the Supporter Edition costs $41.99; and the Founder's Edition costs $83.99. Collins-Laflamme confirmed the Hytale development team is now “50+ or so.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It all points to enormous early success for Hytale, which has endured a tumultuous development. Hytale was announced in December 2018 with a trailer that has an incredible 62 million views on <a href="https://youtu.be/o77MzDQT1cg?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a>. Here’s the official blurb, as it was back then:</p><blockquote>Hytale combines the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game, immersing players in a procedurally generated world where teetering towers and deep dungeons promise rich rewards throughout their adventures. Hytale supports everything from block-by-block construction to scripting and minigame creation, delivered using easy to use and powerful tools.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Excitement around Hytale was fueled by the experience of the developers themselves, who co-founded Hypixel, one of the most influential Minecraft servers in the world. Riot invested in the project and eventually bought the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in November, League of Legends developer Riot Games confirmed it had sold the rights to Hytale back to Collins-Laflamme after it had acquired the game back in 2020. Riot said that after considering "a range of options," it decided to sell the IP rights back to Collins-Laflamme as this "gives players the best chance to one day experience a revised version of the game they've been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Development on the game had been stagnating despite its sale to Riot, but Collins-Laflamme set out to resurrect the dying IP, confirming he had rehired scores of developers who had worked on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006090043665088900" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> published at the end of 2025, Collins-Laflamme expressed his "anger" at what had happened to Hytale over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game has insane potential, but four years of engineering went into rebuilding the engine rather than gameplay features," he said. "That leaves us with a four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do, and that rebuilt engine is never gonna be used.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you don’t invest in gameplay, you don’t just lose time. You lose momentum, iteration, and player feedback. Now the focus has to be on gameplay first and rebuilding trust by actually shipping things at a rapid pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s a damn miracle we were able to salvage Hytale. It was barely playable. All basics were broken. Camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, gameloop, sounds, rendering. Everything, everything was wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It should have taken years to fix, but within weeks, we got the game into a playable, fun state. And now, instead of slowing down or celebrating a release, we have to keep pushing for years to make up for the time that was lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So yes, I feel anger. And I’m turning that into focus and execution. I’m committing more money, more time, and personal sacrifice to deliver the game this vision deserves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has issued a warning to fans ahead of what is expected to be a hugely popular early access launch tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minecraft-esque sandbox game Hytale’s hotly anticipated PC early access release date is set for January 13, and Hypixel Studios said it expects over 1 million players to turn up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale founder Simon Collins-Laflamme took to <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010458001455640636" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X / Twitter</a> to make the bold 1 million player prediction, and to call on fans to download the launcher today (January 12) and log in “to help us significantly reduce launch-day stress.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">1 million players on launch day may sound like wishful thinking, but Hytale is one of the most anticipated games around, and views to its various trailers are enormous. This one does feel like it’s going to be big.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In November, League of Legends developer Riot Games confirmed it had sold the rights to Hytale back to Collins-Laflamme after it had acquired the game back in 2020. Riot said that after considering "a range of options," it decided to sell the IP rights back to Collins-Laflamme as this "gives players the best chance to one day experience a revised version of the game they've been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Development on the game had been stagnating despite its sale to Riot, but Collins-Laflamme set out to resurrect the dying IP, confirming he had rehired more than 30 developers who had worked on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale was announced in December 2018 with a trailer that has an incredible 61 million views on <a href="https://youtu.be/o77MzDQT1cg?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a>. Here’s the official blurb, as it was back then:</p><blockquote>Hytale combines the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game, immersing players in a procedurally generated world where teetering towers and deep dungeons promise rich rewards throughout their adventures. Hytale supports everything from block-by-block construction to scripting and minigame creation, delivered using easy to use and powerful tools.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Excitement around Hytale was fueled by the experience of the developers themselves, who co-founded Hypixel, one of the most influential Minecraft servers in the world. Riot invested in the project and eventually bought the studio. Now, it's ready to go it alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hytale and Hypixel Studios are independent again, and we are returning to the original vision from the 2018 trailer," <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collins-Laflamme said in a statement issued in November</a>. "Because we went back to an older game build that was now meant for prototypes, some parts of the game will feel behind, but momentum is strong, and we’re working fast to make this into the game we all dreamed of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Modding and creative tools are in a decent state; however, they’re not where we want them long term. That being said, they’re ready for players who want to create content on day one. This is a good moment for modders, server owners, and creators to step in early! They will play a significant role in Hytale’s future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Since the cancellation, we’ve rehired more than 40 former and new team members, bringing the total to 50. Reacquiring a game from a AAA studio and preparing an early access launch within weeks is rare, and players will be able to watch the progress as it happens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you don’t feel comfortable pre-ordering, please don’t. This is true early access, meaning it’s still very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while, but you have my and the team's commitment to make Hytale the game we’ve always wanted it to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first impression will be rough, but the path ahead matters more."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006090043665088900" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> published at the end of 2025, expressed his "anger" at what had happened to Hytale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game has insane potential, but four years of engineering went into rebuilding the engine rather than gameplay features.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite now allows creator-made games to sell in-game items — and immediately, the platform's most popular experience Steal the Brainrot has added $45 premium item bundles and a chance-based roulette wheel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Steal the Brainrot is Fortnite's biggest third-party game, and over the weekend saw a concurrent peak of more than 1 million users. These players were among the first to witness Steal the Brainrot's new paid-for in-game offerings — such as a 4,900 V-Buck "Present Rot" bundle of two randomized items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games enabled third-party microtransactions last Friday, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-a-turbulent-time-for-fortnite-battle-royale-epic-games-doubles-down-on-rivalling-roblox-letting-creators-sell-their-own-items-for-the-first-time">previously announcing a U-turn on the policy</a> that had set it apart from rival gaming platform Roblox — where Steal a Brainrot originated. Now, third-party games can offer premium in-game items and effects, with developers pocketing 37% of the proceeds — temporarily doubled to 74% for 12 months — while Epic Games itself takes the remaining cut. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Particular criticism for Steal the Brainrot has been levied against a new roulette-style wheel which lets you pay 100 V-Bucks (around a dollar) for random in-game effects or dollops of cash. The spinner's chance-based outcomes include a 2% chance at a Secret Lucky Rot, or a 0.5% chance at a a Secret Grande Rot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Fortnite killed the entire reason why they were better than Roblox with this one update," one fan <a href="https://x.com/cdn724/status/2010106699567276307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on social media in response. "Can't even implement custom weapons in two years but they can put in tools to create predatory practices with!!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We returned to loot boxes on Fortnite, [in] the most popular mode depending on the day, just years after Epic Games was fined for having them on the original Fortnite (Save the World)," <a href="https://x.com/cdn724/status/2010106699567276307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> another.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I was optimistic about In-Island Translations, but after seeing this gambling style wheel In Steal The Brainrot I think I'm all set... <a href="https://t.co/gMXjIOg1g4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gMXjIOg1g4</a></p>— TheCoolDoggo (@thecooldoggo) <a href="https://twitter.com/thecooldoggo/status/2010179198338416965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Steal the Brainrot's 4,900 V-Buck "Present Rot" bundle has also come under fire — not only for its price, but for it being advertised as a limited-time discount on its usual 5,400 V-Buck cost. One of the constraints Epic Games has placed on third-party microtransactions is a 5,000 V-Buck upper limit for any individual item — meaning this item's saving is discounted from a price that couldn't actually be sold</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Super disappointed in the Brain Rot guys, not only very ethically questionable to do a 'discount' while the feature is not even 24h out but the real prize is not even possible according to the rules," Fortnite third-party developer <a href="https://x.com/Richytoons/status/2010042859735662624" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richytoons</a> noted. "You make us all look bad with this kind of stuff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Implementation by other developers seems less egregious, with the popular Murder Mystery game simply allowing players to buy cosmetic items that don't impact gameplay, while Tilted Zone Wars allows users to pay 50 V-Bucks (less than a dollar) to flood the game's map for all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly how developers will implement Epic Games' rules on monetization in the long-term remains to be seen. Oddly, Steal the Brainrot suddenly disappeared offline overnight last night for several hours, leading to fan speculation that the game had been pulled by Epic Games over its monetization usage. But a developer update has said a now-fixed bug was the cause, and at the time of writing the game is now back available, reportedly with no discernible changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite fans first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-fans-say-the-game-is-opening-the-door-to-loot-boxes-by-allowing-creator-made-modes-to-sell-paid-random-items-though-their-sale-is-restricted-in-certain-countries-and-sellers-are-required-to-disclose-odds">voiced concerns last year that Epic Games' plans risked opening the door to loot box mechanics and predatory monetization</a> within the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair has made the surprise announcement of an official Palworld Trading Card Game, due out this summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair has partnered with Japanese TCG specialist Bushiroad for Palworld Official Trading Card Game, which has a July 30, 2026 release date. The teaser trailer is below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>This game is a 2-player competitive card game where you can enjoy strategic and tactical battles through deploying various unique Pals. Players fight alongside their Pal companions, gathering resources, and building bases as they aim for victory. These adorable and dependable Pals will utilize their own unique traits to lead you to victory. Team up with your trusty Pals and experience the thrill of overcoming formidable enemies through this exciting trading card game.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, the announcement has sparked further comparisons between Palworld and Pokémon, which has a hugely popular trading card game of its own. “They really are going the Pokémon route and merchandising everything,” said one fan. “Palworld anime when?” added another. “Nintendo: heavy breathing,” said one YouTube commenter. “NOW THEY JUST TROLLING!!!!” laughed one fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Pocketpair announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld-palfarm">Palworld: Palfarm</a>, a farming and crafting spinoff that was revealed just a week after Nintendo revealed cozy farming sim <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia"><u>Pokémon Pokopia</u></a>. Pocketpair ended up issuing a response after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-tinfoil-hats-are-out-in-force-pocketpair-dev-responds-after-pokmon-fans-question-timing-of-palworld-palfarm-announcement-just-a-week-after-pokmon-pokopia-nintendo-direct-reveal">some Pokémon fans questioned the timing of the Palworld: Palfarm announcement</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair has certainly moved quickly to capitalize on Palworld’s explosive success. (In March 2024, Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe said the company couldn’t handle the massive profits the game had generated.) While working on its 1.0 release, the Japanese studio is developing Palfarm, working on this new Palworld TCG, running a publishing studio of its own, and it has its other game, Craftopia to update.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld: Palfarm First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair is of course embroiled in a high-profile patent battle with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company over Palworld, which is expected to progress this year. The Nintendo-Palworld lawsuit, which has been ongoing in Japan since its announcement in September 2024, involves three patents, two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. For more details, check out IGN’s coverage of the lawsuit, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why"><u>why Nintendo re-wrote patents mid-case</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-as-theyre-not-full-games-attempting-to-sway-judge-in-palworld-lawsuit"><u>Nintendo’s recent move to discount mods as "prior art."</u></a> All the while, Nintendo has been busy obtaining patents — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-should-never-have-received-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-ip-lawyers-say"><u>some of which IP lawyers said should never have been granted</u></a> — as it develops its case against Pocketpair, which has vowed to defend itself in court.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
