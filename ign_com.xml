            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-roadmap-includes-free-updates-driven-by-community-feedback-and-dlc-details<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has outlined its plans for the first year of post-launch content for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows"><u>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</u></a>, including promises to add features like new game+, more difficulty settings, additional story content, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Assassin’s Creed company detailed all of its plans for 2025 in a four-and-a-half-minute roadmap update video published today. It’s a brief but enlightening video with a specific schedule for May and June as the team behind the latest stealth-action entry plots out how it will keep fans coming back with free updates throughout the year.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/30/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-1746033627143.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Shadows post-launch roadmap. Image courtesy of Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The drops begin soon with The Works of Luis Frois, the first of a few free story add-ons, which is set to drop in early May. It’ll be accompanied by a Codex update and a few quality-of-life improvements, with relatively substantial parkour additions and a photo mode update also set to arrive next month. These adjustments and more are part of what Ubisoft says is a continued effort to listen to its community and take their feedback into consideration for future Assassin’s Creed Shadows updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Your feedback has been a core focus of the team throughout development, and that’s not stopping now that Shadows is released,” community developer Daniel St. Germain explained in today’s video. “Regular title updates are coming, each with impactful additions – and changes – based on your feedback and requests, with some bug fixes to continue refining the experience across all platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next free Assassin’s Creed Shadows story drop will follow in June, as will more challenging difficulty settings, gameplay immersion options, an open-world alarm system, and an option to keep headgear on or off during cutscenes. These are worthwhile changes that players are already looking to see included, but more features, such as new game+ support, additional story drops, special collaborations, and more, are expected to arrive before the year is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest item on the post-launch roadmap is the first proper Assassin’s Creed Shadows DLC expansion, Claws of Awaji, which drops at an unspecified point later in the year. It’s said to include new content, such as the Bo staff weapon and a new region for Naoe and Yasuke to explore, across its 10-hour journey. Pricing details have yet to be revealed, though it will at least be free for those who pre-ordered Assassin’s Creed Shadows before its launch last month.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin’s Creed Shadows arrived for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on March 20 and finally takes Ubisoft’s long-running stealth series to Feudal Japan. Its leap of faith managed to land it among <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-video-games-of-2025-so-far"><u>our list of the best games of 2025 so far</u></a> while also emerging as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march"><u>the best-selling game of last month</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
