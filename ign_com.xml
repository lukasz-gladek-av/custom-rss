            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s first big expansion has been revealed by developer Team Cherry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teased for 2026, Hollow Knight: Silksong - Sea of Sorrow promises new areas, bosses, and tools as “Hornet’s adventures continue in our nautically themed expansion, coming free for all players next year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further details are expected shortly before its launch, with no specific date given. This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, as Silksong's initial release date wasn't announced until just a month before it dropped after one of gaming's most infamous drawn out affairs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the announcement of the DLC, Team Cherry also revealed that a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of the original Hollow Knight is in development. This improved version incorporates "all the updates and enhancements that Silksong received on the platform: high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and many additional graphical effects."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The even better news? If you already own Hollow Knight on Switch, you'll be able to upgrade to this new gen version for free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Australian studio will also be updating all current versions of the original Metroidvania soulslike and adding features and bug fixes. If you're playing on PC, some of those changes have already come into effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“PC players can experience many of those updates right now, via the public-beta branches on Steam and GOG, where they’ve just gone live,” a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Cherry blog post</a> states. “That includes full 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratio support for those of you with Steam Decks or ultrawide monitors."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the DLC announcement, Team Cherry said Hollow Knight: silksong had sold more than 7 million copies since going on sale in September, and had millions more playing on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected (enough to crash all of the storefronts!)," Team Cherry said. "Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home. Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now seems like as good a time as any to get into both Hollow Knight games, then. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/22/hollow-knight-review">Hollow Knight review</a> returned a 9.4. We said: "Hollow Knight’s rich world and incredible depth of content will make you want to explore its caves for dozens of hours."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Hollow Knight: Silksong review</a> scored the game 9/10. We said: "Hollow Knight: Silksong is packed full of sharp platforming, enticing exploration, and nail-biting combat that's all unapologetically challenging in just the right way."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a Pokémon Trainer or have one in your life, today's Daily Deals is going to save you a small fortune. From the best Pokémon TCG bargains to a great deal on the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, I've got you. You can also check out my more comprehensive list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-gift-ideas-2025">best Pokémon gifts for 2025</a> for more options than what I've listed here.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Top Pokémon Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've even taken the liberty of finding the best deals on the top chase cards for every Pokémon TCG expansion in the Mega Evolution and Scarlet &amp; Violet eras, so you can pick up some awesome chase cards instead of busting a bag full of Pokédollars on booster packs. I even found some awesome Pokémon Squishmallow deals to boot, so let's get straight into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Single Card Price Crash</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG stock levels are getting better and better across the board, which means there's more chance of buying off store shelves and a much bigger chance of scalpers losing out. It's a win-win, especially for Pokémon card collectors, as single cards are finding a new floor when it comes to market values.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the best time this year to snap up some of those grails you've been eyeing up, so I've found the top 5 chase cards in every Pokémon TCG expansion and base set from the previous Scarlet and Violet era, as well as Mega Evolution, the current era of Pokémon cards. There's some serious bargains to be had here, and I reckon we'll see prices tick back up when Ascended Heroes launches early next year, so don't wait around.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Best Pokémon TCG Sealed Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best deal here for me is the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra Premium Collection that's currently at market value on Amazon and close to MSRP. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 x Phantasmal Flames</li><li>4 x Mega Evolution</li><li>4 x Destined Rivals</li><li>4 x Journey Together</li><li>2 x Surging Sparks</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The main pull of this UPC is the Mega Charizard X ex Mega Attack Rare and Oricorio ex SIR promo cards, which, frankly, are the best couple of promo cards we've had in a big box collection for a while. It also contains Mega Charizard X-themed card sleeves, deck box, damage counter dice, playmat, and a metal coin.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Legends: Z-A and More Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Need to get Pokémon Legends: Z-A sorted for Christmas? Here's the cheapest way: the Nintendo Switch 1 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A for $44.99 on Woot, then upgrade it to the Switch 2 version for $9.99 via the Amazon digital code service. You're saving $15 over buying the usual Switch 2 copy of Legends: Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot also has more discounts on top Pokémon Switch games, such as Legends: Arceus alongside Scarlet and Violet. It's a great time to build up your library if you've got a few Pokémon-sized gaps on your shelf.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Squishmallow Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing beats cuddling a Squishmallow, and I'll admit that to anyone. Well, getting a $69.99 massive 20-inch Sprigatito Squishmallow for $37.99 definitely beats that feeling, but there's some great deals on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-plushies">best Pokémon plushies</a> right now (in my opinion, which is correct).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
