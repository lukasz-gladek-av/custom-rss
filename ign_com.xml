It adds a new, fully voiced story, a new faction, and new quests to the sci-fi RPG, and Bethesda is even promoting it on its official channels. There’s even a trailer:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Watchtower, a brand new achievement-friendly Creation by our friends at <a href="https://twitter.com/kinggathcreates?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@KinggathCreates</a>, is available now in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starfield?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Starfield</a>'s Creations menu. <a href="https://t.co/EuHtjq85X4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/EuHtjq85X4</a> <a href="https://t.co/3NemADzLOY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3NemADzLOY</a></p>— Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1925588126963053063?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The patch, meanwhile, adds additional support for Creations so Creations up to 2GB can be uploaded, as well as numerous fixes for quests, vehicles, UI, and the Shattered Space DLC. There’s Very Low display settings to improve performance on some devices, too. Patch notes, <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/3eFYYUUqzOpOSv086XWMh9/starfield-update-notes-may" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">per Bethesda's website</a>, are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the wait goes on for more meaningful news on Starfield, with fans hoping for an expansion announcement and a potential PS5 release date this June during Microsoft’s Xbox showcase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years. But it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield went on to reach 15 million players, but some had wondered whether Bethesda might walk away from the game to focus on its other franchises. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. In an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-logo-pops-up-on-work-in-progress-starfield-creation-sparking-ps5-release-speculation"><u>speculation that Starfield would soon be confirmed for release on PS5</u></a> ramped up after fans spotted a PlayStation logo on Bethesda’s official Creations website. The logo was attached to a work-in-progress ship decals Creation for Starfield, and although the Creation was removed, fans were left wondering whether Bethesda’s so-far PC and Xbox-only sci-fi game would soon make the jump to Sony’s console, as so many other Microsoft games have.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda itself has said it has "exciting things" planned for Starfield this year, amid growing discontent from players about a lack of communication and updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s easy to forget about Starfield given all the attention on Oblivion Remastered, its players are hoping that Microsoft and Bethesda go big on Starfield at its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-xbox-games-showcase-2025-for-june-plus-the-outer-worlds-2-direct"><u>Xbox Games Showcase broadcast</u></a> on June 8.
