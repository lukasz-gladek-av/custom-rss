"The base game and all DLC are still available to play in offline single-player by anyone who currently owns it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Alliance launched on June 22, 2021 as a promised "exciting, action-driven, hack-and-slash adventure filled with iconic monsters, legendary characters, and epic loot," but was received poorly by players and critics.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance is a tedious co-op adventure with lots of goblins and even more bugs," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-and-dragons-dark-alliance-review">IGN said in our 4/10 review</a>, and the game sits at a "mixed" rating on Steam with only 50% of reviews being positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Invoke Studios, which was known as Tuque Games at the time but later rebranded, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-game-in-development-at-dark-alliance-studio">is now working on another entry in the D&amp;D franchise</a>. Details are still slim, but publisher Wizards of the Coast confirmed it as an Unreal Engine 5 title and said it will be "a triple-A game derived from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wizards of the Coast is all in on D&amp;D video games at the moment, likely due to the astounding success of Baldur's Gate 3, as five games are currently in development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Invoke Studios' new game comes a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-survival-rpg-life-sim-in-the-works-at-disney-dreamlight-valley-dev">D&amp;D survival role-playing game life simulator from the Disney Dreamlight Valley developer</a>, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/official-dungeons-dragons-vr-game-in-the-works">virtual reality game from the creators of Demeo</a>, a co-op game from Payday 3 developer Starbreeze, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/another-dungeons-dragons-video-game-in-production-at-hasbro">a mysterious entry from Hasbro</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Baldur's Gate 3 arrived in July 2023 and became the surprise hit of the year, with players obsessing over its seemingly infinite number of playstyles and story outcomes. It was incredibly successful commercially, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-has-made-90-million-for-hasbro">pulling in $90 million</a> for Hasbro and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed">even more for developer Larian.</a> Somehow, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-numbers-are-up-compared-to-last-year-seemingly-due-to-mods">it's more popular this year than last</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">In our 10/10 review</a>, IGN said: "With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
