            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">RuneScape developer Jagex is considering removing one of the game's least popular, yet most pervasive, layers of microtransactions. But instead of just making the decision itself, it's letting its entire playerbase vote on whether or not to ditch them entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and the vote is definitely rigged. But it's...rigged in the players' favor?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, the modern version of RuneScape (also known as RuneScape 3) features a number of different types of microtransactions, including a major feature called Treasure Hunter. Very basically, Treasure Hunter allows players to obtain keys in various ways, which are used to open treasure chests and receive items of varying rarity. Though it is possible to obtain small numbers of keys without spending money, far more are obtainable for players who spend money on the game. Over time, this has led to players complaining that Treasure Hunter is essentially a pay-to-win mechanic, since players can obtain items that give them large amounts of experience points through Treasure Hunter, effectively encouraging players to spend more to level up characters quickly.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There have been other issues with Treasure Hunter over the years as well, as well as its predecessor microtransaction "Squeal of Fortune", but the ability to essentially pay to bypass gameplay is by far the most controversial. In fact, Jagex even experimented with removing the feature in part back in July, when it disabled microtransactions for a week. A <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/mtx-experiments-what-weve-learned?_gl=1*1o5v5mz*_gcl_au*MTQyNTk0NDY4MS4xNzYxNzQ3MjE5*_ga*NjU1MTkzMzA5LjE3NjE3NDcyMTk.*_ga_DSN9YBF934*czE3NjE3NTUyMTQkbzIkZzAkdDE3NjE3NTUyMTQkajYwJGwwJGg5ODMxNDE1ODY." data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up survey run by the studio</a> suggested that 65% of players felt positively or neutral about the change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So today, Jagex sent out a press release stating that it was launching a community vote to "decide the future of RuneScape's microtransactions." The developer has launched a page on its website that allows players to vote to remove Treasure Hunter from the game entirely, simultaneously removing over 220 associated items, including the experience points boosting items that have caused issues in the past. Jagex says it will remove Treasure Hunter from the game if the poll receives over 100,000 votes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This vote is one of the most important moments in RuneScape’s history," said Jagex CEO Jon Bellamy in a statement. "Starting right now, players will cast the deciding vote on the future direction of the game. Since Squeal of Fortune was introduced in 2012, and subsequently Treasure Hunter in 2014, our approach to monetisation has, over time, eroded some of the integrity at the heart of RuneScape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The most concerning elements of our MTX systems have been those that allowed players to bypass core gameplay, skipping over the depth, challenge, and sense of discovery that make RuneScape truly special. While these systems have helped fund the game, they’ve done so at a cost to something far greater:  the integrity of our worlds. This vote is about correcting that, and taking a step toward designing experiences that are fair, rewarding, and built to last.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's critical to point out though that Jagex's poll really isn't a poll at all. It's a <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=poll/treasure-hunter-poll" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">button players can press</a> if they want to vote in favor of removing Treasure Hunter. There's no option for players to vote "no", Jagex will simply implement the change if 100,000 people total vote in favor. And the page itself makes it pretty dang clear that Jagex wants players to vote for this. Using language such as suggesting those who vote "yes" want to "see an integrity-led RuneScape powered by your own accomplishments" and the presence of multiple green "Vote Yes Now" buttons all down the page are, uh, not exactly subtle. Nor is the fact that Jagex seems pretty ready to implement this, as if it already knows what the result would be.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But while a clearly-rigged non-poll sounds bad, it's <em>also</em> critical to note that players actually do seem to want this to happen. Over on the RuneScape subreddit, players are ecstatic. The top comment on the Jagex mod's official post announcing the vote simply says "Holy based", followed by "I can't believe I lived to see this", and many, many more comments along those lines. In fact, the positivity is overwhelming. While some players seem skeptical that they'll meet the 100,000 vote requirement, others are confident, even suggesting the OSRS (Old School RuneScape) players might support the poll as well, just on principle. It seems as though they needn't worry. At the time this piece was written, the poll had been up for just four hours, and had already reached 50,000 votes. For context, Jagex says on its website that there have been over 320,000,000 RuneScape accounts created over the years...though how many of those are active is a very different question (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/old-school-runescape-is-more-popular-than-ever-breaks-concurrent-player-record/1100-6533697/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old School RuneScape recently surpassed 240,000 players</a> this past August).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, this seems like a positive, long-needing, and welcome change for the RuneScape community. It's  just a little weird that it's being framed as a poll, when the desired outcome for both players and developer is pretty obvious. There is a potential reading of this as simply a move for positive PR, specifically given that Jagex was acquired just last year, Bellamy was instated as a new CEO just this past March, and he's already had a bad round of headlines over <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/jagex-ceo-wants-studio-s-games-to-operate-as-apolitically-as-possible-" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">canceling annual in-game Pride events</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have until November 12 to vote if they would like to remove the microtransactions, and can continue voting beyond the 100,000 needed numbers to express support for the change. Removing Treasure Hunter won't fully remove all microtransactions from the game, with cosmetics and bonus XP items with set caps to help curb exploits will remain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Early thoughts on Battlefield's free-to-play, standalone battle royale.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a few long sessions since yesterday’s surprise launch of Battlefield REDSEC, the free-to-play battle royale spin-off of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer">Battlefield 6</a>, it’s clearly coming after other grounded-ish military battle royales like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-playerunknowns-battlegrounds-free-to-play-review-2022">PUBG</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-20-review">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>. Hiding a fun mission structure within its streamlined familiarity — as well as an entire non-BR game mode — I’ve had the most fun when its map, called Fort Lyndon, is used to push the boundary beyond the requisite ever-shrinking storm. I still need some more time in the fray to nail down a final opinion, especially since most of the random squadmates I’ve matched up with in the main BR modes haven’t exactly been playing as a team. But for now, the squad-based, elimination-driven, free-for-all Gauntlet mode has impressed me more than the battle royale option itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With destructible environments, the ultimate buzzword (<em><strong>levelution</strong></em>), powerful vehicles that can alter the tide of battle or serve as fun chokepoints, and a baked-in squad system, Battlefield 6 seems like a perfect fit for a battle royale mode. But so far, REDSEC’s translation of Battlefield’s role-based structure feels like a shallow, if fun, take on the genre. Its hasn’t offered much yet to fully draw me away from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-review-2024">Fortnite</a>’s cartoonish chaos and electrifying events or separate itself from the likes of PUBG or Warzone beyond using Battlefield 6’s weapons and the Frostbite Engine. On the surface, REDSEC seems intent on reviving the rote 360-era conversation about shooters with a washed-out color palette because it seems so similar to its contemporaries.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, REDSEC’s compelling mission structure takes a rewarding cleaver to the otherwise ho-hum military BR doldrums. They’re kind of like the missions and bounties you’d find in Fortnite, but with better rewards and more diverse challenges. Even with otherwise uncooperative squadmates, I found myself planting bombs and capturing waypoints to reap the benefits of well-communicated rewards. That seems to be REDSEC’s secret sauce: each in-game mission pops up like clockwork after a few minutes, only requiring a few button presses to get you to the next simple target.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hinging on classic military FPS objectives like babysitting a planted bomb or picking up an important file so you can transmit its signal back to home base, these smaller sidequests add order to the otherwise chaotic pace of conquering the battlefield. Completing an objective will always come with some kind of supply drop. I really like how these drops are handled, offering a clearly communicated reward before accepting the mission, since some will alert nearby players to your presence.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Charlie's Favorite Multiplayer Shooters</h3><p>I've been playing multiplayer shooters for about as long as I've been playing video games. From Halo and Black Ops II to Kid Icarus: Uprising and Splatoon, I've sunk a ton of time into the genre. Here are some of my favorites!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In contrast, Gauntlet expands each of these extra objectives into full-fledged game modes, pitting a handful of four-player squads against each other to rack up the most points on each objective. The mode and objective will change throughout each of the four rounds, with the lowest-performing squads getting eliminated until only two remain. Rotating through different named locations within Fort Lyndon, each game mode uses a piece of the map and works more like a mish-mash between Fall Guys and a squad-based, free-for-all version of traditional Battlefield that’s easily been my favorite part of REDSEC for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield REDSEC’s slow-rolling storm just hasn’t done much to incentivize me toward a hard objective or new destination, but its mission structure usually got me (and any uncooperative squadmates) moving in the right direction towards otherwise flat attempts at the #1 spot so far. I’ll need more time to complete missions and snipe away at opponents across the map before delivering a final verdict, but for now, REDSEC at least has some unexpectedly interesting things going for it.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-review]]></content:encoded>
