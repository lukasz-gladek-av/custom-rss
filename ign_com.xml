            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Get Total War: Warhammer 3, Etrian Odyssey HD, and more.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Humble Choice lineup becomes available on the first Tuesday of each month. That means <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGrB1B?object_uuid=a0ba2658-82f0-4bda-819c-ce4ad4c8cb9d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">November’s Humble Choice</a> is now available for $14.99. This month, members get eight PC games with a total MSRP of $254, including Total War: Warhammer 3, Etrian Odyssey HD, and more. Read on for the full list and all the details.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Humble Choice November 2025 Game Lineup</h2><div catalogid="9793c6e9-126c-41a5-a073-5b90c5dd9727" id="230111"><div id="230111" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Humble Choice - November 2025</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All eight PC games are delivered in the form of Steam codes. It’s a solid lineup of titles, representing a wide variety of genres. That means there’s something for everyone, and some off-the-beaten-path games you might not normally buy, but now you get them without having to pay anywhere near full price. Here’s the full list of games included in the November 2025 Humble Choice, with blurbs from the press release.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Total War Warhammer III</strong>: A grand-scale strategy game where fantasy armies battle daemonic forces in the Realm of Chaos.</li><li><strong>Another Crab's Treasure</strong>: A Soulslike adventure where a hermit crab fights enemies using trash as makeshift shells.</li><li><strong>Pharaoh: A New Era</strong>: A 4K remake of the classic city-builder where you manage resources, appease gods, and build magnificent monuments in Ancient Egypt.</li><li><strong>Etrian Odyssey HD</strong>: A first-person dungeon crawler focused on creating a party and mapping a dangerous labyrinth.</li><li><strong>No More Heroes 3</strong>: A stylish hack-and-slash game where an assassin fights alien superheroes in over-the-top battles.</li><li><strong>Synergy</strong>: A sci-fi city-builder about building a sustainable human settlement on a harsh alien planet.</li><li><strong>Spin Hero</strong>: A roguelike RPG where combat and progression are determined by spinning a slot machine.</li><li><strong>Paleo Pines</strong>: A cozy farming sim where you run a ranch, explore an island, and befriend dinosaurs.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest game in here is probably the strategy game Total War: Warhammer III, which we gave a 9/10 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/total-war-warhammer-3-review">review</a>. It’s a huge blockbuster PC game with many dozens of potential hours of play time. Another Crab’s Treasure is a surprisingly accessible Soulslike game that got an 8/10 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/another-crabs-treasure-review">review</a>. And Etrian Odyssey HD is a personal favorite, a remaster of a Nintendo DS dungeon crawler that has you draw the map as you explore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone interested in relaxing farm sims can try out Paleo Pines, while No More Heroes 3 offers fast-paced action. There’s plenty here to try, and any one of these games is worth the $14.99 asking price all on its own. Getting the whole bundle for that price is a killer deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always with Humble Choice, a membership gets you a month of IGN Plus as an added bonus, as well as access to more than 50 DRM-free games in the Humble Vault. You also get a discount on Humble Store purchases, with bigger discounts the longer you keep your membership active.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, 5% of each Humble Choice membership goes to charity. This month’s charity is <a href="https://www.nokidhungry.org/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Kid Hungry</a>, which seems like a particularly timely choice. It works to make sure kids across the country have reliable access to healthy meals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.
