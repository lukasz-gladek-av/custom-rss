            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"First game I've bought day of release in a decade."</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The splash damage caused by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>’s massive launch impact has spread beyond huge Steam concurrents and struggling storefronts to the parts of the internet where video game pirates hang out — and there something interesting is happening: the pirates are urging each other to buy the game instead of downloading the cracked version.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Cherry’s hotly anticipated Hollow Knight sequel finally came out on September 4, 2025 priced $20, six years after it was announced, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-but-its-so-popular-its-crashing-storefronts-including-steam">instantly crashed storefronts including Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the storefronts recovered, player numbers swelled to the point where Silksong hit an incredible launch day peak of 535,213 concurrent players on Steam, enough to make it the 18th most-played game ever on Valve’s platform. The true player count across all platforms will be much higher.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Silksong also launched DRM-free on GOG, so it was no surprise to see a cracked version available to download in the hours after launch. What was a surprise was the response from some veteran video game pirates, who urged their peers to support Team Cherry and buy the game instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First game I've bought day of release in a decade probably,” said pyrokzg on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1n8bkmo/that_was_fucking_fast/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the piracy subreddit</a> in response to a thread upvoted 7,000 times. “Not even the decade for me. It's the very first,” added Vamsi-Thopu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why is this happening? Clearly, there is a huge amount of goodwill from across the internet directed at Team Cherry, the small indie developer that saw the original Hollow Knight blow up to such an extent that it was able to take its merry time with this ambitious sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s also a feeling that Team Cherry does things the right way. For a start, there’s a DRM-free version available at launch, but the Australian studio was also keen to honor the promises it made with its original Hollow Knight Kickstarter all those years ago. There’s even a free upgrade for the Nintendo Switch 2 version. In short, Team Cherry are the good guys, and the feeling is they deserve their success.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong Release Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a 3-4 person team that has done right by their fans at every turn,” said No-Shape6053, also on the piracy subreddit. “Making sure the PC release is DRM free. Making sure all original backers of Hollow Knight get Silksong free on their choice of platform. This is a time where if we can afford to support them, we should.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Support the devs if you can, they deserve it,” added iTzNowbie. There’s plenty more where that came from, too. “The only game I will feel bad if I ever pirated it,” said beastfire24. “Hey the game is pretty cheap. This one, we should not pirate,” said Sythrin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, some have expressed surprise at the collective urge not to pirate Silksong, which itself prompted a discussion about why this is happening with Silksong but hasn’t happened with similarly beloved indie games in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Usually people here claim that the title, price, or the indie status makes no difference to them, but I guess that Silksong is just that respected,” offered MixaLv.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m surprised too,” added ALIIERTx. “Many times people are like, ‘I don’t care if I pirate from indie developer,’ but on this one everyone is pretty defensive against piracy. I’m fascinated.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Responses to this reinforce the Team Cherry angle. "Team Cherry has built themselves an amazing reputation," suggested Someone_Existing_1. "Because they’re only a three-person studio, they can keep their games super cheap due to far less employees needing pay. Also they aren’t greedy f***s like most companies, so their DLCs are all free and there’s no microtransactions or online-only bulls**t."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out IGN's Silksong coverage, which includes the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-1693-days-of-videos-the-superfan-behind-youtube-channel-daily-silksong-news-can-finally-rest"><u>story of the superfan behind the YouTube Channel Daily Silksong News, who can finally rest after an incredible 1,693 days of videos</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting out Silksong?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The original lightsaber wielded by Darth Vader has fetched a true bounty at auction this week, after being used by one of cinema's most iconic villains in multiple Star Wars films.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bidding on the sci-fi blade began at $500,000, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/darth-vader-lightsaber-auction-star-wars/story?id=125251261&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a> reported, and while the item had been given an estimated sale value of between $1-3 million, it ultimately sold for even higher — just over $3.6 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the original Star Wars movies, two versions of each lightsaber were produced — a version that only featured the hilt, to appear in scenes outside of combat, and another version in which a stunt blade could be attached. This lightsaber is Vader's version of the latter — meaning it was used for the fight sequences in both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back">The Empire Strikes Back</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi">Return of the Jedi</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/screenshot-2025-0ss9-05-111504-1757067447913.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Darth Vader's lightsaber. Image credit: Propstore.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Empire, Darth Vader actor David Prowse and stunt performer Bob Anderson both wielded the weapon when the character confronted Luke Skywalker in Cloud City — and indeed, production photos associated with the auction suggest it was in-hand when Vader delivered his iconic line that reveals Luke's true parentage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Return of the Jedi, this same prop was used again, in the climactic fight between Vader and Skywalker aboard the Second Death Star. There's limited evidence that the blade was also used in the original Star Wars: A New Hope, too, although this matter has not been conclusively confirmed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"As expected from a prop that saw extensive usage, the piece bears authentic signs of wear," a document describing the piece states. "Far from diminishing its value, these marks serve as compelling evidence of the lightsaber's direct involvement in the action — testament to its film-used authenticity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Darth Vader's hero dueling lightsaber stands as one of the most historically significant Star Wars artifacts ever presented at auction," the description continues. "This is the weapon of the most recognizable character in science fiction history, featured in the most critically acclaimed film of the franchise, The Empire Strikes Back, and in the trilogy’s epic conclusion, Return of the Jedi. The lightsaber has become the most iconic sci-fi weapon of all time — instantly recognizable and unmatched in cinematic legacy. This is the finest example of a genuine lightsaber with verifiable screen use ever offered at public auction."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For something (slightly) more affordable, yesterday brought the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-death-star-officially-announced-75419">official unveiling of LEGO's latest Star Wars Death Star set</a> — priced at the comparatively cheap $1,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
