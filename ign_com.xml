            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But Village ran so well, the team got to porting.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">At the most recent Nintendo Direct, Nintendo fans were blessed with the news that not one, not two, but three modern Resident Evil games would be coming to Nintendo Switch 2: Village, Requiem, and Biohazard. But according to Requiem's developers, this wasn't always the plan. In fact, the team didn't originally plan to bring anything to the Switch 2 at all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to me at Tokyo Game Show, producer Masato Kumazawa explains the story of how the Nintendo Switch 2 ended up with the three most modern Resident Evil games on their way to the system:</p><blockquote>The Switch 2 hadn't been announced when we started planning this game [Requiem], so of course it wasn't in the original plan. When the Switch 2 was announced we were able to start testing developing games for it, and we thought it would be great if we could bring the Resident Evil series to this platform. We started off with internally porting Resident Evil: Village to see if it would work well on the hardware, and it looked really great, so that gave us the confidence to add a Switch 2 version of Reqiuem to the plans, and that led us to the recent announcement where we confirmed not only Reqiuem was coming, but 7 and 8 would also be coming to Nintendo Switch 2 at the same time.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise that Kumazawa is gassing up the Switch 2 port of his own game, but I played a brief section of Resident Evil: Requiem at Tokyo Game Show in handheld mode on the platform and...yeah, it looks pretty good! I asked him as a follow-up if there was anything unique about the Switch 2 version of the game, and his response that no, there isn't, "in a good way." It's just Requiem, on the Switch 2, able to be taken on the go. And though my sampling of this experience was brief, I'm optimistic from that short demo that Kumazawa's not just all talk here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We previewed Resident Evil: Requiem just last month, and you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">read our impressions of what we've seen so far right here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Another event, another demo, and no Leon in sight.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I walked into my interview with Resident Evil: Reiquem director Koshi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazama, I came equipped with a big pile of questions about a character who, as far as we know officially, is nowhere to be found: Leon Kennedy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I had these questions prepared because the day before my interview, Capcom aired its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-online-program-tgs-2025-everything-announced">Capcom Online Program showcase</a> to coincide with Tokyo Game Show. And to eager Resident Evil fans, me, and many of my coworkers, it seemed obvious that we were finally going to get a new trailer revealing Leon's official precense in the game, as a playable character or otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's not what happened. We did see a new trailer, but no Leon. And a preview build available at TGS, which I went hands-on with after my interview, was similarly bereft of Leon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When I brought up the strangeness of my expectations and the resulting Leon Kennedy drought to Nakanishi and Kumazawa, they just laughed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will take on board this feedback," Kumazawa said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-shows-fresh-look-at-grace-ashcrofts-backstory-but-wheres-leon">Fan clamor for Leon has been going on for months now,</a> ever since the game's first trailer appeared to contain multiple teases for, at minimum, a Leon appearance. But rumors have since grown, with some suggesting Leon might show up in the game as a secondary playable protagonist alongside newcomer Grace Ashcroft. Nakanishi and Kumazawa have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">attempted to brush those rumors aside</a>, saying that Kennedy is a poor match for Reqiuem's less action-heavy tone, but the fervor has persisted anyway, and the two are stopping short of saying outright that we won't get to control him at all, even for just a little bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given all this discussion, I asked the pair if they had any concerns that all the Leon nonsense was distracting from their attempt to position Grace as the game's star. But they're not worried. "We're always happy that people are interested in the game enough to speculate so much," Kumazawa said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If, then, the pair are so insistent that Grace is the new face of this Resident Evil story, could Reqiuem server as a sort of passing-of-the-torch between old and new Resident Evil? Not quite, Kumazawa says.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Although we don't have firm plans for the future storylines of later titles in the series, I still think passing the torch is probably going a bit too far, because we're not just going to wipe the slate clean completely in terms of the series lore and history. But at the same time I don't want to always have to just go back to the well of existing characters to create new games, which was part of the motivation to introduce Grace."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We previewed Resident Evil: Requiem just last month, and you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">read our impressions of what we've seen so far right here</a>.

With their towering HP values, spectacular full-art designs, and that notorious 3-Prize rule when a Mega ex is knocked out, these cards are already shaking up both the collector market and early deck-building experiments in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/japan-has-so-much-pokmon-stuff-its-almost-unfair">Japan</a>, and we expect the same to happen worldwide, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like every major set, certain chase cards have risen to the top. That’s whether for playability, stunning artwork, or simply the popularity of their featured trainer or Pokémon. Below, we’ve ranked ten of the most expensive Mega Evolution cards in today’s market on our favourite dedicated marketplace, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVExJN?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer</u></a>, starting from the lowest on the chart and working up to the crown jewel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Mega Brave and Mega Symphonia expansions have already delivered some of the most eye-catching and valuable cards of the year, with the 10 most valuable of which from the combined Mega Evolution set can be found below, for those who don’t feel like scrolling through the whole larger list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, with the set only just being released, TCGPlayer's exact most valuable card rankings are changing rapidly, due to continuous market price changes. So, be sure to also check out the live page showing the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVExJN?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">most expensive Mega Evolution Pokémon cards on TCGPlayer</a> right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, as for our top 10, from dazzling behemoths like Mega Venusaur ex and Mega Gardevoir ex, to nostalgic Special Art Rares of fan-favourite trainers like Lillie’s Determination, collectors are still scrambling to secure them before prices climb higher. Here’s a quick look at the ten of the most expensive cards currently dominating the Mega Evolution market.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Mega Venusaur ex - 155/132 (Ultra Rare)</h2><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228417"><div id="228417" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Venusaur ex - 155/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Venusaur ex cards in general thrive on endurance, and Mega Evolution's is no different. Solar Transfer lets you freely move Grass Energy around, while Jungle Dump delivers 240 damage and heals 30, making it tough to topple. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">5ban Graphics’ artwork reinforces that bulk, with <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLMyRZ?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Venusaur ex</a> crouched under vibrant petals in a pose that radiates raw power. Both a sturdy option in Grass decks and a visually commanding card, it’s a sought-after Ultra Rare.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. <strong>Mega Absol ex – 161/132 (Ultra Rare)</strong></h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228412"><div id="228412" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Absol ex - 161/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Absol has always had a cult following since its debut in Gen III , and this new Mega form captures that same aura of menace. <a href="https://zdcs.link/av3wk0?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Absol Ex's</a> Ultra Rare gives us an eye-catching, almost gothic rendering, making it look like it has stepped out of a noir film, with its mix of black and yellow tones. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Competitively, its Terminal Period attack is an intriguing win-condition attack, knocking out foes that line up perfectly on damage counters, while Claw of Darkness offers raw power plus disruption. Though it’s a little clunky in the current fast-paced meta, Absol’s fan appeal ensures this one holds value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Vulpix – 138/132 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228413"><div id="228413" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vulpix - 138/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay-wise, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YMD5o?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vulpix</a> won’t shake the meta with Stampede and Combustion, which are serviceable but underpowered. What makes this card stand out is its Illustration Rare art by saino misaki, showing the fox Pokémon curled up by a fireplace in a warmly lit, rustic room. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a cosy-looking slice-of-life card that collectors are eager to chase, proving once again that atmosphere and nostalgia can lift even a low-power card into a high-value slot.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Marshadow – 146/132 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228414"><div id="228414" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marshadow - 146/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Marshadow is one of the more competitively promising Illustration Rares. Shadowy Side Kick deals respectable damage, and its effect of blanking damage to <a href="https://zdcs.link/98PO01?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marshadow</a> on the following turn if it takes a KO can stall opponents effectively. Altogether, this card straddles the line between competitive tech and collector gem.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Bulbasaur – 133/132 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228416"><div id="228416" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bulbasaur - 133/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Already a major seller amongst Pokémon TCG collectors on TCG player, this Mega Evolution <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeK1D5?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur’s</a> Bind Down is a deceptively disruptive move, trapping your opponent’s Active Pokémon in place while chipping away at their board state. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This utility, combined with Bulbasaur’s nostalgic allure as the original Grass starter, gives it both competitive and casual appeal. Artist mashu delivers bold, swirling colours that make Bulbasaur appear almost dreamlike, enhancing its chase factor. Along with being playable, it’s one of the most visually striking cards in the set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Lillie’s Determination – 169/132 (Ultra Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228415"><div id="228415" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Determination - 169/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although not as dazzling as its more artistic counterpart below, this UR of <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrJNG?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie's Determination</a> is already one of the hottest chase cards of the Pokémon TCG’s Mega Evolution set. Atsushi Furusawa’s stunning full-art design captures Lillie with delicate, vibrant detail, and the card effect remains a flexible draw option. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it may not dominate the competitive scene, it is almost guaranteed to headline binders and display cases. It can be easy for newcomers to underestimate Lillie’s immense popularity, but that doesn’t stop its position near the very top of the set’s value list.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Ivysaur – 134/132 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228418"><div id="228418" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ivysaur - 134/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Razor Leaf offers a reliable 60 damage for two Grass Energy, positioning <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4PYR?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ivysaur</a> as a useful bridge to Mega Venusaur in dedicated Grass decks. The artwork, again by mashu, captures Ivysaur leaping forward with fierce determination against a backdrop of glowing foliage and vibrant petals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the full Kanto starter line, collectors are eager to build the evolutionary trio, and its combination of steady damage and stunning visuals cements its rising market value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Mega Venusaur ex – 177/132 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228421"><div id="228421" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Venusaur ex - 177/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Our third-most valuable card in the Pokémon Trading Card Game’s new Mega Evolution set, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgwoD?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Venusaur ex</a> is a true battlefield tank, with Solar Transfer enabling seamless Energy redistribution and Jungle Dump delivering 240 damage while healing itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, this makes it one of the most flexible and durable attackers in the set. The SAR artwork by mashu is extraordinary, depicting a lush, chaotic jungle scene bursting with colour, where Venusaur looms as a dominant presence. The synergy of competitive utility and jaw-dropping art is what has pushed this card into the top tier of value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Lillie’s Determination – 184/132 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228419"><div id="228419" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Determination - 184/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Few Trainers hold the same sway in the secondary market as Lillie. Not only does the floral artwork of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqm4j?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie’s Determination</a> by Atsushi Furusawa give off endless warmth and nostalgia, the actual effect of this Trainer card is great as well: refreshing your hand with six new cards or even eight when behind, presenting real utility in control and comeback strategies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top, Lillie’s sheer popularity, though seems to be additionally driving the price tag into the around-$200 stratosphere, just as we’ve seen with her earlier Sun &amp; Moon prints.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="6e46733a-996e-4b1e-aa8f-25cb10d3bcde" id="228420"><div id="228420" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gardevoir ex - 178/132 - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Priced at over $500 at the time of writing, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31qeq?object_uuid=ffff6e83-69ba-4559-b2c4-8c8cc9ab06bf&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Gardevoir ex</a> stands as the Pokémon TCG's crown jewel of the Mega Evolution set. Whilst Overflowing Wishes accelerates Psychic Energy across your Bench, Mega Symphonia converts that fuel into devastating damage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raita Kazama’s museum-quality artwork, full of pastel tones and floral elegance, perfectly matches the card’s grace and strength. It’s this union of competitive power and striking style that cements this beautiful piece of cardboard as the set’s most coveted prize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.
