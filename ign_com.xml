Its publisher is listed as Daybreak Game Company LLC, which owns Cold Iron Studios, developer of the first game.

It was well-received upon its 2021 launch, earning a 7/10 from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aliens-fireteam-elite-review">IGN’s review</a>. We said: “There's plenty of wild shootouts with swarms of xenomorphs in Aliens: Fireteam Elite, but some awkward pacing and repetitive level design prevents it from being a classic.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-announces-xbox-game-pass-august-2025-wave-1-lineup">Aliens: Fireteam Elite recently hit Xbox Game Pass</a>, expanding its audience.
