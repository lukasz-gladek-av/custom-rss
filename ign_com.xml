            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Video game adaptations are all the rage these days — so why not add another cool one to the list? The Last of Us and Alien: Romulus star Isabela Merced <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is set to star</a> in an upcoming film adaptation of the hit Sega franchise <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-house-of-the-dead">The House of the Dead</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The adaptation was previously announced with Paul W.S. Anderson at the helm, which is definitely a good sign for any video game adaptation. Anderson is responsible for the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/mortal-kombat">Mortal Kombat</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> films, as well as the fourth, fifth, and sixth installments in the Resident Evil franchise — so it makes a lot of sense that he would want to delve into the 1997 game and bring it to life on screen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The House of the Dead is a game I have loved for many years, and I’m beyond thrilled to be bringing this to the big screen with such an exciting talent as Isabela at its heart,” Anderson said in a statement. “We envisage this as the start of a tentpole franchise which can explore <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/house-of-the-dead">the rich world</a> and lore that Sega has created over a whole series of films.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/gettyimages-2249071240-1770397427545.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Isabela Merced. Image credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The House of the Dead is particularly noteworthy as a horror shooter game because of one special detail: it basically pioneered the concept of zombies running fast in video games, which obviously continued to inspire other games and films alike over the years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are no exact details on Merced’s character just yet, but considering players would take on the role of AMS agents, employees of an agency that handles world-ending conspiracies, it appears she might be playing one of those folks. That said, time will tell.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anderson is also producing this “fresh take” on the series alongside Sega exec and producer Toru Nakahara, and Dmitri M. Johnson, Michael Lawrence Goldberg, and Timothy I. Stevenson of Story Kitchen. Jeremy Bolt, one of the producers on Anderson’s first Resident Evil film, will also produce, with Merced herself serving as an executive producer. The project is set to go up for international sale at the upcoming European Film Market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Working with Isabela is a thrilling opportunity as she embodies the heroine character perfectly, bringing dynamic energy to the production,” Nakahara also noted in a statement. “We’re dedicated to crafting a visually striking and immersive experience by introducing compelling actors and terrifying creatures that will bring the House of the Dead universe to life on the big screen. With our deep understanding of video game adaptations, we’re eager to deliver an electrifying cinematic journey for the franchise’s fans.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lex Briscuso is a film and television critic and a freelance entertainment writer for IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Neverness to Everness Launches New Closed Beta with Latest Improvements]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/neverness-to-everness-launches-new-closed-beta-with-latest-improvements</link>
            <guid>1428421</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Free-to-play open-world RPG Neverness to Everness (NTE) just launched a new closed beta test, called the Co-Ex Test, that’s playable on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile. It showcases the improvements developer Hotta Studio has made in the months since the last closed beta, including vehicle updates, new minigames, and gameplay tweaks. And alongside the beta, they announced that <a href="https://pwgam.es/3G4LuoG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>pre-registration is available now</u></a> on the App Store and Google Play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Containment Test beta in July added a requisition system that allows you to commandeer vehicles across Hethereau, the giant metropolis where NTE takes place. And now, that system has been refined. New types of vehicles have been added, including muscle cars, supercars, and sportbikes, and the physics of all vehicles have been improved. Handling is tighter, while collisions and the exterior damage they cause are more realistic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also a lot more ways to interact with vehicles. Characters can join you as passengers, and they’ve gotten new riding animations. And you can honk the horn and jump out of a vehicle before it’s come to a stop. You can also pop tires, knock out windows, and damage vehicles to the point where they explode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can requisition vehicles whenever you want, but causing excessive damage or disturbing public order will activate NTE’s multi-level wanted system, which has also seen some changes. As your wanted level rises, there will be escalating consequences. Police officers and bots will pursue you, and they’ll get more aggressive as your wanted level increases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Previously, if you were apprehended by police officers, you simply paid a fine and were immediately let out. Now, you’ll be sent to a detention facility, where you have more options for how to get out. You can still pay the fine to leave immediately, but now you also can try to stage a jail break, which obviously comes with some risk. Or you can work off what you owe, which basically amounts to cleaning up the facility. It’s the slowest option, but it costs no money and comes with no danger. So you’ll need to weigh what’s most important to you: speed, danger, or cost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hethereau is almost constantly plagued by reality-defying anomalies, and the main story will see you working as an unlicensed Anomaly Hunter to investigate these weird occurrences and figure out how to stop them. But in between these story beats, you’ll be able to take part in leisure activities and hobbies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can buy a home to return to after a long day, or you can buy and customize a car and race against street crews or against other players in multiplayer. The Co-Ex Test added new activities and hobbies too, including fishing, games of Mahjong, a musical rhythm game called Super Sound (which you can see below), and a shop management sim mode.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fishing is the most in-depth addition, with a total of 76 different types of fish spread across designated fishing spots in the city. Each district of Hethereau has its own spots, and different fish are located in different bodies of water. So you’ll need to venture across the city if you want to catch them all. Whatever you catch can be sold for tokens, which can then be traded for fishing-related items or fons (the in-game currency). And as you catch different fish, you’ll earn additional rewards for filling up your fishing log.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like being able to take over a shop and manage its day-to-day operations to improve it, then Owner’s Selection is the mode for you. You can find shops in the open world available for purchase. Once you buy one, you’re in charge of improving its popularity and business level. You do this by hiring staff, decorating the shop, and stocking products. As the shop’s popularity grows, its level will rise and you’ll earn increased profits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a new dungeon-style extraction mode called Pink Paws Heist that you can access at any time once you’ve unlocked it at Tycoon Level 18. In it, you’ll gather resources and either fight or avoid patrolling anomalies to find your way to an exit. You’ll get points based on which resources you successfully extract with, and those points can be traded for currency, upgrade materials, and other goodies.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Co-Ex Test will last until February 20, and public signups are closed, but you still have the chance to win access. Go to <a href="https://nte.perfectworld.com/net/260206twitch/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>this site</u></a> before February 13 and link your PWG account, then tune in for Twitch Drops livestreams that will run until February 13 at 10:59 p.m. Eastern. During the livestream, you’ll have the chance to directly receive access to the beta. Good luck!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the beta test ends, Hotta Studio will take player feedback and implement it into later versions. A final release date for the full version of NTE has not been announced yet, but we do know it will be available for free on PC, console, iOS, and Android with cross-progression across all platforms. For the latest news and info, you can follow NTE on <a href="https://x.com/intent/user?screen_name=NTE_GL&amp;utm=officialEN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Twitter</u></a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ntegame.official/?utm=officialEN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Instagram</u></a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ntegame.official?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc?utm=officialEN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>TikTok</u></a>, or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/DfCgSpc8ez?utm=officialEN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Discord</u></a>.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/neverness-to-everness-launches-new-closed-beta-with-latest-improvements]]></content:encoded>

What's that, some kind of fancy lawyer lingo?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The line is a fun pun on Wolverine's blades, and the kind of clause a lawyer might include in a legal contract — but which lawyer? Well, Marvel fans will know there's only one legal representative who'd likely seek out Wolverine when he's in another one of his moods.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">"Claws"?

A post-launch Spider-Man 2 patch then re-added the Nelson &amp; Murdock sign, hinting at some kind of story for the character being in the offing — something the game's director Bryan Intihar even <a href="https://x.com/SpiderManCD/status/1720233692407148815" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a> on in late 2023, teasing: "Stay tuned."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Further references to the character have teased Murdock and Jennifer Walters apparently starting a legal firm together, and included other Daredevil-themed locations such as Josie's Bar and Fogwell's Gym. Clearly, the character has been on Insomniac's mind for some time — perhaps Wolverine is where we'll finally see him?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you would expect, replies to Insomniac's latest post have immediately picked up on the studio's apparent Daredevil hint, and responded with numerous gifs of Charlie Cox in his iconic red suit. Well, why not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Due for release this during the latter half of 2026, Marvel's Wolverine remains somewhat under-wraps — though we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-ps5-exclusive-wolverine-game-finally-gets-gameplay-reveal-at-state-of-play-2025">finally got a decent look at the game during last September's State of Play broadcast</a>.
