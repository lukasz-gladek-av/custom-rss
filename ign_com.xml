            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear and Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima recently echoed Tom Cruise when talking about his future plans, declaring: "I want to keep creating things until I die."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since starting out in the industry at Konami in 1986, Kojima has created a variety of games, including Snatcher, the innovative sunlight-based GBA title Boktai, and the infamous P.T. demo. In a recent interview centering around Kojima’s latest game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/06/26/154443.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game*Spark</a> asked Kojima about his motivations and thoughts on why he continues to make games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m the same as Tom Cruise (laughs)," he said. "My life has been dedicated to creating things. That is my joy. I want to create for as long as my body and my brain keep working. I will think about (stopping) if it begins to inconvenience the people around me, but I want to keep creating things until I die.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/04/gettyimages-2222468111-1751642076261.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hideo Kojima says he shares one thing in common with Tom Cruise.

On the red carpet, Cruise told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tom-cruise-making-movies-into-100s-mission-impossible-1236220928/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> that he will never stop making movies, even quipping that intends to keep making them into his 100s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of movies, in Kojima’s comment to Game*Spark, he didn't specify creating games, just <em>creating</em>. This suggests that Kojima is open to making something that is not a game in the future. In a recent video interview with French media outlet <a href="https://youtu.be/TfqoXqWsOt0?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brut</a>, Kojima revealed that, depending on how Kojima Productions is doing after it has completed Microsoft game OD and Sony game Physint, he would like to make a movie.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With their long cutscenes and cinematic presentation, some have argued that many of Kojima’s games are already movie-like (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-of-kojimas-games-are-actually-cutscenes-we-did-the-maths">we’ve even worked out exactly how much of each Kojima game is cutscenes</a>). However, in the interview with Game*Spark, Kojima addresses this, explaining that even though his games are influenced by movies, he is always focused on making a game first and foremost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I grew up watching movies, so they influence the lighting, character modeling, direction and so on (when I make a game), but I am conscious of the fact that I am not making a movie, and my fundamental approach is to consider what can only be done in a game, including an odd sense of playfulness," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima’s playfulness is evident in some of the unexpected cameos and bizarre Easter eggs you can find in his games, especially if you mess about. Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/Secrets_and_Easter_Eggs">list of the Death Stranding 2 Easter Eggs, cheats and secrets</a> we’ve found so far, or find out about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-why-is-sam-singing-and-dancing-in-the-hotspring-hideo-kojimas-nostalgic-japanese-comedy-legends-easter-egg-explained">the strange things you can make Sam do in the hotsprings</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Kojima is associated with a movie: an adaptation of Death Stranding itself, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-star-norman-reedus-says-he-would-of-course-play-himself-in-the-upcoming-movie-if-it-was-an-option">which Norman Reedus has said he'd love to star in</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Kojima Productions.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West. She has also written about Japanese culture and movies for various publications.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-developer-hideo-kojima-says-im-the-same-as-tom-cruise-i-want-to-keep-creating-things-until-i-die]]></content:encoded>
