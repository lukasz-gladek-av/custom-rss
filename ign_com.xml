            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> is set to go up against Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this year, and while both are military first-person shooters, it sounds like there will be at least one significant point of difference: skins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty’s foray into goofy skins territory is not a new phenomena, although recent releases have certainly amped up the conversation around them. With the likes of Beavis and Butt-Head and American Dad hitting the game this year shortly after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-ongoing-420-obsession-sparks-debate-among-fans-some-have-had-enough-others-really-want-that-seth-rogen-skin">weed-obsessed bundles starring Seth Rogen</a>, some fans have said they’ve had enough of what they call the 'Fortnite-ification' of their beloved Call of Duty, and have pleaded with publisher Activision to return to its mil-sim roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Battlefield 6, a game EA is pitching as having a “gritty realism” aesthetic. But will this extend to skins? In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/battlefield-6-dev-responds-to-fears-of-unrealistic-beevis-and-butthead-skins-we-listen/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer</a>, UX director Alan Pimm said he was unaware of any internal plans to release crossover skins that would break the aesthetic Battlefield 6 is going for, and promised the developers were listening to fan feedback.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I can tell you is I don’t know of any plans and, at the moment, that package is the ‘gritty realism’ and that we listen. That I can tell you,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we must also bear in mind that there is enormous pressure on Battlefield 6 to do the business for EA. Indeed the company has said it’s all in on the game, which it sees as a platform just as Activision does with Call of Duty. It would be naive to expect EA to resist the temptation to release eye-catching skins, and even crossover with other IP for bundles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, how far will it go? Will EA, when all is said and do, stick with Battlefield 6’s “gritty realism” when it comes to skins, as Call of Duty initially set out to? Or will it buckle and end up going down the same path with 90s cartoon skins of its own?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/01/f2dyabzwaaa5-ec-1754039802526.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nicki Minaj hit Call of Duty in 2023.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a separate interview with DBLTAP, Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil doubled down on EA's committment to grounded realism, and even pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-call-of-duty-season-5-snoop-dogg">Call of Duty's infamous Nicki Minaj skin</a> as something Battlefield 6 doesn't need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has to be grounded," he said. "That is what BF3 and BF4 was — it was all soldiers, on the ground. It’s going to be like this,” Uchil said, pointing at the key art featuring soldiers in soldier gear looking out over a wartorn New York City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “I don’t think it needs Nicki Minaj. Let’s keep it real, keep it grounded.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Battlefield 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-preview">a hands-on preview</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s first financial report since the launch of Switch 2 is in, and it’s smiles all round for the company after record-breaking sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 2 has sold more than 6 million units globally in the seven weeks since launch, breaking a number of sales records for video game consoles. Nintendo said demand for Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and it apologizes to consumers. “We will continue to strengthen our production and supply systems to deliver as much Nintendo Switch 2 hardware as possible,” the company said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a fantastic result for the Switch 2 hardware itself, which is comfortably the fastest-selling in Nintendo history. Nintendo said demand “has surpassed our expectations.” Still, it’s sticking to its forecast of selling 15 million Switch 2 units in the financial year ending March 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for games, Nintendo said Switch 2 software sales reached 8.67 million units. Launch title Mario Kart World made up the bulk of those game sales, shifting 5.63 million units (almost as many as the Switch 2 itself has sold). But it’s worth noting that figure includes units bundled with the hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end result is that overall sales totaled 572.3 billion yen (approx. $3.8 billion), and operating profit grew 4% to 56.9 billion yen ($378 million) for the three months ending June 30. After all the furore over Trump’s tariffs and changing product prices, in its financial report Nintendo said “at this time there is no significant impact on our earnings forecast for this fiscal year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, demand for the OG Switch has remained even after the launch of the Switch, and sales of the console inched ever higher, and are now at 153.1 million. The number of annual playing users between July 2024 and June 2025 has remained above 100 million, which means Nintendo launched Switch 2 into an environment where a huge number of people were already playing Switch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming Switch 2 exclusives include Drag x Drive, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Kirby Air Riders, and FromSoftware's The Duskbloods. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is due out on the OG Switch and the Switch 2 later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">Nintendo held a Direct showcase</a> focusing on upcoming games from third-party developers and publishers, including Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, Octopath Traveler 0, and The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Stanislav Kogiku/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill f – We Played it for 5 Hours]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-%E2%80%93-we-played-it-for-5-hours.1259331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who loved Bloober Team’s 2024 remake of Silent Hill 2, I’m happy to report that while being made by an entirely different developer, Silent Hill f boasts that same level of quality and polish. From story to worldbuilding, from graphics to combat and exploration, Taiwan-based developer Neobards has crafted an experience that meets the high bar set by the Polish developer, albeit in a drastically different setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I started walking the dense yet deserted streets of Ebisugaoka, it was immediately apparent just how detailed and well-realized this fictional remote town in the mountains of rural Japan in the Sixties is. With an immersive over-the-shoulder view and no UI on screen during exploration, Silent Hill f is a game that tells a convincing story through its visuals.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill f Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Admittedly, I was initially skeptical of Konami’s decision to entrust a non-Japanese developer to create a game set in Japan, but five hours of actually playing Silent Hill f shattered such prejudices. Ebisugaoka is undoubtedly one of the most impressive contemporary Japanese townscapes I have ever seen in a video game, and that comes from someone who has lived in Japan for the majority of his life and loves games like Shenmue, Persona, and Ghostwire: Tokyo.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Exploring a Japanese mountain village</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the few minor issues I had with the Silent Hill 2 remake was that the majority of its playtime is spent inside buildings and facilities. While these functioned as well-designed dungeons packed with horrifying enemies to fight and intricate puzzles to solve, the increase in volume compared to the 2001 original made it feel like exploration of the actual town of Silent Hill was limited.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised that the vast majority of my playtime with Silent Hill f was spent exploring Ebisugaoka. Old wooden houses with tin roofs line the narrow alleys, scattered with bicycles, flower pots, and mailboxes. Small streams and footpaths between rice fields gently lead the way to the village. Fences along the river and concrete stairways following the slopes create a townscape that oozes with atmosphere. Files and other documents scattered throughout the town add context to Ebisugaoka, which flourished as a mining town during its heyday. Now, it has become a largely forgotten village and its people are stuck in old ways, such as favoring traditional healthcare methods over modern medical science and being overly devout to the Shinto deity Inari. The context of Ebisugaoka and its people immediately feel like they are an integral part of Silent Hill f’s cohesive story, which made me eager to go off the beaten path and obtain every hidden file.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Walking the empty streets of Ebisugaoka and heading to the local candy store to meet up with Hinako’s fellow high school friends feels like an authored walking simulator reminiscent of games like Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The story starts after protagonist Hinako – a female high school student – runs away from home after being scolded by her drunk father. Walking the empty streets of Ebisugaoka and heading to the local candy store to meet up with Hinako’s fellow high school friends feels like an authored walking simulator reminiscent of games like Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it doesn’t take long until Hinako and her friends discover something is wrong in town, and before you know it Hinako is holding an iron pipe in her hands, an iconic weapon of the series. Ebisugaoka then gradually proves to not just be suited for a captivating walking simulator experience, but also the perfect setting for a horror game, as its narrow alleys and staircases are ideal to hide enemies behind corners while also functioning as a maze for the player to get lost in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In some instances, doors left ajar and open windows invite Hinako inside traditional tatami-floored houses, where she will have to solve some simple puzzles in order to make her way through to the next area. These puzzles play out in an unconventional way. One puzzle, for example, had me obtain keys to a locked door, but there was nothing noteworthy inside. Then, as I went back to the corridor another door suddenly swung open, which gave me the chills.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Something feels off</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f’s scenario writer Ryukishi07 sees Japanese horror as a sub-genre that doesn’t so much rely on threats to the protagonist's life, but rather makes you feel uncomfortable by creating situations that feel off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you think about it, Silent Hill is a series known for just that. While there isn’t a lack of life-threatening encounters, some of the series’ most uncomfortable moments are in conversations with its outright weird characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Silent Hill f, Hinako and her friends are trying to find a way to escape the haunted town of Ebisugaoka. Interactions with these friends seem normal at first, but then suddenly they say or do something that catches you off guard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, in typical Silent Hill fashion, puzzles often reveal something about Hinako or the world she inhabits. A puzzle on a misty rice field has you examine scarecrows in order to learn the direction you should be heading, which is connected to a childhood trauma of Hinako getting lost and being afraid of the scarecrows.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill f - Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During my playthrough, puzzles never felt too difficult. Hints provided by files you obtain never make the solution too obvious, while still giving the player an idea of what they have to do. On a related note, Silent Hill f has difficulty settings for both its combat and puzzles, and while Konami advised me to play on Story mode for both, I stubbornly chose Normal mode as I wanted to take on a challenge. While the difficulty of the puzzles never overwhelmed me, combat proved to be a bit more demanding. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Weapon durability at its best</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f’s combat relies entirely on melee attacks. Hinako can obtain all sorts of weapons ranging from iron pipes to kitchen knives and baseball bats, but no guns come into play. With some exceptions, these weapons are not obtained through story beats, but are scattered throughout Silent Hill f’s world like other resources, and Hinako can carry up to three weapons at a time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Silent Hill f’s combat relies entirely on melee attacks. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you wield iron pipes and stab at enemies with knives, you will notice that the game has weapon durability. It is a nice touch that weapons that are about to break actually change in appearance, so expect to be holding a bent pipe or a broken bat. This also functions as a hint to the player, which Hinako will acknowledge by mentioning that she should fix it. Weapons can be fixed by using a repair kit, but these are so scarce that on many occasions you will have to say goodbye to your new favorite weapon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While weapon durability is often regarded as a burden in games, it works here as finding a new weapon and repair kits quickly becomes an integral part of the resource management that the survival horror genre is known for, especially since you won’t be having to look for ammo this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A clever system allows you to turn in your resources for an in-game currency at save points, which can be used to increase your stats or obtain new amulets that can be equipped to give you certain buffs. That means that if you are careful and don’t waste your resources, leftovers can be turned into something useful, which feels like a great reward to a well-planned expedition. Hinako can only carry a limited amount of items, which also seems to stimulate active use of this new trading system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the Silent Hill 2 remake, resources were so abundant that skilled players didn’t really have to worry about resource management, to the extent that they would have a large stock of unused ammo and items by the end of the game. Silent Hill f solves this problem by making resources tradable.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Silent Souls?</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat itself has a similar feel to Silent Hill 2’s close-range combat. You can dodge enemy attacks with the DualSense’s circle button, while you can activate a light and heavy attack with R1 and R2, respectively. Your limited reach and lengthy attack motions give a realistic, weighty feel to combat. Heavy attacks especially are slow and need to be timed well, contributing to the feeling that Hinako is just a teenager with limited strength.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, each weapon type has a completely unique set of motions and reach. Swinging a newly obtained baseball bat at an enemy or charging at them with a knife you found in the kitchen of a local residence always creates new and exciting situations.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What sets Silent Hill f’s combat apart from Silent Hill 2’s more limited melee combat is the implementation of timed dodges and counterattacks.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What sets Silent Hill f’s combat apart from Silent Hill 2’s more limited melee combat is the implementation of timed dodges and counterattacks. The latter in particular deals lots of damage and is key in battle. Enemies briefly show a sign when a counterattack can be utilized, but unless you have trained your reflex skills by playing games like of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, you will likely have a hard time reacting. That’s where the Focus mode comes in, which can be triggered by holding L2. When in Focus mode, enemy signs for counterattacks appear for longer, while also charging up a power attack that staggers an enemy. That means you might head into Focus Mode with the intention of going for a counterattack, but find yourself switching to a power attack when it charges before the enemy shows an opening.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Focus Mode is tied to Hinako’s mental energy gauge, which exists separately from her stamina and health bar. Interestingly, the upper limit of her mental energy decreases when enemies do something that scares her or when she is frightened by a certain event, connecting the gameplay to the story and Hinako’s mental state. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luckily, there are items that can recover the upper limit of your mental energy gauge, but Hinako’s stamina is limited too. When she runs out of stamina and mental energy, she can become so frightened and tired that she won’t even be able to move for a while. Managing her energy resources, therefore, is key to survival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fighting one regular enemy is fairly manageable, but when confronted by multiple enemies, running away often felt like the best option, especially since enemies don’t give experience points or drop resources. Combat was fun enough that I found myself actively engaging in fights even if there wasn’t a real benefit to it beyond being able to explore the environment more freely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While keeping combat engaging and complex, Silent Hill f does a great job in making the player feel weak. The design cleverly incorporates this by having what seems to be a boss battle at first actually play out as a sequence in which the player has to find an escape route.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another iconic element to the series is the existence of an alternate world, which is present in Silent Hill f as well. Hinako is occasionally transported to a different dimension that shows a more traditional Japan, where a mysterious masked figure guides her through the grounds of various shrines. Here, Hinako obtains traditional Japanese weapons such as the Naginata, a pole weapon with a curved blade on the end, similar to a glaive or halberd that is known to be mostly used by women. Weapons that Hinako finds in this alternate world don’t break, but Hinako won’t be able to carry them over to Ebisugaoka.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was in this realm that I encountered the main boss of my playtime, which proved much more difficult than I had anticipated. Even with my full understanding of the combat mechanics and systems, its long reach, hard-to-predict attack patterns, and multiple stages required significant trial and error. The boss took me nearly an hour to beat, but gradually learning how to take on the boss was a welcome challenge that never felt unfair. For reference, my colleague was playing on Story Mode and defeated the boss on his second try, but an acquaintance from another media outlet who was also playing on Story Mode didn’t manage to defeat the boss and ran out of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While he didn’t specifically mention the Soulslike genre, series producer Motoi Okamoto says that Silent Hill f’s combat was inspired by the current popularity of more difficult action games. With multiple difficulty settings, Silent Hill f is by no means a Soulslike, but its boss design shares a similar learning curve that ultimately results in a great feeling of satisfaction when you finally beat it. Silent Hill f is a story-driven experience above anything else, but it just happens to have really solid combat mechanics and systems at the same time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One unique component of Silent Hill f’s storytelling is the notebook Hinako carries. Here you can read about characters, locations, and events that appear in the story, all written from Hinako’s perspective. At first, it seems to be a pretty straightforward archive, but events in the story can trigger additional text for previously unlocked entries. Instead of simply repeating what events in the story already told you, these additional texts go much deeper into the lore and background. Sometimes, they can slightly contradict or change your view on characters and events, indicating that things are never what they seem to be on the surface. It is not hard to imagine that for a deeper understanding of Silent Hill f’s story and characters, examining these texts will be essential.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Back to school</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The last part of my demo took place inside a school, which was essentially a dungeon similar to Silent Hill 2’s aforementioned apartment buildings, hospitals, museums and hotels. Upon entering the school, Hinako obtains a map of the building which the player will have to use to navigate their way through. Luckily, Hinako is just as diligent a note-taking enthusiast as Silent Hill 2’s James, so whenever you learn that a door is locked or that there is a passage somewhere, it will be noted on the map. Inside the school, I had to solve a multitude of puzzles in order to find keys to reach different classrooms and floors while fighting and running away from enemies along the way. Just like the town itself, the old wooden school building oozes with atmosphere and feels lively even though none of its students or teachers are there, and Hinako's remark to herself, “I haven't been here since graduation,” subtly added to the atmosphere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While in recent video games, the abundance of self-talk by the protagonist can sometimes feel a bit too much, Hinako’s occasional monologue succeeds in subtly contributing to the situation without ever coming over as an exposition dump.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Okamoto, the average playtime for Silent Hill f will be about 12 or 13 hours, which should indicate that I have played through roughly one third of the game. While I don’t know how things will go from here, so far the game’s balance between town exploration and interior facilities feels like an improvement over the Silent Hill 2 remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, while the first five hours of the game felt like they were structured linearly, Silent Hill f has multiple endings like many other games in the series, including the famous UFO ending.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My time with Silent Hill f was promising to say the least. Its worldbuilding and story had me so intrigued that I still think back on my brief visit to Ebisugaoka almost a week later. The deep fog that envelops the town somehow feels more natural than in the town of Silent Hill, perhaps due to the fact that Ebisugaoka is a mountain village. Ebisugaoka just feels like the perfect fit for a psychological horror narrative, and all of Silent Hill f’s systems and mechanics complement the setting. Series composer Akira Yamaoka’s soundtrack also does a stellar job in making the player feel uncomfortable throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Silent Hill f seems to be a horror game that gets everything right. If, like me, the Silent Hill 2 remake was one of your favorite games of 2024, Silent Hill f has the potential to become a serious game of the year contender when it releases for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Silent Hill 2 f ©Konami Digital Entertainment</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>*In-development footage and screenshots are shown.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours]]></content:encoded>

Read on for details about what comes in each one, how much they cost, where you can preorder, and more.</p><p id="standard-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Standard edition">Preorder Octopath Traveler 0</h2></p><p id="deluxe-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Deluxe edition">Octopath Traveler 0 Digital Deluxe Edition</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/deluxe-1753988720266.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbGVx?object_uuid=a5152d63-262c-4a32-a668-a18ffc42d573&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it for PS4 or PS5</a> - $59.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aeb2ml?object_uuid=a5152d63-262c-4a32-a668-a18ffc42d573&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it for Xbox</a> - $59.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The digital deluxe edition comes with the game itself, plus the following digital items:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Digital art book</li><li>Deluxe Travel Provisions:<ul data-cy="list"><li>Action Skills<ul data-cy="list"><li>Triple Strike Mastery, SP Saver Mastery, Extra JP Mastery</li></ul></li><li>Consumable Items: 8 Types of Nuts<ul data-cy="list"><li>Fortifying Nut, Magic Nut, Tough Nut, Resistant Nut, Light Nut, Critical Nut, Sharp Nut, Slippery Nut</li></ul></li><li>Town Decorations: Festive Decoration Designs<ul data-cy="list"><li>Table with Roasted Chicken, Festive Arch, Large Festive Arch, Festive Flag, Grand Vase</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p id="collectors-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Collector's edition">Octopath Traveler 0 Collector’s Edition</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/collectors-edition-1753988733012.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgw6N?object_uuid=a5152d63-262c-4a32-a668-a18ffc42d573&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Square Enix Store</a> - $229.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">This Square Enix Store-exclusive edition comes with the game itself, plus the following extras:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Digital Deluxe Edition Upgrade Code</li><li>Ring of the Flamebringer (JP ring size 21)</li><li>Traveler's Playing Cards</li><li>8-Sided Dice of Wealth, Power, and Fame</li><li>Orsterra Continent Map Gaming Mat </li><li>Arrangements Break &amp; Boost Vol.3 (Music CD)</li><li>Art booklet</li></ul><p id="preorder-bonus"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Preorder bonus">Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Bonus</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/preorder-1753988759998.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Preorder Octopath Traveler 0, and you’ll receive a set of in-game items called Travel Provisions, which Square Enix describes as “A set of items and skills useful for the start of your journey.”</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Healing Grape (M) x5</li><li>Inspiriting Plum (M) x5</li><li>Revitalizing Jam x2</li><li>Icewind Mastery</li></ul><p id="what-is-this-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is this game?">What Is Octopath Traveler 0?</h2></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-announces-octopath-traveler-0-for-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2">Octopath Traveler 0</a> starts with you creating your own character from scratch. The story kicks off with your hometown of Wishvale burning to the ground, and it’s up to you and your companions to rebuild it. This all goes along with the “start from zero” theme of the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is turn-based once again, complete with the “Break and Boost” system from previous games. But this time you can control parties of up to eight characters, so battles could be pretty big. There’s also a whole town-building mechanic, in which you have a grid to build houses and buildings on, placing them wherever you’d like. You’ll join up with over 30 different characters along the way.</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">More Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-where-to-buy">Borderlands 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5">Gears of War: Reloaded Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-up-for-preorder">Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-where-to-preorder">Mafia: The Old Country Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch">Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-story-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-super-mario-party-jamboree-jamboree-tv-nintendo-switch-2">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div>
