Or destroy…”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a comment from Peter Molyneux:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Masters of Albion is the culmination of my life’s work, a game that owes so much to titles like Dungeon Keeper, Black &amp; White, and Fable. It’s a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Masters of Albion game features:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Build, Create, and Customise</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a god, you have absolute freedom over your towns and villages:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Design and build every structure</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Hire, house and manage your workforce</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Customise buildings with paint, patterns and embellishments</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Combine building types into unique multi-purpose structures</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• No timers or waiting, build instantly and iterate freely</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From small workshops to sprawling towns, Albion grows exactly how you decide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wield the Power of the God Hand</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Command the world with ancient powers:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Manipulate buildings and objects freely</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Possess and control the living</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Inspire, reward, insult, or punish your people</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Throw giant boulders, spiked balls, exploding barrels or just plain old-fashioned people</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Rain lightning, fire and destruction down upon your enemies</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Shape Albion with absolute authority</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enjoy the freedom that being a god brings, but with great freedom comes great responsibility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Roam Freely Across Albion</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Experience the world from multiple perspectives:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• View Albion from the heavens or possess living beings to explore on foot</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Control heroes, dogs, workers and even chickens</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Complete quests to unlock treasures and secrets</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Delve into dangerous underground cave networks</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Craft weapons and armour for your heroes</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Design the clothes that your workers wear (however bizarre)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Explore, experiment and uncover the forgotten history of Albion</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Defend the Night</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">When night falls, Albion is no longer safe.

If you've had your eye on it, now is a great time to add it to your virtual shopping cart. It's one we certainly think is worth the investment, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound (PS5) for $31.12</h2><div catalogid="cf9d7410-97e2-4565-b4a8-4b1fdd202b22" id="234359"><div id="234359" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound - Playstation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Writer Will Borger had very high praise for Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound in his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review">review</a>. He explains that it, "looks and sounds incredible, and the fast but thoughtful combat is so damn satisfying that I had a hard time putting it down long enough to write this review." He even exclaims that, "Ninja Gaiden fans, we were lost in the desert for a long time, but Ragebound is like running across an oasis; trust me when I tell you we’ve never been so back."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not the only praise this game received, either. Ragebound even secured a runner-up spot in our nominees list for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-action-game-of-2025">best action game of 2025</a>, thanks to how it "reimagines and modernizes the classic stylings of old-school, 2D Ninja Gaiden with a unique hypercharge mechanic that encourages you to think not just about the order in which you dispatch your enemies, but the tool they use as well." If that's sold you on it, it's worth noting that the game above also sets you up with the soundtrack and a booklet, which is a fun bonus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game deals don't end there, though. We've found a couple more 2025 releases that have received some nice discounts over at Amazon, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-for-ps5-is-back-to-its-lowest-price-yet-at-amazon">Assassin’s Creed Shadows for PS5</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-gets-a-7-discount-at-both-amazon-and-walmart">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Walmart's also offering some nice deals at the moment, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-dropped-to-just-40-in-the-new-year-sales">Battlefield 6 among them and marked down to $40</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 12, 2026 3:20 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-ps5-hits-a-new-low-price-at-amazon]]></content:encoded>
