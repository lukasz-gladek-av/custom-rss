            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best days of the year is finally here: the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJA51?object_uuid=f066f28b-6109-4aec-9bfb-c500d283860e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steam Summer Sale</a> has arrived at last. If you're unfamiliar, the Steam Summer Sale is one of the two biggest sales available on the platform annually, with the other occurring around the holiday season in December. You can expect to save big on PC games both new and old, which makes the sale a perfect time to buy games in bulk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's Steam Summer sale is set to run through July 10. Some of the top-reviewed games of 2025 are included as part of this sale, in addition to newer PC ports from publishers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/square-enix">Square Enix</a> or PlayStation. We've sorted through the sale and picked out some of the best deals you can find this year. Don't miss your chance to save as much cash as possible on these PC games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Steam Summer Sale - The Best Deals Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best deals I recommend checking out is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> for $41.99. With the main story and side content combined, there is easily over 100 hours of content in this RPG. This game just made its way to PC in late January, and it's one of the best RPGs to release in the last five years. If you haven't yet played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, you can grab both games together in the Twin Pack for $59.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, you can save $10 off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>. While this just released in April by surprise, you can already save 20% off and dive hundreds of hours deep into this iconic Bethesda RPG. Bethesda also has a solid deal on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and now is the best time to jump in and prepare for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-dlc-the-order-of-the-giants-finally-has-a-release-date">The Order of Giants DLC</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also save on three major 2025 indie games: R.E.P.O., Schedule I, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-review">Blue Prince</a>. The latter sits as one of the highest rated games of the year, offering a unique house of puzzles to solve. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/schedule-1-review-early-access">Schedule 1</a> puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer, and the game is still one of the most played Steam games of 2025. Finally, R.E.P.O. is a wonderful time with friends that is sure to cause both laughs and headaches. All of these smaller games are generally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-steam-games-on-your-phone">great to stream to your phone</a> if you want a more mobile experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for deep discounts, I recommend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/29/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-review">Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-game-review">Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/17/star-wars-battlefront-2-review-2019">Star Wars Battlefront II</a>. Each of these games is 90% off, and you can pick all three for a grand total of $14. Star Wars Battlefront II is an especially good deal, as there has been a major resurgence in online players as of late.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the smaller discounts available is for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. While you'll only save $5 during the Steam Summer Sale, this is the lowest we've seen this game yet. If you've been on the fence about picking this one up, it's not likely to dip much further until late this year, especially since it is one of the highest-rated games of the year.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Amazon Prime Day Arrives at the End of the Steam Sale</h3><div catalogid="a568cc81-560f-48fe-bbf9-5308ce73a03f" id="223504"><div id="223504" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>All Early Prime Day Deals</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Steam Summer Sale is ongoing right now, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-everything-we-know-so-far">Amazon Prime Day</a> is set to kick off on July 8. This year, Amazon has doubled the length on the sale, making it the longest Prime Day to date. Though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-video-games">PC games</a> are not usually a focus of Prime Day, you can expect to have the opportunity to score a few deals on PC hardware, monitors, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-keyboard">accessories</a>, and more. If you're looking to either enter the PC market for the first time or upgrade your existing setup, keep your eye on Prime Day. This is also when more of the console games will likely go on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon is also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-early-prime-day-2025-offers-free-games-prime-gaming">currently offering free PC games</a> as part of an early Prime Day promotion. So if you are a Prime member already, it's worth diving into that and picking up some freebies before they're gone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima Productions fans can’t stop talking about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> load times, with many calling them the "fastest" they’ve "ever seen in a video game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hideo Kojima’s strand-game sequel launched to stellar reviews, including our own, where we called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Death Stranding 2's post-apocalyptic take on Australia “hauntingly beautiful.”</a> While there are many elements to praise, it’s the visuals that have been almost unanimously celebrated. Death Stranding 2 is quite the visual showcase, so seeing loading screens last less than a second before dropping protagonist Sam Porter Bridges into wide-open fields is quite the sight to behold.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Videos of players showcasing the quick load times have already flooded social media feeds since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-global-release-times-confirmed"><u>early access launch arrived June 24</u></a>, and the results are hard to deny. Pressing the “Continue” button on the main menu presents a flash of a black screen before picking up exactly where players left off. Loading another save while already in-game presents similar results. Some of the phrases being thrown around include “blink or you’ll miss it,” “instant,” and “the fastest load times I’ve ever seen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima’s secret to the unbelievable load times in Death Stranding 2 has yet to be revealed, but one popular X/Twitter post has a theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Okay but actually how the f**k,” user <a href="https://x.com/RealBugAubrey/status/1937501463661437029" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RealBugAubrey</a> said. “Either everyone else is not so secretly terrible at their job or Kojima Productions is making deals with spirits and demons.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1937298687602172194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It’s been mentioned already but the load times in Death Stranding 2 are unbelievably fast, like the fastest I’ve ever seen in any game ever.</p><p>Genuinely how did they do this?? <a href="https://t.co/GmxbaF3ijH" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GmxbaF3ijH</a></p></div>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1938203860490981644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The essentially non-existent Death Stranding 2 load times are only impressive because so many other games on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S still feature loading screens that can last for up 30 seconds or even minutes long. Even without sitting down for a side-by-side comparison, many believe Death Stranding 2 might feature the most impressive load times for a game of this caliber ever. However, there are a few other shining examples that players believe might give Sam Porter Bridges a run for his money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac Games’ 2023 title, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-2">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a>, famously features similarly fast loading times on PS5, with players able to teleport to any location in New York City. All it takes is holding a button, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-dev-insomniac-confirms-fast-travel-hold-to-confirm-prompt-does-not-hide-a-load"><u>the developer has clarified doesn’t hide its own secret loading function</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Xbox side of things is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which many fans have noted features a main menu screen that is the actual game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Right on par with Indiana Jones new game - both seem to load the actual save file in the background as it boots up, so selecting to continue just essentially reveals the game in progress," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1lji189/comment/mzkydml/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user</a> said.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="es" dir="ltr">Indiana Jones: <a href="https://t.co/DOBj7maJk4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/DOBj7maJk4</a> <a href="https://t.co/LSSQ269mI2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LSSQ269mI2</a></p>— Luiz (@diasluizzz) <a href="https://twitter.com/diasluizzz/status/1937547426757525565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s sparked some debate among those seeking to defend their favorite video game, but one thing is clear: many major games are starting to ditch loading screens altogether. We’ll have to wait and see just how long it takes before loading screens vanish from most games entirely.

Particular food unlocks a certain costume for each character, and some food can only be found in specific areas, while others are more common and appear across the map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dash Food is found at vendors such as Yoshi's Diner and vending machines.
