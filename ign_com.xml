This process came after the decision was made not to develop any further content for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and while Mass Effect 5 officially remains in the pre-production phase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, as work on Mass Effect 5 quietly continues, BioWare is hiring a Production Director for the game who will report directly into the project's overall boss, BioWare and Mass Effect franchise veteran Mike Gamble.</p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hi, I'm hiring a very important senior leadership role," Gamble <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/2014438853273387358?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on social media. "They'll report to me and it's gonna be awesome." A <a href="https://jobs.ea.com/en_US/careers/JobDetail/Production-Director/212271" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job description</a> notes that the role will involve partnering with Mass Effect 5's "creative leadership, studio teams, and internal and external partners to champion the game's vision and ensure its execution at the highest quality bar."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Since 1995, BioWare has been dedicated to creating games defined by rich storytelling, unforgettable characters, and expansive worlds," the job description continues. "Over the years, the studio has earned recognition for developing some of the industry's most critically acclaimed titles. Today, BioWare is building on that legacy with the development of the next Mass Effect game, continuing one of the highest-rated and most celebrated series in video game history."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mass-effect-revealed">BioWare first announced plans to make Mass Effect 5 back in 2020</a> — a date that now feels a lifetime ago — in part to simply reassure fans that it remained committed to the franchise. In reality, though, the company was still busy devoting most of its development efforts into getting Dragon Age: The Veilguard done and out the door. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mass Effect: Next Chapter Game Award Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During this time, BioWare is believed to have had only a small team working on its next Mass Effect game concept, while the bulk of the studio was busy elsewhere. With The Veilguard finally launched in late 2024, Mass Effect 5 became the sole focus of the studio — albeit in its newly-slimmed down form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamble previously confirmed that Mass Effect 5 was being led by a team of fellow Mass Effect veterans who served key roles on the franchise's original three games, including art director Derek Watts, creative director Parrish Ley, senior level designer and Normandy programmer Dusty Everman, and game director Preston Watmaniuk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The leadership team behind Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including its lead writer, senior systems designer, various editors, producer and both its co-directors, Corinne Busche and John Epler, are all no longer at the company following the studio's downsizing, meanwhile.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Consecutive years have seen BioWare release snippets of concept art and other brief teasers for the game, which is expected to be set hundreds of years after the end of the original Mass Effect trilogy and feature at least one returning character. At the same time, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-wont-retread-shepards-story-and-will-be-set-after-the-original-trilogy">pre-production has also begun on Amazon Prime's Mass Effect TV series</a> that will also be set after the events of the trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let's start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-and-bioware-remain-committed-to-next-mass-effect-game-and-yes-romances-will-return">Gamble wrote in a blog post last November</a>. "The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare," Gamble continued today. "But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare has given no indication of when Mass Effect 5 will arrive, though here's hoping 2026 brings a better sense of the company's progress as development ramps up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> ended 2025 as the best-selling game in the U.S., beating its first-person shooter rival <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, which ended down in fifth place. Black Ops 6, which also launched day one on Game Pass, was 2024’s number one best-selling game in the U.S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to sales data from Circana, EA’s Battlefield 6 finished as 2025’s best-selling video game in tracked full game dollar sales. It's the first time a Battlefield game has outsold a Call of Duty game. Meanwhile, Battlefield 6 ranked first on both Xbox and the aggregated PC storefronts for the year while placing second on PlayStation behind only NBA 2K26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 had a massive launch in October 2025, breaking franchise records by selling over 7 million copies in its first three days and becoming the best-selling game of 2025 by revenue. This launch, coupled with the release of the hugely popular extraction shooter, Arc Raiders, put enormous pressure on Black Ops 7, which has disappointed in sales terms. Indeed, Black Ops 7’s fifth place finish is the lowest for a mainline Call of Duty game since Call of Duty: World at War ended up at number six in 2008.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are, however, a number of factors we should take into consideration when analyzing Black Ops 7’s performance. The number one is that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard, has yet to announce any sales number for the game, in the U.S. or globally, so we’re lacking that important data point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do know that Black Ops 7 (November 14) launched after Battlefield 6 (October 10), so had fewer days to count sales for the year. And then there’s the Game Pass factor. As a Microsoft game, Black Ops 7 launched day one on Game Pass, where it has trended high in terms of engagement since release. It is thought that Call of Duty’s day one release on Microsoft’s subscription service impacts sales, at the least on Xbox consoles, and perhaps also on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Black Ops 7 finished the year relatively strong. It was December’s best-selling game across physical and tracked digital spending, Circana said. 2025 marked the seventh consecutive year a Call of Duty game has been December’s best seller, with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate topping the chart in December 2018.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there can be no doubting Black Ops 7’s sales struggle compared to 2024’s Black Ops 6, a fact that's reflected in everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffers-terrible-launch-in-europe-with-63-fewer-copies-sold-than-battlefield-6-but-theres-important-context-to-consider"><u>European sales figures</u></a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games"><u>Activision's own admissions</u></a>. Following the release of Black Ops 7, Activision announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games"><u>significant changes</u></a> to the Call of Duty franchise, including promising never to release back to back games in the same sub-brand (Modern Warfare, Black Ops). Activision released Modern Warfare 2 in 2022, Modern Warfare 3 in 2023, Black Ops 6 in 2024, and Black Ops 7 in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bobby-kotick-claims-activision-call-of-duty-and-consoles-are-doing-so-poorly-it-proves-he-was-right-to-sell-activision-blizzard-to-microsoft-for-69-billion">former Activision boss Bobby Kotick claimed Call of Duty sales were down 60% year-on-year</a> — although he provided no evidence to back up his claim and neither Microsoft nor Activision Blizzard have commented in response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Battlefield 6, it's had struggles of its own since its explosive launch, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1">Season 2 delayed</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community">an apparent loss of moment on Steam</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever your take on the Call of Duty vs Battlefield sales war, Epic’s Fortnite led the year in total active users across both PlayStation and Xbox platforms, according to Circana’s Player</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Engagement Tracker, with over half of all active users of the two ecosystems engaging with Fortnite at least once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox was 2025’s leading publisher in digital at retail spending (including gift cards, code on receipts, etc.) for both December and the 2025 year. Digital at retail spending on Roblox during 2025 increased by 16% compared to 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision is expected to unveil this year’s Call of Duty game in the summer.
