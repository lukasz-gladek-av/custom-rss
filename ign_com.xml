            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo is looking for a fresh start, and today’s 2025 Halo Project Update livestream could give it just that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly four years removed from the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-infinite"><u>Halo Infinite</u></a>, gaming fans from every corner of the industry are looking to today’s Halo World Championship 2025 festivities for a sneak peek at the future of the flagship Xbox franchise. What exactly the developers at Halo Studios (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>formerly known as 343 Industries</u></a>) have cooking remains to be seen, but judging by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-studios-teases-deep-dive-on-what-its-been-working-on-at-an-october-panel-you-wont-want-to-miss"><u>a tease shared late last month</u></a>, it sounds like the Halo universe could soon head into uncharted territory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Like last year we’ll be on the Main Stage to talk about it but this year we’ve also got a ‘deep dive’ panel planned for the Community Stage that you won’t want to miss,” Halo Studios said in a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-sept" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Halo Waypoint post</u></a> last month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Halo World Championship 2024 presentation served as fans’ introduction to Halo in Unreal Engine 5, setting the series up for a new direction. We’ll keep track of everything Microsoft and Halo Studios have to announce at the 2025 Halo Project Update stream here, so be sure to check in when the presentation begins at 1 p.m. PT / 4 p.m. ET for all of the latest news.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Microsoft’s Mysterious Halo Studios Project Update?</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Halo World Championship 2025 broadcast is running a bit behind, but that isn't stopping Microsoft from letting it slip that Halo: Campaign Evolved is on the way. An <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/halo-campaign-evolved/9N683TDT5M7R/0010" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox store page</a> for the game, which is described as "a faithful yet modernized remake of Halo: Combat Evolved’s campaign," appeared online today, just moments after the Halo Project Update stream was set to go live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Experience the original story rebuilt with high-definition visuals, updated cinematics, and refined controls, plus three brand-new prequel missions featuring the Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson," its official description says. "A broader arsenal of weapons, vehicles, enemies, and gameplay-modifying 'Skulls' – optional modifiers that change combat in fun and challenging ways – add fresh tactics and endless replayability."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As revealed in a trailer shown on its store page, Halo: Campaign Evolved has a release window of 2026, with platforms including PC and Xbox Series X | S – and even PlayStation 5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">It’s Really Happening</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/24/halo-ps5-1761337613780.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Halo: Campaign Evolved Is Coming to PS5. Image Courtesy of Microsoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s right – Halo is coming to PlayStation for the first time in 24 years. It’s an achievement many believed would never come to be, as console manufacturers pushed for exclusive experiences throughout the 2010s. That all changes in 2026, when Halo: Campaign Evolved launches. No specific release date has been shared yet, but there’s plenty to dissect until more is announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although multiplayer is not included in Halo Studios’ Unreal Engine 5 Halo remake, there is new story content. Three missions, specifically, are said to be in development, with the developers promising that players can expect to explore an arc focused on Master Chief and Sergeant Johnson. It’s unclear how much Halo: Campaign Evolved will cost or how these new missions have been implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Join the Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson in a brand-new arc set before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved, featuring new environments, gameplay, characters, and enemies," an official description says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo fans aren’t strangers to refreshed versions of classic Bungie experiences, though. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection"><u>Master Chief Collection</u></a> remastered Combat Evolved and other Halo games for Xbox and PC many years ago. There’s no word on whether other Halo games, such as 2021’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-infinite"><u>Halo Infinite</u></a> or 2010’s beloved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-reach"><u>Halo: Reach</u></a>, will also make their way to PlayStation 5 in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Halo: Campaign Evolved?</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN got to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one?_gl=1*iiltsh*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTk1NDE1NTc4MC4xNzYxMzM4MDA4*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NjEzMzgwMDgkbzEkZzEkdDE3NjEzMzgwMDgkajYwJGwwJGgw">hands-on with Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> to see just how Halo Studios has changed the classic FPS ahead of its 25th anniversary. Our sneak peek included a gameplay demo focused primarily on The Silent Cartographer, an early mission that takes Master Chief to serene beaches that are now polluted with Covenant Grunts and Elites. It’s a familiar scene that’s been recreated with even UNSC troops and the iconic Warthog intact, all for longtime Halo enjoyers and newcomers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Halo remake has been reimagined for modern audiences, but it's not quite the same experience. Tweaks under the hood include vehicles that can be hijacked, with the Wraith now also driveable for the first time in the original Halo. Of course, the main difference between Halo: Campaign Evolved and the Combat Evolved original is the sleek new visuals it introduces thanks to the power of Unreal Engine 5. Plus, the the primary cast form the original is back, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Iconic vistas, alien architecture, and sci-fi wonders are reborn with all-new visuals, cinematics, and animations," an official description says. "The soundtrack has been remastered, the sound design updated for greater immersion, and new voice performances recorded with the primary cast."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Halo Project Update Livestream Begins</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a late start fueled by some tense matches of Halo Infinite, Halo Studios took the main stage at the Halo World Championship 2025 to talk about its not-so-mysterious project update. Included in the lineup of developers are Halo Studios' Brian Jarrard, Max Szlagor, and Damon Conn, who finally, officially pulled back the curtain on Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team's Halo World Championship 2025 debut for the Halo remake includes behind-the-scenes details on the project, including interviews with the developers, where they promise two-player couch co-op on consoles and four-player online co-op. Don't worry, the Warthog has been updated to account for those larger party sizes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interviews with the team also reveal how Halo Studios revisited classic stories fans know and love. This includes clips of Steve Downes (Master Chief) and Jen Taylor (Cortana) back in the studio to rerecord some of their most iconic lines. As for the story cinematics themselves, fans can expect the Halo remake to deliver something familiar but new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Developing…</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">No Guts, no glory.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Board games and anime are living in a bit of a golden era right now, where both are more popular and widely accepted by the masses than ever before. I count myself lucky that I am living in a period of time where I also get to see these two awesome things blend and combine together, in equally – almost Voltron-esque – awesome new ways. One of the most exciting recent examples of this collaboration is Monolith Board Game’s upcoming <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/monolith-board-games-sarl/berserk-the-board-game#/section/project-story/the-world-of-berserk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Berserk: The Board Game</u></a>, which has taken off on Gamefound this month.</p><div catalogid="8af5b904-5b67-4bf6-9aeb-546b99842755" id="229882"><div id="229882" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Berserk: The Board Game</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Here's where to back the project.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With nearly 5,900 backers and pulling in just over €2 million at time of writing, this tabletop adaptation of Kentaro Miura’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/berserk-1997"><u>Berserk manga/anime</u></a> has cut through its funding goal like Guts cleaving through a demon with his signature Dragon Slayer. Berserk: The Board Game lets 1-5 players take up the weapons of characters, including Serpico, Farnese, Isidro, Shierke, and of course, Guts to dispatch and destroy demonic foes. All of Guts' crew come in detailed miniatures just begging to be painted. These plastic avatars of the Grunbeld and its Grunbeld Apostle, Slan, and Makara are sights to behold, and more than 120 miniatures is a treasure trove for fans that enjoy painting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the Berserk manga will be treated to a ton of artwork pulled from the original story to enjoy. All of the action cards that compose each character’s deck feature iconic moments from the series, along with the imposing enemy cards and more. The core game box gives you an 11 Act campaign that takes place during the <a href="https://berserk.fandom.com/wiki/Millennium_Falcon_Arc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Millennium Falcon arc</u></a>, but the additional Black Swordsman expansion that is also available during the campaign allows you to build your own adventures with tons of possible combinations and options to pick from – including the characters in your party and the enemies you are going to face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While board game adaptations, especially these grandiose boxes, aren’t uncommon these days, most of the time it seems as though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">video games are the source material</a>, and seeing an anime with such legacy and personality as Berserk is exciting. Monolith Board Games has a pedigree for adapting properties for the tabletop that let players team up and bash some heads in, having previously designed games based on Conan the Barbarian and Batman. Berserk, with its mix of dice rolling, card draw, and grid-based movement, looks like it is going to be another gruesome good time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Backing the project</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Berserk: The Board Game looks to have set itself up as a box that will appeal to fans of Berserk who may not have much exposure to the board game scene, thanks to all of the miniatures, as well as fans of co-operative board games thanks to <a href="https://monolithedition.com/en/?srsltid=AfmBOorQlFhIOVq47gt-eRt-hFrVc3EpqJe88mEICIDa8qMmOtjkeh9m" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monolith’s expertise</a>. If you want to make sure that Berserk is for you and your game group before backing it, there is a <a href="https://monolithedition.com/download/berserk_rulebook_kit-demo_en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>WIP Rulebook</u></a> available to look at for a better sense of gameplay. This is undoubtedly a premium product with just the Core pledge running you €200 (about $233) with the total jumping to €335 (about $390) if you want it all, including the 184 miniatures. Gamefound does offer StretchPay that lets you pay off these large costs over multiple months. As someone who has taken advantage of this myself, it helps a ton! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaign is going on for only a few more days, but late pledges will open soon after it closes for those to jump on if you miss the initial campaign.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More board game collaborations</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.
