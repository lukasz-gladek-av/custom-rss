            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-moba-shooter-deadlock-cuts-a-lane-spurring-reactions-from-its-playerbase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">One less line of minions.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>, the MOBA-meets-hero shooter mash-up from Valve, has been in a perpetual state of quiet build-up over the last year. But that hasn't stopped Valve from making massive, tectonic changes, like cutting down the number of lanes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, February 25, Valve published <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422450/view/530965072572320687" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Map Rework Update for Deadlock</a>. Chief among the changes was a redesign of Deadlock's core map around three lanes, rather than four. For those who don't dabble in MOBAs, these "lanes" are the central focus of gameplay; minions spawn at each team's base and surge down them, attempting to push the battle lines into each other's territory. Players take up residence in the lanes, fighting over the killing blow on minions to accrue money and experience they can use to power up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's one big game of tug-of-war, and reducing the number of figurative ropes from four to three has pretty drastic implications. It cuts down on one source of resources and reduces the number of fronts in the ongoing battle. It also means, for the 6-on-6 battles of Deadlock, that previously "solo" lanes will more often be duo lanes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Definitely going to be missing four lanes," one commenter <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iy6ysk/map_rework_update/mes5m1t/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said on the Deadlock subreddit</a>. "I always thought that was one of the more unique aspects of Deadlock. Oh well, learn and adapt I guess."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite some of the worried hyperbole over map shifts, there is a degree of trust — though not absolute or unflinching — and voicing measured feedback. "It’s just a test guys chill," said <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iy78c1/lane_changes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one commenter</a>. "If it works well it stays, if it doesn’t work then it will go away like mid urn." (A former game mechanic.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A decent amount of this trust stems from the fact that IceFrog, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/13/valve-announces-dota-2">pseudonymous developer behind Dota 2</a>, is also working on Deadlock. Dota 2 is fairly infamous for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-aftermath-of-dota-2s-game-changing-update-ign-arena-podcast">massive overhauls and game-changing updates</a>, wiith patch notes that felt like getting whiplash from spreadsheets. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iyk163/some_of_yall_didnt_play_dota_and_it_shows/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old memes stretching back to the early days of Dota 2</a>, encouraging players to trust in IceFrog's changes, have already been resurfaced for modern Deadlock players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Dota 2 has seen so many massive overhauls and changes and the game still thrives," a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1iyk163/some_of_yall_didnt_play_dota_and_it_shows/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commenter said</a>. "As long as Deadlock's core gameplay doesn't drastically change (which definitely isn't a guarantee since its currently in development) then people will play the game regardless."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Map changes aside, Valve took the wrench to a lot of Deadlock with this recent update. Soul Orbs, which are released from enemies upon death and can be shot by players to either secure their rewards or partially deny them from the enemy team, also got a hefty rework. Sprinting has been tuned, flex slots and economic considerations have been made to adjust for the new three-lane set-up, and there's the usual slew of quality-of-life and hero changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some, especially the long-time Dota players, Deadlock's update feels par for the course. (Dota 2 even <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/737004388447420792" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got its own massive overhaul just last week</a>.) While it will certainly shift the way players approach the game, part of the long-term appeal of a MOBA like Deadlock is the ways the game shifts over time, in response to both developer changes and community reactions. If handled well, it can result in years of vibrant competition. If not, well, hopefully there's a rewind button somewhere. History has shown that not all major updates are made in stone, even for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-is-looking-at-bringing-6v6-back-to-overwatch-but-it-wont-be-easy">huge games like Overwatch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With not even a week out yet in Deadlock, players will need to dig in and figure out just how the reduced lanes shifts the game, suss out the intended change, and find new ways to open up gameplay through it. On at least one positive note, players with solo lane anxiety can breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deadlock is still flagged as being in early development, and Valve warns players it's filled with "temporary art and experimental gameplay." Access is currently limited to friend invite via playtesters, and there's no release window announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

All three titles will be available to download for Essential, Extra, and Premium members starting March 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a notably strong month for PlayStation Plus subscribers of all tiers, but the main highlight here is EA and BioWare’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard"><u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u></a>. The big-budget RPG launched October 31, only four months ago, and received strong reviews from critics (we gave it a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review"><u>9/10 in our review</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-failed-to-resonate-with-a-broad-audience-gamers-increasingly-want-shared-world-features"><u>EA said</u></a> the latest Dragon Age title wasn’t able to “resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market,” and BioWare saw a restructure and layoffs. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-patch-notes-sure-make-it-sound-like-biowares-basically-done-with-the-game-now"><u>patch from late last month</u></a> delivered quality-of-life changes and bug fixes and signalled the end of content support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if RPGs aren’t your thing, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-colors-ultimate"><u>Sonic Colors: Ultimate</u></a> provides a rush of speed, action, and, well, color. This remaster of one of the more beloved entries in the Sonic franchise launched in 2021, adding more content to blaze through as players refamiliarized themselves with the Blue Blur’s sci-fi-inspired abilities and story. We gave it an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-colors-ultimate-review"><u>8/10 in our review</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the pack is a collection of 13 remasters of Konami’s classic TMNT spinoff games. It’s a bundle that includes new and improved versions of beat ‘em up titles like TMNT: Turtles in Time, the original TMNT arcade game, and more, all under one roof. Although it wasn’t without its issues, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection"><u>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</u></a> still provides PlayStation Plus subscribers with an easy way to experience old-school fan favorites.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection is a treasure trove of Turtle games, but our online experience was barely functional when matchmaking,” we said in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-the-cowabunga-collection-review"><u>7/10 review</u></a>. “Couch co-op fares a lot better, but some may notice an increased input delay over the originals. All said this is still a great collection for fans.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Plus subscribers can add Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Sonic Colors: Ultimate, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection from next week until April 1, 2025. While we wait for the March titles to drop, be sure to nab <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-plus-games-for-february-2025-announced"><u>February’s PlayStation Plus games</u></a>, which include Payday 3, High On Life, and Pac-Man World Re-Pac, before they disappear from the service next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

It's an eclectic spotlight of games preserved in playable form, available on GOG's storefront, and F.E.A.R. Platinum — which includes the base F.E.A.R. and both expansions — will soon join the lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may not be the last Monolith game there, either. GOG said that other Monolith icons will "join eventually as well." The storefront also teased more news to come about the Preservation Program tomorrow, February 27.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The preservation effort is a nice recognition of Monolith Productions' legacy in the wake of its sudden closure.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-gallery-card-seemingly-teases-hellfire-gala-theme-and-characters-for-season-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Keen-eyed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals"><u>Marvel Rivals</u></a> players have spotted an in-game reference that seems to suggest that Season 2’s theme and characters will revolve around the classic Marvel comics storyline, the Hellfire Gala.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Information on what NetEase Games could be planning for its next seasonal content drop was first spotted and shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1iy4eu3/season_2_is_hellfire_gala_confirmed_in_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>by Reddit user DynamiteDynamo10</u></a>. Their post includes a screenshot of the "Plans Within Plans" Gallery Card included in the in-game event page in Season 1, containing dialog and story details tied to the current season. It’s a lengthy entry in what is already a game brimming with lore, but what’s interesting is how it ends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, if you will excuse me, Doom has a gala to attend,” the post concludes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not exactly an all-out reveal that Season 2 will follow a story set around Marvel’s well-known gala event, but it is at least a suspicious mention that you’ll need to dig to find. Meanwhile, other players are using Doctor Doom’s gala reference as fuel to the fire that are the rumors that X-Men regular Emma Frost will soon join Marvel Rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seemingly leaked Emma Frost voice lines were <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1893535638214922567" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>shared online by X0XLeak</u></a> this past weekend, kicking off speculation that the diamond-skinned character could be added sooner rather than later. She also happens to play a part in the original Hellfire Gala storyline along with a laundry list of other Marvel icons. Voice lines like this are suspicious on their own, so coupled with the reference to the gala, these details have some players already plotting out how Emma Frost could break apart the current Marvel Rivals meta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the development makes sense for many, others are saying the reference isn’t enough to confirm which Marvel names will join the Marvel Rivals roster in Season 2. If the next content drop, which is expected to arrive mid-April, is truly set to add content themed around the Hellfire Gala, then the Gallery Card is the first time NetEase has said anything official on the matter. So, even if we assume Season 2 centers around the Hellfire Gala, the story could include Emma Frost or go a different path completely.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, so many other players have spent the entirety of Marvel Rivals Season 1’s vampire-themed romp expecting to see Blade join as the next playable character following multiple in-game appearances. Some have suggested that this could mean we see the Daywalker join for one half of the season while Emma joins in another, while others theorize that Emma may not join until Season 3. At the least, NetEase has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-promises-a-new-hero-every-month-and-a-half">it plans to deliver at least one new character every half-season</a>, so Season 2 is sure to surprise players one way or another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these details are based purely on speculation; we won’t know what NetEase has planned for at least another few weeks. Until the team has more to share about the future of Marvel Rivals, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-just-made-a-classic-moon-knight-meme-feel-a-little-more-real">how it chose to include a reference to an infamous Moon Knight meme</a> as part of its mid-season update.
