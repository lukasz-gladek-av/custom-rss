            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Strange things are happening.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-online">Red Dead Online</a> is showing signs of life after Rockstar added new missions to the game, and as you’d expect fans are once again speculating that a next-gen update for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> is in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans had come to terms with the idea that Rockstar had moved on from Read Dead Online back in 2022, but the developer has unexpectedly released the new Strange Tales of the West update, which includes four new missions and a tease of more to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new trailer, below, is the first Rockstar has released for Red Dead Online since 2021.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Author Theodore Levin can’t believe the rumors and missives he’s been receiving from the four corners of the American frontier. He’s working on an anthology of these unexplained and weird phenomena and he needs your help investigating the wildest claims that cross his desk.</blockquote><blockquote>Strange Tales of the West will require steely resolve and courage in the face of the odd, twisted, and downright supernatural. Embark upon these four new Telegram Missions by picking up Mr. Levin’s letter at any Post Office or from your Camp’s Lockbox, then opening it via your Satchel or launching Telegram Missions from your Player Menu.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The four new missions are Strange Tales of The Plague, Strange Tales of Modern Science, Strange Tales of The Bayou, and Strange Tales of The Wilderness. As reported by @videotechuk_ on X / Twitter, the update adds a new zombie infected mode, the first mission of which takes place in Armadillo.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Rockstar has launched a new zombie "infected" mode in Red Dead Online as part of the new Strange Tales of The West telegram missions </p><p>The first mission takes place in Armadillo and the main objective to kill infected and bring them to a wagon as a team.</p><p>Infected carry knives. <a href="https://t.co/TC9uOuIDEI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TC9uOuIDEI</a></p></div>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/1940025158225264674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are still digesting the news, with posts across social media and subreddits showing the level of excitement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what does this mean for Red Dead Online and parent game Red Dead Redemption 2? Given the zombie nature of the update, some are wondering if Rockstar has prepared an Undead Nightmare-style expansion for Red Dead Redemption 2. That would come as a huge shock given the studio’s all-hands-on-deck focus on next year’s Grand Theft Auto VI, but perhaps more likely is a next-gen port.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In May, <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-red-dead-redemption-2-for-nintendo-switch-2-may-arrive-this-year-1544753/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GameReactor</u></a> reported that a Nintendo Switch 2 version of Rockstar's Wild West romp was on the way, along with a "next-gen upgrade patch" that would improve the game for current-gen systems (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S). Both could be released later in 2025, according to the site.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have long called for an updated version of Red Dead Redemption 2, which is considered a masterpiece. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review"><u>IGN's Red Dead Redemption 2 review</u></a> returned a 10/10. We said: "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open-world ode to the outlaw era."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Red Dead Online fans are enjoying digging into Strange Tales of the West, which is officially described as Vol.1. This suggests another content drop is coming. Whatever the future holds, it seems Red Dead Online is back from the dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
