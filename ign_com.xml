Gameplay for this Futurama mod also feels familiar, as you run around as Fry and complete missions for characters such as Bender, Professor Farnsworth and Dr. Zoidberg. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="fr" dir="ltr">ANNONCE ðŸ“£ ðŸŽ® : La dÃ©mo de Futurama Hit &amp; Run, sera disponible le 19 octobre ! Une idÃ©e juste parfaite ! ðŸš€ <a href="https://t.co/cy8WBhoLYL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/cy8WBhoLYL</a></p>â€” Mooonaa ðŸ’• (@lycheemoona) <a href="https://twitter.com/lycheemoona/status/1979533450718716390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">There's driving too, of course â€” with Fry able to zoom around a section of New New York in a hover car. One particular mission has Fry escorting Bender back to the Planet Express headquarters while avoiding police in hover cop cars. But there's no sign yet of actual flying â€” perhaps in future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, the demo includes four story missions, plus a set of street races, vehicles, costumes and other Easter eggs to find and unlock. The demo also comes with an acknowledgement that it currently uses AI-generated dialogue as a "temporary placeholder." The mod team states: "Professional voice artists are already engaged, and their recordings will replace the placeholder content in a future update."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 25 Futurama Episodes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Response to the demo has been positive, not least from Joe McGinn, who worked on the original The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run over two decades ago. "As the lead designer of the original game, I can only say... this looks awesome!" McGinn wrote in a comment on the mod's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKPz3PE7_4s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a>. "I want to play it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/matt-selman-simpsons-hit-and-run-remake">Fans have long hoped for another Simpsons game</a>, and previously cheered on a separate unofficial Hit &amp; Run project that looked set to remake the entire title in Unreal Engine 5. Alas, that idea ran into legal issues with Disney, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/awesome-looking-the-simpsons-hit-and-run-fan-remake-is-complete-but-it-will-never-be-released">its creator has now said the finished version will never be released</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there may well be something new and official for The Simpsons fans to play in the not-too-distant future, as the franchise's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-simpsons-long-rumored-fortnite-mini-season-now-feels-imminent-as-kang-and-kodos-turn-up-in-game">long-awaited Fortnite mini-season now finally appears to be near</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
