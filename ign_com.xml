It's all very BioShock-y as everyone's favorite space bounty hunter scans stone figures and blasts new enemies on the planet Viewros using purple energy that she controls with her free hand. Little is known about this strange jungle world she's been "unexpectedly transported to," but it's clear intelligent life has surrounded the massive tree in its center for quite some time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo may be keeping tight-lipped about when Metroid Prime 4 will launch outside of the promise of its 2025 release window, but today's gameplay did reveal how some of these new abilities will work.

With today's Direct focused entirely on the current Nintendo Switch, there remain numerous questions about whether Metroid Prime 4 will receive any kind of enhanced treatment on Nintendo Switch 2. We do know, at least, that it will be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-officially-almost-fully-backward-compatible">playable across both platforms</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at today's Nintendo Switch Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
