Hangar 13 President Nick Baynes described Mafia: The Old Country as a "focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar Mafia gameplay."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: "That focus allows us to deliver a story that’s gritty, grounded, brutal and emotional. Embracing early 1900s era Sicily, this is a mafia origin story that follows our protagonist, Enzo Favara, as he takes the oath and works his way up Don Torrisi's crime family.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mafia: The Old Country May 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tellingly, 2K President David Ismailer added: "We think there’s a large audience for compelling stories that don’t require massive time commitments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re excited to offer a game like Mafia: The Old Country in our portfolio, and to provide a linear highly-polished narrative experience that can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on these comments, Mafia: The Old Country will be a relatively short affair. There is no multiplayer mode, so the story is the entire package.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps that’s why the standard edition costs $49.99 across all platforms, and the deluxe edition costs $59.99. Here’s the breakdown, per 2K:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mafia: The Old Country will offer two editions: Standard Edition and Deluxe Edition. Both editions are available for pre-order today and will release worldwide on August 8, 2025.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Standard Edition includes the full base game and will be available for $49.99 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.</li><li>The Deluxe Edition lets players descend into Sicily's criminal underworld in true Cosa Nostra style with a variety of bonus items and will be available for $59.99 on PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. This edition includes the Padrino Pack, featuring "Lupara Speciale" Shotgun, "Vendetti Speciale" Pistol, "Immortale" Charm, "Padrino" Outfit, "Stiletto Speciale" Knife, "Eckhart Speciale" Limousine and "Cosimo" Horse and Accessories. Additionally, it offers the Gatto Nero Pack with the "Bodeo Nero" Pistol, "Velocità" Charm, "Gatto Nero" Racing Outfit and "Carozella Nero" Race Car, plus digital bonus materials including the Original Score and Digital Artbook full of concept art and developer notes.</li><li>Pre-order Mafia: The Old Country Standard Edition or Deluxe Edition to receive the Soldato Pack featuring the "Soldato" Outfit, "Scannaturi Speciale" Knife, "Tesoro" Horse and Accessories and "Lupara" Charm.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-mafia-the-old-country-to-gta-6-dev-says-theyre-not-as-similar-as-youd-think">IGN interviewed Baynes and game director Alex Cox about all things Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and the prospect of running up against GTA 6. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">With GTA 6’s delay from fall 2025 to May 26, 2026</a>, that is of course no longer a concern.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the interview, the pair dismissed comparisons to GTA 6, insisting Mafia: The Old Country shouldn’t be considered an open-world game at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather, the pair insisted, Mafia: The Old Country is more like Mafia 1 and 2 than it is the open-world Mafia 3. It is a “linear, narrative-driven” game, a “focused package” that offers a “cinematic experience.” You might find yourself driving around an authentic representation of 1900s Sicily in Mafia: The Old Country, or even riding around on horseback a bit like that other Rockstar game, but the similarities to Rockstar games stop there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-restock-prismatic-evolutions-surprise-boxes-amazon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Or should you opt for buying the rare promo cards standalone?</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions</a> expansion for Scarlet &amp; Violet has been crazy popular, sending Pokémania 2025 over the edge due to tough pull rates and having few opportunities to rip the set open. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dealing with bots and scalpers is one thing, but now Amazon is at it, charging <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxZmG?object_uuid=df5b0964-4c67-4039-928b-93414a5c727f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">more than double the MSRP ($22.99) for a Surprise Box ($59.99)</a> that only has four booster packs. It might be worth it for the keen collectors among us, but let's dig into whether you should be paying this much for so little.</p><div catalogid="aa330f46-232b-48d9-aa21-2e145ab03cb4" id="220107"><div id="220107" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions Surprise Box</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes 1 of 9 randomly selected foil promo cards with a special logo. Warning: MSRP: $22.99.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, the box itself is nice, and it's cool to get stamped versions of the standard Eeveelution ex cards: Eevee ex, Vaporeon ex, Jolteon ex, Flareon ex, Espeon ex, Umbreon ex, Leafeon ex, Glaceon ex, or Sylveon ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But you also only get one per box at random, and I'm not going to give myself an anxiety attack trying to work out the odds on hunting all of these down, but that's a big bag of bones going off Amazon's pricing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is it a nice gift? Sure. Is it practical enough to buy a couple of boxes for just ripping open packs and hoping for your favorite Eeveelution? At $59.99... jeesh, maybe not.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Prismatic Evolution Stamped Surprise Box Cards</h3><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/08/umbreon-pokemon-tcg-ign-1746714881932.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Umbreon ex - 060/131 (Prismatic Evolutions Stamp)</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But still, it's been a popular pick amongst <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-8-2025">IGN's Daily Deals readers</a>, so who am I to judge? Make your own decisions when buying, just don't say I didn't warn you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, you can also consider picking up the singles you might be chasing via trusted retailers like TCGPlayer. Let's explore the top Prismatic Evolutions cards available to pick up today as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're, like me, just interested in the Suprise Box for the promo cards, it might be worth just buying the cards standlone. The most expensive <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62qDZ?object_uuid=df5b0964-4c67-4039-928b-93414a5c727f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(of course it's Umbreon)</a> is going for the same price as one of these boxes, with the rest coming in at well under $20. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for the price of two to three Suprise Boxes, you can get the complete collection. If you want to rip open packs and pull these promos yourself then go for it, but it'll cost you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Prismatic Evolution Chase Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Dropping over a grand on a Pokémon card sounds mental, but this Umbreon SIR has come down quite a bit after release. Sitting at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3q4N?object_uuid=df5b0964-4c67-4039-928b-93414a5c727f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$1100, that's a fall of around $500 and change</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the other chase cards of Prismatic Evolutions have fallen to under the $500 mark, with my favorite <a href="https://zdcs.link/916nGn?object_uuid=df5b0964-4c67-4039-928b-93414a5c727f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Roaring Moon ex SIR dropping to $221 at the time of writing</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These prices may very well fall more as the year goes on and attention shifts, but these are pretty good prices considering what the bloated Pokémon card market would have you believe just a month ago.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Pokémon TCG: Best Deals Today</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're trying to keep up with Pokémon TCG without getting ripped off or left behind, here's where to start, including the latest update on what can be bought here and now from trusted retailers in the US.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want to know more about the best single Pokémon cards out there right now?
