But one trio of monsters that fans were really hoping to see did NOT appear: the elemental monkeys Panpour, Pansage, and Pansear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why are fans so hung up on the monkey trio? It's a bit complicated. The three monkeys and their evolutions have been a part of an increasingly shrinking list of Pokémon that are currently unavailable in any Nintendo Switch game. If you want to truly catch 'em all, you still can, by transferring them from other Pokémon games pre-Switch to Pokémon Home. But at the moment, the following Pokémon are unavailable for capture natively in any Nintendo Switch Pokémon game:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Panpour</li><li>Pansage</li><li>Pansear</li><li>Simipour</li><li>Simisage</li><li>Simisear</li><li>Patrat</li><li>Watchog</li><li>Furfrou</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">This list used to be much longer, but Game Freak added a ton of new Pokémon in the DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that culled the list down to these nine. What's more, the trailer we saw yesterday showed both Patrat and Furfrou, confirming these two at least will be available in Legends: Arceus. And since Watchog evolves from Patrat, it's a safe bet it will be in the game too. So that just leaves the three monkeys.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The elemental monkey trio was first introduced in Pokémon Black and White, and are somewhat beloved by fans due to the unique way the player obtains them. In Black and White, the first Gym the player encounters will use a typing that the player's starter Pokémon is weak against. However, if the player visits a certain person in the Dreamyard, they'll receive the monkey that has an advantage against that Gym, making it easier to tackle. Their designs are also memorable for being based on the "Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil" wise monkeys of Japanese folklore.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/28/pokmon-legends-z-a-releases-in-late-2025-3-1740761188956.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Furfrou lets out a lakeside howl in Pokemon Legends Z-A.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Realistically, the odds of the monkey trio showing up in Legends: Z-A are actually pretty good. It would be very surprising for Game Freak to leave them out of what could possibly be the last major Pokémon game on Nintendo Switch, and given that they appeared in the Kalos region PokéDex back in the day, it only makes sense for them to still be there in Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if the monkeys are included, there's still one other problem Game Freak needs to solve: Spinda. Spinda is catchable on Nintendo Switch in Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl, but due to an error in how the game reads its spot patterns, it cannot be transferred to Pokémon Home. You can still get a Spinda from pre-Switch games transferred to Home, but the weird stuck nature of Spindas on Switch means that the dizzy little bear could probably use a functional Z-A appearance too, if Game Freak feels amenable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-trailer-reveals-rooftop-running-gameplay-and-late-2025-release-window">first real look at Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> gave us a lot to take in, and we're still dissecting the footage to find all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-frantically-trying-to-work-out-how-pokemon-legends-z-a-connects-to-other-pokemon-games">connections between this and other, past Pokémon games</a>.

But it also outlined several awaited features it’ll bring:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Update 7.0:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>One Chapter Pack</li><li>One Champion Pack</li><li>Private PvP lobbies</li><li>A new weapon (only in PvE for now)</li><li>New Operation</li><li>Weapon perks rebalance</li><li>Class weapon loadouts rework</li><li>PvE Prestige Rank</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The PvE Prestige Rank is perhaps of most interest to veteran players of Space Marine 2 looking for a new challenge or goal to work towards. Here’s how it works: once you reach level 25 on a class, you can buy a Prestige Level that will unlock a unique Prestige Perk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Choose them wisely,” Focus and Saber said, “because you won’t be able to change your selected Prestige Perks before unlocking the four Prestige Levels.” On top of that power boost, each class will have a unique cosmetic reward that emphasizes the class’ iconic armour part.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 will get Public Test Servers (PTS) on Steam only in March before Patch 7 comes out. This will give fans early access to the upcoming features and the chance to share feedback so the developers can refine the content ahead of launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Focus and Saber teased the upcoming launch of Horde mode, a feature Space Marine 2 players have been looking forward to ever since the game came out last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’re very eager to get more info on the Horde Mode, it’s one of our top priorities right now,” Focus and Saber said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One thing we can say is that it will be very different from the Space Marine 1 Horde Mode, and that there are surprises we can’t wait for you to find out about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once we get really interesting things to show you about it, we will do it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bear with us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same post, Focus and Saber also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-stamps-out-live-service-game-talk-amid-backlash-to-fomo-community-events">stamped out live service game talk amid a backlash to 'FOMO' Community Events</a>.
