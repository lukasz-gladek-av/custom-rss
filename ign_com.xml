            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Robo-Link, activate?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Nintendo Partner Direct, we got a new trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. While most of the trailer was straightforward, it ended on a cryptic tease that has Zelda fans running with speculation as to what the scene could mean for the game's roster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end of the trailer shows a chamber deep inside a cavern where what appears to be one of the Constructs from Tears of the Kingdom is being assembled and activated. The Constructs themselves are nothing new - they're all over the place in Tears of the Kingdom, and we know they were created by Mineru during the events of Age of Imprisonment, so it makes sense we'd see them in the game. What's interesting about this one is that it appears to be roughly human-shaped and -sized, whereas none of the Constructs we've met before (including Mineru's own Construct) were quite that proportioned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why are fans excited about this? Well, a lot of folks think this means <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeLink/comments/1me38a5/how_are_we_feeling_about_construct_link_x_zelda/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we're getting some sort of Robo-Link playable in Age of Imprisonment</a>. The game takes place in the far, far distant past, thousands of years before the main events of Tears of the Kingdom, and in the time period that Zelda is transported to at the start of that game. It covers the events of the Imprisoning War as Zelda experienced it during her time in that era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As such, chronologically, it doesn't make any sense that Link would be playable in Age of Imprisonment. There was no Link in that era, after all. That said, it also seems baffling that a Legend of Zelda game, even a spin-off, could exist without Link involved. This is why a lot of fans have been speculating that Link will find some way to turn up, whether that's through alternate timeline shenanigans (see: Age of Calamity) or some other method. And this teaser offers one possibility for this hoped-for Linkening: maybe Link somehow gets to embody one of Mineru's constructs made in his likeness, so he can fight alongside the others of that era.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">nintendo you know i dont play about fi please dont play with me <a href="https://t.co/Uj0QOJQ9aj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Uj0QOJQ9aj</a></p>— ava (@zeldevil) <a href="https://twitter.com/zeldevil/status/1950913028670787672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That said, there's one other detail that has fans thinking this is going in a different direction. If you listen back to the ending teaser, there's a bit of music that plays as the scene transitions to the Construct. If you're a Skyward Sword fan, you'll recognize it as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV1Efuh-aus" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fi's Theme</a>. The presence of this little chime has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1me1h85/aoi_new_age_of_imprisonment_trailer_in_nintendo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some suspecting that this won't be a Robo Link</a>, but actually a way for Fi to finally reappear in a Zelda game after being (understandably) absent for so long. Some are suggesting this could be possible given that Zelda obtains the broken Master Sword at the start of her time in the ancient era. Given that Fi dwells within the sword, what if they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1me2vii/totk_rise_up_because_we_are_so_back/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">used its fragments to give her a body to fight with</a>? Anything's possible!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that means it's also possible this thing is none of the above and we're in for some sort of weird twist surprise when the game comes out. Age of Calamity, after all, wasn't quiiiite what we thought it was by the endgame, so it's likely Age of Imprisonment also has some tricks up its sleeve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We unfortunately still don't have a firm release date for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment but know it's coming to Nintendo Switch 2 sometime this winter. You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at today's Nintendo Partner Direct right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase might have featured a new Plants vs Zombies remake, Monster Hunter Stories 3 and a pair of new Square Enix HD-2D titles, but there was one game conspicuous by its absence. Again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> fans tuning in were left disappointed by yet another video game showcase passing with no further word of Team Cherry's highly-anticipated, long-awaited sequel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And to be fair to the fans, there was cause to think today might finally bring Silksong's much-desired release date. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window">Nintendo Direct earlier this year confirmed the game would arrive in 2025</a>, raising hopes of a fresh appearance today. And, just days ago, Microsoft announced that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-a-new-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-playable-at-gamescom">Silksong will be playable via a fresh Xbox demo</a> in a couple of weeks at Gamescom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid this backdrop, hopes were high — but, as we now know, they were in vain. Reaction to the Nintendo Direct on the Hollow Knight and Silksong subreddits has, perhaps to be expected, not been positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The top thread currently on the Silksong <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1me1j9k/aaahahahahahahah/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> is a meme of a cat laughing open-mouthed, pointing at the screen. "It's never been so over", "The cycle of pain", "Silksong isn't real" read a selection of the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've genuinely lost so much hype for this game," wrote reddit user YeetHead10. "I was so excited last year but now I've just moved on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"No you havent," replied DirtySlutMuffin. "You're here complaining."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"At least this is consistent in my life," CringeNaeNaeBaby2 said, referring to the constant disappointment around Silksong they faced. "You know when they go to jail, spend years trying to get out, then beg to be readmitted after being freed? I'm gonna beg for Silksong to be unreleased. I need the longing, the spite keeps me alive. I'm gonna drop dead when Silksong comes out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans simply seem upset at their own frustration, though a few have suggested Silksong developer Team Cherry should be doing more to set expecations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I feel like people would be taking it better if Team Cherry themselves gave more frequent updates," wrote reddit user ChocoGoodness, "instead of letting us wait for Nintendo or Xbox or whatever to announce it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, all we know of Silksong's arrival is that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-responds-to-release-date-confusion-promises-launch-before-holiday-not-tied-to-xbox-handheld-arrival">will launch before Christmas 2025, and not be tied to the release of the ROG Ally X handheld</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For everything that <em>was </em>shown today, here's our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">roundup of the Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase presentation in full</a>.
