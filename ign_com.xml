The game launched in September with an Ultramarines Champion skin for the Heavy class, and this week’s game-changing Patch 5 added the Dark Angels Champion skin for the Bulwark class.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Patch 5 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, based on fresh datamines, that cadence looks set to continue with each season up to Season 9.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Warhammer 40,000 spoilers for upcoming cosmetics follows!</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1hc0fw6/upcoming_seasons_leaked/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor agentduckman12</a> uncovered information revealing the cosmetic DLC, reproduced below.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Season 3: Raven Guard</li><li>Season 4: Salamander</li><li>Season 5: Space Wolves</li><li>Season 6: Chaos Pack</li><li>Season 7: Imperial Fist</li><li>Season 8: White Scars</li><li>Season 9: Blood Angels</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">What fans don’t know yet is which class is set for each Chapter Champion skin, although agentduckman12 also leaked a Salamander Sniper Champion Pack skin render, below, so we know the Sniper class is set for a Salamander Champion skin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Assault, Tactical, and Vanguard are classes are therefore still up for grabs. Obviously there are enough Chapters here for each class to get more than one Champion skin, unless Saber plans to release new classes in the future of course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only other question is when these seasons will roll out. If we’re looking at year one including four seasons, then we could be waiting until 2026 for Season 9 and the Blood Angels skin. IGN has asked Focus Entertainment for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of unannounced DLC, IGN has reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-discover-unannounced-research-centre-which-houses-all-sorts-of-unreleased-secrets">the availability in-game of what looks like a Battle Barge expansion set to hit Space Marine 2 with Season 3</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The confirmation comes <a href="https://assettocorsa.gg/open-world-map-coming-in-summer-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via Kunos' official website</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Kunos, the map will make its way into Assetto Corsa EVO in mid-2025, at an unspecified point during summer in the Northern Hemisphere. The open world will be released in stages, and will eventually cover 1600 square kilometers. New features and content will be added as the map expands. Kunos explains the map is fully laser-scanned, and will boast "unmatched detail."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Local businesses based around the Nürburgring are also set to feature, so players will be able to rent cars and upgrade and customise their vehicles at actual outets. As part of today's news, Kunos has opened an invitation to all local businesses in the vicinity of the Nürburgring to contact the studio for the opportunity to be featured in Assetto Corsa EVO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assetto Corsa EVO will initially become available on PC in Early Access from January 16, 2025. Console versions are also expected eventually, but not until the game exits its Early Access period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

It’s acknowledgement of what could be a bombshell moment for entertainment fans everywhere, but until a deal is finalized, it is probably best to keep expectations for a potential buyout at a minimum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is true that we have made an initial statement of intent,” Sony said regarding its interest in Kadokawa (translated via DeepL). “We would appreciate it if you would allow us to refrain from further comment.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/14/elden-ring-story-trailer-1647298141811.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sony confirms interest in aquiring FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/report-sony-in-talks-to-buy-kadokawa-owner-of-elden-ring-and-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware"><u>Rumors that Sony may soon acquire Kadokawa</u></a> first emerged from a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reuters</u></a> report last month. It stated that talks between the two companies were ongoing, with one of its sources adding that, should negotiations proceed in a positive direction, a deal could be signed soon. Today’s confirmation from Sony suggests that talks remain active, though it’s unclear where things sit now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa oversees a number of entities that could no doubt benefit Sony in the long run. One that many gaming fans have their eye on is FromSoftware, which helped launch gaming into the 2010s with its critically acclaimed Dark Souls series. The developer also found tremendous success with 2022’s George R. R. Martin collaboration project, Elden Ring, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-of-the-erdtree-the-first-and-last-elden-ring-dlc-fromsoftware-boss-hidetaka-miyazaki-confirms">its follow-up DLC</a>, Shadow of the Erdtree, launching earlier this year. Kadokawa also owns other gaming studios such as Spike Chunsoft (Danganronpa), Acquire (Octopath Traveler), Gotcha Gotcha Games (RPG Maker), and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some experts believe that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-may-find-it-hard-to-buy-all-of-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-financial-report-claims"><u>bringing the media company under Sony’s wing may prove to be difficult</u></a>, Ampere Analysis research director Piers Harding-Rolls previously explained to IGN that news of the company’s interest shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. It already owns about 14% of FromSoftware thanks to a deal made in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At the time, Sony mentioned a broader interest in cross-media development of anime and games IP to support its other media businesses,” Harding-Rolls said. “So, in that sense any deal for the parent company Kadokawa, which also operates extensively in manga and anime, is a natural extension of this earlier deal. These other areas align nicely with Sony’s anime businesses.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no telling when or if the deal will proceed for now.
