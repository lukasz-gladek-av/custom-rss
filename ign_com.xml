The only way to have a chance at getting either is by requesting an invite to purchase on each collection's product page.</p><div id="219954" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="e7a2ca72-8b53-4acf-aa19-29433e5325a0"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Prismatic Evolutions Accessory Pouch Special Collection</h3></p></div><div catalogid="e7a2ca72-8b53-4acf-aa19-29433e5325a0" id="219955"><div id="219955" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Blooming Waters Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After doing this ourselves, we got an email notification for both right away stating that the invitation requests were received. If you end up being picked within the next 12 months to purchase either collection, you will then be emailed a link that's valid for 72 hours, of which you can use to buy your new cards and accessories. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Within those 12 months, you won't need to request an invite again whenever Amazon UK makes any restocks, as yours will still be connected to each collection's product page. Essentially, it's a lottery where a decent amount of luck is required in order to grab one for yourself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In return, however, you'll have the chance to buy a collection that's actually at a fair price compared to the higher prices for Prismatic Evolutions and 151 collectors have been having to deal with over the recent months, in light of their low supply vs demand. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Prismatic Evolutions Accessory Pouch Special Collection includes both five booster packs and an Eevee accessory pouch for just £29.99. With Amazon's current price of £16.49 for just <a href="https://zdcs.link/QV7pMN?object_uuid=aa77d810-c462-43ff-91c0-654a1d35db2b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one Prismastic Evolutions booster</a> — on open, no-invite-required listings — you would need to pay £82.45 for five packs individually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same goes for the 151 Blooming Waters Collection. Charging you £79.99, you'll get 12 booster packs, individual foil cards; Squirtle, Bulbasaur, Blastoise ex, and Venusaur ex; and an oversized Blastoise ex card for display as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even when only taking the packs into account, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3w2g?object_uuid=aa77d810-c462-43ff-91c0-654a1d35db2b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">individual boosters for 151</a> cost a massive £19.49 at Amazon UK — meaning you would have to put up £233.88 just to buy 12 without getting an invite. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon TCG's major supply issues around sets like 151 and Prismatic Evolutions don't seem like they'll be letting up anytime soon. With that, keeping an eye out for invitation listings like these is one of the best ways to get new cards from them without needing to refresh retailer pages 24 hours a day, or applying for a bank loan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With other new sets like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025">Destined Rivals</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-booster-bundle-in-stock-for-just-39">Journey Together</a> selling out almost instantly to scalpers as soon as they're in stock, we wouldn't be surprised if other retailers didn't start applying an invite system as well, to give everyone a fair chance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-2025-at-an-australian-museum<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN can reveal the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will be playable in an Australian museum in September 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Cherry’s long in development game is one of the most anticipated in the world, and has topped the Steam wishlist chart for years. The studio, which is based in Adelaide, South Australia, has yet to say when Silksong will be released beyond a vague 2025 window, but we at least know it will be playable for those who can be at Australia’s national museum of screen culture, ACMI, from September 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silksong will be playable at the Melbourne museum as part of a video game exhibition called <a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/game-worlds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Worlds</a>, which will also include displays that delve into the game’s design and artistic direction.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">ACMI co-curators Bethan Johnson and Jini Maxwell commented: “Since Hollow Knight: Silksong's initial announcement in 2019, it has been one of the most anticipated indie games on the planet – and we are thrilled to celebrate the design of this South Australian-made game as a centrepiece of Game Worlds in September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From the hundreds of sprites that animate Hornet’s different movements and attacks, to the logic behind the game’s most challenging boss fights – and of course, having the game playable in-gallery – our Silksong displays delve deeply into the details of the game's artistic direction and design. We’re so grateful to Team Cherry for trusting us with their work, and so excited to share that work with you!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the announcement, ACMI shared a sprite sheet from Silksong, below, one of several design elements from the game that will be on display in the Game Worlds exhibition. The image was provided to IGN with permission.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/01/hornet-sprite-sheet-from-hollow-knight-silksong-courtesy-of-team-cherry-1746102656959.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hopefully not long now until release.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Hollow Knight fans will be wondering what this all means for Silksong’s actual release date. You’d imagine it will come out before September 18, if it’s going to be playable from then at a museum. Perhaps we’re looking at an August launch?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the case, things are certainly ramping up in the world of Hollow Knight. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window">Silksong made a brief appearance at Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct last month</a>, and soon after Team Cherry nailed down the 2025 release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game showed up for the hardware-focused presentation in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment that included little more than a few seconds of new gameplay and confirmation of Team Cherry’s updated launch plans. It was the most meaningful update on Silksong in years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally confirmed for just Nintendo Switch and PC, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-trailer"><u>Xbox (and Game Pass)</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-ps4-and-ps5"><u>PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</u></a> versions being added later, Silksong has been at the center of a number of bizarre teases over the years. Team Cherry kicked off 2025 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake"><u>a mysterious tease related to a chocolate cake recipe</u></a>, leading desperate fans to hope that a re-reveal would arrive in April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
