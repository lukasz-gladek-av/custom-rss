As a result, PC gamers in over 100 countries won’t be able to buy the game on Steam because Sony does not operate PlayStation accounts in those markets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PSN is available in just 73 countries, leaving many out in the cold. The Baltics, including states that are part of the European Union (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), and the vast majority of countries in Africa are also excluded. For years, some players in these countries have created a PSN in a supported region to get around the restrictions, but there are concerns that Sony could ban the accounts of those who do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s PC push has been controversial to say the least, with most of its games suffering negative Steam reviews as a result of the PSN requirement regardless of whether the games themselves are great or run well. In September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnark-launches-to-mixed-steam-user-reviews-with-most-complaining-about-the-playstation-network-account-requirement"><u>God of War Ragnarök</u> met with a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam following its PC launch</a>, with most of the complaints revolving around the PSN requirement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-mod-removes-controversial-psn-requirement-and-its-creator-has-vowed-to-maintain-it">One disgruntled fan even created a <u>God of War Ragnarök</u> mod that removed the requirement</a>, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nexus-mods-says-creator-of-god-of-war-ragnarok-psn-bypass-mod-has-pulled-it-offline">it was pulled down out of fear of reprisal from Sony</a>. Exacerbating the backlash is that Sony has doubled down on this policy even for single-player games, such as God of War Ragnarök, Until Dawn, and now The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s PSN account requirement for its PC games was thrust into the limelight with the release of Arrowhead’s explosive PC and PS5 co-op shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> earlier in 2024. Helldivers 2 suffered a review bomb campaign on Steam after Sony made PSN accounts mandatory for PC gamers on Valve’s platform (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-psn-review-bomb-cape-mia-as-arrowhead-awaits-clarity-on-game-being-sold-in-more-countries"><u>Arrowhead subsequently decided to turn the user review history graph into a cape, which is ready for launch but has yet to release</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reverses-course-on-helldivers-2-psn-account-requirement"><u>Sony eventually backed down and reversed Helldivers 2’s PSN account requirement</u></a>, but the game remains unavailable in the many countries that lack PSN. And indeed all Sony’s games on PC now suffer from this problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it announced the PSN requirement for Helldivers 2, Sony said it had to do with player security. “Account linking plays a critical role in protecting our players and upholding the values of safety and security provided on PlayStation and PlayStation Studios games,” Sony said in a statement issued at the time. “This is our main way to protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling the banning of players that engage in that type of behavior. It also allows those players that have been banned the right to appeal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps bracing itself for a backlash it knew was to come, Sony added: “We understand that while this may be an inconvenience to some of you, this step will help us to continue to build a community that you are all proud to be a part of. “Many thanks for your continued support of Helldivers 2!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered likely faces a similar backlash on launch that Sony’s other PC games have seen, despite the Steam warning months in advance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sleeping-dogs-movie-not-happening-anymore-donnie-yen-confirms<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Let sleeping dogs lie.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes everyone already knows what happened to a project, we just need someone to confirm it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2017 it was announced that there would be a live-action adaptation of the open-world crime game, Sleeping Dogs, starring Donnie Yen, who was riding high on the success of movies like Ip Man and Rogue One. Director Timo Tjahjanto was also approached to <a href="https://x.com/Timobros/status/1837930312476885040" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">direct</a>, giving this project a real pedigree for anyone who loves hardcore Asian action films.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, since about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/05/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-confirms-its-still-in-production">2018 </a>almost any mention of this movie disappeared. And now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon </a>confirmed with Yen that this movie is no longer in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights," Yen tells Polygon. "I waited for years. years. And I really wanted to do it... And unfortunately... I don't know, you know how Hollywood goes, right?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yen calls it an "unfortunate thing," but says he's ready to move "on to better things."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sleeping Dogs was released back in 2012 and was developed by the now defunct United Front Games and published by Square Enix. The open world action game was effectively Grand Theft Auto in Hong Kong, with plenty of influences from Hong Kong crime cinema like Infernal Affairs and Hard Boiled. Starring undercover cop Wei Shen as he infiltrated the local Triad, Sleeping Dogs became something of a cult hit thanks to its mix of action, world design, and star-studded voice cast (including Emma Stone and Lucy Liu). The Definitive Edition received an 8.5 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/08/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-review">review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately a sequel and planned spinoff, Triad Wars, never entered into production before United Front shut down, and now the movie adaptation joins the dormant game series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luckily for fans of Yen, he's been keeping himself quite busy both at home and abroad. Alongside the action movie The Prosecutor, Yen was last seen stateside as the blind assassin Caine in John Wick: Chapter 4, and according to <a href="https://collider.com/john-wick-spinoff-donnie-yen-directing-caine/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>, is in talks to star and direct a<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-wick-spinoff-film-centered-on-donnie-yens-caine-officially-in-the-works"> Caine spinoff movie.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
