            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Overnight, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio director and executive producer Masayoshi Yokoyama introduced RGG Direct 2025, a livestream chiefly dedicated to a remake of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-seemingly-on-the-way-after-fans-spot-alleged-rgg-website-leak">previously leaked</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3,</a> which will be released alongside the spin-off game, Dark Ties.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza 3 was released in 2009 ‚Äî that's over 15(!) years ago now ‚Äî and Yokoyama said this remake "is the best iteration of the original game, Yakuza Kiwami 3." Dark Ties, however, is a "new, never-before-seen story," which means this essentially bundles two games in one package.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Like a Dragon &amp; Yakuza series will celebrate its 20th anniversary on December 8 of this year," the team said. "We sincerely appreciate your continued support of RGG Studio."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/screenshot-2025-09-24-at-11-18-48-1758709258747.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're developing [Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties] based on the concept 'a legend is reborn and a new legacy begins,'" Yokoyama added, after which chief producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto said that both Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2 "directly link to this title." Producer/director Ryosuke Horii introduced details about the upcoming game, which is out in February 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Kiwami 3] is a total remake of 2009's Yakuza 3," he explained. "We've rebuilt it from the ground up using the latest technology developed by our talented staff. The game has evolved enormously with loads of new cutscenes and newly added game elements. I can proudly say that we're delivering a game worthy of the Kiwami title."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We had a good time with the original, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/03/09/yakuza-3-review"><u>awarding it 8.5/10 back in 2010</u></a>, but while the remake follows Yakuza 3's story, RGG has added cutscenes "that we weren't able to fully deliver before."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Whether it's Kiryu and his pal Rikiya Shimabukuro, or enemies like Mine, Kanda, and Hamazaki, we've further detailed their thoughts and actions to better depict the human condition and connection," Horii added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additional scenes are not the only new things coming to the game, either. Players can expect re-recorded voice lines as well as brand new ones, and "overhauled" animations, with some scenes "changed drastically with different developments and outcomes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In order to greatly outdo ourselves and make a game that everyone will love, we didn't take the safe, defensive route by glorifying the past with a simple remake, but instead took a more aggressive approach to make Yakuza Kiwami 3," Horii said.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">üêâA LEGEND IS REBORN AND A NEW LEGACY BEGINSüêâ<br>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties releases Feb 12, 2026 on PlayStation¬Æ5, PlayStation¬Æ4, Nintendo Switch‚Ñ¢ 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (Steam).<br>üëâDigital pre-orders now live (link in bio)!

It's a story of the "gritty reality of human relationships in the criminal underworld," with a "refined but cool" combat style centered around boxing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties are out on February 12, 2026.
