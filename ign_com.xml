It’s also causing some big changes to card value as players rush to upgrade its precons, particularly the Blight Curse one.

It’s not exactly Sonic the Hedgehog, Tomb Raider, or any of the other games the studio is known for getting involved in, but it’s still something it’s (mostly) serious about.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re thrilled to bring STEAL A BRAINROT to the big screen,” Story Kitchen co-founders Dmitri M. Johnson and Michael Lawrence Goldberg said in a statement. “Noobini Pizzanini 6-7.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deadline says the Steal a Brainrot movie will blend all of the “chaos, comedy, and competitive mischief” that has attracted the 56.6 billion visits the Roblox experience has achieved. Fans have turned up every day since May to buy "Brainrots," which are essentially meme versions of collectible monsters not unlike Pokémon. Some Brainrots are rarer than others, with players able to generate money, sell Brainrots, and, of course, steal them from other players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around 400,000 users are active in Steal a Brainrot as of this piece’s publication, with the all-time peak it reached in October being a whopping 25.8 million concurrent players. Even if you’ve never played Roblox, there’s a decent chance you’ve heard about this particular experience, as multi-instrumentalist and Uptown Funk mastermind Bruno Mars helped put together <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/steal-a-brainrot/Bruno_Mars_Concert"><u>an exclusive concert for Steal a Brainrot earlier this month</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Story Kitchen is bringing Steal a Brainrot to moviegoers at an unspecified point in the future. The project is in development alongside Do Big Studios and Spyder Games, and it’s led by Johnson, Goldberg, Timothy I. Stevenson, and Elena Sandoval. Think Influence, which represents the creators of the experience, is also involved in the production.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The company has shown interest in the Roblox community before, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announcing</u></a> in November 2025 that it had started putting the pieces together for a movie based on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grow-a-garden-roblox"><u>Grow a Garden</u></a>.
