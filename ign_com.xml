            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy has told staff a redundancy process has begun amid the disastrous launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a>. The cuts could affect over 100 employees, studio sources have told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One person, who asked to remain anonymous in order to protect their career, told IGN there’s no word yet on exactly how many staff are affected, but the standard 45-day consultation process starts today, June 23, which according to UK law is triggered when an employer proposes 100 or more redundancies within a 90-day period. IGN understands Build A Rocket Boy currently has around 300 UK employees, with around 200 abroad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Build A Rocket Boy for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Staff now face an anxious wait to find out whether they will be affected. Meanwhile, there are serious questions over whether Build A Rocket Boy will be able to fulfill its post-launch roadmap for content, including the promised multiplayer mode, on time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-heartbroken-amid-troubled-launch-as-players-report-success-with-refunds-and-sponsored-streams-are-canceled-last-minute"><u>Build A Rocket Boy said it was “heartbroken” over the issues players had faced with the recently released game</u></a>, and promised to issue a series of patches to fix the significant performance problems, glitches, and AI behavior issues. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-releases-performance-improvement-hotfix-as-first-in-series-of-emergency-patches-designed-to-address-disastrous-launch">Rollout of these patches has begun</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, MindsEye’s troubled launch saw the developer cancel sponsored streams, and reports of players securing refunds, even from the normally stubborn Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, which does not paint the whole picture of MindsEye’s current popularity, the game hit a peak concurrent player count of 3,302 on launch, but had a 24-hour peak of just 130 players. At the time of this article’s publication, 52 people were playing on Steam, with a mostly negative’ user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye was initially a part of Everywhere, the ‘Roblox for adults’ game creation platform led by former Grand Theft Auto design chief Leslie Benzies. Build A Rocket Boy, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, eventually switched to focus on MindsEye, its story-driven action adventure game, but it has so-far failed to do the business for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an email to staff reviewed by IGN, co-CEO Mark Gerhard insisted the studio remained committed to MindsEye, but pointed to a shift from an intense development and launch phase to a sustainable post-launch support phase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gerhard had hit the headlines ahead of MindsEye's launch for claiming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments">there was a "concerted effort" by some to "trash the game and the studio,"</a> suggesting people were being paid or using spam bots to post negative comments.
