            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Coming September 4, whatever it is.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> developer CD Projekt has issued a bizarre in-universe tease — with a date set for September 4, later this week. The message has since prompted an array of fan theories — and debates over the franchise's canon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This afternoon, a message for New United States of America (N.U.S.A.) citizens posted by President Rosalind Myers appeared on the game's social media channels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dated September 4, 2025, three days from now, the post asks for "brave netruners" to help defend the N.U.S.A. from a "mounting cybersecurity threat" by taking some kind of recruitment test. What exactly this all means, however, has left fans uncertain. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, some fans are wondering whether the message — which of course in reality has come from CD Projekt Red — has gone live several days early, and whether it was meant to point to some kind of early sign-up for information on Cyberpunk 2. Or maybe the message is appearing now to trail something happening on September 4, and this is the start of some kind of ARG?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's the fact that, well, this is an in-universe message from President Rosalind Myers — who doesn't become president until 2065. (As Cyberpunk fans have quickly pointed out, the current president should be Elizabeth Kress.) Has Myers figured out how to send a message back in time? Is this a retconning of the franchise's established lore? Or is this simply just a fun message from CD Projekt that fans shouldn't be reading this much into? Well, if it's the latter, it's already too late.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on the Cyberpunk <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1n5plxz/important_message_for_nusa_citizens_from/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, fan speculation on what to expect later this week ranges from details of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077-codename-orion">Cyberpunk 2</a>, more information on the already-announced Cyberpunk 2077 iPhone port, fresh news on the new anime spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2">Edgerunners 2</a>, or yet more content for Cyberpunk 2077 — which is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/despite-laying-off-270-staff-development-studio-virtuos-remains-fully-committed-to-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-cyberpunk-2077-and-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">still being worked on by support studio Virtuos</a>, even as the bulk of CD Projekt knuckles down on The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk's sequel.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Important message for N.U.S.A. Citizens from President Rosalind Myers. <a href="https://t.co/GOHC5Tw136" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GOHC5Tw136</a></p>— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1962516349730566299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Here is today's mysterious statement from President Rosalind Myers in full: </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Message for N.U.S.A. Citizens September 4, 2025</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Our great nation is once again facing a mounting cybersecurity threat — from those who hide in the shadows, too cowardly to publicly proclaim their beliefs, who are viciously determined to tear down our flag and the values it upholds. I will not accept this, and I know you won't either. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The N.U.S.A. is seeking brave netrunners to join our efforts and overcome this grave threat. Our brave agents work tirelessly to keep our country secure, maintain its dominance, and defend it from those so eager to undermine it. Now you can join us in our fight for freedom. I personally welcome all who believe they have what it takes. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Take our recruitment test. Prove yourself. Serve the N.U.S.A. </strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have pointed to the fact that Cyberpunk 2's associate game director Paweł Sasko has also shared the post, suggesting this has indeed gone live at the right time and is pointing to something to do with the game series itself. Others have also noted that Cyberpunk 2077 is, somehow, already approaching its fifth anniversary in December — a milestone CD Projekt may now be planning to celebrate in some fashion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Contacted for more detail by IGN this afternoon, CD Projekt declined to comment on what might be in store. Here's hoping later this week brings more answers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

As it happens, yes. Living Energy is all about building up energy counters to roll out copies of creatures and trigger other effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some decently priced cards, too, like Stridehangar Automaton, Lightning Greaves, and Panharmonicon for around $6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eternal Might is perhaps more fun, though, just because it’s all about zombies. It’s still going for $50-$60 on its own, and is all about making an army of the undead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Card value-wise it’s no slouch, either. The Scarab God is a $9 card, Renewed Solidarity would cost you $8, and Bontu’s Monument isn’t far behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's not the only big MTG deal available during the Labor Day sales right now.</p></div><div catalogid="a14fe182-2495-4e51-b750-54b3bf633d12" id="226460"><div id="226460" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy - Commander Deck Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally (<em>heh</em>), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-precons-bundle-discount-amazon-new"><u>we’ve been watching the price of the Final Fantasy Commander bundle over the last few weeks</u></a>, and it’s just hit $175.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given you’d have paid not far off that for a single deck not that long ago, you’re now essentially getting each for under MSRP at under $44 each. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's a huge bargain, and well worth picking up as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.

"The action includes everything from high-speed car chases to on-foot stealth sequences and shootouts. Stay tuned after the playthrough for insights from IO Interactive on the intense espionage gameplay."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1962500749033623681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation made no mention of any other game set to be showcased in the upcoming State of Play, so it's worth lowering your expectations for more from the upcoming Ghost of Yōtei, or anything else from Sony's first-party studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-series-is-definitely-not-done-insists-io-interactive-ceo">the Hitman series is "definitely not done,"</a> IO Interactive is now aiming to develop <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy">a new trilogy of Bond games</a> featuring a fresh-faced take on the iconic character. First Light is the first chapter of this story, and will showcase an origin tale for an all-new original Bond incarnation unrelated to any specific book or film incarnation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Previously, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak explained how the studio would be keeping costs managable over the course of the Bond trilogy by building on each game in sequence, without unecessary expense — such as by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/io-interactives-secret-to-developing-james-bond-007-first-light-is-literally-down-the-pan">not producing multiple new toilets</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A previous look at the game, during a PlayStation State of Play broadcast back in June, left fans certain that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-bond-fans-think-theyve-worked-out-secret-identity-of-007-first-light-actor">Dexter: Original Sin star Patrick Gibson was the behind the new Bond</a>. Here's hoping IO Interactive finally gets around to acknowledging that this week, and maybe also a final release date for the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of now, 007 First Light is set to arrive sometime in 2026, for Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Stand by for more.
