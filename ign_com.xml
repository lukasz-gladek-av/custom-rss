Recently filed records related to the suit, which involved the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aspyr-says-kotor-2-switch-dlc-was-canceled-because-a-third-party-objected"><u>cancelation of the Restored Content Modification (RCM) for the Nintendo Switch KOTOR 2 re-release</u></a>, appear to contain both updates for the KOTOR remake as well as mentions of a mysterious project known as “Juliet.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">11 Goofiest Silliest Weirdest Dumbest Star Wars Video Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Attorney Ray Kim prodded for details about what Project Juliet was during the deposition of Lucasfilm Games vice president Douglas Reilly. The Star Wars company VP’s response left little room for ambiguity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Juliet was the code name for a project where we were going to do a full remake of KOTOR II with modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general—the general content of KOTOR II, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kind of things,” Reilly said. “It was something we were discussing with Aspyr.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for that long-lost cut KOTOR 2 content, Reilly clarified that “the plan was we would remake the content that was in the RCM as it relates to Star Wars in that Juliet project.” Whether or not a KOTOR 2 remake remains in development is hazy for now, with Reilly’s last update saying Juliet was “technically on the roadmap” as of March 2025. Should Saber continue development, it seems the plan is for a reimagined version of the entire experience, even the RCM content, to be included in the final build.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many other details on the supposed KOTOR 2 remake remain a mystery, but the good news is that Reilly says “we’re starting with the remake of KOTOR 1,” clarifying that “Aspyr isn’t working on those games.” Instead, the KOTOR remake is said to now be in the hands of the team behind Hellraiser: Revival at Mad Head Games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s yet another update on a remake of a classic Star Wars video game that was first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kotor-aspyr-remaster-playstation-showcase-announcement-news"><u>announced all the way back in 2021</u></a>.

No details have yet emerged as to what the new studio will work on, or if any other former Perfect Dark employees joined them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked, a 2K spokesperson provided the following confirmation of the hire:</p><blockquote>With a combined six decades of AAA game-making experience across franchises like Tomb Raider, Call of Duty, Destiny, Marvel’s Spider-Man, Hitman, Deus Ex, and more, we’re thrilled to confirm Darrell Gallagher and Brian Horton have joined 2K for their next all-new venture. We don’t have additional details to share at this time, but look forward to sharing updates on their work in the future.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes after the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">cancelation of Perfect Dark</a> by Xbox earlier this year as part of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">larger wave of devastating layoffs</a>. The project had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-years-away">previously been a troubled one</a>, with multiple studios being brought into help and a number of internal revisions as studio leads tried to figure out what the game should be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While The Initiative was closed down upon the game's cancelation, Crystal Dynamics had also been working on the project. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Per Schreier's reporting</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-was-nearly-saved-by-take-two-but-the-deal-fell-through">corroborated by IGN's own sources</a>, leadership from both studio sides of the project spent two months after its cancelation shopping it around to publishers in an effort to save it.
