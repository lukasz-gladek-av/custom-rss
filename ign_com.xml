            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/empire-of-the-ants-single-player-campaign-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This is not the anthill to die on.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be nice to look at, but Empire of the Ants’s single-player campaign is outright terrible and dull. It’s around 12 hours worth of missions that pivot between being pointlessly easy – due to a passive enemy AI that doesn’t even know how to use powers to buff its troops, which is crucial to success – to obnoxiously difficult on a dime, and it doesn’t let you save mid-mission. Most infuriatingly, there’s one where nine waves of enemies spawn and attack from all directions, and you instantly fail if you lose control of a single one of the seven nests you have to defend – so many that it’s impossible to upgrade them all with effective defenses. That last wave is a doozy, too, which meant I had to replay it from the start multiple times just to overcome the final challenging moments where they come in large enough numbers to be a threat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mixed in with those combat missions are absurdly tedious ones where you only control your single ant as you hunt for tiny bugs – which are usually very effectively camouflaged thanks to the realistic art style – spread across a big map. You’re guided only by a non-directional proximity sensor, so you have to run in circles to triangulate each bug. There are also “stealth” missions that don’t actually care if you’re detected as you scan enemy legions (dying has basically no consequences either), and these similarly amount to running around a map looking for things. Sometimes you’re told to catch butterflies or fireflies that fly away when you get close – the only way I found to do it was to wait for them to repeat their scripted movement pattern and land right in front of me, and that is exactly as much fun as it sounds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering you can climb any object and walk on the ceiling, it’s surprising that only a couple of the missions make any use of this ability at all, and those that do are mostly the boring, non-combat variety. (There was only one mission where my units fought upside-down, which was very funny because the corpses of dead ants rained down.) Similarly, the only thing Empire of the Ants does with its impressive sense of scale is give you a few objects – like a glass bottle or a toy giraffe – to run around, picking up little glowy things as you explore them. I’ll grant you that this does remind me of how I’ve seen real ants figure out if an object is something they want to eat, but I don’t think ants are doing this for fun, and I am not having much fun doing it either. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don’t think ants are doing this for fun, and I am not having much fun doing it either.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You aren’t forced to do all of these missions to complete the campaign – you select missions by speaking to quest-giving ants in a sequence of hub areas that serve as a sort of menu – but I don’t recommend any of them, or the campaign in general. The nicest thing I can say about it is that it’s not all that buggy (other than… you know).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing you do in these hubs is talk to ants. I haven’t read the books Empire of the Ants is based on, but if the Wikipedia synopsis is anything to go by this game’s story isn’t even close to following them because there are no human characters or secret ant weapons to make it remotely interesting. I’m going to assume that its numerous conversations about how your nest is threatened by termites and other visually identical ant species or floods don’t do the novels justice. Even the ant civil war that breaks out is over almost as abruptly as it begins, ensuring there’s no substance there either.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">While Empire of the Ants’s nearly photo-realistic world looks incredible at first glance, its boring and annoying real-time strategy campaign is the ant-ithesis of that. Combat missions are mostly trivially easy because the AI doesn’t seem to understand crucial mechanics, and those that aren’t are obnoxious because you can’t save mid-mission to replay the tough parts without trudging through the easy setup; Meanwhile, all of the non-combat missions are tedious searches for needles in haystacks and the story fails to make ant politics intriguing. It’s easily the worst single-player campaign I’ve played in years.</p></div></div><div><div data-cy="review-content"><p>awful</p><p>Pretty to look at but painfully dull and frustrating to play, Empire of the Ants's single-player campaign has none of the depth of the multiplayer and packages bad AI with boring missions and a meandering story.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's the cry of hundreds of beleaguered Dino Crisis fans, mourning the revival that could've been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adi Shankar, the creator of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/devil-may-cry-anime-from-castlevania-showrunner-is-coming-to-netflix">Netflix's upcoming Devil May Cry show</a> and a filmmaker with a strong reputation for video game anime adaptations (Castlevania, Captain Laserhawk), revealed some interesting information in <a href="https://x.com/adishankarbrand/status/1854227947944890505" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent X/Twitter post</a>. Specifically, when he first started talking to Capcom years ago, his sights weren't actually set on Devil May Cry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He began by sharing some quick thoughts on each of the three Dino Crisis games, praising the first two while conceding that the third "lost that magic" as it headed off Earth. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Why am I telling you this?" he continued. "Because when I first went to Capcom in 2017, my mission was clear: I wanted to bring Dino Crisis back. But in an awesome twist of fate, they sold me Devil May Cry instead! I didn’t think DMC would even be on the table."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">1.

"Like it’s cool Devil May Cry fans can eat but god damn. Dino Crisis fans stay in sad I guess," <a href="https://x.com/Jawmuncher/status/1854593201266737643" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bemoaned one X/Twitter user</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Dino Crisis game came out all the way back in 2003, and rumors have swirled for years about a potential fourth game. There are a few reasons not to hold your breath, though: for one, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-doesnt-leave-room-for-a-dino-crisis-reboot-creator-shinki-mikami-says">Mikami said earlier this year</a> that the popularity of Monster Hunter doesn't leave a lot of room for another Dino Crisis entry. Plus, Capcom recently tried its hand at another dinosaur-focused game, Exoprimal, a multiplayer title that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-a-dino-crisis-for-capcom-as-it-abandons-new-exoprimal-content-just-a-year-after-launch">stopped adding new content just a year after its launch</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/29/dino-1724928513393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Devil May Cry's Adi Shankar originally approached Capcom with the mission of bringing back Dino Crisis.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, hope for a revival in anime form isn't completely extinct just yet — even if it's a little thin. While clarifying that he's currently committed to a "very long-term plan" for Devil May Cry, <a href="https://x.com/adishankarbrand/status/1854610800889283081" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shankar added</a>, "But yes, one day perhaps I usually use my powers to resurrect Dino Crisis." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Devil May Cry, at least, is still set for an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflixs-devil-may-cry-gets-first-teaser-trailer-and-release-window">April 2025 release date</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-will-feature-marcus-and-doms-original-voice-actors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War voice acting veterans John DiMaggio and Carlos Ferro will officially reprise their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago for Gears of War: E-Day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer The Coalition announced the news on Thursday, which also happens to be the 18th anniversary of the launch of the original Gears of War. It’s big news for longtime fans of the series, who will remember that DiMaggio and Ferro played the two leads in the franchise’s first three games. An <a href="https://x.com/GearsofWar/status/1854584608223813638" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>image of the two stars standing together</u></a> was shared to studio’s official X/Twitter account.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We are so back. 🤜🤛 </p><p>On today's 18th anniversary of Gears of War, we're proud to share that John DiMaggio and <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCarlosFerro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RealCarlosFerro</a> are reprising their roles as the iconic voices of Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago in Gears of War: E-Day. <a href="https://t.co/x9uaH9R0sR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/x9uaH9R0sR</a></p></div>— Gears of War (@GearsofWar) <a href="https://twitter.com/GearsofWar/status/1854584608223813638?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War: E-Day is a prequel that takes place awhile before the mainline Gears story got its start. Specifically, it’s set around Emergence Day, which is known as the day the Locust horde made its way to the surface of Sera to launch its attack on humanity. That means that we definitely won’t be seeing protagonists like JD Fenix and Kait Diaz from future Gears games, and more importantly, it means that Marcus and Dom get one more game to see how exactly their bond was strengthened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not much of a surprise to hear that DiMaggio and Ferro will re-team for E-Day – fans had guessed that the longtime Marcus Fenix voice actor would at least return following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gears-of-war-game-officially-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>the reveal of an emotional announcement trailer</u></a> earlier this year – but it’s still nice to hear that Dom’s voice will be returning as well. While Marcus lived on to fight in Gears 4 and 5, his partner’s journey ended with a heroic sacrifice in Gears of War 3. Many believe the duo’s relationship and the performances behind them are what helped propel the Gears of War series to success, and now, E-Day is attempting to recapture that gritty, gory magic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Coalition told us earlier this year that Gears of War: E-Day gives the team to return to the series’ roots in more ways than one. One element set to return in the prequel is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-e-day-devs-promise-return-to-horror-from-the-original-games"><u>the horror that the original trilogy is known for</u></a>. Brand Director Nicole Fawcette and Creative Director Matt Searcy spoke to us about their goals in an interview that took place shortly after the game’s reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For us, it’s like a what-if story,” Searcy said. “What if the ground opened up and monsters came out? Yeah, it’s set on a fictional, other planet, but there are very human reactions and stories we get to tell. To do that, we need to be able to tell a story that feels like a horror story.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War: E-Day is currently without a release date but is expected to come to PC and Xbox Series X | S sometime in the future. In the meantime, you can read about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-is-by-no-means-abandoning-the-stories-told-in-gears-4-and-5-despite-decision-to-do-a-prequel-next"><u>why the prequel doesn’t meant the end for the story that left off with Gears 5</u></a>.
