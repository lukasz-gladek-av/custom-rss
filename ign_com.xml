Also from the OG days, the 50v50 LTM returns as OG 50v50.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OG 50v50 pits two 50-player teams against each other, and runs until 9am ET on April 14. Fortnite veterans will remember that 50v50 was the first-ever LTM to be added to Fortnite Battle Royale, all the way back in 2017.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The meteor will emerge in the sky later in OG Chapter 1 Season 3, and get closer and closer as the Season goes on. This, too, will be fondly remembered by Fortnite players who were there to see battle royale kick off back in the day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, starting today, March 25, anyone can create their own The Walking Dead Universe islands for Fortnite using Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Fortnite Creative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creators can start a new project using one of the new The Walking Dead Universe templates to access unique Walking Dead-themed weapons, Prefabs, Galleries, and Walker NPCs. Then, on May 16, developers will be able to publish their The Walking Dead Universe islands via the Creator Portal and make them available for people to play.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/25/fortnite-x-the-walking-dead-universe-shiva-shotgun-and-lucille-1742910536643.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Negan's infamous baseball bat, Lucille, hits Fortnite.

Whether it’s Lucille smashing through hordes or the eerie presence of Walkers, I can’t wait to see where the Fortnite community’s creativity takes us.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Here’s a breakdown of some of the Walking Dead tools available for Fortnite creators today:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Walker NPC</strong> - Slow, unintelligent, horde enemies, Walkers are motivated by their primal drive to consume humans.</li><li><strong>Weapons and Items</strong> - Mow ‘em down with the Shiva Shotgun Ranged Weapon, an exotic, modded pump shotgun (which also triggers a Shiva tiger roar); use the Lucille Melee Weapon, the iconic heavy-hitting baseball bat wrapped in wire wielded by the infamous Negan (and perfect for bashing in Walkers and Survivors alike).</li><li><strong>Effects</strong> - Create with the new heavy linework post-processing effect, a shader that influences the overall look and feel of an island to bring the tone and visual style of The Walking Dead comics.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Most Roblox experiences have <strong>codes that are case-sensitive</strong>, so if you're not putting the code in exactly as it's written, you'll find it won't work. To make it easier for you to avoid this issue, we'd recommend <strong>copying the code directly from this article</strong>. We test each and every one before we add them, so just be sure you don't copy an extra space before or after the code accidentally! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If your code still isn't working, it might be that it's expired. For reference, in Anime Card Clash, whenever you put in a code incorrectly, it says "Code not found!". </p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Anime Card Clash Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We check for Roblox codes daily, so when a new Anime Card Clash code drops, you can be sure you'll find it here! If you want to track down codes yourself, the <a href="https://discord.gg/animecardclash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anime Card Clash Discord server</a> is the place to hunt for them. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Anime Card Clash in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Anime Card Clash the goal is to build the best deck to battle against bosses and other players. You'll start by rolling for cards to craft a unique deck, and we'd recommend taking some time to roll as many times as possible and creating your perfect pack before you jump over to story mode. When you're ready to tackle story mode, you'll engage in turn-based combat against a series of tough bosses. With each defeat, you'll unlock new worlds, so you can put your deck to the ultimate test. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lauren Harper is an Associate Guides Editor.
