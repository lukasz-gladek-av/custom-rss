That good games, whether they come from Microsoft or otherwise, top the sales charts. That’s perhaps no surprise. It’s also no surprise to see these games do well on PlayStation. The PS5 was screaming out for a game like Playground’s wonderful racer, Forza Horizon 5, so its April launch on the console was hotly anticipated. Then there’s The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which is scratching that Bethesda itch across PC and console, and the eternally popular Minecraft, even more popular now with the Minecraft movie going viral and breaking records.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is now the new normal for Microsoft, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-coming-in-summer-even-on-playstation">just announced Gears of War: Reloaded</a> for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation coming in August. It seems inevitable that Halo, what was once the flagship Xbox exclusive, will also make the jump.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-gaming-boss-phil-spencer-wont-rule-out-any-xbox-exclusive-making-the-jump-to-playstation-including-halo"><u>Microsoft’s gaming chief Phil Spencer said there were no “red lines” in its first-party lineup when it comes to going multiplatform</u></a> — and that included Halo. Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a>, Spencer said every Xbox game is up for grabs when it comes to making the multiplatform jump. “I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say ‘thou must not,’ ” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer has said Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure on to deliver following its eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We run a business,” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5"><u>Spencer said in August</u></a>. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore"><u>As former Xbox executive Peter Moore told IGN last year</u></a>, bringing Halo to PlayStation will have been a topic of discussion at Microsoft for some time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Look, if Microsoft says, wait, we're doing $250 million on our own platforms, but if we then took Halo as, let's call it a third-party, we could do a billion… You got to think long and hard about that, right?” Moore said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I mean, you just got to go, yeah, should it be kept? It's a piece of intellectual property. It's bigger than just a game. And how do you leverage that? Those are the conversations that always happen with, how do you leverage it in everything that we would do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's had its ups and downs, but look, Xbox wouldn't be what Xbox is without Halo. But yeah, I'm sure those conversations are happening. Whether they come to fruition, who knows? But they're definitely happening, I'm sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft does face a potential backlash from hardcore Xbox fans who are already disgruntled after what they feel is a devaluing of the Xbox as a console, the lack of exclusives, and Microsoft’s marketing strategy for its gaming business. Losing Halo to PlayStation could spark yet another angry response, but Moore told IGN that won’t deter Microsoft from doing what’s right for its business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The question would be, ultimately, is that reaction enough not to make a fundamental business decision for the future of not only Microsoft’s business, but gaming in itself?” Moore said. “Those hardcore are getting smaller in size and older in age. You've got to cater to the generations that are coming through, because they're going to drive the business over the next 10, 20 years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-2-million-copies-sold-after-12-days-on-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has now sold an impressive 2 million copies after 12 days on sale. That’s up from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hit-rpg-clair-obscur-expedition-33-tops-1-million-sales-in-just-3-days">the 1 million sold three days after launch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was, alongside Bethesda’s Oblivion Remastered, a day-one Game Pass title. That makes this sales milestone all the more impressive for French developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve watched in awe as so many of you began your journey,” reads <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1919701863491838316" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on social media</a>. “Feeling every step, every emotion, every revelation alongside you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To those just joining us: welcome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Tomorrow comes.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When Bethesda shadow-dropped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered"><u>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</u></a> amid the launch of fellow role-playing game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, most thought there could be only one winner. However, it turned out that there was plenty of room for both games to succeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, according to Kepler, not only did Oblivion <em>not</em> harm Clair Obscur, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-says-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-shadow-drop-actually-benefitted-the-game-by-drawing-attention-to-quality-rpgs-that-week">Clair Obscur actually benefitted from Oblivion’s release because it boosted excitement for the RPG genre</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kepler Interactive’s senior portfolio manager Matt Handrahan told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Game Business</u></a> last week: “We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity. When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has done so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/french-president-macron-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-for-creating-one-of-the-best-rated-games-in-history"><u>French President Macron has praised the development team</u></a>.
