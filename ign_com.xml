The reveal comes alongside a message from game director Josh Sawyer (last seen directing Pentiment), with his thoughts on what turn-based mode means for Pillars of Eternity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fans who enjoyed experimenting with turn-based mode in Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire will find familiar ground here, but with key improvements shaped by your feedback,” <a href="https://eternity.obsidian.net/eternity/news/eternity/public-beta-for-turn-based-mode" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian said in a blog post</a>. More details are below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How turn-based mode works in Pillars of Eternity:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Unbound Turns:</strong> All turns are now influenced by a character’s overall speed, improving the value of Real-Time with Pause attributes and mechanics.</li><li><strong>Smarter Free Actions:</strong> Actions like swapping weapons, drinking potions, or enabling modals are now free actions. Each free action is limited to one per turn per type for balance.</li><li><strong>Faster Pacing:</strong> Combat lethality has been significantly increased for both enemies and players to keep battles tense and impactful.</li><li><strong>Mode Flexibility:</strong> You can choose Turn-Based Mode alongside difficulty when starting a new game — or swap freely between Real-Time with Pause and Turn-Based Mode in the game options. We’re also investigating a direct HUD toggle for even more convenience.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">As this is a public beta, please expect bugs and ongoing adjustments, Obsidian warned. The beta will run for “some time” as the developer continues to roll out updates and prepares for a full release.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/03/eternity-turnbased-menu-1762196302444.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pillars of Eternity now has turn-based mode. Image credit: Obsidian.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/27/pillars-of-eternity-review">Pillars of Eternity review</a> returned a 9/10 back in 2015. We said at the time: “Obsidian (and its Kickstarter backers) have done it: Pillars of Eternity is one of the best RPGs since Baldur's Gate.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian followed PoE up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire">Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</a> in 2018, before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/10/microsoft-to-acquire-obsidian-entertainment-inxile-entertainment">Microsoft bought the company later that year</a>. Obsidian went on to release the likes of The Outer Worlds and Grounded, and has become one of the most prolific Xbox Games Studios developers Microsoft has on its books.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will there be a Pillars of Eternity 3? Sawyer has commented on the prospect in the past. In 2023, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/josh-sawyer-would-make-pillars-of-eternity-3-if-given-a-baldurs-gate-3-sized-budget">Sawyer said he would love to develop Pillars of Eternity 3 — under the condition the game receives the same budget as <u>Baldur's Gate 3</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think if it truly was an unlimited budget, I think I would try Pillars 3 because I know what the budget was for Deadfire, which was not a whole lot and I have heard from multiple people what the budget was for Baldur’s Gate 3, and I’m not gonna talk about numbers, but if I got that budget, sure, I’ll make Pillars 3,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sawyer added that if he were to make Pillars 3, he would employ a turn-based combat structure. Obsidian has yet to announce its next game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">I just thought you'd want to know.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey. Hey you. Yes, you. The one playing Hollow Knight: Silksong. I just wanted to let you know, before you go any further, that you're missing a bench in Bilewater. Just in case that helps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not to Bilewater yet, this PSA is still for you. You will get there, and you will want to know this. I am going to spoil what's in Bilewater in this piece, so if you don't want to know that information, leave and come back when you've gotten sufficiently angry at Bilewater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bilewater is notorious. It is a massive, disgusting zone on the other side of the already frustrating Sinner's Road that you can stumble into fairly early on in Act 1 of Silksong, and which is required if you ever want to see the game's Act 3. There are many reasons why Bilewater is loathesome: it has many obnoxious enemy types that can ambush you and ruin your day, there are lots of spikes you can fall on and hurt yourself, and notably, it is full of maggot-infested water that will stop you from healing and regenerating silk. Bilewater is <em>awful.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But apart from the grub-water, one of the most standout horrors of Bilewater is its lack of benches. There's one bench way, way down at the bottom of Bilewater, in the Bell Beast station. At first, you might be tricked into thinking there is a second bench nearer the top lefthand side of the zone but, surprise! It's a trap. Not a bench at all. Down into the maggot water you fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So...uh...is that it? Is the Bell Beast bench really the only bench in Bilewater? Do you really have to do the entire zone, and the long, agonizing run back up to its boss over rivers of maggot-infested goop, past piles of spikes and exploding bug enemies and those awful things that belch poison at you, all with no break?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't. Be free. You're missing a bench in Bilewater. It is here:</p><div><blockquote data-embed-height="671" data-embed-theme="light">Posts from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nf4p7r/theres_a_secret_bench_in_bilewater_which_makes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">silksong</a><br> community on Reddit</blockquote></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Bilewater_Walkthrough">detailed guide to getting through Bilewater</a> here on IGN, which you should use to find this bench when the time comes. The short version is that the hidden Bilewater bench is located behind a breakable wall on the far right-hand side of a cavern, past a giant pool of maggot soup at the bottom of a pit. Break the wall and drop down through another pit, then break another wall on your left to find the secret bench. This one, mercifully, is safe, and will not unceremoniously dump you into a pool of misery when you try to sit down.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This bench is much, much closer to Bilewater's boss, Groal, though it's still a bit of a trek up to him. Again, I recommend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Bilewater_Walkthrough">our walkthrough</a> for help on surviving Bilewater, because it really is just a disgusting and difficult place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've seen a lot of people suggest that the run back to Groal, even with the help of the hidden bench, is one of the worst runbacks in the Souls genre. We're curious if you agree, so we set up the poll above. Vote to let us know which of these bosses has the worst runback from safety to their arena every time you die and have to attempt fighting them again. Or let us know in the comments if there's a worse fight we haven't mentioned here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to our Bilewater guide, we have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Walkthrough">detailed Wiki</a> to help you through every step of your journey in Pharloom, so check it out before, during, and after Bilewater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">FPS fans have spent months obsessing about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> map sizes, so some players finally took the time to measure and compare nearly every map the series has seen in the last 15 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield map size breakdown is a collaborative effort organized by Reddit users ClaraTheRed and PENGUINonPC and includes multiplayer locations featured in Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, Battlefield: Hardline, Battlefield 1, Battlefield 2042, and, of course, last month’s Battlefield 6. It comes not only with a side-by-side comparison for each game’s map, organized by game mode and player count, but also color-coded horizontal bar graphs, illustrating how EA’s approach to map sizes has changed through the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ClaraTheRed shared details about their analysis in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/comment/nmsbalz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a follow-up post</u></a>, clarifying that they have “done nothing but work on this the entire weekend.” The more than 45 hours of work resulted in a six-game, 72-map breakdown that paints a clear picture: Battlefield 6 doesn’t quite reach the gargantuan size of some of the series’ biggest maps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ClaraTheRed points out that, while many of the relatively small Battlefield 6 maps, like Iberian Offensive or Siege of Cairo, are similar in size to maps seen in Battlefield 3 and 1, many of its larger maps rank among the medium-sized pool of maps studied. While games like Battlefield 3 and even Battlefield 2042 boast some of the most colossal maps the series has seen yet, Battlefield 6 falls short of offering even one map in the top 20. Even its largest map, Operation Firestorm, which itself is a downsized remake of the Battlefield 3 map of the same name, lands as the 32nd biggest map for total shared playable area and 22nd for total map area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are numbers the Battlefield community is already latching onto, but there are a few notes to consider. The evaluation stops short of including every map in the series, for example, with 2018’s Battlefield V, which ClaraTheRed says was difficult to gather data for, being one omission. Battlefield titles have also been known to alter the play area mid-match thanks to features like Levolution and environmental hazards, which some portions of the study consider. Every game that is included also has the benefit of being a completed work, DLC included – Battlefield 6 launched less than one month ago.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have continued to push updates for its new Battlefield game in the weeks since its release, with Season 1 introducing a medium-sized map with Blackwell Fields last week, and another called Eastwood set to follow later this month. There’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-redsec"><u>Battlefield REDSEC</u></a>, a standalone offshoot with ties to the Battlefield 6 experience, which also launched last week. EA has proudly declared its map, Fort Lyndon, as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-launches-alongside-battlefield-6-season-1-with-battle-royale-gauntlet-and-portal-modes-heres-everything-you-need-to-know"><u>“biggest Battlefield map ever,”</u></a> though much of the community has already placed it into a separate category thanks to its status as a battle royale map included with REDSEC, not Battlefield 6, specifically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 fans who hopped in as early as the August beta tests have spent months clamoring for larger maps as EA and BF Studios continue to work on post-launch content. It’s a topic that has set the community on fire, as some work to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/comment/nmsdiq6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>defend Battlefield 6’s current offerings</u></a> while others take to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-steam-reviews-as-battlefield-6-players-push-for-battle-pass-changes-and-bigger-maps">review-bombing</a> to express their dissatisfaction with map sizes, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The two of us are not here to complain about map sizes in BF6 (although we do have our opinions on them),” ClaraTheRed clarifies, “but we're here to provide context and show that Battlefield maps throughout the last decade and a half have varied in size by a tremendous amount.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield REDSEC Fort Lyndon Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players will likely continue to break down new maps as future seasons roll out.
