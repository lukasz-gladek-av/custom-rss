            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/highguard"><u>Highguard</u></a> developer Wildlight Entertainment has confirmed a new patch is in the works after issues related to its official website sparked fears that a full shutdown was imminent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The already troubled multiplayer shooter’s first month in players’ hands took a turn for the worse earlier this week when fans noticed access to its official website had been closed off without warning. With all that remained of <a href="https://playhighguard.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>playhighguard.com</u></a> being a “site unavailable” message and social media links, many believed the full experience, which launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S just weeks ago, would soon be taken offline for good.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As concerns that Highguard could soon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">go the way of Concord</a> boiled, Wildlight finally stepped in (via <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2024081430674800915?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CharlieIntel</u></a>). Discord server admin and moderator WL_Coronach replied to one fan’s question about the website’s status earlier today, assuring them and others it would eventually come back online – even if it’s currently a “low priority” issue. Instead, the developer has put most of its focus on “updates and content.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not sure on the timeframe, but basically needs to be transferred and simplified,” the full message says. “Low priority [at the moment] ( reputational damage already done ). Now we just need to focus on delivering updates and content to improve.”</p><p>Now we just need to focus on delivering updates and content to improve.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wildlight had teased its first full year of content was already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-know-theres-a-lot-of-eyes-on-us-after-our-game-awards-trailer-as-highguard-goes-live-dev-insists-were-in-this-for-the-long-haul"><u>“deep in development”</u></a> when Highguard launched January 26. While an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-episode-2-is-here-with-a-new-warden-map-ranked-mode-and-more"><u>early February content update</u></a> proved that work on post-launch features was indeed underway, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-studio-wildlight-hit-with-layoffs"><u>layoffs</u></a> affecting much of the studio’s staff immediately called both its future, as well as the future of its new game, into question.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Wildlight facing drastic changes in the last week alone, it’s unclear what a new Highguard update would look like. Still, those who have stuck by the free-to-play game seem to be satisfied with any additional content at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once we lock in the patch date I’ll see if we can get a patch preview up for you guys a bit beforehand,” WL_Coronach added in a follow-up reply.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Highguard Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-highguard-developer-reflects-on-disastrous-announcement-and-launch-we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-1"><u>Highguard’s woes</u></a> began the moment Geoff Keighley showed it as the one-last-thing announcement at The Game Awards 2025. Confusion about its place at the show turned into concern in the weeks that followed, as players took <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-closer-highguard-reemerges-with-launch-showcase-so-yes-its-still-coming-out-next-week"><u>Wildlight’s silence</u></a> as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/can-we-stop-dunking-on-highguard-before-its-even-out-please"><u>a sign the game could be in trouble</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Fortunately, "the majority of people who made Skyrim are still here."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls 6 is going to be a return to Bethesda's "classic style" of games, according to Bethesda director Todd Howard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from an interview done by Howard with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KindaFunny</a> today, in which he talked about why he can't really provide too much of an update on The Elder Scrolls 6, and admits he would have preferred not to have announced it so early (in 2018).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, he says players can expect it to be a return to Bethesda's classic form, after the studio took "creative detour[s]" with both Starfield and Fallout 76. Here's the full quote from Howard:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We do have a certain style that we like and that our fans like that we want to get better and better at. I think in some ways Fallout 76 and Starfield are a little bit of a creative detour from that classic Elder Scrolls, Fallout, a Skyrim or a Fallout 3 or a Fallout 4, Oblivion, where you're exploring a world in a certain way. And as we come back to Elder Scrolls 6 that we're doing now, we're coming back to that classic style that we've missed, that we know really really well."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Howard goes on, confirming that the studio has spent the last several years improving on Creation Engine 2, which is the game engine behind Starfield, and bringing it up to Creation Engine 3, which will power "Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the interview, he adds that "the majority of people who made Skyrim are still here," while new faces have also joined the studio, bringing experiences from other studios to lend to The Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a long, agonizing wait for The Elder Scrolls 6 since it was first announced – wow, okay, <em>almost eight years ago.</em> It has in fact been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced">longer between the announcement and now</a> than it was between The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and the announcement of The Elder Scrolls 6. Howard has warned eager fans as recently as last November that the game is "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop">still a long way off</a>" and has even teased that he may just shadow drop it, something he alluded to again today with KindaFunny. He reiterated today that "it's gonna be a while yet," and confirmed that, "We're able to play it, we're about to pass a big milestone internally, the majority of the studio is on the game and some of our partners."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Howard also claims all this waiting is necessary for the game to be great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What do fans really want?” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-dev-says-were-going-to-take-our-time-and-as-long-as-it-needs-to-be-great-points-to-gta-6-delay-as-the-smartest-thing-they-could-do">he said in December of last year</a>. “Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn’t meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know? That’s what I think people are going to want. So, we’re going to take our time and as long as it needs to be great.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?
