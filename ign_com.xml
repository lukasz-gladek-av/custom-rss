            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the hugely popular Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 1, developer DICE has outlined the changes and additions fans can expect for the upcoming Weekend 2, and confirmed its start time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Weekend 2 kicks off today, August 14, at 8am UTC (1am PT), and runs until Sunday, August 17. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/open-beta-week-2-playlist-options" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, DICE outlined the playlist adjustments it has made for Weekend 2 and set out its reasoning. The thing to know here is the All-Out Warfare playlist will include Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“During Week 2, we're delivering more variety and choice for how you’d like to play with more playlists rotating between multiple different game modes,” DICE said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As an example, the All-Out Warfare playlist will include both Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush. The in-game descriptions for each mode will tell you which modes are included in the rotation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rotating through multiple modes within playlists helps us understand what our community enjoys as we shape the launch experience, and enables us to keep more fan-favorite modes available at the same time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DICE said rotating through playlists daily is specific for the Open Beta “while we're still able to test and gather feedback, and is not planned for launch.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 2 Playlists Overview:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Day 1, Thursday 14th</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Conquest</li><li>Rush</li><li>Attack &amp; Defend (Breakthrough, Rush)</li><li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill)</li><li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Day 2, Friday 15th</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Conquest</li><li>Squad Deathmatch</li><li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill, Squad Deathmatch)</li><li>All-Out Warfare; Epic battles across expansive maps (Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush)</li><li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Day 3-4, Saturday 16th - Sunday 17th</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Conquest</li><li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill, Squad Deathmatch).</li><li>All-Out Warfare; Epic battles across expansive maps (Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush)</li><li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, DICE has added custom search options for Weekend 2. The developer stressed that this is now a Server Browser, which some fans are hoping to see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Based on your previous feedback and to give you more control over map and mode selection, we're introducing a new feature called Custom Search,” DICE said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This feature allows you to choose your favorite combinations of maps and modes. For example, if you want to play Conquest on Siege of Cairo, then matchmaking will prioritize putting you in a match with this combo, if available. Note that this is not a Server Browser (which is not being tested this week).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“During Open Beta, Custom Search will be available for Open Weapon mode playlists so you can mix and match maps and modes as you prefer.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 Open Beta hit over half a million concurrent players on Steam last weekend, so it will be interesting to see whether Weekend 2 can beat that figure. Either way, there’s huge interest in the first-person shooter, which bodes well for its October launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're thinking of jumping in on PC for the first time, be aware you need to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/How_to_Enable_Secure_Boot">enable Secure Boot to play</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
