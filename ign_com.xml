Indeed, their statement ends with the suggestion that "all the media attention this has received will do something to convince investors" that Shenmue 4 should be made.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I just wanted to set the record straight for all those who think it might still be half real," JustAFan1 wrote. "It's not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know many of you will want to hang me for dashing your hopes, but know this was not done out of malice, but love for Shenmue. I realize I went about it the wrong way, and I apologize for that. But I hope all the media attention this has received will do something to convince investors that Shenmue is very much alive and profitable if approached correctly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As proof that they were the creator of the video, JustAFan1 posted a link to a new version of the trailer with additional music and footage, along with a lengthier apology statement in both English and Japanese. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I want to be absolutely clear: I am merely a fan of the series and have absolutely no professional or personal affiliation with Ys Net, nor have I ever had any," this statement reads. "The creation and release of the trailer, which presented itself as an official piece of promotional material recorded behind the scenes, was a lapse in judgment. I take full responsibility for this action."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shenmue 3 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">JustAFan1's statement continues by confirming that the fake trailer's story elements were made using publicly available lore and common fan theories about where the Shenmue series might progress in future, with nothing that specifically reflected any real development that may or may not be underway within Ys Net. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While my intent was centered on a positive outcome, the method I chose to achieve it was misleading and unprofessional. I deeply regret creating and sharing information that was not factual, and I understand the negative impact this misinformation had.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The sole purpose behind creating the 'Shenmue 4' trailer was to demonstrate the sustained and substantial market demand and community enthusiasm for this beloved series," the video statement concludes. "I meant no harm to Ys Net, its brand, or its loyal fans. My motivation was to champion the series and help encourage its continuation, not to mislead or create distress."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the statement has been mostly supportive, with many agreeing that the trailer had created fresh buzz for the franchise amid hope for confirmation of a new game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nah, you're good," fan hyo_razuki replied. "I knew it was fake from the beginning but it was fun and you generated some enthusiasm for Shenmue, so no biggie, no need to apologize."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of now, it's unknown if a fourth major Shenmue game will ever get made, though the franchise's fans certainly hope it happens. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yu-suzuki-talks-shenmue-4-air-twister-and-40-years-of-game-development">Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki told IGN in 2023 that he wanted to create a fourth game at some point</a>, though he is currently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shenmue-3-enhanced-announced-as-most-refined-version-of-ryo-hazukis-epic-journey">still working on an enhanced version of Shenmue 3</a>. This, Suzuki hopes, will win the game a warmer reception across a wider set of platforms, after a middling response to Shenmue 3 at the game's initial launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
