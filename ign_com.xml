            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-says-a-new-virtua-fighter-is-in-development-could-virtua-fighter-6-finally-be-on-the-horizon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Virtua fighter game appears to be in the works after apparent confirmation from Sega itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/why-sega-is-reviving-classics-like-shinobi-and-jet-set-radio-across-games-film-and-tv/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>, Justin Scarpone, Sega‚Äôs new global head of transmedia, dropped the potentially explosive news as part of a discussion about the various legacy titles the company is bringing back with new versions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here‚Äôs the quote:</p><blockquote>So we have a suite of titles in development right now that fall into that legacy bucket, which we announced last year at The Game Awards; Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, Shinobi, and we have another Virtua Fighter being developed. And so all that‚Äôs very exciting. And then in certain instances, we‚Äôre also doing animation series, or live-action films to augment that and be part of those roadmaps.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That innocuous mention of a new Virtua Fighter has already set tongues wagging within the fighting game community. Virtua Fighter hasn‚Äôt seen a mainline release in years, leaving mini-game appearances in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio‚Äôs Yakuza games and the 2021 release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a> to tide fans over. IGN has asked Sega for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter, which includes characters such as Akira Yuki, Pai Chan, and Wolf Hawkfield, is on the hardcore end of the fighting game spectrum, with slower-paced gameplay that challenges players to master its mechanics in order to enjoy success. Virtua Fighter 5, which first released in 2006, is considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time. Could Sega now be ready to release Virtua Fighter 6, nearly 20 years later?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During The Game Awards 2023, Sega announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-golden-axe-and-more-are-in-development-game-awards-2023"><u>new games in the Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi franchises</u></a> alongside the teaser trailer, below. The video shows brief clips of each of the games set to return.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has said its Crazy Taxi reboot, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crazy-taxi-reboot-an-open-world-massively-multiplayer-aaa-game-sega-says">is an open-world, massively multiplayer AAA game</a>. There is no release date yet for the Crazy Taxi reboot or any of the other new games announced at last year's Game Awards. Perhaps we‚Äôll find out more in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/if-sony-ever-gave-a-diablo-style-bloodborne-spin-off-the-green-light-it-might-look-something-like-this<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A fan-made top-down action RPG take on Bloodborne has given fans a clear picture of what a Diablo-style spin-off might look like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer <a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maxime Foulquier</a>, who had ditched plans to remake Bloodborne in Unreal Engine 5 out of fear of a cease and desist from franchise owner Sony, has now started a new project called ‚ÄòBloodborne Top Down Arena,‚Äô and in the tweet below, showed gameplay off.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>HUNTERS! I haven't touched Bloodborne Remake for a year for 50 reasons (too big, too risky to finally be C&amp;D).</p><p> But last week I decided to start a new project from scratch, Bloodborne Top Down Arena</p><p>Maybe you won't like it, but I'm enjoying developing it and playing it üòÇ <a href="https://t.co/OPont0sS45" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/OPont0sS45</a></p></div>‚Äî Maxime Foulquier (@MaximFoulquier) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853835793388953662?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay looks very much as you‚Äôd expect: FromSoftware‚Äôs hugely popular Bloodborne but with the camera pulled up into an action RPG perspective. The repurposed Bloodborne combat is action RPG snappy, perhaps a good fit for a Diablo-style game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Foulquier <a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853834672347758739" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Bloodborne Top Down Arena is "less ambitious and different from a true remake‚Äù of Bloodborne, so hopes it will avoid falling into the crosshairs of Sony‚Äôs lawyers. ‚ÄúThe Demake and the Minecraft Project didn't receive CnD so I cross the fingers,‚Äù Foulquier added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs worth noting that the developer behind Bloodborne Nightmare Kart <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nightmare-kart-bloodborne-kart-release-date">ended up re-jipping the game after Sony got in touch</a>, so perhaps Foulquier is being a little naive here. Foulquier insisted, however, that because Bloodborne Top Down Arena is not planned for release on Steam, it will avoid a similar fate.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah but I don't want to release this on Steam.</p>‚Äî Maxime Foulquier (@MaximFoulquier) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1854087594008617080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, what Bloodborne fans really want is a sequel to the PS4 classic, or, saving that, a next-gen update for the original game. Neither are so far announced from either FromSoftware or Sony. In February, ahead of the launch of FromSoftware‚Äôs Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">director Hidetaka Miyazaki said that because the developer doesn‚Äôt own the Bloodborne IP</a>, he can‚Äôt speak about its future. He did, however, admit Bloodborne would benefit from releasing on more modern hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps5-pro-can-you-see-the-difference">IGN has had a look at Bloodborne running on the PS5 Pro</a>, which launches November 7 priced $700. And then there‚Äôs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-no-bloodborne-remake-but-there-is-a-bloodborne-outfit-for-astro-bot">the Bloodborne cameo in recently released PS5 exclusive Astro Bot</a>, if you‚Äôre desperate for a fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Once players have collected one of each of these Pok√©mon the 3 Star Mew card will unlock.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/mew-1730901811705.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The 3 Star Mew card in Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only condition is the cards must also be from Genetic Apex, meaning, for example, that collecting the promotional Butterfree card from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">the special Lapras ex event</a> won't count towards the 150 total despite it being among the first 150 Pok√©mon. Any version of the Pok√©mon from Genetic Apex will work, however, whether it's an ex or alternative art or regular or whatever else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While simple, collecting so many cards may still take some time. One player recently worked out it could take almost two years of daily play to collect every card in the set, though thankfully hitting the 150 necessary for Mew will require considerably less time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mew holds a special place in the set as one of just four 3 Star cards, meaning it's one of the special immersive cards with fully animated artwork. It joins Charizard, Pikachu, and Mewtwo in this category, the three Pok√©mon which feature on the booster pack covers of Genetic Apex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pok√©mon TCG Pocket arrived in October as a streamlined, digital version of the beloved trading card game. It has players opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others;</a> a simple formula that's already proved popular given it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">$12 million in four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players may otherwise want to keep an eye out from cards from the two decks currently dominating the Pok√©mon TCG Pocket meta, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">headlined by usual suspects Charizard ex and Mewtwo ex</a>.
