            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> has seen a big boost in players after launching its first new class, but complaints over monetization have continued especially after developer Fatshark released a version of the Arbitrator's default helmet with its visor up for $5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/huge-warhammer-40000-darktide-battle-for-tertium-update-goes-live-alongside-new-class-the-adeptus-arbites">Battle for Tertium update</a>, which arrived alongside the new Adeptus Arbites class DLC, reworked the core player experience to provide a new, clearer narrative focus for the co-op first-person melee / shooter hybrid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players now experience a linear campaign with new mission debriefs and embedded cinematics. It’s designed to “ease in new players and gradually unlock features that were previously gated by character level,” Fatshark has said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the big draw for veteran players was the release of the Adeptus Arbites class, and it appears to have done the trick. This $11.99 DLC looks like it’s sparked the interest of players who have stuck with the game since its troubled launch, as well as convinced lapsed players to dip back in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch, Darktide hit a peak concurrent player count of just over 43,000 on Steam, the highest it’s been on Valve’s platform for over two years. And this doesn’t even paint the whole picture of the game’s success, given it’s also out on console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement provided to IGN, Product Marketing Manager Rodrigue Delrue said Fatshark had noticed the uptick, but failed to say exactly how many were playing Darktide across PC and console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve seen a high level of engagement across all platforms, even if we don't have exact numbers to share at this time,” Delrue said. “What’s important is that the community remains active and passionate, and we’re incredibly thankful for that.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/26/ss-ab7a23b22d0485c18ca39f259f38bef8d1f9d745-1920x1080-1750940682493.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The new Arbitrator's default helmet has its visor down. Image credit: Fatshark.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, there is one sticking point: monetization. Darktide’s Adeptus Arbites DLC launched alongside a fresh round of premium cosmetics, bought with the in-game currency called Aquilas (the Aquila is the ancient symbol of the Imperium of Man in the Warhammer 40,000 universe). And within that monetization debate, one item in particular has set the community off: a helmet with its visor up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This helmet, specifically for the Arbitrator, is identical to the default visor-down helmet you get with the new class. So, you’re paying 900 Aquilas (approx. $5) just to lift your visor up.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/26/screenshot-2025-06-26-125015-1750940732879.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Arbitrator's patrol helm with raised visor costs $5. Image credit: Fatshark.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d imagine, this hasn’t gone down well with some Darktide players. “We've reached the current peak of Fatshark greed,” reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTide/comments/1ljb3we/i_think_weve_reached_the_current_peak_of_fs_greed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one thread on the Darktide subreddit</a>, upvoted 3,000 times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, it’s bulls**t that this wasn’t just included alongside the otherwise identical default visor-down helmet,” said one player. “Just give me a button push that lets me do this,” suggested another. “I’m just glad the visor up isn’t default and they make you pay for down,” joked one fan. “You mean I have to pay extra to actually see my character’s ugly face? I was buying skins to cover it up.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put the complaints about this cosmetic and Darktide’s monetization generally to Fatshark, and Delrue explained the studio needs to sell items in order to continue working on the game, but took the feedback on board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Cosmetic pricing is always a balancing act,” Delrue said. “As a live service game we want to be able to keep working on the game while respecting what players feel is fair value. We appreciate when these topics are brought up, these conversations help us better understand what the community values and helps inform how we approach cosmetics going forward.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, how much longer will Fatshark continue to work on adding new content to Darktide, which is approaching its third birthday? Delrue pointed to the studio’s continued support of the even older Warhammer game, Vermintide, as evidence of its commitment to its players, and even confirmed more new classes are on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since launch, we’ve continuously supported Darktide with free updates — and that commitment isn’t changing,” Delrue said. “As we’ve shown with Vermintide, we’re in this for the long haul. Players can naturally expect ongoing support, including new classes and additional free content as the game continues to evolve.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Previously, players branded the endgame as "toxic" due to griefing even after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-patches-out-orni-squishing-in-pvp-by-completely-removing-the-ability-to-damage-players-and-npcs-with-vehicles-and-not-all-fans-are-happy-about-it"><u>patching out the ability for players to squish other people with their Ornithopter</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want PvE players to be able to play the endgame and have access to the content of the endgame," said creative director Joel Bylos. "Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert — an endlessly renewing location that resets every week and creates an activity loop for great rewards. The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe. Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those wondering, yes, Control Points and Shipwrecks will continue to be PvP "throughout the entire map," which means you will find "localized pockets of PvP within the PvE section still. Similar to how Shipwrecks are PvP in Hagga Basin." Work has also begun on changing the Ornithopters; equipping a rocket launcher module will now decrease the top speed of your Scout Orni by 20%, and Assault Ornis by 10%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the patch has been applied, players will also be able to report other players’ messages from the text chat or report them by using the Inspect menu.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dune: Awakening Patch Notes 1.1.0.17</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Deep Desert</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As outlined in <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>A message from the Creative Director on PvE and PVP » Dune: Awakening</u></a>, this hotfix will see the first iteration of the changes to the balance between PvE and PvP in the Deep Desert. Rest assured that we will continue to listen to your feedback and make adjustments in the future.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The PvE area has been adjusted to encompass the entire southern half of the Deep Desert map.<ul data-cy="list"><li>This means that players who have no interest in PvP should be able to find what they want without engaging in PvP. Imperial Testing Stations, caves, and so forth found in this area are thus now PvE.</li><li>Control Points and Shipwrecks will, however, continue to be PvP throughout the entire map, which means you will find localized pockets of PvP within the PvE section still. Similar to how Shipwrecks are PvP in Hagga Basin.</li></ul></li><li>To retain the Risk vs Reward setup for the Deep Desert:<ul data-cy="list"><li>The density of resources increases the further north you go. This includes high-density clusters of valuable resources.</li><li>The largest spice fields will also spawn in the north.</li><li>The majority of Control Points will exist in the northern part.</li></ul></li><li>As part of these changes, we have made some balancing adjustments in the Deep Desert:<ul data-cy="list"><li>The lower half of the Deep Desert now offers PvE loot that is balanced toward shared loot and PvE activities. You may find better loot in the more dangerous PvP area located further north on the map. In the PvE area, for example, each player gets their own loot and can expect to receive one schematic. In the PvP area, loot is distributed on a “first come, first served” basis, with higher quantities of everything. Players can expect to find 2–6 schematics there, which are among the rarest.</li><li>Plasteel plates can only be found in PvP zones.</li><li>The amount of active medium spice fields has been reduced from 8 to 5.</li><li>The number of active small spice fields has increased from 20 to 22.</li><li>The spawn rate of Titanium and Stravidium has been reduced in the PvE areas so that large quantities only spawn in the far-out PvP areas.</li><li>The number of nodes in resource hotspots in the PvE part of the map has been reduced.</li><li>The respawn time of Titanium and Stravidium has increased from 30 to 45 minutes.</li></ul></li><li>Some Imperial Testing Stations are still in the PvP region, and players who want all schematics available each week will want to visit both the PvP and PvE Imperial Testing Stations. Keep in mind the loot in them rotates each week, so even if you’re not interested in PvP, you could obtain it at a later date if you’re not able to trade for it or buy it off the Exchange.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Vehicles</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>We have begun work on the outlined changes to the Scout Ornithopters.<ul data-cy="list"><li>Equipping a Rocket Launcher Module will now decrease the top speed of your Ornithopter.<ul data-cy="list"><li>For Scout Ornithopters, the reduction is 20%.</li><li>For Assault Ornithopters, the reduction is 10%.</li></ul></li><li>Infocards for the modules now reflect this change.</li></ul></li><li>Exiting ornithopters mid-air will now cause them to drop straight down instead of gliding away. This should decrease the chance that you lose your ornithopter upon disconnecting from the game or exiting by accident your ornithopter mid-air (yes, we have seen the videos).<ul data-cy="list"><li>Known issue: There is an edge case that if your vehicle ends up in the quicksand you might not be able to interact with it if you are in the quicksand. The workaround is to try to get on top of the vehicle to interact with it. This will be fixed in the very next patch.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Visiting</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>We removed the restrictions when visiting other sietches. Before this change, players had their “home” sietches, and could visit other sietches in their world but couldn’t claim land. Now, any player can go to any sietch in their world and claim land wherever they want.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Technical and stability</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased game stability.</li><li>The latest NVIDIA driver was added to the GPU driver check at the game launch.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Other</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>We have introduced Player Reporting, allowing players to now report other players’ messages from the text chat or report players from the Inspect menu on players.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">FIXES</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Technical and stability</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>As a continuous effort, we have closed several exploit vulnerabilities.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a specific type of network issue would cause players to be stuck in an infinite loading screen.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some players could experience a client freeze when traveling between Deep Desert servers.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Combat</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where players performing a melee attack could get obstructed by corpses lying on the ground.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">User Interface</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where the guild faction alignment was not localized on the Guild Overview tab.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could encounter a black screen if they skipped the cinematic at “The Wreck of the Hephaestus”.</li><li>Fixed an issue where several Sandbike research schematics failed to mention the Imperial Testing Stations as the primary source.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Travel</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where players could use an ornithopter pilot service to fly from the cities to Hagga Basin if they had arrived in a city with their ornithopter.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Miscellaneous</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>You will no longer lose learned emotes when respec’ing your skill tree.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Dune: Awakening has enjoyed a superb launch, with a 'very positive' user review rating on Steam.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has updated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> to change how the game handles online course selection, in a move that has gone against many fans' wishes and highlighted the mixed response to the game's open world overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World version 1.1.2 was released last night, and patch notes from Nintendo state that it has "adjusted courses selected in Random when selecting next course in a wireless VS Race." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While confusingly phrased, this change looks to be a deliberate move by Nintendo to nerf the game's Random course selection option when playing in VS mode — something many fans had been using to opt out of 'intermission tracks' whenever possible. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What is an intermission track? This fan term relates to the often long stretch of open world players must travel through to get from their current location to another nearby course, before playing just one lap of its track. It's these nearby courses that the game will usually suggest as options for the next race, meaning players typically must play an intermission track, alongside the Random option which alternatively picks a course from elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had been using the Random option to deliberately skip intermission tracks where possible, hoping instead to be transported to a far-away course where they are plonked at the starting line. In these cases, players are then given the classic three-lap Mario Kart course experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with this change, Random also picks from the nearby courses the game suggests — meaning far-away courses are no longer guaranteed to appear, and intermission tracks are now more likely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a lengthy thread on forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-updates-mario-kart-worlds-online-removes-the-only-guaranteed-way-to-play-normal-3-lap-races-with-randoms.1228638/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restera</a> states, the change goes against how many players want to play Mario Kart World online, with the ability to consistantly play three laps of a course in VS mode, rather than only one lap after a long open-world drive through an intermission track.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart World Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo seems to have made this decision in response to player behavior as, anecdotally at least, use of the Random option seemed to be on the rise. And now, the patch is prompting a backlash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo has basically stepped in and said 'no, you're supposed to play this way,'" wrote fan GreenMamba. "They saw players clamoring for a more traditional online mode and did... the exact opposite of what they wanted."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The change will likely also make Mario Kart World's brilliant Rainbow Road track even rarer, the user noted. Perhaps World's best course, it is only accessible from the game's main open-world when selecting its specific Grand Prix, meaning fans hoping to play it online must rely on the Random choice option and hope it eventually gets picked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Good luck to ever even playing Rainbow Road online anymore," GreenMamba continued. "Thanks I hate it," wrote another fan. "Let people just play three-lap courses if they want to." "I get the impression that Nintendo isn't open to feedback on this," wrote a third. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have suggested Nintendo should add a bespoke three-lap VS option for those who want it, alongside the game's current offering. Others say intermission tracks should be kept to the game's Knockout Tour mode entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World's open world is not without its charms — it can be a relaxing place to cool off after heated races, and it holds a decent number of things to discover — but fans have consistently said its lengthy sections between main track locations just aren't as good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The highways aren't bad — in fact some of them can be very fun — but they're often extremely wide and straight, leading to long portions of each race that aren't as demanding or enjoyable as the twists and turns of the dedicated levels," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, it seems users will be seeing more of these open highways in VS mode play — though it remains to be seen what Nintendo's wider plans are for Mario Kart World over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World guide</a> and learn <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mario-kart-world/How_to_Unlock_All_Characters">how to unlock every hidden Mario Kart World character</a>, plus how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mario-kart-world/Kamek_Unlocks_Explained_(And_Tips_For_Getting_Them_Quickly)">Kamek Unlocks</a> work — you’ll need them to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mario-kart-world/How_to_Unlock_NPC_Drivers_and_Creatures">unlock NPC Drivers</a>.
