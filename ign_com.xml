"More maps. More modes. More time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, this weekend's upcoming multiplayer beta has been extended — so the beta now runs from Friday June 20 at 12pm PDT to Sunday June 22 at 9pm PDT — and Execution has now joined the mode pool alongside King of the Hill on Gridlock, Raven Down (Courtyard and War Machine), and Canals. You'll also be able to play Team Deathmatch on the same maps via social matchmaking, with Gold Rush also in the pool. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That won't quite quell the issues some players had about server stability but to be honest, that's precisely what beta tests are for, right? Better to experience that instability now than when the game launches in a few weeks' time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month Microsoft announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-reloaded"><u>Gears of War: Reloaded</u></a>, a remaster of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war"><u>original 2006 game,</u></a> will launch on August 26 on PC, Xbox, and yes, even PlayStation. The shiny new version will come with improved visuals and audio, crossplay, and cross-progression, and all the DLC from the Gears of War: Ultimate Edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a little treat for the Gears of War faithful, Gears of War: Reloaded will be a free upgrade for any players who purchased the digital version of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition before the announcement. If you're one of the special ones, expect a code via a DM from Xbox ahead of the release.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"As we approach the 20th anniversary of Gears of War in 2026, we’re reflecting on what this franchise means. It’s about the stories we’ve told, the friendships we’ve built, and the unforgettable moments we’ve shared together. With Gears of War: Reloaded, we’re opening that door to more players than ever," Mike Crump, studio head at The Coalition, said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Well, fix it the developer did. Kinda.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather than mess with the Ornithopters themselves, the developer simply deployed a patch so "players no longer receive damage when hit by vehicles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/dune-awakening-patch-fixes-the-ornithopter-goomba-stomp-problem-in-pvp-just-not-in-the-way-i-expected/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PC Gamer</u></a> points out, this is fine in theory, as it means you're not only protected by griefers determined to squish you like a bug in PvP, but it also protects you from wiping out on your sandbike, especially if you accidentally send yourself rocketing off the side of a cliff, for instance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And though hundreds of players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lebm3l/players_no_longer_receive_damage_when_hit_by/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>upvoted a post</u></a> on the subreddit that confirms the change, some point out that griefers have simply changed tactics rather than stop griefing altogether.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The[y] need to decrease top speed when using rockets. They need to increase top speed when using thrusters. PvP should be about control, not ganking. You use rockets to take or hold a landmark, not to hunt people. That would solve a ton," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lebm3l/comment/myfxpt2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> one player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Scouts shouldn’t have rockets," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lebm3l/comment/mygeyfe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested</u></a> another. "I’ve killed so many people with them and I shouldn’t be this fast or efficient. Assaults should have the rockets, because they’re slow and need constant input to out manoeuvre someone. Scouts should be storage and scanning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Is that good? I'm not sure. I think it would have been preferable if both took damage. The Thopter not taking any damage doesn't stop people being annoying with it," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lebm3l/comment/myewseh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a> another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They're not wrong. The only thing that can shoot down an Orni is a rocket launcher or Lasguns, but both of those are Tier 6-exclusive weapons and take some time to unlock. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also means you can't expedite fights with NPCs by ramming them with your vehicle, either. But hey, it's better than how it was before, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-dev-working-on-pvp-and-deep-desert-issues-as-new-concurrent-user-peak-record-is-set"><u>Dune: Awakening a Great 8/10 in our review</u></a>, writing: "Dune: Awakening is an excellent survival MMO that captures Frank Herbet’s sci-fi world incredibly well, mostly to its advantage and occasionally to its detriment. The survival climb from dehydrated peasant to powerful warlord of Arrakis is a joy almost every step of the way, and the story and worldbuilding filled this nerd with absolute joy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There’s still plenty for Awakening to work on though, as its combat never really hits its stride, the endgame is a bit of a chaotic mess not worth the effort, and there’s quite a few technical bugs yet to be squashed, but even these rough patches felt like tiny desert mice next to the leviathan shai-huluds that are this survival game’s wonderful successes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dune: Awakening has enjoyed a superb launch, with a 'very positive' user review rating on Steam.
