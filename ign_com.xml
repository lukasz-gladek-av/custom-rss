            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mojang-rules-out-minecraft-2-do-you-think-were-going-to-have-an-earth-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> celebrated its 15th anniversary last year, but despite growing into those troublesome teenage years, it appears that developer Mojang has no plans to replace it with a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a recent trip to the Stockholm studio, IGN asked about the possibility of the best-selling game of all time getting a sequel. Ingela Garneij, executive producer of Minecraft Vanilla, had an amusing, yet to-the-point answer for us: “Do you think we're going to have an Earth 2? No, no, there's no Minecraft 2.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Minecraft 2.0 is evidently not on the horizon, that doesn’t mean the survival-crafting phenomenon won’t continue to evolve. In fact, plans stretch way into the future, with a goal of at least doubling its current lifespan.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've existed for 15 years”, stated Garneij. “We want to exist at least 15 years more so we actually, Agnes [Larsson, Minecraft Vanilla’s game director] and I, we work as a team. We set the vision and strategy for our game for what can we do beyond that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an ambition propelled by Mojang’s desire to innovate, continuing the mine and craft, so to speak, new ideas upon their rock-solid foundations. Those foundations are beginning to show their age, though, Garneij admitted, and while there are no plans for an engine overhaul, it does mean that new content, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-upgrade-the-start-of-a-new-graphical-journey">the newly revealed Vibrant Visuals graphics update</a>, does take time to put into practice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the age of the game is a challenge," Garneij said. "It's a 15-year-old platform, 15-year-old technology that slows us down in one sense. So other new games have new engines, and they can run really fast. So I would say the technology and our age [are our biggest challenges].”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, Minecraft continues to be one of the most popular games in the world, and, as far as we can tell, shows no signs of slowing down. There's also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-its-the-best-deal-in-the-world">no plan for Minecraft to go free-to-play</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mojang-wont-use-ai-minecraft-is-about-creativity-and-creating">take advantage of generative AI technology</a>. Just don’t expect to be playing Minecraft 2 in the near future. Not on this Earth, anyway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-live-2025-vibrant-visuals-flying-happy-ghast-and-everything-announced">everything announced at Minecraft Live 2025</a> for more on what's coming to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editorial Producer who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

That's a purpose, [it] makes life look beautiful. So for us, we really want it to be our teams that make our games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ingela Garneij, executive producer of Minecraft Vanilla, expanded on this sentiment: “For me, it's the thinking outside of the box part. This specific touch of: what is Minecraft? How does it look? That extra quality is really tricky to create through AI. We even try to have remote teams sometimes and guide them in building things for us, which has never worked, because you have to be here working together face-to-face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I mean creativity is... you need to meet like this as a person, as a human to really truly understand the values and principles and the ecosystem, the lore, everything. It's so massive Minecraft, it's a planet, it's massive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The humans making Minecraft continue to build on its record-breaking foundations. The newly revealed graphics update, titled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-upgrade-the-start-of-a-new-graphical-journey">Vibrant Visuals, is due out in the near future</a>, and Mojang <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-its-the-best-deal-in-the-world">continues to refuse to make Minecraft free-to-play</a>. This philosophy of improving and expanding the original game also goes hand-in-hand with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mojang-rules-out-minecraft-2-do-you-think-were-going-to-have-an-earth-2">Mojang's desire to not make a “Minecraft 2</a>." It may be 16 years old now, but there’s truly no sign of Minecraft slowing down, and no sign of generative AI finding its way into the Nether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-live-2025-vibrant-visuals-flying-happy-ghast-and-everything-announced">everything announced at Minecraft Live 2025</a> for more on what's coming to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editorial Producer who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

During a recent interview with IGN, developer Mojang said it's determined to stick with the established "buy and own the game" approach, even now, 16 years after it came out. In short: don't expect Minecraft to go free-to-play any time soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, it doesn't really work with the way we built it," explained Ingela Garneij, executive producer of Minecraft Vanilla.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I mean we built the game for a different purpose. So monetization doesn't work in that way for us. It's a purchase of the game and then that's it. For us it's important that our game is available for as many people as possible. And so I think that's a very core value that it should be accessible for everyone. It's the best deal in the world.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the industry has evolved over the years, many games have made the jump to free-to-download but infested with battle pass and cosmetic pack waters, with mixed results. Examples include Overwatch 2’s decision to go free-to-play, Destiny 2, or Minecraft’s Microsoft stablemate Halo Infinite (at least when it comes to its multiplayer).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pressure is of course on video game publishers and developers to find new ways to monetize to survive, but this is seemingly a pressure not felt by Garneij and her Mojang teammates: “No, no. What's important for us is that many people can enjoy it still and that's going on strong still.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a sentiment expanded upon by Minecraft Vanilla’s game director, Agnes Larsson: ”I mean for me, it’s part of the important values of Minecraft. I think it's become such an important thing of what Minecraft is and the perfect culture and values, and I think we all here can agree on that. It's a thing for the game and it's one part of what makes the game strong. It has strong values.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Minecraft Vibrant Visuals Comparison Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Minecraft will continue to evolve without asking its players to spend money for new features, then. This is exemplified by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-upgrade-the-start-of-a-new-graphical-journey">the upcoming Vibrant Visuals graphics overhaul</a>, which arrives free of charge in the coming months. And with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mojang-rules-out-minecraft-2-do-you-think-were-going-to-have-an-earth-2">no plans for a Minecraft 2 on the horizon</a>, there’ll be no need to purchase the best-selling game of all time again any time soon.

Still, we do know it’s the top-selling game on Steam, where Ubisoft recently returned after years of PC launch exclusivity on the Epic Games Store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this article’s publication, Assassin’s Creed Shadows was on 58,894 concurrent players on Steam, enough to break into the top 30 most-played games on Valve’s platform. That peak is expected to rise as we continue into the game’s opening weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For comparison, Origins’ all-time Steam peak was 41,551, over seven years ago, and Odyssey’s was 62,069.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/playing-as-yasuke-in-assassins-creed-shadows-doesnt-feel-like-assassins-creed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playing-as-yasuke-in-shadows-doesn%E2%80%99t-feel-like-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-he%E2%80%99s-something-new.1142097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/playing-as-yasuke-in-assassins-creed-shadows-doesnt-feel-like-assassins-creed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to a renewed focus on the ideas the series was originally built on, Shadows is the most satisfying Assassin’s Creed has felt in years. You can fluidly move from ground to castle rooftop thanks to the best parkour system since Unity, and a grappling hook only makes the journey to a great vantage point even speedier. Perched on a tightrope high above the enemy, you’re only a drop away from scoring the perfect kill… provided you’re playing as Naoe, that is. Take control of Yasuke, Shadows’ second protagonist, and it’s a whole different game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yasuke is slow. He is clumsy. He can’t kill silently. And he climbs like a grandpa. He is the antithesis of an Assassin’s Creed protagonist. He is one of Ubisoft’s most baffling design choices… and one of its most fascinating. Because when I play as Yasuke, I don’t feel like I’m playing Assassin’s Creed anymore. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/15/ac-1715776356743.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yasuke changes the rules of Assassin's Creed, promoting grounded combat over parkour stealth. | Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I initially found this gulf between Yasuke’s ability set and the fundamental philosophy of the series to be incredibly frustrating. What is the point of an Assassin’s Creed protagonist who can barely climb and can’t perform a silent takedown? But the more I’ve played as him, the more I’ve seen merit in Yasuke’s design. He’s unquestionably flawed, but I think he addresses a couple of very important issues that Assassin’s Creed has struggled with over the past few years.      </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A brief starring role in Shadows’ prologue aside, you don’t get to play as Yasuke until several hours into the campaign. It means that your entire settling-in period is spent controlling Naoe, a swift shinobi who fulfills the “assassin” part of Assassin’s Creed better than any series protagonist has for a decade. Switching to Yasuke after playing as Naoe for so long is jarring. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This towering samurai is too big and too noisy to effectively sneak through enemy camps, and is barely capable of climbing anything higher than his own head. He cannot find a handhold in the jutting roofs that line Japan’s streets, and when you do find something he’s able to climb, he does so painfully slowly. On rooftops, he precariously balances on the apex, standing upright for all to see as he cautiously inches forward. These impairments to Yasuke’s climbing abilities introduce friction. Scaling environments can feel like a chore, with structures like scaffolding and ladders required to make any significant progress. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this doesn’t exactly <em>force </em>Yasuke to stay at ground level, but it certainly encourages it. This in turn denies him vision; without easy access to high vantage points it’s difficult to map out an area’s threats and plan accordingly. And where a grounded Naoe at least has the enemy-highlighting Eagle Vision to fall back on, Yasuke has nothing. Take up his blade and you’re agreeing to sacrifice almost everything other than raw strength.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Assassin's Creed is built on stealthy kills and vertical exploration, ideas that Yasuke is in direct opposition to.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If this sounds not a lot like Assassin’s Creed, it’s because it isn’t. The series has thus far been built around parkour-led exploration. Even when it has delved into areas of history where buildings were rarely more than one or two storeys high, verticality is still a core part of the flow. Being robbed of the series’ traditional climbing freedom and forced to follow more prescribed routes makes time spent as Yasuke feel much closer to playing Ghost of Tsushima than Assassin’s Creed – a feeling only emphasised by Yasuke’s lack of stealth training and reliance on his samurai sword skills. Embodying Yasuke is to play a game that’s first and foremost about fierce combat, something Tsushima is fondly remembered for and Assassin’s Creed often criticised over. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To play as Yasuke is to be asked to rethink how to play Assassin’s Creed. Historically, the series has allowed us to climb anywhere. Previous assassins have been knife-happy Spider-Men, armed with sticky hands that allow them to scale everything from towers to glaciers as if they were ladders. It is effortless and, as a result, it offers no challenge whatsoever. Yasuke changes this. While it’s true that there’s a lot beyond his grasp, careful observation of the environment reveals hidden pathways that have been built especially to allow Yasuke to reach his objectives. For instance, a leaning tree trunk protruding from an overcrop can lead you to a sync point that would otherwise be inaccessible without a grappling hook. A castle may have an open window on the second floor, easily entered if you follow the staircase-like arrangement of the courtyard’s exterior wall. Such paths are arguably more interesting to decipher than the practically thoughtless scrambles of past games.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These pathways only take Yasuke where he <em>needs </em>to be, though. He has much less freedom when it comes to general exploration, and it’s difficult to gain the high ground to observe enemy patrol patterns. But Yasuke really doesn’t abide by the traditional Assassin’s Creed approach of assessing guard movements and planning ahead. His only real stealth ability is the “Brutal Assassination” skill, and… well, it involves impaling an enemy on his sword, lifting them three feet off the ground, and yelling. Not exactly inconspicuous, is it? Rather than a takedown, it’s an opening move for combat, kicking things off with an instant kill. And when things do kick off, things get good. They get <em>really </em>good. Shadows boasts the best swordplay Assassin’s Creed has had in over a decade. There’s purpose to each strike and a rich variety of techniques to pull on – from brutal rush attacks to satisfying ripostes. Finishing moves cleave heads from shoulders, an image that creates a clear contrast between Yasuke’s abilities and Naoe’s stealthy approach. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/ac-shadows-yasuke-combat-1742486870466.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yasuke enjoys the best combat mechanics Assassin's Creed has ever had. | Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s more than just contrast here; the separation of combat and stealth into two characters means there’s less bleeding between the two styles. In Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, far too many quests used direct conflict as the default interaction. As such, action became their primary language. In Shadows, the twin protagonist system safeguards against that; Naoe’s relative fragility means she can’t go full slaughter mode, so when combat does break out you’re eventually forced to flee, reposition, and reset the stealth loop. When you want a break from that tension, Yasuke’s strength ensures you’ll be able to survive the worst Shadows can throw at you. It’s the power that he brings to the party that makes him such a tantalising prospect in combat, especially once his flashy skill tree full of abilities unlocks over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s strong intention within Yasuke’s design, then. But it’s nonetheless difficult to see where he fits into Assassin’s Creed – this is a series built on stealthy kills and vertical exploration, ideas that Yasuke is in direct opposition to. While it’s true that the likes of Bayek and Eivor stepped much too far into action territory, they were still able to perform the fundamental actions of an Assassin’s Creed lead character. They climbed to the apex of temples and wielded hidden blades. While it is thematically appropriate for Yasuke, who is a samurai and not an assassin, to be bad at stealth and climbing, his design simply means you can’t play Assassin’s Creed like Assassin’s Creed while in control of him. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real problem Yasuke faces, though, is his ally. Naoe is just the better option. She is, mechanically speaking, the best Assassin’s Creed protagonist in many years. Her stealth toolkit is complemented by Sengoku Period Japan, which allows for the towering verticality of architecture the series has been missing since Syndicate. Combined, these elements allow for an experience that truly fulfills the promise of Assassin’s Creed: becoming a highly mobile silent killer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoe also benefits from the design changes that shape Yasuke – while she can climb up to practically anywhere in the world, the “stick to every surface” mantra of the series has been scrapped in favour of something slightly more realistic. This means you still have to assess climbing routes and find anchor points for your grappling hook, but you can leap further and climb faster – these are the fundamental things that turn an open world into an Assassin’s Creed sandbox. And when you are on the ground and in the thick of it, Naoe’s combat flow feels just as ruthlessly violent and impactful as Yasuke’s. She benefits from all of the swordplay enhancements he enjoys, just with the caveat that she can’t endure battle for as long as her samurai friend can. All of this raises the question: why would you play as Yasuke when you can play as Naoe?   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Due to its admirable intent to offer two distinct playstyles with Yasuke and Naoe, Ubisoft has created a double-edged sword. The African samurai plays by very different rules to a classic Assassin’s Creed protagonist, which creates a contrasting and reasonably compelling experience that’s a genuine first for the series. But he is undeniably in direct opposition to the ideas upon which these games were built – ideas that remain largely unique in the open-world genre. So while I’ll always find time to return to Yasuke’s shoes to enjoy the vicious thrill of his blade, it’ll be through the eyes of Naoe that I truly explore Shadows’ world. Because when I play as Naoe, I feel like I’m playing Assassin’s Creed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
