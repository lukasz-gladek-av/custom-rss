            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2s-year-of-prophecy-heres-everything-guardians-need-to-know<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Get ready, Guardian — Bungie just unveiled what's coming up in its sci-fi shooter, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2"><u>Destiny 2</u></a>, including two new expansions and major seasonal and core game updates coming to both paying and free players, all badged under the "Year of Prophecy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Year of Prophecy is the first year to boast four "major content beats," with two paid expansions and two major updates. The former is paid content while the latter will be available to all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First up is Rite of the Nine, a "fresh take on dungeon diving for both seasoned dungeon crawlers and those stepping into the depths for the first time" that is already available to all players for no additional cost. While the dungeons themselves — Prophecy, Spire of the Watcher, and Ghosts of the Deep — will be familiar to some, even the most hardened Guardian can expect "unique twists" in which you'll reconnect with Orin and refreshed dungeon weapons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, on July 15, we'll get the brand-new expansion, Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate, a "multiyear saga that will unfold across multiple expansions." A paid-for expansion, The Edge of Fate will reintroduce us to the Nine, powerful and mysterious beings who existed long before the Traveler, as two characters "step into the spotlight" — new ally Lodi and Warlock Vanguard, Ikora.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expansion will take place on new destination Kepler, described as "inspired by the puzzle-solving and pathfinding challenges of Destiny 2’s dungeons and destination design which encourages deep exploration, mystery, and player-driven discovery." Expect new enemies, weapons, gear, and "destination-specific abilities."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, on July 15, "major core game innovations" will roll out, including revised armor and gear systems "to create richer opportunities for buildcrafting" and a new activity selection screen called the Portal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Players will be able to easily choose between Fireteam Ops, Pinnacle Ops, Crucible Ops, and the newly introduced Solo Ops," Bungie explained. "Fireteam Ops and Pinnacle Ops reinforce quick fireteam action and longer-form cooperative content, while the new Solo Ops activities are specifically designed for solo players who want short, self-contained gameplay sessions without the need for a fireteam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Additionally, players can tailor activities to match their desired gameplay and the specific rewards they are chasing. 50 all-new modifiers will allow deeper gameplay customization and offer greater challenges for players, while curated activity rotations will ensure there is always something new to chase."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As typically happens with a new expansion, pre-order sweeteners are available, including an instantly unlockable Exotic Ghost and Legendary Emblem. We've listed the full spoils below:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Destiny 2 Pre-Order Details</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Edge of Fate Pre-Order includes:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Edge of Fate Campaign</li><li>New Raid</li><li>1x Active Rewards Pass</li><li>Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ghost (instant unlock)</li><li>Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (instant unlock)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Year of Prophecy Edition Pre-Order includes:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Edge of Fate and Renegades Campaigns</li><li>New Raid and Dungeon</li><li>1x Active Rewards Pass</li><li>3x Rewards Passes</li><li>The Edge of Fate Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ghost (instant unlock)</li><li>The Edge of Fate Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (instant unlock)</li><li>Renegades Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ship (available September 9, 2025)</li><li>Renegades Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (available September 9, 2025)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition Pre-Order includes:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Edge of Fate and Renegades Campaigns</li><li>New Raid and Dungeon</li><li>1x Active Rewards Pass</li><li>3x Rewards Passes</li><li>Instant Unlock Exotic Sniper Rifle: New Land Beyond<ul data-cy="list"><li>New Land Beyond Ornament and Catalyst (available at launch of Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate)</li></ul></li><li>The Edge of Fate Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ghost (instant unlock)</li><li>The Edge of Fate Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (instant unlock)</li><li>Renegades Pre-Order Exclusive Exotic Ship (available September 9, 2025)</li><li>Renegades Pre-Order Exclusive Legendary Emblem (available September 9, 2025)</li><li>Year of Prophecy Exotic Emote (instant unlock)</li><li>Year of Prophecy Exotic Sparrow (available July 15, 2025)</li><li>Dark Side Legends Bundle (3 full armor ornament sets, 1 for each class, instant unlock)</li><li>Secret Stash (1x Exotic Cosmetic, 1x Exotic Cipher, 2x Ascendant Alloys, 3x Ascendant Shards, delivered with each seasonal update)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">A Year of Prophecy Collector's Edition is also available, although pre-orders for the physical edition have already entirely sold out at the time of writing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From September 9, a second major update will go live — Ash &amp; Iron — with the second expansion of the year, Renegades, going live on December 2.

The news was revealed on the official X account of Turki Alalshikh, the Chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority. Alalshikh acquired American publication The Ring back in November 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the tweet, the untitled game will feature original characters and combine "The Ring’s unmatched authority in boxing with game developer Dimps’ decades-long experience in crafting classic games."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Together with legendary Japanese video game designer Takashi Nishiyama, I am proud to announce a forthcoming boxing game presented by The Ring featuring original characters. </p><p>This strategic partnership between myself and Nishiyama brings together our unmatched authority in… <a href="https://t.co/LRWyyZzkpz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LRWyyZzkpz</a></p></div>— TURKI ALALSHIKH (@Turki_alalshikh) <a href="https://twitter.com/Turki_alalshikh/status/1919238688808051145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Dimps is Takashi Nishiyama’s company. Its most recent game was Freedom Wars Remastered, a reworking of a PlayStation Vita game for modern consoles released in January 2025. According to the tweet from Alalshikh, development of the boxing title will begin soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Saudi Arabian royal family has become increasingly invested in Japan’s gaming industry in recent years. In April 2024, it was revealed that 100% of Japanese game company SNK’s shares were now owned by the Saudi Crown Prince’s foundation. The Ring Magazine has also been involved in promoting SNK’s upcoming Fatal Fury: City of Wolves, hosting a <a href="https://www.boxxer.com/events/fatal-fury-chris-eubank-jr-vs-conor-benn-26-apr-2025-tottenham-hotspur-stadium-london/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>boxing match collaboration</u></a> at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London on April 26, 2025. Of course, Nishiyama himself previously worked at SNK in the 1990s, creating the Fatal Fury series and producing many games in flagship SNK series like Metal Slug and King of Fighters.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Fighting Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese people’s reactions to the announcement of The Ring x Dimps collaboration so far have generally ranged from <a href="https://x.com/muuko_ht_e/status/1919361396342657243" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>surprised reactions</u></a> of “What?!!

It will be interesting to see whether The Ring and Dimps’ new boxing game goes for a realistic or rule-breaking approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

In a post on its <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/3eFYYUUqzOpOSv086XWMh9/starfield-update-notes-may" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, Bethesda called for feedback, and published patch notes, below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This update does little more than add a few new features and make bug fixes, which means Starfield players are still waiting for news on potential DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space-set RPG Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years. But it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite reaching 15 million players, some wondered whether Bethesda might walk away from Starfield to focus on its other franchises. Bethesda itself has said it has "exciting things" planned for Starfield this year, amid growing discontent from players about a lack of communication and updates. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would release following Shattered Space. In an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-logo-pops-up-on-work-in-progress-starfield-creation-sparking-ps5-release-speculation">speculation that <u>Starfield</u> would soon be confirmed for release on PlayStation 5</a> ramped up after fans spotted a PlayStation logo on Bethesda’s official Creations website. The logo was attached to a work-in-progress ship decals Creation for Starfield, and although the Creation was removed, fans were left wondering whether Bethesda’s so-far PC and Xbox-only sci-fi game would soon make the jump to PS5.</p><div id="ranking-the-best-starfield-companions-and-crew" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ranking the Best Starfield Companions and Crew</h3><h3>Ranking the Best Starfield Companions and Crew</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s easy to forget about Starfield given all the attention on Oblivion Remastered, its players are hoping that Microsoft and Bethesda go big on Starfield at its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-xbox-games-showcase-2025-for-june-plus-the-outer-worlds-2-direct">Xbox Games Showcase broadcast</a> on June 8.

Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade made some improvements to the PS4 version’s graphics and lighting, and also included Remake’s Intermission DLC, which centers on plucky ninja Yuffie’s arrival in Midgar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade is currently available on PS5 and PC. However, Hamaguchi revealed that with the Switch 2’s improvements over its predecessor, it will be possible to bring the game to Nintendo's handheld platform. “With the power of the Switch 2, we can now recreate Midgar with full specs,” he stated.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Being able to play this game on the Switch 2 in handheld mode means you can play it on the train while commuting to work,” Hamaguchi added, saying that the portability will also make it easier for people to directly discuss and show others the game and their progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 version will also incorporate GameChat, enabling players to talk to friends while playing and share their screens in real time. “I’m very excited to see this game playable on a portable system,” Hamaguchi enthused, adding that “I have high hopes that we can build a strong partnership between Nintendo and the Final Fantasy brand.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although only Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade has been confirmed for Switch 2 so far, Hamaguchi ended with, “I hope players are looking forward to the Final Fantasy VII Remake series on Switch 2,” suggesting that Rebirth and the upcoming final entry in the trilogy will also see Switch 2 releases in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the Final Fantasy series originally started out on Nintendo consoles, before switching to the PlayStation 1 and its CD-ROM format for Final Fantasy VII, the first 3D entry, in 1997.
