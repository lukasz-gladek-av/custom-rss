            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics card scored a 10/10 in our review.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to upgrade your gaming PC and want to keep your budget to under $1,500, then one deal stands out above all the rest. Walmart is offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqw1wD?object_uuid=2fdebc24-4973-4a58-9bb6-d71f73326a58&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iBuypower Element Pro gaming PC</a> equipped with an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU for just $1499 with free delivery. This was the best "high-end" gaming PC deal during Prime Day - better than anything I found on Amazon - and it's still the best deal I've seen so far at this price point. The Radeon RX 9070 XT is an outstanding graphics card that can run the latest games (like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer">Battlefield 6</a>) in 4K.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">iBuypower Element Pro Radeon RX 9070 XT Gaming PC $1499</h2><div catalogid="bfc43746-9b7c-42f7-b829-b608cfd87865" id="224881"><div id="224881" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>iBuypower Element Pro AMD Ryzen 9 7900X Radeon RX 9070 XT Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The iBuypower gaming PC is generously equipped across the board. It features an AMD Ryzen 9 7900X CPU, Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and 2TB M.2 SSD. The Ryzen 9 7900X processor has a max boost clock of 5.6GHz with 12 cores and 24 threads. This is an excellent CPU for both gaming and multi-tasking and you won't need to upgrade from it for a long time. It's cooled by a very robust 360mm all-in-one liquid cooling system and run off an 850W power supply.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Radeon RX 9070 XT Received a 10/10 at IGN</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We rated the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT a "perfect" 10/10. Even though it costs $150 less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the 9070 XT beats it out in several of the games we tested. In a few benchmarks, the results aren't even close. The 9070 XT is also comparable in performance to the older $1,000 RX 7900 XTX but with better ray tracing and upscaling performance than its predecessor. It does lose out on VRAM (16GB vs 24GB), but that isn't really an issue for gaming. By "4K ready" I mean that this gaming PC can run pretty much any game at 4K resolution and at framerates of 60fps or higher. Any video card that's weaker and you'll have to compromise in order to get playable framerates. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Battlefield 6 Beta Runs This Weekend</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is out in October and there's one final open beta that runs August 14-17. It's shaping up to be a solid game that goes back to its true roots . Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-preview">initial impressions of the beta</a> and go ahead and <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-open-beta" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try the game</a>. Battlefield 6 has <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/system-requirements" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fairly lax requirements</a> for a new release title; EA recommends at last a GeForce RTX 3060 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT GPU to achieve 30fps at 1080p, although an RTX 4080 or more powerful GPU is recommended for gaming in 4K.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Check out more Alienware Back to School deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

The first is that the Triangulate code was input incorrectly. Check the spelling and that the case is correct, then redeem again. You can even copy and paste the codes directly from this article over to Roblox if you want to make sure you’re inputting them correctly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other possibility is that the code has expired or you’ve already used it. In this scenario, you should see an error message pop up at the top of the window informing you that the code has already been redeemed or is invalid.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Triangulate Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to stay up to date with Triangulate codes, you'll want to keep your eye on the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/triangulate" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Discord server</a>. Become an official member, and then check the <strong>Announcements channel</strong>. Whenever new codes are added, chances are you'll find them posted here!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Triangulate in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Triangulate is a Roblox game all about making cold, hard cash by selling stacks of... well, triangles. Playing alone or with friends, you'll enter a circular zone with a vent that dumps out piles of triangles that you then have to transfer into a bucket on the opposite side of the room. You'll have a quota to hit each round before a timer on the wall hits zero, with the quota increasing between rounds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To keep the cash flowing in, you'll need to devise smart new ways to transfer triangles, using conveyor belts you can buy from the breakroom between rounds to construct inventive triangle-delivering contraptions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.

That's one of the best prices I've seen for an RTX 5080 prebuilt, which is impressive considering you would typically pay more for the Alienware brand. Although GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card prices are trending downwards, you still can't find it for under $1,000, so you'd be hard pressed to build your own diy PC for cheaper.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Alienware Aurora RTX 5080 Gaming PC From $2,149.99</h2><div id="215911" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="a25177bf-886b-4d72-b109-40de6e2e9e15"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5080 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)</h3></p></div><div id="225993" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="a25177bf-886b-4d72-b109-40de6e2e9e15"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 9 285K RTX 5080 Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)</h3></p></div><div catalogid="a25177bf-886b-4d72-b109-40de6e2e9e15" id="221539"><div id="221539" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 9 285K RTX 5080 Gaming PC (64GB/2TB)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three tiers of this Alienware RTX 5080 gaming PC currently discounted.

This is a good all-around CPU for gaming, multi-tasking, and general workstation performance. For gaming, you won't see much of an improvement upgrading to a Core Ultra 9, especially if you plan to play at high resolutions where the GPU makes much more of an impact. However for multi-tasking and workstation and creator tasks, the Core Ultra 9 is superior because it has significantly more cores.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The GeForce RTX 5080 GPU will run any game in 4K</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The RTX 5080 is the second best Blackwell graphics card, surpassed only by the $2,000 RTX 5090. It's about 5%-10% faster than the previous generation RTX 4080 Super, which is discontinued and no longer available. In games that support the new DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation exclusive to Blackwell cards, the gap widens.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Scientists have identified a new species of ancient whale with cartoonish bulging eyes that they say would have made it look like a Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A precursor to today's modern whale species, the 25 million-year-old creature was "deceptively cute," according to Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of vertebrate paleontology at Australia's Museums Victoria Research Institute, as reported by the <a href="https://torontosun.com/news/weird/scientists-discover-an-ancient-whale-with-a-pokemon-face-and-a-predator-bite" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toronto Sun</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It might have looked for all the world like some weird kind of mash-up between a whale, a seal and a Pokémon," Fitzgerald said, before clarifying, "but they were very much their own thing."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/australia-prehistoric-whale-298134545-e1755256162696-1755274869824.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The newly-identified <em>Janjucetus dullardi</em>, part whale, part seal, part Pokémon. Image credit: Ruairidh Duncan/AP.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the species, officially named Janjucetus dullardi, might have looked like something you could pop out of a Pokéball, in reality they would have been something you'd probably want to stay clear of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Described as a feral predator with a super effective bite, the specimen is estimated to have once been around the size of a single bed, despite only being a juvenile. Still, much of the species' full appearance remains a mystery, as only a partial skull and teeth have so far been found.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They may have had tiny little nubbins of legs just projecting as stumps from the wall of the body," Fitzgerald continued. Adorable!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Janjucetus dullardi has been placed as a member of the rare mammalodontids group of ancient whales that existed 34-23 million years ago, which later evolved into the humpbacks and minke whales of today. Or in Pokémon terms, it would have definitely been Water-type.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The species has been named after amateur fossil hunter and high school principal Ross Dullard, who contacted Museums Victoria after unearthing the skull on a local beach. Confirming it did indeed belong to a previously-unknown species has since taken six years of research — a lot longer than simply registering it to a Pokédex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, however, has finally brought that confirmation — something Dullard says has given him "the greatest 24 hours of my life" and "high fives coming left, right and center" when he was greeted on his high school campus the following day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's taken my concentration for six years," Dullard said. "I've had sleepless nights. I've dreamt about this whale."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, how about returning it to life, Helix Fossil style?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
