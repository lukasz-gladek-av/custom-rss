            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has quietly fixed a door in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> that had left Dark Brotherhood lore fans scratching their heads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potential spoilers for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s cast our minds back to April and the hugely successful release of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Soon after launch, players of the original, much-loved open-world role-playing game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-some-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-lore-fans-are-disappointed-with-oblivion-remastereds-new-dark-brotherhood-door">noticed the door to the Dark Brotherhood’s Cheydinhal sanctuary entrance was inexplicably changed in a way that broke the lore</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The door in question is at the centre of an iconic moment in Oblivion, one players who took on the excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/The_Dark_Brotherhood"><u>Dark Brotherhood quest</u></a> will probably remember well. In the original Oblivion, the glowing door has a heavy mood aesthetic and a relief showing the Night Mother (who members of the assassination-obsessed Dark Brotherhood worship) murdering five children. The Oblivion Remastered version of this door has no glow, is light on atmosphere and, weirdly, has two extra children.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see a comparison with accompanying complaint in the reddit post from alvaro-elite, below:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls lore fans were quick to point out that the addition of two kids on the relief makes no sense given what we know about the story of the Night Mother. This moment in time is meant to represent the Night Mother’s murdering of the five children she conceived with Sithis, the Elder Scrolls deity who represents emptiness and the Void. As the story goes, the Night Mother is murdered by the locals for killing her kids, which turns her into the immortal Night Mother in the first place. In fact, in Oblivion, the Night Mother’s tomb includes skeletal remains of one adult and five children, reinforcing this lore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had wondered whether Bethesda and developer Virtuos would patch Oblivion Remastered to change the door to be lore compliant, and so it has proved. As noticed by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/oblivion-remastereds-latest-patch-stealthily-fixed-the-most-lore-breaking-door-in-videogames/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-update-12-finally-adds-performance-improvements-tunes-journeyman-difficulty-setting">the recent release of Update 1.2 in Steam beta form</a>, those who have opted in to test the patch now have a lore-compliant door with five children, rather than seven in the relief. Strangely, this change isn’t in the officially released patch notes, below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expectation is this new door is what Oblivion Remastered will include across the board when Update 1.2 launches fully.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out our comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil"><u>Interactive Map</u></a>, complete Walkthroughs for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Main_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>Main Questline</u></a> and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Guilds"><u>Guild Quest</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Character_Building_Guide"><u>How to Build the Perfect Character</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Things_to_Do_First_in_Oblivion"><u>Things to Do First</u></a>, every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/PC_Cheats_and_Console_Commands"><u>PC Cheat Code</u></a>, and much more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered update 1.2 patch notes:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>SETTINGS CHANGES</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>We’ve added additional difficulty settings to allow players to further tune their “Player Combat Damage” &amp; “Enemy Combat Damage”.

So, even if you did start playing on Switch 1 and then decide to later fully re-purchase the Switch 2 edition, you'd need to start your playthrough again from scratch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, the only Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake item that does seem to be cross-compatible is a save data bonus for an in-game Dog Suit (in Dragon Quest 1) and Cat Suit (in Dragon Quest 2). These will unlock if you buy a Switch 2 version of the game, if you previously unlocked them with a Switch 1 copy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each version has different graphical specifications based on the hardware's processing capabilities," Square Enix wrote of the remake's differences on Switch 2. "However, there are no differences in the story, game content, or in which items can be obtained."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher has given no reason why the two versions of the game remain separate, without a $10 paid-for upgrade option (as with similar third-party Switch 2 games such as Hogwarts Legacy and Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds) or the situation, as found by fans with many other Switch 1 games, where some titles simply run better on Nintendo's newer hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix is set to launch its Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake on October 30, 2025, for PC (via Steam and Microsoft Store), PS5, Switch, Switch 2, and Xbox Series X/S. Just remember to be careful which version you're buying</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In a way, Dragon Quest’s, let’s say 'classic' storyline and trope-ish setting is easier to appreciate today than maybe a decade ago," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-first-impressions-classic-dq-has-never-looked-so-good"><u>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake preview</u></a>. "Nowadays, with graphics as advanced as they are and storylines trying to compete with the biggest movies and TV shows, Dragon Quest is a reminder that some stories are timeless for a reason."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

As detailed in the "Character Art" section pertaining to base game update changes, the update says, "Added clothing to a character in A Lethal Obsession, Narcos, and some characters in the mission Hide and Seek," evidencing it is pressing on with one of the more controversial changes, which was to cover up nudity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the hundreds of comments left by players, many are unhappy VOID has gone ahead with the amendments.

At the time, VOID insisted the changes were "small enough that most people here wouldn't notice if we didn't say anything," but it "wanted to be transparent" with its players.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"... boy, that game sucked."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A former head of communications at Dead Island 2 publisher Deep Silver has opened up about the "eight-year product delay" <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-island-2"><u>Dead Island 2</u></a> endured after early playtests reported "horrific feedback."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of a Develop:Brighton talk as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-would-have-killed-the-franchise-insights-into-the-scrapped-2014-version-of-dead-island-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesIndustry.biz</u></a>, Martin Wein — now at GameFlex Consultants — talked candidly about the sequel's troubled development, and how it was decided at a major milestone meeting with then-developer, Yager, that the game as it was then "sucked."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead Island 2 was revealed at E3 2014 but soon went quiet before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/15/yager-managing-director-discusses-being-dropped-from-dead-island-2"><u>"mutual differences" separated Yager from Deep Silver</u></a>. It was then moved to Sumo Digital before being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/08/14/dead-island-2-is-officially-on-its-third-developer"><u>shifted again in 2019 to its final home of Dambuster Studios</u></a>. A new trailer and gameplay video was released on December 6, 2022, during a Dead Island 2 Showcase that announced it was delayed once again, slipping 12 weeks to April 2023. It was the first proper look at the game fans had since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-island-2-new-trailer-release-date-february-2023"><u>it was re-revealed after years of troubled development in August 2022</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was working on that with the creative team, and we were mightily proud of that [trailer]," Wein said. "But then, about three to four weeks later, we had a major milestone with the development studio that was in charge at that time. And boy, that game sucked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It had nothing to do with what [made] the original Dead Island [...] really fun. So we commissioned a play test and got horrific feedback. And we sat down with the development team and said, 'Okay, what's the course of action?' And they said, 'Yeah, leave it with us.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But at the next touch-point, Wein said little had changed, with playtest feedback indicating the sequel was "not fun, not engaging, [and] does not feel like the Dead Island that I played."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So at the end of the day, we had to take the game away from that external developer, find a new studio, and that put the game on a journey of… well, it was supposed to launch in 2015. When did it come out? 2023?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Sometimes you have to make hard decisions," Wein added. "Because we could have, at that point, put out a sh*t game. It might have made some money, but it would have killed the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I cannot really speak to the conversation between the production team and the development partner as I was not part of those, but as the developer wanted to pursue their vision rather than follow player feedback, the ultimate decision was made to part ways."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it did finally release in 2023, IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-island-2-review"><u>Dead Island 2's review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: "Dead Island 2 is a hilarious gore-fest and a competent zombie-slaying adventure, but lacks creativity outside of its great sense of humor."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
