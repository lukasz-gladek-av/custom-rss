As explained in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign review</u></a>: "Let’s get the most important caveat out of the way first: if you are hoping to tackle Nightreign entirely solo, and are anything less than a hardcore Elden Ring player that actively seeks out ways to make that already difficult game even more challenging, Nightreign isn’t for you. Yes, there is technically a single-player option, but it is so poorly balanced that I would be shocked if it isn’t patched and adjusted within the first month of release. And this is coming from someone who lives and breathes these types of games."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the update increases the number of high-rarity Relics that can be obtained as a reward when reaching Day 3 during Expeditions, and increases the probability of obtaining high-rarity Relics from Scenic Flat stones purchased at the Small Jar Bazaar. The patch notes, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published by Bandai Namco</a>, are in full below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the weekend, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-matchmaking-not-working-fromsoftware-has-some-suggestions">FromSoftware acknowledged matchmaking issues on Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, and offered suggestions to players affected. There had already been some negative reaction, mostly due to Nightreign's lack of duos co-op, lack of voice chat, and other archaic mechanics. That age-old multiplayer struggle to find enough friends to make up a coordinated three-player group is very much a part of the Elden Ring Nightreign experience, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, producer Yasuhiro Kitao <a href="https://x.com/YasuhiroKitao/status/1928475446217163233" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to comment on Elden Ring Nightreign’s early sales success (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-sells-2-million-units-on-the-first-day">2 million units in its first day</a>). “Nightreign has some peculiar aspects to its game design and is different from our recent titles in various ways,” Kitao said. “Nonetheless, many of you have bravely jumped into this world, and for that we're immensely grateful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As with Demon's Souls or Sekiro, it may be confounding at first, but just like those games, Nightreign offers its own challenges and experiences. Once you overcome the initial hurdle, it'll surely provide a sense of accomplishment that's also its very own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hope you enjoy it.”</p><output

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2.1204350/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s big reveal of the Switch 2 back in April came with many surprises, but perhaps the most unexpected of them was that Cyberpunk 2077 was among the launch lineup. While the Switch 2 may be a whole new generation for Nintendo, the console is – much like its predecessor – relatively modest when it comes to hardware horsepower. Cyberpunk 2077, meanwhile, is one of the most technically ambitious video games ever made. Not only that, but the Switch 2 version is the complete package, including the Phantom Liberty expansion that was designed with PS5, Xbox Series, and high-end PC specs in mind. And so all this poses a big question: how has developer CD Projekt Red put Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2? Is this a case of forbidden blood magic, or has the studio made deep compromises to the experience? The answer is neither. In fact, this isn’t quite the impossible port it seems from the outside. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We really thought it was going to be more of a challenge,” says Charles Tremblay, VP of Technology at CD Projekt Red. “But in the end, [it was] not that much.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The road to Cyberpunk 2077’s Switch 2 version began back in summer 2023, when Nintendo met with CD Projekt Red to discuss its then top-secret new hardware. “At that point [there was] no Software Development Kit,” explains Tremblay. “Just more like ‘Okay, is there a possibility for us to collaborate with this hardware?’ I remember I was in the room and we just looked at each other. It was like, ‘Yeah of course we will check it [out], it looks like a really cool product.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt Red had, of course, already worked with Nintendo before. The Witcher 3 had been ported to the original Switch in 2019, although development duties were handled by Saber Interactive rather than CDPR itself. This time around things had to be different, in part due to the fact that the Switch 2 had yet to be publicly announced and so needed to be kept a closely-guarded secret. “It was way easier to have a very super small team working end-to-end with Nintendo rather than delegating the process,” says Tremblay.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another important factor in keeping the development in-house was simply the studio’s knowledge and expertise in Cyberpunk 2077 itself. “We have very key people in here that know exactly how to make Cyberpunk run,” Tremblay says. And those people would be vital, as the Switch 2 version required many elements of the game to be re-engineered. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Cyberpunk is built for x86 with old PC architecture,” explains Tremblay. “So this from the beginning was completely different. Lots of changes had to be done at the engine level, all the shaders [are in a] different language. We had to convert everything, some HLSL to GLSL. [The Switch 2 uses] a very, very different architecture.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another thing the team had to contend with was that the Switch 2 has fewer computational cores available than any other platform Cyberpunk has been built for, including previous generation consoles. “We have at least one core we share with the OS [operating system],” Tremblay reveals. That narrowing of resources means that where once there was core space available to enhance performance, that space now has to be used for activities such as decompression or IO operation. “This was one of the struggles we had, but otherwise I think it was surprisingly fast to get the game running on the platform. We were all super impressed.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s the same great experience, but not competing with the high-end quality path tracing on PC that you can have. This is not the goal. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the early stages of production, one of the main aims was simply to “try to figure out if [running Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 is] even possible.” As it became clear that the hardware was capable, a key tool in ensuring the experience was as strong as possible was Nvidia’s DLSS system. This rendering technology uses artificial intelligence to upscale lower resolutions and generate additional frames, resulting in sharper images with increased framerates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With DLSS it definitely increases the quality that you can have, on the go and on the TV,” says Tremblay. “That being said, the technology we built scales very well across all the platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can adjust the crowd density, we can adjust the fidelity we want the characters to have when we switch levels of detail,” he explains. “So it was very, very easy. And, of course, the DLSS helped to bring the quality to another level, but I think all of those things together makes the port very good.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the Switch 2’s hardware specifications were released to the world, the go-to comparison has been a PlayStation 4. That’s a solid enough base for a handheld device, but it does set off alarm bells when it comes to Cyberpunk 2077 – a game that infamously ran terribly on that generation of consoles. So if the Switch 2 is like a PS4, that means that Cyberpunk will be awful on it, right? Not so much. While the consoles share similarities, the Switch 2 benefits from many modern technologies. DLSS is one of them, but there are several other factors. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was very difficult for the previous generation of consoles,” Tremblay admits. “I think I will say that the most difficult problem was the mechanical hard drive, which is one of the things that’s very important not to have.” The Switch 2 uses bespoke cartridges, but more importantly it supports the new microSD Express storage system that features faster data read and write speeds, “which is great” according to Tremblay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Switch 2  has more RAM [than the previous generation of consoles], which is also very important,” he adds. All this means that not only does the Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077 run better than the PS4 and Xbox One versions, but it also includes the Phantom Liberty expansion, which was much too demanding for old tech and thus was not released on last-gen systems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Make no mistake, some extra RAM, better storage, and DLSS doesn’t miraculously turn the Switch 2 into a high-end PC. And so Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo’s new console is not the same experience as it is on a RTX 5090-powered rig. The content is the same – the same missions, streets, characters, and weapons – but the resolution and framerates are reigned in to ensure compatibility with the Switch 2’s specifications. Similar to the Xbox and PlayStation versions, there are two visual options to choose from: quality mode hits 1080p/30fps, while the performance mode targets 40fps at 1080p when docked, or 40fps at 720p on the system’s own screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not just about resolution and framerates, though. The team at CD Projekt Red carefully combed through the game to assess what changes they could make to ensure Cyberpunk was more Switch 2-friendly. “We have people that are super experienced about the game and they really looked at what kind of parity we want to have with other platforms, whatever compromise [we made],” Tremblay explains. “We do a lot of iteration with them. So if we reduce the quality of [an element] and we play the game, we figure out ‘Okay, this is great’ or ‘This is not.’ And some of the people that have very, very good eyes can make those calls and we always try to compromise performance versus quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We do have some people that are literally tweaking the settings, playing the games continuously, to figure out what kind of resolution compromise we can have, what kind of quality settings we can have to make the best experience for the players.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/cyberpunk2077-ns2-panam-1920x1080-clean-1748594592954.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A screenshot from the Switch 2 version of Cybperunk 2077. | Image credit: CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Switch 2 has understandable limitations, CD Projekt Red has firm quality bars that it wishes to adhere to. That includes a minimum frame rate of 30 frames per second. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So just to be clear, if it goes under 30fps, I don't think that's great,” Tremblay states. “There's no such thing as ‘Oh, this is fine to get 25 [fps in this section.’] No it's not, it should be 30fps everywhere.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While 60fps has become the widely accepted golden standard by many developers and players, hitting that bar on Switch 2 hardware with a game as complex as Cyberpunk 2077 is a tall ask. It’s why the performance mode targets a middle ground.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the 40fps is a very good compromise to the 60fps,” Tremblay says. “Honestly, I think it's a game changer, at least for me as a gamer. And we have the same on docked mode. The difference is that on docked mode it's dependent on your TV setting. So if you have a 120Hz refresh rate, then you can have the 40fps mode.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this talk of frame rates, resolutions, and compromises ignores the real strengths of the Switch 2 version, though. Nintendo’s hardware provides a unique approach that CDPR has embraced. “I think that on the handheld device, I think the experience is very good,” says Tremblay. “I think the experience that we have, that is way different than other platforms, with the gyros, the Joy-Con, the mouse support. I think the whole package in general, I think it's quite good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CDPR has gone all-in on these features. Motion controls allow you to augment the shooting mechanics with subtle movements of the Joy-Cons. If you’re looking for something more precise, you can turn the right-hand controller on its side and use it as a mouse, resulting in an aiming experience closer to that used by the PC version. And, of course, all this can be done on a bus, a plane, or at the bottom of your garden. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do think that all those things that the platform introduced [is] what makes this version different,” Tremblay says. “At the same time [it’s] the same great experience, don't get me wrong, but different, but not competing with the high-end quality path tracing on PC that you can have. This is not the goal, but the platform as a whole I think stands on its own.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last point is the real key to understanding the Switch 2 port. The whole project is about making a great version – not the greatest version – of Cyberpunk 2077. And even then, that measurement of ‘greatest’ depends on your priorities. If you already have a PC or a PS5 and you demand a silky-smooth framerate at 4K, then maybe the Switch 2 version isn’t a great fit for you. But if you’re primarily a Mario fan who only buys Nintendo consoles, then this new version of Cyberpunk 2077 is the greatest version, because finally there is a version for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for those with both systems, there’s flexibility. “We have the cross save,” says Tremblay. “You can go to your home, you play on PC, and if you want to go, if you want to continue your game, it's no big deal. You just take your save. So for me, it's definitely the handheld device to play on the go. It's a system seller for me, for sure.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

"We cannot do so many things we would love to do — we are <em>tempted</em> to do. We tried and it didn't work out. We have to focus on what we are good at, and really put 100% into it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's why we switched from a single project company to the multiple project," Badowski added.
