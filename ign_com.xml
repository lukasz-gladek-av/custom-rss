This month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/immortals-of-aveum">Immortals of Aveum</a> headlines the bundle, with seven other games like Total War: Pharoah Dynasties, Fabledom, and more included. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars to grab these games individually, you can get all eight games for just $11.99 at Humble Bundle for this month only.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Humble Choice Games for February 2025</h2><div catalogid="0687e5ea-609a-4b6c-9fb6-791577e0cc24" id="214728"><div id="214728" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Humble Choice - February 2025</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Immortals of Aveum</li><li>Trepang2</li><li>Total War: Pharoah Dynasties</li><li>Fabledom</li><li>Griftlands</li><li>Tales &amp; Tactics</li><li>Naheulbeuk's Dungeon Master</li><li>My Little Universe</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Each month, Humble Choice curates a selection of games for members to redeem. These games are sent as Steam codes, which are yours to keep forever. You can even send them to a friend if you already have the game or want to gift one! For February, Immortals of Aveum is well worth the price of this package alone, receiving <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/immortals-of-aveum-review">an 8/10 in our review</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Immortals of Aveum is an impressively confident first-person shooter that successfully trades muzzles and magazines for mages and magic. Its fast-paced, spellcasting combat is both satisfying to master and spectacular to look at, and it features a lengthy and hearty campaign packed with secrets to keep us going well after the story has wrapped. As someone who desperately hopes that unapologetically single-player shooters will live forever, these Immortals have done a great job of making sure they’re definitely not dead yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these games, you can also score up to 20% off select games on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Store</a>. The longer that you have an active subscription, the more rewards you can unlock. 5% of each Humble Choice purchase also supports a charity that rotates monthly, with February's supporting United Negro College Fund, an organization that works to increase the total annual number of African American college graduates. Don't miss out on this month's Humble Choice selection!</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Feb 4, 2025 10:15 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While that does mean there are only a few tangible additions, such as that new island and fruit, the team made sure to include a solid group of balance adjustments to help keep its swashbuckling Roblox experience smooth across the board.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/04/grand-piece-online-mini-update-1738634012107.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Piece Online February mini update adds new island, fruit, and balance changes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can find Turtleback Cave north of Rose Kingdom in the Second Sea. Those who make the trek will find a new boss: Juzo the Diamondback. Defeating the enemy rewards players with the Turtleback Armor and Turtleback Helmet, with kills also including a 5% chance to drop the Kira fruit and a lower chance to drop a Mythical Fruit Chest. There’s also a new player list that shows crew and player names, as well as a list of crew adjustments, which include five new crew shop items, eight total crew shop slots, and the option to purchase current and out-of-rotation battle pass outfits from the crew shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for those Grand Piece Online balance tweaks, players will find that Arena Storm has been removed in favor of a new countdown system. The change will see winners determined by damage dealt and stocks remaining at the end of the countdown. There have also been adjustments to Tori, Pteranodon, Buddha, Venom, Yuki, Gold, Zushi, and many more, as Grand Quest Games aims to level the playing field.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Piece Online launched all the way back in 2018, and although the patch does fall under the “mini update” category, it shows the team is still going strong as it sails into 2025. The last notable update brought Water and Travel changes on January 17, so while there is no date regarding when players can expect to see the next update run aground, we likely won’t have to wait too long for more news. Until then, you can see our list of all active Grand Piece Online codes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-piece-online-codes">here</a> and the full mini-update patch notes below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grand Piece Online February Mini Update Patch Notes</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">New Content:</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Island:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Turtleback Cave</p><p data-cy="paragraph">  - Located in the Second Sea, north of Rose Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">  - New Boss: Juzo the Diamondback</p><p data-cy="paragraph">	- Drops: Turtleback Armor &amp; Turtleback Helmet</p><p data-cy="paragraph">	- 5% chance to drop the Kira Fruit</p><p data-cy="paragraph">	- Very low chance to drop a Mythical Fruit Chest</p><p data-cy="paragraph">	- Respawns every 15 minutes after dying</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Fruit:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Kira (Diamond) has been added as a new Epic Fruit</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Player List:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- A new player list has been added, which now displays crews and player display names</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crew Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Added 5 new items to the crew shop</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Increased crew shop slots from 4 to 8</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Increased mythical chance in the crew shop</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Old and current Battle Pass outfits are now obtainable from the crew shop</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Balance Patch:</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Arena Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Arena Storm has been removed in favor of a Countdown System</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- At the end of the countdown, the winner is determined based on:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">  - Damage dealt and stocks remaining</p><p data-cy="paragraph">  - Each stock remaining counts as 10k damage</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tori Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode (Arena/BR) requirement changed to 100%</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode bar now drains 2x faster in Arena/BR</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Phoenix Pyreapple is now cancellable in base form if you get stunned</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Triple Talon Kick no longer locks the player in place</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Burn damage removed from M1s</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Slight scaling increase on M1s</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pteranodon Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Increased movement speed when out of combat</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Slower flight speed when in combat</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode (Arena/BR) requirement changed to 100%</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode bar now drains 2x faster in Arena/BR</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Hitbox increased to a size ratio similar to Tori</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buddha Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode (Arena/BR) requirement changed to 100%</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode bar now drains 2x faster in Arena/BR</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Spine Breaker endlag increased by 20%</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Venom Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode (Arena/BR) requirement changed to 100%</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode bar now drains 2x faster in Arena/BR</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Venom Aura is now cancellable on perfect block</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yuki Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Fixed: Snow Gust not working on Factory Core</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gold Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Removed knockback from Golden Touch</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zushi Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Gravity Dominance startup increased by 15%</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Meteor Strike startup reduced by 20%</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mochi V2 Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Increased movement speed for Spiked Donut Roll when out of combat</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Increased knockback on Spiked Donut Roll hit</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Snowcap Scepter Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Scepter Snowball now fires 3 projectiles before going on cooldown</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Inferno Rocket Blade Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Explosive Field startup reduced by 30%</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Slightly increased stun on Explosive Field</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Abyssal Karate Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Diving Tides cooldown increased from 16 to 19 seconds</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>3 Sword Style Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- M1 scaling reduced by 30%</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
