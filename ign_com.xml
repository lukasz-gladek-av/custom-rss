            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Evo 2025 fighting game tournament, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guilty-gear-strive">Guilty Gear Strive</a> developer Arc System Works revealed a first look at Lucy from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/cyberpunk-edgerunners">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a>, and confirmed an August 21 release date for the DLC guest character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lucy is the final playable character from Strive’s Season Pass 4, and is lifted from the hugely popular Cyberpunk: Edgerunners Netflix anime that followed the release of CD Projekt’s Cyberpunk 2077. And anyone who’s played the game will instantly recognize the hacking mechanic we see in the gameplay trailer, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Time pauses as Lucy selects from a number of Quickhacks, such as Algorithm Malfunction, Optics Inhibition, and Energy Siphon, using Cyberdeck Ram in the same limited fashion you do in Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We then see Lucy’s opponent afflicted with the hacking debuffs via icons that display above their character. These icons are the same from Cyberpunk 2077, and appear to clear quite quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, does Lucy mark the end of DLC for Guilty Gear Stive? Four years after its launch, it seems more is to come. Arc System Works tweeted to say Guilty Gear Strive “will continue… we look forward to your continued support.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GGST?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GGST</a> will continue...<br>We look forward to your continued support.<br>皆様の応援を引き続きよろしくお願いします！<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%AE%E3%83%AB%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AE%E3%82%A2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ギルティギア</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GuiltyGearStrive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GuiltyGearStrive</a> <a href="https://t.co/lQKiDyIEV3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/lQKiDyIEV3</a></p>— GUILTY GEAR OFFICIAL (@GUILTYGEAR_PR) <a href="https://twitter.com/GUILTYGEAR_PR/status/1952101221357232187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That message came alongside a video that revealed Strive has had 3.5 million players since launch, and announced Guilty Gear Strive 2.00, coming at some point in 2026. What that means for gameplay is anyone's guess right now. Perhaps of more interest, the video teased two new characters, which fans are speculating are Robo-Ky and Jam Kuradoberi.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible supervillain Omni-Man is a playable character in fighting game Invincible VS. The announcement came as part of the EVO tournament alongside a first look at gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible VS is the upcoming 3v3 tag fighting game set in the Invincible universe. It’s developed by Skybound Entertainment’s first in-house game studio, Quarter Up, and already has a number of confirmed playable characters, including Mark Grayson (Invincible), Atom Eve, Thula, Bulletproof, Rex Splode, and Battle Beast. Now we can add Omni-Man to the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on Omni-Man:</p><blockquote>A versatile and brutal fighter, Omni-Man is an excellent pick for or against any team composition. His versatile move set offers options at all ranges: he can apply pressure from a distance with his concussive blast, punish reckless advances with anti-air tools, or close the gap in an instant with his sudden and devastating takedowns. Balanced, efficient and relentless, Omni-Man is a top-tier “point” character for players who want to set the pace from the very first hit.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn’t Omni-Man’s first foray into the world of fighting games. He was a popular guest character in the equally gory Mortal Kombat 1, which included some of his iconic scenes as Fatalities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we now know seven playable characters in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs"><u>Invincible VS</u></a>. There will be more, of course. But just how many? Based on comments from Invincible creator Robert Kirkman in an interview with IGN at San Diego Comic-Con 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-kirkman-teases-massive-roster-of-playable-characters-for-invincible-vs-thats-a-spoiler-i-might-get-in-trouble-for-that-sdcc-2025">Invincible VS will have a massive roster</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh from his SDCC 2025 panel where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-kirkman-reveals-battle-beast-as-a-playable-character-in-invincible-vs-with-debut-trailer-sdcc-2025"><u>he announced Battle Beast for Invincible VS</u></a>, Kirkman told IGN that if fans are wondering if a specific character from either the Invincible comic or the Prime Video animated series will be in the game, there’s a “99%” chance they will be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's so much care being put into being true to the Invincible universe,” Kirkman began. “So if you're a fan of the comics or the show and you're like, ‘Oh, there's a fighting game coming, who would I like to be in that fighting game?’ There's a 99% chance they're going to be in the game. I'll just say that. That's a spoiler. I might get in trouble for that. I don't know.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Invincible VS Battle Beast Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirkman continued: “The lineup is going to be absolutely insane. I'm so glad that we announced Battle Beast. You can't do an Invincible fighting game without having Battle Beast be one of the playable characters. There are other characters like that that will more than likely be in the game. So we'll see. We've got a lot of announcements to roll out. There's a really great team working on this and I can't wait for people to see everything is going into it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who would you like to see playable in Invincible VS? Let us know in the comments below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for when Invincible VS will be released, Kirkman said 2026, which we already knew, but then he added: “Sooner than you may think… But next year. I'm not being specific.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out IGN's roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-4s-dinosaurus-has-a-voice-actor-robert-kirkman-says-7-9-seasons-needed-to-do-the-complete-comic-arc-jokes-season-5-will-be-out-in-2032-sdcc-2025"><u>everything announced during Robert Kirkman's Invincible panel at SDCC 2025</u></a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Gotta' get them all.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon is one of those franchises that has infiltrated pretty much every medium. Whether you're a fan of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order">Pokémon games</a>, anime, or the trading card game, there is a seemingly endless amount of new content for you to peruse at any given time. There's so much, in fact, that it can almost be hard to find the perfect Pokémon gift for yourself or the fan in your life without trudging through piles of search results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, if you're specifically looking for a really cool Pokémon jigsaw puzzle, I have scouted out this specific topic for you. Below I've listed out some of the very best options currently available on Amazon for both adults and kids of varying ages. Some of these puzzles are a <em>lot</em> more challenging than others, so just make sure you check the piece count before you bite off more than you can chew.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ravensburger Pokémon Challenge Jigsaw Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">A good challenge for adults</h3><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218908"><div id="218908" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ravensburger Pokémon Challenge Jigsaw Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Pokémon puzzle I'd recommend is for more advanced puzzlers. It's 1,000 pieces and is stamped with the Ravensburger "Challenge" title, meaning it's not going to be a quick one. Featuring all of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-version/pokedex">original 150 Pokémon</a> all in one picture, it's a nostalgic blast from the past and fun to put together. It also comes from Ravensburger, which is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">most-trusted jigsaw puzzle brands</a> out there. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buffalo Games Retro Pixel Pokémon Chart Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">For fans of the video games</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218909"><div id="218909" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buffalo Games Retro Pixel Pokémon Chart Puzzle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Great for fans of the original video games.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're anything like me, you likely have fond memories of playing Pokémon on your Game Boy for hours on end and this puzzle hits a similar nostalgic vein. This glorious 2,000 piece jigsaw puzzle from Buffalo Games showcases the original 150 Pokémon once again, but this time they are pixelated and perfectly organized. With the higher piece count and nice blue border around the edges, this Pokémon puzzle is a great option for anyone looking to proudly frame and display their completed work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like the piece count on this puzzle, you should also check out our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">largest puzzles available now</a>. They scale up beyond 40,000 pieces.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buffalo Games Pokémon Fan Favorites Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">For younger kids</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218910"><div id="218910" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buffalo Games Pokémon Fan Favorites Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first two puzzles on this list are targeted more toward adults, but if you're looking for a good option for younger kids, this 100 piece puzzle is my top pick. It features a ton of fan favorite Pokémon, primarily from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation. You can see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-diamond-pearl-platinum-version/Rayquaza">Rayquaza</a> right in the middle there and Pikachu all the way at the bottom. At 100 pieces it's fairly easy for younger kids to piece together while still providing a really cool image for fans of the franchise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buffalo Games Four Pokémon Puzzle Boards</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Starter option for preschoolers</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218911"><div id="218911" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buffalo Games Four Pokémon Puzzle Boards</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Starter puzzles for preschoolers.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for a good puzzle gift for kids just getting into puzzles, this four pack is an excellent option. It says it's made for ages 4+, but I got this same pack for my niece and nephew when they were around three years old and they had no problem putting it together. Each puzzle depicts a different set of Pokémon and features between 12 and 48 pieces so kids can scale up the difficulty if they are really into it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3D Master Ball Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">The best Pokemon puzzle gift</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="219020"><div id="219020" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3D Master Ball Puzzle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>A good gift for all ages.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the absolute <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-toys">best Pokémon toys</a> on the market are Poké Balls.

Here are a couple of key things to look out for when buying a Pokémon puzzle:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Make sure it's a trusted brand</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first thing you'll want to do before you buy <em>any </em>jigsaw puzzle online is check what brand it's from. There are some puzzle brands that are more trusted than others, many of which I've featured on this list already. A good brand tends to have higher quality puzzles, which means higher quality materials. And for Pokémon puzzles specifically, they will likely be selling the puzzles in an official capacity via licensing the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When in doubt, I'd suggest reading through Amazon reviews to see what people thought. Things to watch out for are missing pieces, thin cardboard, and obvious AI usage.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Get the right piece count for the occasion</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Another important thing to think about is who you're buying the puzzle for. If it's a gift for an experienced puzzler, 1,000 pieces and above is probably ideal. But if it's for a novice or a younger audience, then 500 or below is probably your best bet. Larger puzzles tend to take a <em>lot </em>longer and if you don't have a dedicated space set up for puzzling you'll likely never finish. This is where a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-tables">decent puzzle table</a> really comes in handy.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 3, 2025 2:30 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="article-subtitle">Not yet available for streaming.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-puzzles]]></content:encoded>
