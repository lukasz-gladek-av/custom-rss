            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/new-minecraft-movie-lego-sets-where-to-buy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO announced earlier this year that we'd be getting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-movie-lego-sets-gives-insight-into-which-mobs-will-appear-in-the-jack-black-film">new Minecraft Movie sets</a>, and the time has finally come for them to be released into the world. There are four new Minecraft sets that you can now buy, with two of them featuring scenes from the upcoming film. These new sets are added to an ever-growing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-minecraft-sets">list of LEGO Minecraft sets</a> that have been accumulating over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the new Minecraft Movie sets features minifigure mobs, but only two of the sets offer up a tiny Jack Black as Steve. You can currently purchase all of these sets from Amazon, LEGO direct, or any of the other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-sets">best places to buy LEGO</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New LEGO Minecraft Sets Available Now</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Although there are four new LEGO Minecraft sets coming out, the two that are associated with the movie are The Ghast Balloon Village Attack and Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring. Both sets give us an idea of what to expect from the upcoming film. The Woodland Mansion Fighting Ring depicts some sort of gladiator style battle with Jason Momoa fighting a baby zombie on a chicken. Meanwhile the Ghast Balloon Village Attack set reveals a marshamallow-like villain from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Nether">Nether</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other two Minecraft sets that are releasing are The Parrot Houses and The Trial Chamber. For more like these, you can check out more of our favorite LEGO Minecraft sets.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Does the New Minecraft Movie Come Out?</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGO tends to release new sets tied to movie releases about a month before the actual release of the film. The new Minecraft sets are following the same timeline by coming out on March 1 seeing as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/a-minecraft-movie">A Minecraft movie</a> is hitting theaters on April 4, 2025.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Will There Be More Minecraft Movie Sets?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">So far the two sets we've featured above are the only ones set to release alongside the film. It's possible this could change if the live-action Minecraft movie is a success. Either way, there are new LEGO Minecraft sets released fairly consistently and we can likely expect more to release later this year, even if it isn't directly tied to the movie.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
