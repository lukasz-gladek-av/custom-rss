Now, years later, it remains on hold, but one Valve developer has given fans a glimpse at what might have been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced during the 2017 Game Awards, In The Valley of Gods is set in Egypt during the late 1920s. It stars Rashida and Zora, a pair of documentary filmmakers who accidentally made it big with a hit movie but have since seen their careers go off a cliff. They reunite years later after receiving information about the lost Tomb of Nefertiti, with a goal of reigniting their careers by documenting their trip to Egypt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve visual effects developer Matt Wilde took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skilful.bsky.social/post/3lakopz32k22x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a> to publish a six second water test created by Camp Santo before the studio’s move to Valve. It shows the player character bobbing in impressively realistic water while looking out from inside a cave at the other protagonist from a first-person perspective. “I do often tend to work on liquidy things,” Wilde said.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Matthew Wilde, the Valve developer behind the water shader for Counter-Strike 2, has shared a rare gameplay footage. It shows the water technology that was tested for In The Valley of Gods before Valve acquired the company Campo Santo. Team shelved the game not so long after… <a href="https://t.co/wIs6Im8KYx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/wIs6Im8KYx</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1855941378301141312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a reference to Wilde’s work on Valve's 2020 virtual reality exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, which caught attention for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-alyx-update-liquid-physics-14">ultra realistic liquid in glass bottles</a>. More recently, Wilde worked on Counter-Strike 2’s water and effects.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Spent a good chunk of lock-down doing this important work. Boozy liquid shader, now available in the latest update for Half-Life: Alyx <a href="https://t.co/Iw9h98pmEg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Iw9h98pmEg</a></p>— Matthew Wilde (@skilful) <a href="https://twitter.com/skilful/status/1265875309980643329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Wilde’s In The Valley of Gods clip obviously sparks questions about whether Camp Santo / Valve will one day return to the game. “To fans looking forward to In The Valley of Gods, it’s probably clear that the optimistic ‘2019’ at the end of the announcement trailer isn’t going to be accurate,” Campo Santo co-founder Jake Rodkin said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/03/in-the-valley-of-gods-on-hold-as-campo-santo-devs-work-on-other-valve-projects">when it was announced that In The Valley of Gods had been put on hold</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the end, Valve Time makes fools of us all. But yes, developers from the former Campo Santo team have joined other projects at Valve, including Half-Life: Alyx.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So to answer your question as of today, In The Valley of Gods development is on hold — but it certainly feels like a project people can and may return to. And when that happens, we’ll find an exciting way to let fans know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/687440/In_The_Valley_of_Gods/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In The Valley of Gods’ Steam page is still live</a> — with a December 2029 release window. Perhaps that will end up being true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skilful.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Matthew Wilde / Bluesky</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

That's already the best price we've seen for the latest Zelda game for the Switch, but new Woot! customers can use $5 off coupon code "<strong>ZELDAWISDOM</strong>" to drop the price even further to $39.99. If you're an Amazon Prime member, you can also get free shipping, otherwise you'll have to pay $6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a physical copy and includes a 90-day Woot! warranty. The game box you receive may or may not be imported, which means there is a chance you might be receiving a PEGI or ESRB copy. Functionally it doesn't matter, since all Nintendo Switch games are region-free and you'll be able to play the game regardless. You won't have to worry about language either, since the language setting is determined by your Switch console, not the game disc.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h2><div catalogid="007d5bf9-dc92-4652-8ad4-bf06bd9bfbbb" id="207939"><div id="207939" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (Switch)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Code for for new customers only (otherwise $44.99)</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom review</a> and see why this game earned an "Amazing" 9/10 score. In it, writer Tom Marks states "The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is far greater than a gimmicky spinoff led by Zelda instead of Link. Its echo summoning is a clever concept used to combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you’d expect from a classic-style 2D Zelda with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by Tears of the Kingdom. This experiment doesn’t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn’t quite as compelling, but it’s an impressively successful one all the same. Echoes of Wisdom is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before Breath of the Wild without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced. Creating echoes aside, if this is the future of Zelda, I can’t wait to see more."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should you wait for Black Friday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We will absolutely see plenty more Nintendo Switch games on sale as we approach <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a>. There's a chance other vendors may drop the price of Echoes of Wisdom to $44.99. However, if you can get this game for $39.99, you should jump on it. I highly doubt you'll find any other retailer selling a physical copy of this game at that price, since it was released on September 26, less than two months ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more discounts on games, check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Nintendo Switch deals today</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
