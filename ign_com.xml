            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-through-the-ages-most-expensive-cards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Final Fantasy: Through the Ages collection reimagines classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-2025">Magic: The Gathering cards</a> with iconic art and characters from all 16 mainline <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-games-in-order">Final Fantasy games</a>. Packed into Magic's newly released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-in-stock">Universes Beyond: Final Fantasy set</a>, these reprints aren't just nostalgic; they're in high demand for collectors, with several fetching serious prices on the secondary market.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR: 16 Most Valuable Final Fantasy: Through The Ages MTG Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond just looking incredible, many of these cards are proven staples in multiple formats like Commander. That combination of competitive relevance and collector appeal has already driven prices up, with several cards becoming some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-best-cards-to-chase-and-buy-today">most sought-after in the entire set</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're opening boosters or tracking down singles, these are the 16 most valuable cards from the Through the Ages collection right now. They're powerful, flashy, and, for longtime fans of both games, pretty irresistible right now. Let's take a look.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>16. Clive Rosfield (Vial Smasher the Fierce)</strong></h3><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223058"><div id="223058" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Clive Rosfield - Vial Smasher the Fierce</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting at around $10.20 market, you can get this Commander staple for as low as $9.60, but this shoots up to <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1MRn?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$49.89 for the foil print</a>. I was hoping for a larger red creature to represent Clive, but Vial Smasher fits his fiery personality well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>15. The Emperor, Hell Tyrant (Yawgmoth, Thran Physician)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223057"><div id="223057" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Emperor, Hell Tyrant - Yawgmoth, Thran Physician</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yawgmoth, Thran Physician is a Modern staple (there's a whole deck named after him), so the Emperor art would be a nice addition to die-hard fans of the deck. You can pick this up for around $14.54 market, or as low as <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnO3j?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$11.99 on TCGPlayer right now</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>14. Kefka's Tower (Bolas's Citadel)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223056"><div id="223056" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kefka's Tower - Bolas's Citadel</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I thought for sure Kefka's Tower would be printed onto Command Tower, but it looks like Wizards of the Coast wanted to avoid Commander-only cards, which is welcome. Get this at market value for $15.55 or as low as $13.69.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>13. Cecil Harvey (Tymna the Weaver)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223055"><div id="223055" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cecil Harvey - Tymna the Weaver</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A personal favorite (seriously, I adore Final Fantasy IV), Tymna, the Weaver's design is another card that fits the flavor of the character well. Find it at market around $16.18.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>12. Lightning, Lone Commando (Isshin, Two Heavens as One)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223054"><div id="223054" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lightning, Lone Commando v- Isshin, Two Heavens as One</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best Mardu Commanders around, Isshin definitely fits Lightning's vibe in terms of combat mechanics. You can pick this up at <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62DYj?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">market price for $21.93</a> but not much lower at the time of writing, as Lightning's value seems to be slowly spiking as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>11. Blessing of the Oracle (Akroma's Will)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223051"><div id="223051" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blessing of the Oracle - Akroma's Will</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing white in Commander, odds are you're running Akroma's Will. The art with Noctis and Lunafreya is one of my personal favorites. It's recently had a massive spike in price, and you can currently find it at market value for around $23.99.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>10. Kefka Palazzo (Purphoros, God of the Forge)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223052"><div id="223052" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kefka Palazzo - Purphoros, God of the Force</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Purphoros, God of the Forge is great in Commander if you're running a tokens or blink strategy, and the Yoshitaka Amano Kefka art is a nostalgic masterpiece. Market is around $25, and that seems to be the price you're looking at right now as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>9. Tidus, Zanarkand Fayth (Thrasios, Triton Hero)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223053"><div id="223053" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tidus, Zanarkand Fayth - Thrasios, Triton Hero</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You'd be hard-pressed to see Thrasios played anywhere other than low-powered Merfolk Commander decks, but the Final Fantasy X cover art is the big selling point here. Get it at market for $21.26 but not much lower.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>8. Cloud Strife (Najeela, the Blade-Blossom)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223050"><div id="223050" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cloud Strife - Najeela, the Blade-Blossom</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Najeela, the Blade-Blossom fits Cloud well, and the Tetsuya Nomura art alone is enough for me to pick one up. <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5wXKL?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Market value is $25</a>, and seems fairly stable right now as well, albeit the foil version fetches 10x that, with listings up to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAx3j?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$250 at TCGPlayer right now</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>7. The Cloudsea Djinn (Nyxbloom Ancient)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223049"><div id="223049" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Cloudsea Djinn - Nyxbloom Ancient</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd call this a fringe Commander staple, as big mana green decks love this massive enchantment creature for some extra ramp, and the Cloudsea Djinn art from the original Final Fantasy is icing on the cake. Find it at market for $24.66 or down to around $23 from select vendors.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>6. Zidane Tribal (Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223048"><div id="223048" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zidane Tribal - Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer might be one of the most annoying one-drops ever printed, but I can't argue against this sweet Zidane alternate art, especially as a huge fan of Final Fantasy IX. Market price is $27.70 and other vendors don't have it for much lower. The foil version is also going for around $82.99 right now as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>5. Terra Branford (Urza, High Lord Artificer)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223047"><div id="223047" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Terra Branford - Urza, High Lord Artificer</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This card is another example of a fan-favorite character glued onto a multi-format powerhouse. It's at $26.62 market value, with that being fairly stable right now as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>4. Knights of San d'Oria (Ranger-Captain of Eos)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223046"><div id="223046" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Knights of San d'Oria - Ranger-Captain of Eos</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ranger-Captain of Eos sees enough Modern and Legacy play to warrant picking this one up. It's at $29.50 market and not much lower elsewhere.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>3. Sephiroth, the Savior (Atraxa, Grand Unifier)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223045"><div id="223045" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sephiroth, the Savior - Atraxa, Grand Unifier</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one I'm surprised at as well, but because of how low it is. Mix Atraxa, Grand Unifier, a multi-format all-star, with one of the most iconic video game villains of all time, and you have potential for a serious price tag. Luckily it's at a $42.78 market price, which could be worse. Find one for as low as $39.98.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>2. Dragon of Mount Gulg (Ancient Copper Dragon)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223044"><div id="223044" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dragon of Mount Gulg - Ancient Copper Dragon</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From a Commander or competitive standpoint, I can't quite figure out why this is as expensive as it is, it's sitting at $72.19 market. But nostalgia is a hell of a drug, so you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgr7q?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">grab one for as low as $69.74</a>, break out the big guns as the foil version is up to <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OM4y?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$254.70 at the time of publication</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bonus: Honorable Mentions</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we jump into the most valuable card, consider these honorable mentions when picking up any singles right now as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy: Through the Ages features dozens of other cards, and the above list are some other multi-format staples like Fatal Push and Dovin's Veto with awesome new art that won't break the bank for a playset.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>1. Stay With Me (Rhystic Study)</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="adadb6c5-4f79-4a2e-acf4-b641e11123a7" id="223042"><div id="223042" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Stay With Me - Rhystic Study</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhystic Study has been a Commander staple since the format's inception. The Final Fantasy X version is sitting at a market price of $103.12, but you can pick one up for as high as $125.98, or as low as $100.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where Can I Buy Final Fantasy: Through the Ages?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Through the Ages cards can be found non-foil in both Play Boosters and Collector Boosters, with foil versions of the cards only available in Collector Boosters. But, the best avenue to get the cards you want, without spending an absolute fortune, is by purchasing singles, so hopefully this was a handy guide for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're here for FF6’s Terra, FF7’s Cloud, FF10’s Tidus, or FF14’s Warrior of Light, these sets are stacked with heroes and villains from across the series. And that’s just the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">Commander Decks</a>, the full release runs deep. If you managed to lock in a preorder before they vanished, congrats. Otherwise, check in with the links just above to bookmark or wishlist your favorite set in anticipation of any restocks soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or perhaps, Collectors with more money than sense might be even more drawn to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-secret-lair">Final Fantasy x Secret Lair drops</a>. Wizards of the Coast has had a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">packed year of limited-time releases</a>, and all three Final Fantasy Secret Lair sets sold out in record time, leaving plenty of fans empty-handed. That said, they’re still <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available through third-party sellers</a>... if you’re willing to pay the markup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three drops in total: Weapons, Grimoire, and Game Over. Each one offers Magic: The Gathering cards with exclusive Final Fantasy art and themed names. All were released in both standard and foil editions, with Japanese-language variants adding an extra layer of rarity for collectors.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/12/where-to-buy-secret-lair-mtg-final-fantasy-ign-1749723561198.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">MTG x Final Fantasy Secret Lair - Credit: Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since these drops are no longer available directly from Wizards of the Coast, don’t expect to find them at their original prices. Standard nonfoil sets launched at <strong>$30, and rainbow foil versions at $40</strong>, but most listings now sit between <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>$80 and $150 or more</strong></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a steep jump, so if you’re looking to grab one now, make sure you know exactly what you’re paying for. You can find them on eBay, but we’ve always found <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn3lV?object_uuid=c13208de-f4fc-44ea-99f1-63df54d4188c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>, while also eBay-owned, to be the more secure and trustworthy option for picking up Secret Lair drops after release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-party-preview-proves-theres-room-for-more-than-just-mario-party<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Lego seems to snap into yet another genre pretty seamlessly.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The humble party game genre has connected people throughout gaming generations. And while nobody really considers it whenever a new one hits the fray, the results are usually an enjoyable time. That’s true for Lego Party, the mini brick’s seemingly successful attempt to Lego-fy Mario Party so that fans of the tiny constructables can get together in a group of four and proceed to ruin their friendship over minigames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review">Mario Party</a> you know exactly what to expect for Lego Party. A group of four players will drop onto a boardgame-like table and roll numbers to advance the requisite number of spots. Some spots will have special prizes, some will hide traps that will steal your hard-earned Stars, or in this case, a golden Lego Brick. After every player rolls their turn, they’ll all drop in to compete in one of 60 Lego-themed minigames.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And to Lego Party’s credit, the minigames is where this effort can differentiate itself from Mario Party. There are some standard-fare activities, like a game where players jump over a swinging octopus tentacle until the last player is left standing, to some very off-kilter ones. One I tried is a Bennett Foddy-style unicycle racing game where players must use the joysticks to balance atop a very fiddly unicycle and inch their way towards the finish line. We only played about eight minigames total, so I’m very excited to see what else Lego Party has in store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Lego innovation is how Lego Party leans into the creative aspect of the toy bricks. While the overworld maps are themed after fun concepts like “Pirates,” they can also be modified if certain conditions are met within the game. Landing on a specific spot will let players create unique elements to add to the map like a pirate ship that wasn’t there when the game began.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visually, Lego Party has the crisp, colorful aesthetic Lego games have come to be known for, though the party game aesthetic means that these Legos lean towards more whacky designs than something I’d consider charming. That is to say, these Legos are all about being zany and loud, which is perfect for the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing with three other players (my two IGN colleagues and a developer), we found ourselves immediately sucked into its playful orbit. The goal is to collect as many Gold Bricks by the end of the game. Winning minigames on their own will only award you Lego bits that you can turn into ways to score Gold Bricks, such as movement modifiers that will help you land on the spot where a Gold Brick has spawned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’re also traps you can purchase (don’t worry, it’s not in a microtransaction way) to potentially steal Gold Bricks from other players, and unique spots on the board that will initiate a special 2v2 game where the winning team will both get Gold Bricks as a reward. These 2v2 rounds include special minigames where, for example, both players each control one half of a car and must coordinate their controls to drive to the designated goal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we did complete a small game ourselves, we only saw a fraction of what Lego Party has to offer. If the rest of the games are anywhere near as fun as the handful that we played, I can see Lego Party having the kind of addictive appeal Mario Party has had – which is especially good news for PlayStation and Xbox players that don’t have access to Mario Party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress.1221123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A solid way to judge a co-op shooter is by how many inside jokes you and your mates come up with while you play. And after around seven hours working in The Oldest House, it’s safe to say that if that were the only metric to judge FBC: Firebreak on, it would be an easy 10. Of course, it helps that the setting and the enemies you face are so curiosity-inducing. So far, I’ve encountered a sticky note behemoth, an evil drum kit, and a possessed traffic light. I’ve also carved a path through pink goop and loaded mannequins into ski lifts. Do I understand why? No. Does it matter? Not at all. With slick combat, striking graphical effects and diverse objectives, FBC: Firebreak is a first-person shooter that’s a load of silly fun with your friends. The main question I’m still figuring out is: how far can Remedy sustain this wackiness to keep me interested in the long term?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FBC is set six years after the events of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/08/26/control-review-2">Control</a>, and invites you back to the wonderfully strange architecture of The Oldest House under wildly different circumstances. Instead of saving the day as upstart director Jesse Faden, you’re a trio of first responders attending to oddball emergencies that would make an OSHA officer wince. When radioactive leeches have infested a quarry and need to be thrown into a furnace on wheels that resembles Team Fortress 2’s Payload, it’s you and your team that receive the call. And once you’ve finished your Jobsite shift, your team will also have to trek back to the elevator you arrived in and survive until it reaches your station. Hey, it’s hard work, but someone's gotta do it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FBC: Firebreak PC Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the time since Control, that game’s interdimensional antagonist, The Hiss, also remains ever-present. As such, while you’re trying to tackle the quirky jobs at hand, you’ll also need to manage hordes of possessed office employees hellbent on your disposal. While there hasn’t been a vast range of enemy types to tackle, at least so far, there is enough diversity to keep gunplay interesting. And, whether it was a glowing ghoul sprinting at me, or flying desk jockeys zooming through the sky, I found plenty of joy in taking them out all the same. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To pull off these expedition, you call in the help of two additional players, with each member of the squad wielding a specialised ‘Crisis Kit.’ Similar to the class systems found in other cooperative shooters, each kit equips you with a unique skill set that can expedite key tasks throughout jobs. For example, on the map called Hot Fix, the player wielding the Fix Kit can speedily repair the internals of a broken fan with their quick-fixing wrench, while the Splash Kit crew member can provide support by keeping them from heat death thanks to their globs of healing ammunition. Meanwhile, the Jump Kit player can sprint around activating the generators with their electro-kinetic charge impactor, using their secondary fire to rocket jump around the map and control the field. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s plenty of replayability in the current Jobsite lineup already.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth mentioning that there are no restrictions on repeating roles, and your crew can triple down on one skillset, rather than diversifying the team. You’ll still be able to finish jobs, though the approach you’ll need to take will be drastically different depending on the specific composition of your team. While the gunplay across each role is identical (depending on your choice of loadout), the mixture of your cohort's Crisis Kits do well to tailor expeditions around your team’s preferences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of how your team pick powers between the roles, though, FBC provides opportunities for each role to shine, especially as you start to level up and invest in the upgrade trees to unlock perk-based modifiers and new weaponry. As the resident Fix Kit operator and player most likely to get into sticky situations, I funnelled my Lost Assets (the currency that allows you to progress the upgrade tree) into perks like ‘Shower Thoughts’, which enabled me to expedite recovery when using healing sources, as well as ‘Greasy Fingers’, which allowed me to switch between my tools faster. While I was initially sceptical that these additions would make any tangible difference, I immediately noticed a positive change in my performance, especially during high-octane combat encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of now, FBC has five unique Jobsites to choose between, with more expected to arrive after launch. And, despite the small pool of options, there’s plenty of replayability in the current lineup already. The pink goo level, which my friends lovingly dubbed the Mr Blobby level in homage to the British children’s TV mascot from the early 90s, became the bane of our existence – primarily due to our clumsy play leading us right into explosives. The sentient sticky note-infested Paper Chase mission, on the other hand, provided the right amount of risk vs reward, and we revisited that map frequently in search of more Lost Assets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each Jobsite in FBC offers three unique ‘Clearance Levels’ that expand on the base job, and as you progress deeper into these levels, the number of Hiss agents and objective criteria increases in both number and intensity as the map expands. Soon enough, the infected office workers make way for winged eldritch horrors and tanky beasts, and your team will be forced to communicate to avoid being downed. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>FBC is an engaging extension of the Control universe.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is some reprieve from the constant combat, and in each Clearance level, you can find healing decontamination showers and ammunition bays. Though in the FBC, not even safe zones are truly safe, and these life-saving stations can also break and falter, demanding a quick fix from a certain kit or a more lengthy button-pressing session if you’re caught in a bind. Attempting a repair without the appropriate kit in FBC leads to a rhythmic quick-time event where you have to tap Q and E (or L1 and R1) in sequence without making errors to progress the meter. I wasn’t expecting to encounter a stressful rhythm game in my cooperative shooter, but I was pleasantly surprised by how it ramped up the anxiety of completing essential tasks nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps what makes FBC so morish, though, is how quickly poor communication can turn a level upside down. During one such mission, I found myself caught between enemy fire and literal flames while attempting to retrieve Lost Assets. In response to my screams, my Splash Kit teammate valiantly came to my rescue, putting out the fire and starting to revive me… that was, until a second horde of Hiss appeared, and the fire restarted without warning. As you could expect, my teammate fell to the same fate I did while trying to revive me. At any point, I could have said, ‘Leave me, save yourself.’ But, naively, despite the flames and enemies, I thought it was going to be okay. Thankfully, FBC isn’t keen on punishing you for your poor planning, and depending on your difficulty setting, you’ll have a series of lives to expend before it’s a total game over.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">FBC is an engaging extension of the Control universe, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time blasting through the Oldest House with friends in tow. Unfortunately, beyond the initial exhilaration, I was disappointed to find that I didn’t feel as embedded in the Remedy Connected Universe as I was expecting. It is the nature of the replayable co-op shooter genre, I suppose, but the story only appears in loading screens and the occasional voice line on the main menu. So far, it’s left me with many stories, but I’m still keen for a little bit more lore, and hoping that it arrives as I push deeper into the difficulty modifiers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of this writing, I’ve completed the final stage of each Jobsite and am now messing around with Corruption and Threat-based difficulty modifiers to unlock rare Research Samples that will allow me to specialise my perk build. There’s still a lot more to explore before I deliver my final review, like playing on my own and the forthcoming weapon upgrades, like the ‘Functional’ Submachine Gun that I’ve yet to unlock. But right now, despite how sparse the story can seem in moments, there’s a lot of fun to be had wrangling erratic monsters in Remedy’s spectacularly absurd bureaucratic setting. I’ll be playing more this week and wrap up this review as soon as I’ve tested the limits of Remedy’s chaotic cooperative job simulator.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sarah's favourite co-op games</h3></p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
