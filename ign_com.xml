And now, it's coming to the U.S. for a one-night-only theatrical release on February 27, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2026/1/14/umamusume-pretty-derby-beginning-of-a-new-era-anime-film-north-american-release-date" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared by Crunchyroll</a>, the film will hit select, to-be-announced theaters in the U.S. for a one-night screening next month, and shared an English-language <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4dMQOzj-5g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a> and poster alongside the news. Tickets will be available at a later date via the <a href="https://www.movie-umamusume-newera-en.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official English website</a>, though it's unclear how broad a release this film will actually get.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/filters-quality95formatwebp-1768426269047.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not familiar with Umamusume: Pretty Derby, it's an exceedingly popular franchise from Cygames centered around a mobile game that launched in 2021. It features the Umamusume, or women with some of the features (such as ears and tails) and abilities of horses who participate in races styled after real-world historical horse races. In the game this takes the form of a sports simulation game where players train Umamusume to compete in various raises and meet certain, character-specific goals.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the mobile game, a multi-season anime, a manga, and various other spinoffs, Umamusume has covered the stories of multiple characters based on real-world race horses from the '90s, '00s, and '10s. The film, Beginning of a New Era, released in Japan on May 24, 2024 and follows Jungle Pocket, based on the real-world horse of the same name, and her rivalries with Agnes Tachyon, Manhattan Cafe, and Dantsu Flame. In the film, Jungle Pocket trains with veteran trainer Tanabe in an effort to win the Triple Crown, a series of three races that can only be competed in once in a lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umamusume: Pretty Derby launched in the U.S. in July of last year and only increased its popularity from what it already enjoyed in Japan. So much so that fans are now paying attention to the real-life horses that inspired their fictional counterparts, cheering them on, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-fans-mourn-death-of-champion-racehorse-grass-wonder">even mourning the death of one last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Punching trees might never be the same. </h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After more than 10 years in development, Hytale early access is here! If you’re just getting started, we’re writing a variety of early-game guides on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hytale/How_to_Make_a_Furnace_and_Smelt">smelting</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hytale/How_to_Play_with_Friends_and_Set_up_Hytale_Servers">setting up servers for friends</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hytale/Hytale_Progression_Guide">plenty more</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I preferred to go in blind. Hytale is quite obviously heavily Minecraft coded, but developer Hypixel is also doing its own thing in ways big and small, too. Below are seven things in Hytale's early game that surprised me, coming at it specifically from a Minecraft’s player’s perspective. Anything I missed? Have some early-game observations of your own? Leave a comment! </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>1. Punching down a single tree knocks down the entire thing at once, giving you a pile of wood, sticks, and sap along with it. No floating tree trunks here!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale is very clearly heavily Minecraft-inspired, but one area in which it does feel quite different is in that time-honored opening crafting survival game moment of punching down your first few trees. In Hytale, like Terreria and plenty of other survival games, the whole tree collapses and explodes like a little piñata of wood and resources once you disconnect it from the ground. You'll need all that sap, trust me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>2. Early overworld mobs are tankier than expected</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-11-49-25-am-1768423172423.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">How was I supposed to know this cutie would take nine hits?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Within my first few minutes in Hytale I had come across squirrels, rabbits, sheep, and even a fox. And although none of them were hard to kill at all (sorry little guys, but I need your pelts for early-game crafting recipes), I was a little surprised at how much HP they seem to have, and how many hits from my first crude sword it took to take them down. I had to chase one rabbit halfway across the plains - they're quite speedy when making their getaway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>3. Ores glint faintly in underground caves</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-42-54-pm-1768423553440.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Sweet, sweet early game Copper.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is truly a tiny detail, but still one I thought was neat. When spelunking in Hytale, if you look carefully, an otherwise pitch-black cave wall or crevasse will glint off distant light sources like your torch if there are any valuable ores present. Helpful!
</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>4. Gear Progression Is a bit more complicated</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-41-18-pm-1768423553440.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Iron upgrades will have to wait.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In my first cave I explored I found plenty of copper ore for Tier 1 armor, but I also found a stack or so of iron ore, for Tier 2 gear. I was initially a little bit disappointed, thinking maybe I could just leapfrog past tier 1 entirely. But crafting weapons and armor in Hytale actually requires a few different raw materials, which I appreciated. Copper armor requires only copper and plant fiber. But Iron requires iron, light leather, and linen scraps. So it looks like I have more mob grinding in my near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>5. There are more decorative options</strong></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-44-00-pm-1768423553440.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale’s crafting system in early access is still very basic (and a little buggy), but coming from Minecraft, I still appreciated some small crafting details like being able to turn raw wood and stone into slanted, tiled roof blocks and half-block-thick walls when building out my starter hut. You can also place shelves on our walls and stick a few decoratives like candles and books on them. By the way - huge fan of how Hytale's crafting benches can see and make use of resources stored in nearby chests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>6. There are promising secrets and surprises</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-1-19-53-pm-1768423653838.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A first look at the still-heavily-under-construction Forgotten Temple.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale is what I would describe as an “aggressively” early access game. Most of the time when you come across something interesting in the world like what looks like a dungeon entrance, or a hand-built ruin, you’ll be stopped from entering and shown a literal under construction “work in progress” sign. There is one exception though, which illustrates some of the promise of what is hopefully to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on I spotted a nearby icon on my map labeled “Forgotten Temple Gateway.” Without spoiling the details, investigating said gateway led to a fight against a unique mob and a portal to a beautiful and entirely unique, hand-crafted location, filled with its own NPCs and points of interest. Hytale for now looks to be very thin on hand-crafted Adventure content, but this tiny taste was an encouraging place to start. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>7 Farming Is a Bit More Complex</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-44-21-pm-1768423553440.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Next order of business: start my chicken empire.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although I didn’t get a chance to dive into the feature in detail because I had to go back to (grumble grumble) <em>work, </em>I did get a chance to poke around Hytale’s farming system a bit. So far it looks like, similar to most of Hytale’s other systems, it’s a bit more complex than Minecraft’s. You can craft animal caretaking buildings including chicken coops and beehives, as well as a farming aids like a watering can. Tree saplings and new crop seeds don’t come from harvesting, but instead must be created by spending “Essence of Life,” which seems a bit like a currency you receive when harvesting mature crops.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, as a Minecraft veteran - I’ve been playing off and on since there were Secret Friday Updates! - Hytale’s opening few hours are familiar enough and yet still different enough to keep me interested and coming back for more.

From the block-by-block breaking and building, to the stylized environments and enemies, to the procedural world generation, this feels like the, "What would we change if we had the chance to start over again?" version of the now legendary 2009 classic. Many games have been influenced by Mojang's trendsetter, but this is more of a cover song than a subgenre from what I’ve seen so far (though I’ve got plenty more to play before my final review). And while developer Hypixel Studios’ lawyers might not love hearing me say that, I honestly don't think it's a bad thing. Even in Early Access, it's a good cover!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of the gameplay will be pretty familiar if you've put any time at all into Minecraft, but with some streamlining here and there. You no longer have to begin your journey punching trees, for instance, since basic tools are made with sticks and rubble that can be collected easily with your bare hands. Also, breaking the trunk of a tree will cause everything above it to collapse and drop its resources, which was almost enough to win me over on its own. I still to this day hate having to chop upwards to hollow out a tree in Minecraft!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Movement is also a lot more modern and fluid. You can jump up to three blocks high and pull yourself up, which feels like such a huge quality-of-life improvement over the one-block jump limit in Minecraft. It's even possible to take a running leap at a ledge, hit the side, and pull yourself up. We've got proper parkour now, and I don't know that I would ever want to give it up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also just runs better than Minecraft on my Ryzen 7 3700X, 32GB RAM, and RTX 4070 Ti-powered system. Even with the draw distance cranked up, my framerates sit comfortably above 60. We'll see how long that lasts when I start building elaborate megastructures, but for now it's like butter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is fine. There are a handful of different weapon types, from swift-slashing double daggers to a classic sword and shield setup with more defensive options, and every one has its own unique charge attack and a special meter that can be filled up to release a devastating finisher. I'm impressed with the enemy variety so far, with everything from goblin bomb-throwers to really terrifying lava toads that can catch you with their tongues and pull you in for a very painful bite attack.</p><p>It's almost like someone's wishlist of things Minecraft can't or will never do.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building can be a little bit fiddly. We have more pieces to pick from, like proper roofs that make Minecraft's classic stair tricks redundant. But sometimes I had to do silly stuff like building a dirt "mold" to make sure all the pieces were facing the right way. Still, once I got the hang of its quirks, I was able to start making some pretty neat-looking stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's very little direction in this Early Access version of Hytale, currently. The main hub area, the Forgotten Temple, is a rotunda of literal Under Construction signs. I even stumbled into some dungeons out in the world where I'd be excited to throw the doors open only to find one of these disappointing barriers. It's not clear what the larger, overarching goal is supposed to be, although I'm happy enough to build cool stuff and seek out new ores for higher-level tools at the moment. But I'm not sure if there will eventually be a story or bigger bosses to find or anything like that. I haven't run into them yet if they exist already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, I'm quite enjoying my time with Hytale so far, though. Even if it is just Minecraft again, it's an enjoyable rendition with some thoughtful tweaks and additions. It's almost like someone's wishlist of things Mojang will never do, or can't do with its legacy tech. I plan to put in at least a few dozen more hours before I give it a final evaluation, but check back for more updates on my progress in the coming week.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 Survival Crafting Games</h3><p>I've reviewed a lot of these!
