            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcanas-ninth-set-fabled-to-be-released-in-september-2025-with-a-goofy-movie-and-the-first-iconic-and-epic-cards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Lorcana just revealed a ton of new info for the future of the trading card game, including that the ninth set - Fabled - will be released on September 5, 2025, with the first-ever Iconic and Epic cards and the long-awaited arrival of A Goofy Movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Fabled, more details were shared on Lorcana's eighth set - Reign of Jafar - ahead of its debut on June 6, a new Collection Starter Set was revealed, and details on the Disney Lorcana World Championship were given. Oh, and we can't forget about the tease of Darkwing Duck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot of exciting info was unveiled for Disney Lorcana, and we're here to break it down to ensure you don't miss a thing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fabled Will Add Iconic and Epic Cards, A Goofy Movie, and Rotating Cards for Competitive Play</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/dlc-fabled-a-goofy-movie-image-1746510989873.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While we still have more to learn about Fabled, the teases given by the Disney Lorcana team are making the wait until pre-release on August 29 and wide release on September 5 just that much harder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Goofy Movie cards will be one of the biggest additions to Disney Lorcana with Fabled, but the team wasn't ready to share exactly which cards will become available. They did share, however, that Mickey and Minnie will be the very first Iconic Cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iconic Cards will be the rarest cards in all of Lorcana, as only two will appear in each set going forward, and beautiful cards of Mickey and Minnie on a carousel will serve as the Iconic Cards all players will be chasing for their sets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Iconic Cards will be Epic Cards, which are rarer than Legendary but not as hard to get as Enchanted and Iconic. These cards will also feature special artwork and foil treatments and will give players even more chances to score a special card like a new Elsa (Snow Queen) one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big change in Fabled is that it will mark the first time Lorcana will be rotating out certain cards and making them illegal for competitive play. Top-level competitive play is called Core Constructed and will not allow players to use any cards from the first four sets of Lorcana. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana Fabled Cards and Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of older cards shouldn't worry too much though, as there will be plenty of ways to play your older cards, including in a new format called Infinity Constructed. Furthermore, Fabled will introduce reprinted cards from earlier sets - like Winnie the Pooh (Hunny Wizard) - and those will be fully usable in competitive play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To keep the competitive game thriving, rotating out older cards to encourage new strategies and fresh deck designs is a really important part of the next chapter,” said Ryan Miller, Brand Manager and Co Designer of <em>Disney Lorcana</em> <em>TCG</em> at Ravensburger. “But because we know there are cards in those early sets that are important to a lot of fans’ deck-building strategies, and we know not everybody got the cards they wanted the first year, we’re re-printing some cards from those first sets in <em>Fabled</em>. Including Enchanted versions of some fan favorites!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are new to Lorcana and all of these new sets sound enticing and wonderful, the team has announced a new way to jump into this trading card game with the Collection Starter Set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This set includes four Fabled booster packs, a Tinker Bell (Giant Fairy) "Glimmer Foil" Promo Card, one card portfolio with Mickey Mouse (Brave Little Tailor) on the front, and one collector's guide.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/collection-starter-set-1746511057724.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Reign of Jafar Offers Aladdin and Bambi Cards Alongside a New Co-Op Adventure</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As we previously mentioned, Reign of Jafar is Lorcana's eighth set and it will be available in pre-release on May 30 and wide release on June 6. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reign of Jafar will continue the ongoing story in Lorcana that stars the Disney villain, and the Lorcana team has given a summary of what fans can expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Jafar now possesses the Hexwell Crown and, with it, he has corrupted Archazia’s Island to his wicked will," the official description reads. "Traps and illusions abound in <em>Reign of Jafar</em>, and glimmers like Jasmine – Steady Strategist and Rapunzel – High Climber will need to band together to steal back the crown and defeat the evil vizier."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana Reign of Jafar Cards and Sets</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Reign of Jafar, fans will be able to jump into Illumineers' Quest: Palace Heist, which is a new "co-op experience-in-a-box" that will allow four players to team up and take on Jafar and his minion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the cards, fans will be able to try to get Bambi (Prince of the Forest), Flower (Shy Skunk), Thumper (Young Bunny), Jafar (High Sultan of Lorcana), Magic Carpet (Phantom Rug), Aladdin (Vigilant Guard), and much more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Teases of the Future Include Whispers in the Well and Darkwing Duck</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/dlc-whispers-in-the-well-set-art-1746511073170.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the presentation, Disney revealed that the set after Fabled will be called Whispers in the Well and it will arrive in Q4 2025. The team didn't share much, but a key art revealed Mickey, Ariel, and the likely addition of Disney Gargoyles into Lorcana. Oh, and that there is a new type of Glimmer abound. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Farther out, the team finally answered many fans' calls for Darkwing Duck to be added to Lorcana as it was confirmed he will be joining the game in 2026.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Get Ready For the Disney Lorcana World Championship</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The competitve scene in Lorcana is heating up as the Disney Lorcana World Championship will take place on June 28 and 29 in Walt Disney World. This major tournament will see players from around the world competing for the envious title of the first annual Disney Lorcana TCG World Champion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans not in attendance will be able to follow along live on Twitch.TV/DisneyLorcana with a team of casters that includes Rebekah (<em>RebekahQuests</em>), Baker (<em>LorcanaVillain</em>), Liam (<em>The Illumiteers</em>), Brandon (<em>Bsquared24</em>), and JD (<em>JDZ Quest</em>). Additionally, there will be a chance to obtain a non-foil 'A Whole New World' promo card during this time, but more details will be given in the future.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/dlc-promo-a-whole-new-world-1746511087140.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tcgs">what other TCGs alongside Disney Lorcana are worth getting into</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-first-impressions-of-the-new-tcg-expansion">our impressions of Lorcana's Archazia's Island expansion.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Have a tip for us?

The PlayStation reference, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-and-website-still-lists-release-date-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-with-no-mention-of-pc">the trailer notice confirming the footage was entirely captured on PS5</a>, has some wondering whether Sony has signed a co-marketing deal with Rockstar for the promotion of GTA 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GTA series was once inexorably linked to PlayStation, and Rockstar and Sony have done deals like this before. GTA 6, which is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time, would certainly be an aggressive marketing move from Sony, but you can imagine it’s hoping GTA 6 sells the PS5 Pro in huge numbers in time for the May 2026 release date. Assuming we don’t see a PC release at the same time as console, PS5 Pro will be the most powerful platform for what is expected to be the best-selling game of all time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, fans are having fun with this PlayStation nod in the GTA 6 trailer, with some joking that it’s an early look at the PS6.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="fr" dir="ltr">Rockstar Games leak la PS6 dans le second trailer de GTA VI. 👽 <a href="https://t.co/liBCpDFJQX" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/liBCpDFJQX</a></p>— PXL (@MisterPXL) <a href="https://twitter.com/MisterPXL/status/1919760323231219787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"GTA 6 playable within GTA 6 before GTA 6," joked redditor WillyPepper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are wondering if previous GTA games will be playable within GTA 6 in a nod to Rockstar's past, perhaps as one of the many mini-games. "Imagine they just casually put in GTA 4 remaster as a playable mini game," wondered Crazy-Path-7929. "What are the chances we get Vice City emulated in game?" asked PastorPoppyseed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6 Trailer 2, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-70-brand-new-screenshots-reveal-the-characters-and-places-of-leonida">70 brand new GTA 6 screenshots</a>, confirmation of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-song">the trailer’s song</a>, and much more analysis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
