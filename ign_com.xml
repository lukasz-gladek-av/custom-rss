It's called Star Wars: Zero Company, and it's being developed by Bit Reactor with support from Lucasfilm Games and Respawn.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/14/unnamed-3-1744648819191.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The first and only (so far) official art for Zero Company.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't know much more about Zero Company, except that it be a "single-player turn-based tactics game". We won't have to wait long for more information, though, as EA says it will be giving a first look at the game on April 19 at Star Wars Celebration in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Bit Reactor is a newly-formed strategy game studio made up of veterans from games like XCOM, Civilization, Gears of War, and Elder Scrolls Online. The studio was founded in 2022, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-to-be-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration-2025">we've known for a while now</a> that it was working on a Star Wars game with Respawn, but this is the first time we've received any real details about the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Respawn's involvement, it's not 100% clear exactly how involved the studio is. Respawn has undergone a number of difficult challenges lately, including the cancelation of its own Star Wars FPS one year ago <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawns-star-wars-fps-is-canceled-but-work-on-next-jedi-game-black-panther-and-iron-man-will-continue">alongside mass layoffs at EA</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-has-quietly-canceled-a-multiplayer-fps-incubation-project">cancelation of another multiplayer FPS incubation project</a> just last month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More about Star Wars: Zero Company will be revealed at a live panel on Saturday, April 19 at 4:30pm local time in Japan...which is unfortunately 12:30am PT and 3:30am ET over here in the U.S., so set your alarms accordingly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
