While he didn't really think of Final Fantasy as "competition" per se — while they're both RPGs, their approaches to storytelling are quite different  — he did acknowledge that he was "definitely paying attention to it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Way back then, when Final Fantasy originally came out, I was definitely paying attention to it because it was something we needed to look out for," Horii said, reflecting on how the games differ. "But there's one key difference that I really saw back then: the protagonists in the Final Fantasy titles, they speak a lot. Whereas for Dragon Quest, the key objective for [the games], or the experience it offers for the player, is that the player becomes the protagonist themselves.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Final Fantasy Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In Final Fantasy, you kind of observe the protagonist, but you're not necessarily becoming the protagonist in the games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt has ruled out an appearance from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a> at The Game Awards this year, despite its cinematic reveal trailer premiering during last year’s show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While acknowledging The Witcher 4’s nomination in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards 2025, joint-CEO of CD Projekt, Michał Nowakowski, took to <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> to manage expectations, confirming its hotly anticipated sequel is being kept under wraps for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards,” Nowakowski began. “Thanks to everyone who has already voted — your support means a lot to us. We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, that rules out more of The Witcher 4, last seen via a hugely impressive Unreal Engine 5 tech demo in June, any time soon. When might CD Projekt have more to show? Given CD Projekt has indicated The Witcher 4 won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest, perhaps The Game Awards 2026 is a safe bet. According to CD Projekt's latest financial report, 447 people are currently working on The Witcher 4, up slightly from the number reported at the end of July. Clearly, it is CD Projekt's focus right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And don’t go expecting anything from Cyberpunk 2, either. CD Projekt recently said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-has-now-sold-35-million-copies-currently-cd-projekts-main-source-of-revenue-5-years-after-launch">it’s still “laying the foundations” for the sequel</a> while ramping up staff at its development studios. That one’s even further out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, we do know of one title that will be at The Game Awards this year: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/exodus-archetype-entertainment">Exodus</a>. The official Twitter page for the game <a href="https://x.com/EXODUSGame/status/1993365313962889525" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> that a new Exodus trailer will be shown at The Game Awards on December 11. Exodus is a new sci-fi RPG in development at Archetype Entertainment, a studio founded by former BioWare developers James Ohlen, Chad Robertson, and Drew Karpyshyn, and published by Wizards of the Coast.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher 4 Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait for that, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">all the nominations for The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher Paradox Interactive has today taken the blame for the poor sales of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The long in development sequel launched in October and was met with a ‘mixed’ Steam user review response, with fans saying it failed to meet the expectations they had for the sequel to Troika’s 2004 cult classic Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 takes another flawed but unique and remarkable bite at the jugular, with plenty to love and loathe alike, but I certainly enjoyed my time as an elder vampire at the very least.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, after 30 days on sale, <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-ab-writes-down-msek-355-of-capitalised-development-costs-for-vampire--the-masque,c4273262" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paradox has issued a note to financial markets</a> signalling a write-down valued at 355 million SEK (approx. $37 million) of capitalized development costs for Bloodlines 2. This write-down, Paradox said, was based on an updated sales forecast now it has had a month to look at Bloodlines’ commercial performance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive, said the blame for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2’s failure lay at the publisher’s door, not that of The Chinese Room, which had been drafted in to save the project after years of development hell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is a strong vampire fantasy and we are pleased with the developers’ work on the game,” Wester said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve had high expectations for a long time, since we saw that it was a good game with a strong IP in a genre with a broad appeal. A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down. The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales. Going forward, we focus our capital to our core segments and, at the same time, we’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has two expansions planned as part of the game’s Premium Edition, and Paradox said it remains committed to delivering them. “Our post-release plan remains firm; we will deliver updates and the promised expansions to the game in the coming year,” Wester added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Swedish game company Paradox’s main focus is on grand strategy games, which have proven enormously successful over the years. Games such as Stellaris, Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, and Cities: Skylines have all enjoyed big sales, and, in total, Paradox games have six million players each month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, however, falls outside that core grand strategy genre, and always looked like it would struggle upon release. And while its development trouble began years ago, it suffered issues right up to launch. In September, a month before release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-adds-clans-to-base-game-after-fan-outcry-over-launch-dlc">Paradox and The Chinese Room announced that the Lasombra and Toreador clans would be available in the base <u>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</u> experience following a backlash from players</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paradox <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/22/bloodlines-2-announced"><u>announced</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2"><u>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</u></a> all the way back in 2019 with then-developer Hardsuit aiming for a Q1 2020 release window. That, of course, never happened, as Paradox would go on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-developer-removed-game-delayed-out-of-2021"><u>announce an indefinite delay</u></a> alongside Hardsuit's departure from the project. The Chinese Room was then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-with-a-new-developer-and-release-window"><u>announced as its new developer</u></a> in 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/iyWDyNLAo1E?si=H6x-u7AFGCe4F7Hz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the Goth Boss podcast</u></a>, former creative director Dan Pinchbeck said the development team tried to work out how to get Paradox to <em>not </em>call the game Bloodlines 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The tricky question around it was Bloodlines 1," Pinchbeck said. "Are you making a sequel to Bloodlines 1? We used to sit there and have these planning sessions of how do we get them to not call it Bloodlines 2? That feels like the most important thing we do here, to come at this and say this isn't Bloodlines 2. We can't make Bloodlines 2; there's not enough time, there's not enough money.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.
