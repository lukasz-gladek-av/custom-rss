If you do, try restarting the matchmaking process, FromSoftware suggested. That’s not a great help, admittedly, but at least we know the developer is aware of the problem. “Thank you for your patience and understanding,” it added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware followed that social post with <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928822575318126753" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another</a>, this time acknowledging issues on PlayStation consoles specifically. Those on PS4 and PS5 who are having difficulty matchmaking should check their NAT type, FromSoftware said. “NAT type 3 may affect matchmaking on PSN,” it explained.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Check your NAT type with the following steps:</li><li>Home &gt; Settings &gt; Network &gt; Connection Status &gt; Check Connection Status</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no specific advice for Xbox at this time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, producer Yasuhiro Kitao <a href="https://x.com/YasuhiroKitao/status/1928475446217163233" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to comment on Elden Ring Nightreign’s early sales success (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-sells-2-million-units-on-the-first-day">2 million units in its first day</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nightreign has some peculiar aspects to its game design and is different from our recent titles in various ways,” Kitao said. “Nonetheless, many of you have bravely jumped into this world, and for that we're immensely grateful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As with Demon's Souls or Sekiro, it may be confounding at first, but just like those games, Nightreign offers its own challenges and experiences. Once you overcome the initial hurdle, it'll surely provide a sense of accomplishment that's also its very own. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hope you enjoy it.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what might this tweet be about, specifically? Well, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-massive-steam-launch-tarnished-by-mixed-user-reviews-over-lack-of-duos-co-op-voice-chat">Nightreign is still on a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam</a>, with much of the negative sentiment revolving around its brutal solo experience, its lack of duos co-op, lack of voice chat, and other archaic mechanics. That age-old multiplayer struggle to find enough friends to make up a coordinated three-player group is very much a part of the Elden Ring Nightreign experience, too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-developer-fromsoftware-already-has-a-patch-in-the-works-to-make-the-brutally-difficult-solo-play-easier"><u>A patch to make solo play easier is due out next week</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As explained in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign review</u></a>: "Let’s get the most important caveat out of the way first: if you are hoping to tackle Nightreign entirely solo, and are anything less than a hardcore Elden Ring player that actively seeks out ways to make that already difficult game even more challenging, Nightreign isn’t for you. Yes, there is technically a single-player option, but it is so poorly balanced that I would be shocked if it isn’t patched and adjusted within the first month of release. And this is coming from someone who lives and breathes these types of games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
