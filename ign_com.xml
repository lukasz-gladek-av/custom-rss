            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Save on Azurite Sea Boosters, Gift Boxes, Playmats, and more.</h2></p><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has some excellent deals on Disney Lorcana cards today, and in particular, you can currently pick up a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxeP3p?object_uuid=733b85fb-6d00-4819-8dca-3793d630202f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Display set of Azurite Sea for just $90.50</a>. That's a significant 37% drop from the list price of $143.99, and one of the best deals we've ever seen on the booster set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes 24 Packs with 12 cards in each, so that's a total of 288 cards, with each pack guaranteeing at least six common and three uncommon cards, alongside two cards of rare, super rare, or legendary rarity, and finally 1 randomly selected foil card amongst these.</p><div id="235577"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235577" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Disney Lorcana TCG: Azurite Sea Booster Pack Display (24 Packs)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, it's also worth noting that this is a limited-time lightning deal at Amazon, and once it's gone, it's gone. At this price, I wouldn't be surprised if fans snap these up as soon as possible, as there's still plenty of trading potential in Azurite Sea. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, there are loads of other great Lorcana deals to check out at Amazon this week as well. That includes the Gateway Board Game down to just $16.30 - 35% off, and it is basically the perfect way to start playing Lorcana, or even teach you and a friend how to start off on one of the most promising new TCGs in recent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My other favorite in the sale is on the Azurite Sea Stitch Collector's Gift Set, which includes six collector cards and four Booster packs of 12 additional game cards in each. That's down to just $33.94 right now, and another tidy drop from the $49.99 list price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Disney Lorcana news, there is a brand new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-new-collection-starter-set-and-scrooge-mcduck-gift-boxes-are-now-up-for-preorder">Gift Set and Collection Set up for preorder at Amazon today</a>, featuring Scrooge McDuck and Stitch respectively. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is IGN's Senior Commerce Editor and resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a> developer Fuse Games has said its racing adventure will feature a "good mix" of new faces and classic characters from a galaxy far, far away, following the reveal of Phantom Menace returnee Ben Quadinaros. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN as part of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-star-wars-galactic-racer-interview-why-its-not-open-world-how-its-story-mode-works-and-when-its-set">wide-ranging interview on Star Wars: Galactic Racer's track-based design, story mode and innovative boost gameplay</a>, creative director Kieran Crimmins teased that fans will be able to look forward to more characters from previous Star Wars movies and games joining the fray. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's going to be a good mix of familiar faces and new characters," Crimmins said. "Obviously we want to get that mix right, so no matter what kind of Star Wars media you've engaged with, whether it be a movie or game, there's a bunch of familiarity in there when it comes to the space. Otherwise it wouldn't feel like an authentic Star Wars experience. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So there's both familiar faces and new characters," Crimmins continued, acknowledging Sebulba and Quadinaros. "We can't talk about who exactly they are just yet though, sorry."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who else might appear? While less well known, it's possible that other participants seen in Episode 1's podrace might appear, alongside Sebulba and Quadinaros. The Boonta Eve Classic had 18 participants, though poor Ratts Tyerell died during the race, while Anakin Skywalker... well, we all know what happened to him. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've seen racing as an activity and as a sport in Star Wars has been around in many forms, right?" Fuse Games founder and CEO Matt Webster said at another point, going on to potentially hint at racers from other parts of Star Wars being included. "Episode 1's podracing we all know and love, Bad Batch's riot racing in Season 2 was just awesome. Star Wars Resistance has got the Aces and low-altitude starfighter racing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Galactic Racer is set sometime after Return of the Jedi, so anyone could potentially put in an appearance. It seems unlikely we'll see Luke Skywalker, who was quite busy doing other things during this period, but who knows? He sure knows how to race a speeder bike across Endor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week brought our best look yet at Star Wars: Galactic Racer, though we delve much deeper into its clever two-tier boost system, environmental effects, and how the game will let you nuture rivalries and interact with characters on foot in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-star-wars-galactic-racer-interview-why-its-not-open-world-how-its-story-mode-works-and-when-its-set">big Star Wars: Galactic Racer interview that you can go read right now</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
