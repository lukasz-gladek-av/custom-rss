The rest, as they say, is history: Spider-Man was inarguably Magic’s most disappointing set of at least the last year (maybe longer), and Edge of Eternities was much more well-received but invariably didn’t get its chance in the limelight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I was hoping that Wizards would take some lessons from it, we’re now entering a 2026 roadmap with seven full sets planned. Lorwyn Eclipsed is great, and only just launched, but that’s January’s set. Preorders are now live for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGrVNq?object_uuid=fcf04366-9d70-4822-9c66-d2bf97a545a8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Rnk8?object_uuid=fcf04366-9d70-4822-9c66-d2bf97a545a8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Secrets of Strixhaven</u></a>, and even <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56LlN?object_uuid=fcf04366-9d70-4822-9c66-d2bf97a545a8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Marvel Super Heroes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last set, by the way, is around five months from launch. While I appreciate that a company needs a line on a graph to go up to show success by bringing in new players, it’s starting to feel like Wizards of the Coast is trampling on Magic’s own legacy in its desperation to talk about crossover sets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lorwyn Eclipsed should be a celebration, a chance to return to a beloved Plane full of classic creature types, and instead, we’re getting close to the Turtles landing on store shelves. Looking past Strixhaven to a Marvel crossover, this early (and with the taste of the Spider-Man set still lingering), is just a bad look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Please, Wizards - don’t let Secrets of Strixhaven suffer the same way Edge of Eternities is. It’s almost unavoidable with such a packed release calendar, but if you can’t pay enough time to your own universes, the ones that have captivated players for over three decades, does that not tell you a change is required?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, all of this is moot anyway - I’m part of the problem. I’ve pre-ordered some Marvel Superheroes products, and you can bet your Bilbo Baggins that I’ll be first in line for The Hobbit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Magic’s current set, Lorwyn Eclipsed, be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-most-expensive-cards"><u>our list of the best chase cards</u></a> in the set right now, as well as a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-weird-wonderful-creatures-of-magic-the-gatherings-new-lorwyn-eclipsed-set"><u>all eight creature types</u></a> in the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.
