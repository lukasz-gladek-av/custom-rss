Fans have spent the time since the December 16 launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-cold-snap-update-goes-live-alongside-big-170-patch-notes"><u>update 1.7.0</u></a> (a.k.a. Cold Snap) theorizing about what the new year may hold while sharing any new concerns with Embark. Although The Goalie Raider Deck helped tide players over late last month, the lack of a firm 2026 roadmap has left some fans curious about what’s to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One player tapped into some of their more pressing issues and shared them with Embark yesterday. They specifically take issue with what they believe is a “lack of urgency” at the studio, calling for communication and tweaks for Stella Montis, cheaters, the skill tree, Trigger Nades, and more. Birdie replied, and while not every point was addressed, it seems Embark has plans to tackle balance changes sooner rather than later – and a Trigger Nade nerf may be on the docket.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The holidays delayed things a bit, but the dev team want you to know that they are looking into balance, for example, the stitcher, kettle, and trigger nade,” the community manager explained. “Rest assured that we hear you and work on delivering a good gaming experience, things are just not immediate.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The shape these nerfs will take remains unclear for now, leaving some players concerned that they’ll do more harm than good before actually evening the playing field. It’s also unclear if the next Arc Raiders update will feature some of these teased balance adjustments, but it’s least being looked into as Embark gets back into the swing of things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s Arc Raiders news is a far cry from the 2026 roadmap fans have been hoping to see. While we wait for something more concrete from the team, you can read about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-arc-raiders-movie-and-tv-show-offers-are-already-coming-in-and-the-boss-of-embark-studios-sounds-up-for-it"><u>why some fans are expecting to eventually see an Arc Raiders movie and TV show</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Another entry in the Wolfenstein franchise may be on the way, according to multiple reports today. Specifically, a Wolfenstein 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The possibility was first mentioned by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Central today</a> as part of a 2026 Xbox predictions piece, and was corroborated by <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotaku</a>. No hard details were provided, just that the game is in development with Machine Games and, per Windows Central, may be timed to coincide with the already-announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wolfenstein-series-in-development-at-amazon-with-fallout-show-team-attached">Wolfenstein TV series with Amazon</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This would be Machine Games' first return to Wolfenstein since 2019's Wolfenstein: Young Blood, which saw series protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz's twin daughters searching for him in France and, of course, fighting the Nazis. Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, was all the way back in 2017, so a third Wolfenstein game would be a long-awaited return indeed. Of course, MachineGames has been a bit busy lately, helping out on Doom: Legacy of Rust and developing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Windows Central also suggests the studio may be working on a "Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wolfenstein reports also aren't a huge shock, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/machinegames-teases-were-not-done-with-wolfenstein-yet">Machine Games studio head Jerk Gustafsson said</a> just this past September that the series was always meant to be a trilogy, and that "we're not done with Wolfenstein yet." A third game would presumably find a way to wrap up B.J. Blazkowicz's story, and would almost certainly find a way to wrap up the ongoing battle against the Nazis. It's unclear if it would take place before or after Young Blood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Young Blood, we weren't the biggest fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/25/wolfenstein-youngblood-review">giving it a 6.5/10 </a>and calling it "an aggressively okay co-op shooter that doesn’t come close to recapturing the joy of its predecessor’s action or its surprisingly interesting characters and story." We did, however, love The New Colossus, saying it's "a fantastic single-player shooter" with "brilliantly written characters and performances" in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/28/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review">our 9.1/10 review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
