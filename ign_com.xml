It’s confirmation that two classic tactical espionage action titles are getting touch-ups, but more importantly, it means MGS4 will finally leave its PS3 prison when the collection launches August 27, 2026. Konami has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le2VFSdYzPw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed separately</a> that, in addition to PS5, the collection is coming to PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, and Xbox Series X | S.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Creator Hideo Kojima’s fourth mainline Metal Gear Solid game features David Hayter as an elderly Solid Snake and was originally released for the PS3 in 2008. It’s also remained on this one platform since, meaning only those who own the 20-year-old console have been able to (officially) play it. Now, after 18 years, Old Snake’s story will be available to experience elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also included in Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 is 2010’s MGS: Peace Walker, which originally launched for PSP and later came to the PS3 and Xbox 360. Hardcore fans can also enjoy access to 2000's Game Boy title Metal Gear: Ghost Babel, as well as the digital soundtrack. Even without confirmation regarding what changes the Master Collection Vol. 2 brings, most fans would probably agree that ports for each of these games are long overdue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1"><u>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1</u></a> in October 2023 and, despite its title suggesting at least one additional volume would be developed, has mostly remained quiet about a sequel since.

First up was the reveal that Dead or Alive 6 is being re-released for PS5 with new features, new characters, and more content in development, too. The big surprise, though, was a first look at the studio’s plans to celebrate the series’ 30th anniversary: Dead or Alive 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First footage of the currently untitled PS5 game was shown during the presentation and includes a look at Ninja Gaiden's Ryu Hayabusa.
