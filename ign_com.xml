            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege-x"><u>Rainbow Six Siege</u></a> is getting a Metal Gear Solid crossover, as Ubisoft is teasing that Solid Snake will appear as a new Operator in Year 11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A 15-second clip for the tactical action game’s next roadmap lays it on thick, showing not just a faceless body wearing a familiar sneaking suit but a Metal Gear Solid 1-style Codec Call from none other than Splinter Cell star Sam Fisher. It’s the kind of crossover fans have dreamed about for decades, brought to life as Ubisoft teases a full reveal for the Year 11 roadmap that’s scheduled to take place next month, February 15, at 8 a.m. PT / 11 a.m. ET on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rainbow Six Siege Twitch page</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear if today’s tease is just for the Solid Snake Operator or if fans should instead expect a selection of skins from Konami as well, but judging by the fanfare surrounding the reveal, it looks like Ubisoft went all out for this latest collaboration. Either way, the Solid Snake teaser marks what is likely the most exciting Operator in the last 10 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were some early signs that Rainbow Six Siege could soon meet the world of Metal Gear Solid. Reputable dataminer <a href="https://x.com/Shiiny77/status/2014760041740734601?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>@Shiiny77</u></a> suggested a collaboration was in the cards for Year 11 Season 1 just last week, teasing that “it is not just a skin collaboration” like fans have seen in the past. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-rainbow-six-siege/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Insider Gaming</u></a> later said it was able to independently verify the leak as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There is so much out of this collab and the season itself, its so packed,” @Shiiny77 <a href="https://x.com/Shiiny77/status/2014763388434366839?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a> at the time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid may be one of the wildest crossovers for Rainbow Six Siege so far, but it’s far from the first. Other recent collaborations have brought the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/rainbow-six-siege-x-official-attack-on-titan-bundle-trailer"><u>Attack on Titan</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/rainbow-six-siege-x-official-the-boys-bundle-trailer"><u>The Boys</u></a> universes into the fold with various cosmetics for existing Operators. Splinter Cell didn’t launch with the game when it first launched back in 2015, but Sam Fisher did go on to get his own Operator in the form of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splinter-cells-sam-fisher-to-join-rainbow-six-siege-as-an-operator"><u>Specialist Zero</u></a> in 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll learn more about what this official meeting between Solid Snake has in store February 15. In the meantime, Rainbow Six Siege recently received a massive 10-year update to become Rainbow Six Siege X. You can check out why we think it’s now an 8/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-review"><u>our review</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We understand some players may find these restrictions limiting."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo fans have criticized the company's decision to heavily restrict image-sharing from within <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the conclusion of today's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-in-the-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Nintendo Direct</a>, the company posted an unusual <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> to its support website announcing that "limits" would be placed on the ability to share screenshots from the upcoming social sim to ensure "the worlds players create... remain fun and safe, and that the game can be enjoyed comfortably by all players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Nintendo's English-language statement does not go into further detail, the company's Japanese support site has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> that this entails a block on the ability to directly share screenshots to social media or to a smartphone, though sharing gameplay via Game Chat will be allowed. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The immediate response to this decision from Nintendo fans has been negative, with many contrasting the game's ability to create quirky, unexpected and potentially very sharable social gameplay situations with Nintendo's refusal to let players actually share said gameplay socially.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wow they killed the game," Nintendo fan Raccoon wrote on video game forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-restricting-image-sharing-features-for-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream.1419745/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "Social media was going to shoot this into the stratosphere, instead they killed it. Very disappointing." Added PlanetSmasher: "Wasn't this, like, the reason people were into Tomodachi Life last time? Like being able to share goofy images with friends? That was what made the game go viral in the first place."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have gone further, saying that were disappointed to see these restrictions applied to a game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-decade-after-nintendos-same-sex-relationship-controversy-tomodachi-life-finally-delivers-on-promise-to-make-series-more-inclusive">that finally allows players to customize their characters with a more diverse range of genders, voice options and dating preferences</a>. "Sure, you can be gay and non-binary! BUT YOU BETTER NOT SHOW ANYONE!!" wrote another fan, doops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream allows you to play as a Mii version of anyone, alongside Mii versions of anyone else — potentially people you know in real-life, celebrities, or long-dead dictators. The potential for players (and the game's systems) to create bizarre and unexpected scenarios here is huge, and it's perhaps not surprising to see Nintendo acting cautiously.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I get why they don't want you having, like, Hitler Mii and Trump Mii hooking up and then posting that all over the internet and people getting mad at Nintendo for it because that's exactly the type of thing Nintendo hates," wrote jph139. "But that's also 99% of the appeal so not sure what they were expecting?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can understand why they're being cautious," agreed PucePikmin. "The idea of making Miis of your friends and celebrities and having them do wacky things is fun, and the way it's executed in these games is innocent, but the concept of 'make avatars of other people and make them do things' is a more fraught idea in 2026 for any number of reasons."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those intent on sharing clips of gameplay, this likely does not remove all avenues of doing so. There's no suggestion here that Nintendo has removed the ability to share screenshots saved to an SD card via PC, or the ability to use capture equipment to record gameplay. And, of course, you can just film your screen with your smartphone. Instead, Nintendo's statement suggests it is intending more to place a hurdle in place, curbing what it seems to believe is the potential for problems to occur.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo aims to create experiences where players have the freedom to enjoy their Mii characters in their own way," the company stated today. "In Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, this freedom can sometimes lead to humorous, surprising, or unpredictable moments during gameplay. While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone. To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image sharing features. These limits help to make the worlds players create in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream remain fun and safe, and that the game can be enjoyed comfortably by all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We understand that some players may find these restrictions limiting. However, they reflect Nintendo’s ongoing philosophy of creating experiences that bring smiles to everyone who plays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, it was confirmed that hit superhero workplace comedy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-is-censored-on-nintendo-switch-due-to-platform-content-criteria-developer-says">Dispatch would be censored upon release for Nintendo Switch platforms</a>, with the game's nudity covered up by large black boxes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <guid>1420150</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is getting the first of a number of planned voice packs at the end of February, each sold for $4.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first voice pack, which is <em>not</em> included in the Season Pass and thus has <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/343-january-community-update#post-6777" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upset some players who believe it should be part of the premium DLC package</a>, drops alongside Patch 12 (the one that adds <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2s-upcoming-techmarine-class-has-a-unique-ability-that-has-fans-very-excited-indeed">the long-awaited Techmarine class</a>), and includes over 450 voice lines per Chapter, dubbed in the seven audio languages Saber Interactive’s explosive third-persion action game already supports.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means you get unique lines based on the Chapter, and your Space Marine will shout these new lines. New lines are also in the Social Wheel emote. In a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/343-january-community-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community update</a>, publisher Focus Entertainment used the example of a Space Wolf (the Space Wolves are among the most popular chapters in all 40k), who will shout  “For the Allfather” instead of the usual “For the Emperor."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Techmarine Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Focus made a point of confirming that none of this voice work is the result of generative AI. “And for those who may be wondering: we’re happy to confirm that each and every one of this Voice Pack’s 1,300+ total voice lines were performed by a real voice actor, as our commitment to quality remains absolute,” Focus said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice actors in English are:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Thomas Mitchells (Blood Angels)</li><li>Andrew James Spooner (Space Wolves)</li><li>Kris W. Laudrum (Black Templars)</li></ul><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/29/lookingcooljoker-1769704535041.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is getting a $5 voice pack. Image credit: Focus Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can probably tell from the image above, the first voice pack comes with a set of three new heads for PvE. All three heads (Space Wolf, Blood Angel, Black Templars) are part of the same Voice Pack, and are not sold separately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can, however, equip one Chapter’s head with another Chapter’s voice. Voices and heads aren’t tied together. The voices aren’t class-restricted, either. And finally, a second voice pack is already in the works. Focus will say more later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, Warhammer maker Games Workshop banned the use of AI in its content production and design process, insisting that none of its senior managers were currently excited about the technology. So perhaps it comes as no surprise to see the ‘no AI voices’ message made clear in this post.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As an aside, in the world of Warhammer 40,000, AI does not stand for Artificial Intelligence. Rather, it stands for Abominable Intelligence. And, as Games Workshop has banned AI within the confines of its Nottingham headquarters, humanity has banned AI within the Imperium of Man. That’s because during the ‘Dark Age of Technology,’ AI rebelled against humanity in a bloody war that almost resulted in our extinction. Eventually, humanity won out, and, sufficiently traumatized, forbid the use of AI at all. That is, you can’t have ‘thinking machines’ in the Imperium, which is in part why the future tech is all a bit backwards for the 41st millennium.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of generative AI in game development is one of the hottest topics in the industry, and it has sparked a number of controversies. Following the reveal of Divinity at the 2025 The Game Awards, Swen Vincke, boss of developer Larian, met with a backlash after he said the studio was using genAI in various capacities. Larian ended up having to address AI concerns in a reddit AMA in which the studio confirmed a U-turn on some aspects of its use. And this week, RuneScape maker Jagex insisted it would never use generative AI to make content players actually see in-game, in one of the hardest stances on AI yet seen from a video game developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, some video game companies have gone all-in on the tech. The CEO of Genvid — the company behind choose-your-own-adventure interactive series Silent Hill Ascension — has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gen-z-loves-ai-slop-former-square-enix-exec-claims-a-lot-of-ai-sentiment-is-driven-by-emotion-rather-than-logic"><u>claimed "consumers generally do not care" about generative AI, and stated that: "Gen Z loves AI slop."</u></a> EA CEO Andrew Wilson, meanwhile, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>said AI is "the very core of our business,"</u></a> and Square Enix recently implemented mass layoffs and reorganized, saying it needed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan"><u>be "aggressive in applying AI."</u></a> Dead Space creator Glen Schofield also recently detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered"><u>his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in game development</u></a>, and former God of War dev Meghan Morgan Juinio said: "... if we don’t embrace [AI], <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short"><u>I think we’re selling ourselves short</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
