            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to 2D action platformers, I don’t necessarily need them to be revolutionary. But I do expect a superb execution of the fundamentals – speed, control, and challenge – all of which the upcoming Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is nailing down based on a two-hour hands-on demo I played. That’s not to say it doesn’t have new ideas woven into the formula, it’s just that I came away simply impressed by how this reboot plays like a well-oiled machine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven’t seen it in action yet, think of it as the classic Shinobi franchise getting the Streets of Rage 4 treatment; a vibrant and expressive hand-drawn art style that looks fantastic in stills and even better in motion. Many of the developers at LizardCube had worked on the Streets of Rage reboot, and it ended up being a great fit because it breathes life into a 2D world in a way few other games have done. A level’s backdrop can give a notable sense of scale, and the illusion of distance in this new Shinobi – what could’ve been a drab shipyard level feels immense when you see the details of huge cranes, ships, and containers in the background. And the interiors painted with neon signs and neo-modern shops and stalls fill the in-betweens with personality. A great sense of style pops in small but effective ways.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A banging electronic trip-hop soundtrack fused with traditional Japanese folk instruments also feeds into its balance of classic and modern sensibilities, vaguely reminiscent of something out of Samurai Champloo. The Art of Vengeance both looks and sounds effortlessly cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I went through the opening level that I played earlier this year at Summer Game Fest, which reintroduces series protagonist Joe Musashi as his village and clan are under attack the minute you start. His wife Naoko and understudy Tomoe are introduced as he has to leave them behind to chase down a military invasion led by the antagonist Lord Ruse and a gang of his demonic minions. You’re taught the basics like combos, dodging, wall-jumping, and special abilities, quickly pitting you against a mix of platforming sections to sharpen your mobility and combat encounters to test deftness with the blade and Ninpo specials.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance - Preview Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This preview round, however, I cleared two full levels around the midway point, where I had a slew of new abilities and much tougher foes. I had to play both in Arcade Mode which reconfigures levels for a time attack-style version of them, and while the checkpointing was generous, Arcade Mode is all about having a seamless run to earn a high grade in the end. The aforementioned shipyard had pesky drones, guards in riot gear, and enemy ninjas with unblockable dark spells – any combination of these guys made for some tough normal encounters that can get overwhelming if you don’t know who to prioritize. And with clever but trial-and-error platforming challenges, it was a tall task to get through without death (at least on my first try). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s the flow and fluidity of the gameplay that made my time with Shinobi so enjoyable.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I know that on paper, all this may sound like what you should expect from a proper 2D action platformer, but it’s the flow and fluidity of the gameplay that made my time with Shinobi so enjoyable. When I can slice a gang of enemies within a sliver of health and hit the shoulder buttons to pull off a swift and dramatic multi-hit execution, I’m pumped up like I’m stringing a series of glory kills in the new Doom games. The novelty hadn’t worn thin because, like glory kills, it doesn’t get in the way of the flowing fast action, and you get health and Ninpo energy in return as a treat. Hitting your light-heavy combos is all well and good, but when I execute my counterattack Ninpo on a dime to chop down a strong enemy’s health, I’m nodding my head in satisfaction. And Joe’s ultimate ability, which builds up through taking damage, just burns through everything on screen which was clutch in sticky situations that had me popping off when it finished a boss. Even something as simple as going from a platforming section into divekicking a foe to start my combo string in combat sequence is a small but effective thing that shows LizardCube knows what makes 2D action tick.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There wasn’t any real story content to glean from these later levels, but boy, are these stages <em>long</em>. And when they’re capped off with intense boss fights, Arcade Mode can really wear you down – which isn’t a derogatory mark, but rather an indication of demanding Shinobi can be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all going from left to right, however. The second level I played was in neon-soaked slums that had three sections to the west, east, and south where I had to find and save children being held captive. This stage leaned more into exploration, where connecting ziplines and jumps to avoid hazards and lurking enemies pushed me to be more precise with movement. Snipers lurking in the distance could one-shot me lest I one-shot them first, goopy slimes moving underground can pop-up for toxic damage, and those damn riot guards are a different kind of challenge in close quarters. The boss fight here was my favorite, which had me thinking more about aerial combos since he could fly across the combat arena – he also had a phase where he would heal up if I didn’t do enough damage in time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Balancing depth and approachability is one aspect I think Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is getting right from what I’ve played. I have just enough tools to feel equipped for its toughest battles, not overwhelming and not shallow. Thus, the focus is on your mastery of the toolset and reacting to some devastating combat mechanics from enemies. Since it controls incredibly smooth, and is properly paced with a speed to match its style of challenges, the fundamentals of a good 2D action platformer seem to all be here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The return of our old ninja-themed action games is great to see – well, maybe it’s just this and Ninja Gaiden Ragebound (which also has Streets of Rage 4 lineage via publisher DotEmu). But in the years since both series’ heyday, we’ve seen countless others set the bar higher and higher with games like Dead Cells, The Messenger, and Katana Zero to name a few. To speak for Shinobi specifically, Art of Vengeance feels like an old head coming back to show the youngins that they still got it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’ll truly prove whether or not the series still has the juice when Shinobi: Art of Vengeance launches on August 28 this year for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-is-2d-action-done-right-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>
