            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Lorcana has just launched its 11th new set, Winterspell, and there's a whole lot to like about it already. The new frost-themed card art is sublime, and it's undeniably a particularly cosy expansion before we look ahead to the highly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-full-release-schedule-2026">Wilds Unknown expansion in May</a>, featuring fan favorite Pixar characters for the first time.</p><p id="winterspells-10-top-chase-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Winterspell's 10 Top Chase Cards">Lorcana: Winterspell - 10 Best Chase Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But enough on that, let's take a look at what's really rocking for single card collectors in Winterspell, including two brand new iconic rares that are already demanding a mighty high price (we're talking thousands of dollars), and unsurprisingly, feature some of the finest art I've ever seen in a trading card game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56qVx?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">data from our friends at TCGplayer</a>, here are the 10 most valuable Disney Lorcana cards to come out of the new Winterspell expansion.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">10 - Tod - Knows All the Tricks (Enchanted)</h3><div id="235529"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235529" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tod - Knows All the Tricks (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another absolutely adorable card that I can't get enough of from Winterspell, is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLp3k0?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tod - Knows All the Tricks</a>. The Enchanted variant is looking fairly valuable as well, currently sitting at around $190 market price, while its <a href="https://zdcs.link/QW6qMl?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary is fetching around $6-$8 right now as well</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His ability to ready up again twice per turn when chosen for an action or an item's ability seems fairly good to me as well, with a high ceiling for shenanigans, from my initial impressions at least. I'm certainly going to be chasing after Tod, and I suspect plenty of fans will be as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">9 - The Cold Never Bothered Me (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235519"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235519" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Cold Never Bothered Me (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course we're getting some delightful Frozen themed cards in the Winterspell set, it would be crime not to. And, 'The Cold Never Bothered Me' (anyway?) is one for collectors to absolutely keep a sharp eye out for, especially its delightful Enchanted version. Market price highs are reaching around $171.49 right now, and I've got a funny feeling this valuation will continue to rise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It features some incredible card art of Elsa, funnily enough from an artist also named Elsa (Elsa Chang, to be exact). It reads: "Look at the top 4 cards of your deck. You may reveal a location card and put it into your hand. Put the rest into your discard. You pay 3 Ink less for the next location you play this turn."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">8 - Raging Storm (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235530"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235530" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Raging Storm (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Enchanted card demanding a high price is Raging Storm, featuring Nani, Lilo, and Stitch with some wonderful card art from Jane Pica.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's demanding a fairly high price right now at <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yPj7O?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$126.26 at TCGplayer</a>, but if you really want this card, you can also just pick up its <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoJxlL?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Super Rare variant for around $4</a> instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, it's another Winterspell card that Collectors are bound to be all over, and chasing as for it as hard as they can. Keep an eye on this one, as I think it's got a whole lot of value potential even further into the future as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">7 - Eeyore - In the Way (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235525"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235525" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Eeyore - In the Way (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This might be one of my favorite ever cards to come out of Disney Lorcana. This full card art of Eeyore - In the Way, by Gabby Zapata, is absolutely stunning, and worth the high price of the card alone. If I get lucky and manage to pull this sweetheart, then even better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Running for around $130 at market on TCGplayer right now, this is still a hot card to come by, even if it just misses out on a top ten ranking by value. And while it doesn't reach the eye watering values of the rest of the cards coming up on this list, at $130+, it's still a unbelievably good pull if you manage to score it. It's a card I'm absolutely on the look out for right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">6 - Belle - Snowfield Strategist (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235566"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235566" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Belle - Snowfield Strategist (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring some wonderful art from Jane Pica, this enchanted variant of Beauty and the Beast's "Belle - Snowfield Strategist" has got all the makings of an increasingly valuable card, in the short and long term. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It reads: "[Winter Stockpile] Whenever one of your characters is banished, you may put that card from your discard into your inkwell facedown and exerted."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting at around $145.48 on TCGplayer right now, I can only seeing it going up in value over the next few months. Let's wait and see.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"> 5 - Angel - Experiment 624 (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235565"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235565" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Angel - Experiment 624 (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Angel - Experiment 624 is just an incredible well rounded card, and a great addition to the Winterspell expansion, so I'm not surprised that it's fetching a tidy price at launch. The Legendary card is sitting at around $24.76 right now on TCGplayer, while the stunning Enchanted variant is at $177.84, and there's no surprise why. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Community sentiment around Angel, who features heavily on Winterspell key art across its marketing and sealed product selection, has been incredibly positive so far. Prices could come down a little bit as we get further away from launch, but I've got a funny feeling it's going to hold out for a while longer. If you manage to find this one, I'd avoid selling and hold on, at least that's what I'll be doing.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">4 - Ohana Means Family (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235528"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235528" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ohana Means Family (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring both Lilo and Stitch, this Enchanted action card is already hovering just shy of the $200 market mark, and it boasts some genuinely charming artwork from Kei Yotsuba. Its Legendary card version has decent value right now as well, sitting at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN3xky?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$27.19 at TCGplayer's market price</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mechanically, it is more or less a rework of <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l8nqr?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rapunzel - Gifted with Healing from The First Chapter</a>, carrying almost the exact same effect, but as an action card, and being potentially slightly less flexible in real play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather than capping the effect, like Rapunzel did at three damage, Ohana Means Family instead removes all damage from one of your characters and lets you draw a card for each point healed in the process. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">3 - Anna - Soothing Sister (Enchanted)</h3></div><div id="235517"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235517" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anna - Soothing Sister (Enchanted)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Frozen-themed card from Winterspell, this time focusing on Anna. Soothing Sister's Enchanted card art is another beautiful example from the new set. It's currently worth just over $200 at TCGplayer, and it's easy to see why. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can see this as another card from the latest set that will continue to rise in value over the next few weeks. If you manage to pull it, hold on for a bit longer. And if you fancy a solid investment, well look no further.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2 - Pocahontas - Peacekeeper (Iconic)</h3></div><div id="235526"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235526" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pocahontas - Peacekeeper (Iconic)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of two Iconics from the Winterspell expansion, and I can already see why this is going to be a huge chase card for both players and collectors. Sitting at just over $400, I'm hardly surprised that Pocahontas - Peacekeeper is demanding such a high price already. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, there's a whole lot of potential in the card itself, even if you want to just opt for the equally as beautiful, if a little less expensive, <a href="https://zdcs.link/ae8PWw?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary variant (which is valued at just under $6 right now)</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Easily paired with <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3OvWM?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pocahontas - Following the Wind</a>, also featured in Winterspell, this puts you on a one way train to locking down the board for a full turn and completely shutting off your opponent's ability to challenge. That is not a small effect, and just the tiniest bit mad, all things considered. I love it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">1 - Moana - Curious Explorer (Iconic)</h3></div><div id="235527"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235527" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Moana - Curious Explorer (Iconic)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The demand on this card is honestly mind-boggling. But, I can also get behind it. The card art by Leslie Strock is to die for, and it's probably one of my favorite designs I've ever seen in a trading card game, let alone Lorcana itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, <em>the price</em> is eye-wateringly high. There's something to be said about never having to ink a card from your hand again, which is why the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yPj1P?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary variant</a> we mentioned earlier is also spiking at decent value since launch (sitting at around $26), but the Iconic rare is just on another planet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like, come on, $550 - that's nuts? That's playing ball with some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-top-10-most-valuable-cards-from-last-year-2025">rarest Pokémon</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-most-valuable-cards-2025-updated">Magic: The Gathering cards</a>. Let's go, Lorcana, I guess, making its very own economy with every release is as impressive as it sounds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm skeptical that it can maintain such a high demand going forward, but since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-fabled-most-expensive-cards">Fabled introduced Iconic</a> rarity, it has certainly introduced the perfect height of card chasing for what is a TCG somewhat still in its infancy. Best to just see where things go next, cross your fingers, and then throw an enormous party if you manage to pull such a rare card when ripping packs. </p></div><p id="where-to-buy-winterspell"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to Buy - Winterspell">Where to Buy - Disney Lorcana: Winterspell</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some quick honorable mentions before I finished up, as it's also worth keeping an eye on several other Winterspell cards that look like they have plenty of potential. That includes <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7RbLE?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lilo - Rock Star</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QG8VvV?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Darkwing Duck - Cool Under Pressure</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wBGrR?object_uuid=3afcf91c-4390-45a2-8756-8fc389026e4e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mulan - Resourceful Recruit</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to find any of these cards, rather than buying them outright as singles, then you'll want to pick up some Winterspell boosters ASAP. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-tcg-winterspell-where-to-buy">Winterspell is now available to buy</a> at most major retailers, but I'd recommend at least picking up the Booster Display Pack for $144 at Amazon to really get you started with the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The booster display comes with 24 packs, with each booster packs setting you up with 12 cards, including six Common cards, three Uncommon cards, two cards of either Rare, Super Rare, or Legendary rarity, and one random foil card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a little bit of everything, I'd recommend checking out the Illumineer's Trove for $50, which comes with a card storage box, six card dividers, eight booster packs, six damage-counter dice, and a lore counter. Perfect for any newcomers to Lorcana, or as a tidy gift for any Disney fans in your life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is IGN's Senior Commerce Editor and resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I fully understand the legitimate concerns of our teams in France and around the world."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has been questioned over the future of his company — and his own position in it — as part of a wide-ranging interview that also confirmed multiple Far Cry titles are in the works. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Guillemot was quizzed on his plans for Ubisoft following its recent company restructure and ongoing job losses (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-insists-mia-splinter-cell-remake-still-in-development-despite-fresh-layoffs">with another 40 roles confirmed gone just overnight</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were questions, too, of his personal response to <a href="https://za.ign.com/assassins-creed-shadows/225554/news/union-says-1200-ubisoft-staff-went-on-strike-this-week-protesting-closures-cost-cutting-and-return-t" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent staff strikes that sparked fresh calls for his resignation</a>, and to the persistent grumbles surrounding the appointment of his son Charlie Guillemot as co-CEO of Vantage Studios, the company division now overseeing Ubisoft's most prized franchises, including Far Cry and Assassin's Creed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"On Far Cry, anticipation is high, and we currently have two very promising projects in development," Guillemot said, without providing further detail. The franchise's last title, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry 6</a>, launched in 2021. Previous reporting has suggested that the next entry will offer a more radical upgrade to the series' usual formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Assassin's Creed, Guillemot noted the company had "several titles" in development, comprised of both single-player and multiplayer experiences. Back in 2022, Ubisoft announced a raft of upcoming games including the now-launched Assassin's Creed Shadows, the witchcraft-inspired <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-hexe">Assassin's Creed: Hexe</a> (another single-player blockbuster) and Invictus (a multiplayer game). The company is also widely-expected to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ah-s-here-we-go-again-ubisoft-finally-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-leak-responds-with-gta-meme">announce its long-awaited Black Flag remake soon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ubisoft was created as a family company, and our strong heritage helps us take a long-term view, prioritizing sustainable growth, creative ambition, and continuity over short-term cycles," Guillemot said when asked about the accusations of nepotism that surrounded Vantage Studios' announcement.

Delivering at the level of quality and ambition our players expect requires strong alignment, speed of execution, and close collaboration. The decisions we are making are guided by that reality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My main focus areas now are our transformation," he concluded, "ensuring Ubisoft's long-term financial sustainability, and delivering games at the highest standard."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
