And there's one card that everyone seems to agree they hate, whether they're using it or facing an opponent with it: Misty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Misty is a Supporter card, essentially a type of card that can be played once per turn to give yourself an advantageous effect. Misty is explicitly designed for use in decks featuring water-type Pokemon, and comes with the following effect: "Choose one of your water-type Pokemon, and flip a coin until you get tails. For each hads, take a water-type Energy from your Energy Zone and attach it to that Pokemon." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon need energy to use attacks on opponents, but typically you can only attach one energy to one Pokemon per turn. So the idea behind Misty is to quickly power up a single water-type Pokemon so it can use an Energy-intensive attack right away, rather than having to wait two, three, four, or more turns to blast away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, Misty's efficacy depends entirely on coin flips, meaning she can either be completely useless (if you flip tails right away) or so overpowered as to be ridiculous (if you flip more heads than you need). So of course, people who are using Misty in their decks are complaining about constantly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1fu4o9f/misty_card/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flipping tails </a>right away, and people who are facing Misty are posting...well, this:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/screenshot-2024-11-06-130544-1730919966599.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: u/Money_Tap2401 on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gi1rlo/ok_misty/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gi1rlo/ok_misty/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The frustrations with Misty's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gc6uyu/misty_is_a_lie/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">luck-heavy</a> potential are resulting in a lot of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1fw52i6/is_misty_badly_designed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussions</a> as to whether or not the card design needs to be changed. Those discussions have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gkkisj/this_event_made_me_realize_why_people_hate_misty/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">only increased</a> with the release of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">special event in the game featuring water-type Pokemon</a>, where players can battle an AI using a deck containing Misty and a few Pokemon that can absolutely destroy an opponent on turn one with lucky coin flips.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Pokemon TCG Pocket subreddit, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1fwrylx/i_attempted_a_misty_rework_reupload_because_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">number</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1g3fqik/custom_misty_for_fun_can_we_add_custom_flair_or/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users</a> have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gipuom/misty_if_she_was_a_fair_card/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made suggestions</a> for how she can be improved, such as limiting the total number of coin flips or placing restrictions on how energy is distributed. The biggest issue players are citing apart from her luck-heavy mechanic is that if a Misty-user gets luck and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gi9jex/how_are_you_supposed_to_come_back_against_a_turn/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">draws her turn one</a>, they can then use her to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1fw3zl8/misty_lets_you_attack_t1_and_its_bs/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially attack their opponent on turn one</a>. Typically, players are not able to attack on the first turn due to the game prohibiting attaching an energy on turn one, a fairness mechanic intended to ensure going second isn't a massive disadvantage. But a lucky Misty draw, a lucky Misty flip, and an Articuno EX is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ghge71/articunomisty_is_probably_the_fastest_way_to_get/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recipe for disaster</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/screenshot-2024-11-06-131429-1730920486945.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: u/WTFPROM on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gk3by6/misty_is_a_real_sicko/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gk3by6/misty_is_a_real_sicko/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is so bad that some players are speculating her <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gjmbf8/guys_i_dont_think_misty_is_a_5050_for_the_first/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coin flips</a> are rigged or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gj1g9n/is_misty_bugged/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bugged</a> in some way.

This set Metal Gear Solid fans on the hunt for the true voice actress, with many suspecting Benson, given the similar sound to Ariel, but the mystery has now, finally, been solved.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The various projects that I am affiliated with in my career are sort of family-based, children-based.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Benson explained why there was so much secrecy around her work on the military stealth action game.
