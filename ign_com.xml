            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/all-pokemon-games-on-nintendo-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Often cited as the world's most valuable media franchises, Pokémon is a household name that's been a Nintendo staple since the Game Boy. The beloved series is home to hundreds of amazing creatures, with each new generation bringing loads more to discover. Every console released by Nintendo has had dozens of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order">Pokémon games released</a> for it, and the Nintendo Switch is no exception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we approach 2025, now is a great time to explore the Pokémon offerings on Switch and catch up before new games (and perhaps a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">new Nintendo console</a>) are released. Below, we've compiled every Pokémon game that has been released on Nintendo Switch, and will keep an eye on any <a href="#upcoming-titles" data-cy="styled-link">upcoming Pokémon titles</a> that may arise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Many Pokémon Games Are There on Nintendo Switch?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In total, <strong>12 Pokémon games have been released for the Nintendo Switch</strong>. This includes the mainline games for the 8th and 9th Pokémon generations as well as plenty of spinoffs. For the sake of this list, we've counted mainline entries with two versions as a single release. We also don't include the Pokémon games offered through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, but you can check out that list below.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What Pokemon Game Should You Get in 2024? </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're wondering which game is worth picking up on the Switch in 2024, my recommendation is Pokémon Legends: Arceus. It's not going to give you that OG Pokémon game feeling, but that's what the older generation games are for. Instead, Legends: Arceus introduces more action and RPG elements to the Pokémon series, offering the freshness of open areas to explore, more control over encounters, and plenty of polish for the handheld. </p><div catalogid="50afecce-e265-4f93-be54-71713034bf2d" id="165225"><div id="165225" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch Pokémon Legends: Arceus</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">All Pokémon Games on the Nintendo Switch (in Release Order)</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Pokkén Tournament DX (2017)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/21/pokken-tournament-dx-review">Pokkén Tournament</a> was originally released for the Wii U in 2016.
