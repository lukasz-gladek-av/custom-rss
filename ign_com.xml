            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, CA are just around the corner in August, and with it comes an exclusive line of cute Pokémon merch, which IGN has an exclusive first look at. Each year, the Pokémon World Championships hosts a special Pokémon Center pop-up shop, and we’re getting <em>three</em> uniquely themed exclusive lines out of the event this time. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-look-at-2024-pokemon-world-championships-merch"><u>Last year, we got a tropical, Hawaiian-themed Pokémon line</u></a>. Check out the unique new Pokémon items, including a first-ever Pokémon bodyboard, below. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In honor of this year’s Anaheim, CA location, Pokémon Center will be releasing three product lines – the Varsity Line, SoCal Beach Skater Line, and Rockabilly Line,” said Cindy Ruppenthal, senior director of Pokémon Center and e-commerce at The Pokémon Company International. “This year’s collection draws inspiration from bright, retro-diner design, blending vibrant colors and nostalgic elements that capture the spirit of our SoCal location.” </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">2025 Pokémon World Championships Exclusive Merch Reveal</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Check out a large selection of the exclusive merch that will be at the Pokémon World Championships in the slideshow above, but keep in mind, this won’t be everything! </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2025 Worlds Pikachu Plush sporting a varsity jacket, revealed at this year’s North America International Championships in New Orleans, is sure to be a popular item along with the other SoCal-themed plush of Fennekin, Machamp, and Jigglypuff, but there’s a lot more to look forward to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The standout premiere item this year is the SoCal Bodyboard, which is fully functional for riding waves at the beach, and is priced at $79.99 USD. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ruppenthal “expects strong demand” for the SoCal Bodyboard along with other functional items from the SoCal Beach Skater Line, like the SoCal Beach Towels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Additionally, following popular reception from Pokémon Worlds in Honolulu, we teamed up with Reyn Spooner to create a Pokémon Aloha shirt, bucket hat, tote, and more to celebrate the event in Anaheim,” Ruppenthal said. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pokemon-center-worlds-2025-3-1752721417421.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A sneak peak of this year's Reyn Spooner shirt, in the front and center. A different design than the 2024 Pokemon Aloha shirts in Honolulu last year. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Reyn Spooner Pokémon Aloha shirts from last year were so popular that I witnessed an attendee offer $300 for the shirt off someone’s back, literally, since they had sold out. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I witnessed an attendee offer $300 for the Pokémon Aloha shirt off someone's back last year</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“With this year’s California location, it felt like the perfect moment to reintroduce the</p><p data-cy="paragraph">apparel collaboration as our laid-back, SoCal designs align perfectly with Reyn Spooner’s bright, beach vibe and signature Aloha shirts,” Ruppenthal said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as other exclusive apparel goes, there <em>will</em> <strong>be a varsity jacket</strong>, “as well as other standout apparel that matches the various design styles offered this year,” Ruppenthal said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most surprising of the designs overall this year is probably the Rockabilly line, featuring Arcanine, Squakabilly, and an edgy Pikachu wearing a leather jacket and sunglasses. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pokemon-center-worlds-2025-rockabilly-1-1752721600256.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Some of the merch from the Rockabilly Line, coming to the Pokémon Center pop-up store at the 2025 Pokémon World Championships.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We always keep in mind that the Pokémon community has diverse interests and styles, and as such, wanted to introduce a bolder counterpart to the Varsity Line and SoCal Beach Skater Line,” Ruppenthal explained. “The Rockabilly Line features darker tones and edgier styling – all while staying true to the retro-diner theme found throughout the Pokémon Center Pop Up Shop. It complements the store design, which takes fans through a journey (beach to boardwalk to nighttime).” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The theming Ruppenthal describes is important, as the Pokémon Center Pop Up Shop at the Pokémon World Championships each year isn’t just a plain holding room for goods, but more of an immersive experience to explore while shopping, complete with set pieces and unique art. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>...this year, there will be a Pokémon Center special online-only shopping promotion taking place that same week.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Usually, all of the Worlds merch revealed here would be exclusive to the in-person Pokémon Center,  which actually runs an additional two days ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championship, from August 13 to August 17. However,  this year, there will be a Pokémon Center special online-only shopping promotion taking place that same week. During this time, the 2025 Pokémon World Championships Coin will be available online. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t know anything else about this online shopping event, like whether any other 2025 World Championship items will be available, but Ruppenthall said, “It’s our way of making sure more fans can take part in the celebration.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/map-of-worlds-2025-1752721631366.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A map of the Anaheim Worlds Event Hall, with a huge area in Hall D sectioned off for the Pokémon Center pop-up store. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are attending in person, keep in mind that you usually need to make a separate Pokémon Center pop-up store reservation, but right now, the <a href="https://worlds.pokemon.com/en-us/experience/pokemoncenter/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Anaheim 2025 Pokémon Center page</u></a> says, “More information on how to attend the Pokémon Center pop-up store is coming soon!” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll be sure to cover the Pokémon Center Pop Up Shop and a lot more during the 2025 Pokémon World Championships from August 15 to August 17 in Anaheim, so stay tuned for updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Casey DeFreitas is a deputy editor of guides at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Community-driven updates make this the most feature rich edition of Off The Grid yet</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Off The Grid</em>, the fast-paced, third-person cyberpunk battle royale from developer Gunzilla Games launches today on Steam, meaning more players can experience the game’s high-octane multiplayer combat and gritty near-future setting. Alongside its PC launch, the release delivers full cross-play support with Xbox, PlayStation and PC, so no player is left behind. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since its initial release, the free-to-play game has steadily built a strong following, thanks to its slick third-person combat, fast-paced gameplay, and a deep looting system. Frequent updates keep things fresh and bring players back for more. One of the game’s most unique features is the cyberlimb system; players can swap out limbs to gain special abilities, adding a layer of unpredictability and strategy to every match. These limbs can be looted, earned through trades, or taken from defeated enemies, offering plenty of ways to customize your loadout and playstyle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatively led by film director Neill Blomkamp, writer and director of films <em>District 9, Elysium </em>and <em>Chappie, Off The Grid </em>has become “one of the most dynamic and responsive battle royales on the market” according to Gunzilla Games’ Executive Producer David Nicholson. Recent updates have been made to the game in direct response to community feedback, and it is that “commitment to player-driven development” that will help <em>Off The Grid </em>continue to build momentum as it prepares to roll out even more content. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The launch of <em>Off The Grid </em>on PC opens the door to a larger and broader player base that can become part of the community and continue to improve the game through active engagement. Player feedback continues to be an integral part of <em>Off The Grid </em>with key features such as limbs, weapons and maps all receiving tweaks in response to community involvement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the game prepares for its next phase, new and active players can expect to see <em>Off The Grid’s </em>packed roadmap unfold over the course of the next few months, including new gameplay elements and community-driven experiences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Play <em>Off The Grid </em>on Steam by downloading <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3659280/Off_The_Grid" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">here</a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-preview-why-this-dual-expansion-is-epic</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-preview-%E2%80%94-why-this-dual-expansion-is-epic.1246131/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been opening packs from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a> for the past week, including a White Flare Elite Trainer Box, the Poster Collection, Black Bolt Binder Collection, the Victini Illustration Collection, and a White Flare Booster Bundle. Right away, these don’t feel like typical Scarlet and Violet products. This dual-set format means there are two completely separate card lists, with Black Bolt focusing on Zekrom, Kyurem, and Genesect, while White Flare leans into Reshiram, Samurott, and Keldeo. It’s a clean split that doesn’t feel like filler or overlap. It feels especially fresh considering we've had two sets of trainer Pokémon cards with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-preview">Destined Rivals</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also the final expansion in the Scarlet and Violet era, and I can tell the designers knew it. Pulling cards from both sets, there’s just a lot more to look at and sort through. You’ve got Poké Ball reverse holos, Master Ball reverse holos, Illustration Rares, Special Illustration Rares, and the new Black White Rare cards. Every single Unovan <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Pokémon</a> is included across the two sets, which was obvious the moment I started ripping packs, trying to keep track.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pxl-20250714-180207617-1752740669695.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-where-to-buy">Black White Rare cards</a> specifically caught my attention, although I didn't pull Reshiram, Zekrom or Victini. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-where-to-buy">Black Bolt</a>, Zekrom ex has a new monochrome foil treatment, and in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-members-early-access-preorder-pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-white-flare">White Flare</a>, Reshiram ex has the same look but in pure white. These aren’t just normal secret rares with a different background (although they look fantastic too), They look completely different from anything in their respective sets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing I appreciate about this setup is how each set feels like it has its own identity. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-july-14">Black Bolt</a> leans into electric types and edgy designs, while White Flare has a lot more reds and fiery aesthetics. Even the packaging, from the ETBs to the mini tins, reflects that. Sorting the cards felt like two separate collections that just happened to release on the same day.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pxl-20250714-180216169-1752740737783.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From a collector’s angle, there’s a lot going on here. I noticed pretty quickly that even commons have an Illustration Rare version somewhere in the set. For example, I pulled two different artwork versions of Patrat (one regular and one IR) and it wasn’t just alternate art slapped onto a foil. It felt intentional, with each version telling a different story. That kind of thing keeps me opening packs longer than I probably should.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also helps that I had pretty consistent pulls across all the products I opened. Between the Poster Collection, the Binder Collection, and the Booster Bundle, I pulled several ex cards, a couple of Illustration Rares, and one Master Ball reverse holo that honestly looks better than I expected. It feels like The Pokémon Company made a conscious effort to avoid the rough pull experiences some of the smaller sets had earlier this year.</p><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><p id="unboxing-and-impressions"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Unboxing and impressions">Unboxing and Impressions</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I got my hands on an awesome selection of Black Bolt and White Flare products: a White Flare Elite Trainer Box, Unova Poster Collection, Black Bolt Binder Collection, the Victini Illustration Collection, and a White Flare Booster Bundle.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon TCG: Black Bolt and White Flare - 1</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"> I don’t always open this many different product types when previewing a set, but with the way this dual release is structured, The Pokémon Company wanted to show this large duel-set off. Both sets have their own exclusive promos and packaging styles, which made the whole thing feel like more than just pulling from the same booster packs over and over.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">White Flare Elite Trainer Box</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-63-1752734995575.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I started with the White Flare ETB. Inside were the usual dice, sleeves, and nine booster packs. The promo is an epic Tornadus Illustration Rare. As for the pulls themselves, this ETB wasn’t the wildest I’ve opened, but I did manage to pull a Jellicent ex hyper rare, Whimsicott ex SIR, Accelfor IR, Keldeo ex, then a Mienfoo IR, Woobat Master Ball and Whimsicott ex in one pack! Epic result, but it’s ultimately potluck. Ripping packs of Black Bolt and White Flare open was certainly off to a cracking start.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Unova Poster Collection</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-64-1752735168896.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Unova Poster Collection felt more like a side product. It’s not packed with boosters (just four) but it does come with promos of the Unovan starter common cards from the set and a fold-out poster showing Unova Pokémon featured in both sets on one side, then box art for Black Bolt and White Flare on the other. So there’s two Black Bolt and two White Flare boosters in the Poster Collection. I pulled a Jellicent ex, Venipede IR and a Kyurem ex, which isn’t bad at all for four pack openings.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Bolt Binder Collection</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-65-1752735287443.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Binder Collection includes five boosters plus a nine-pocket binder themed around either Black Bolt or White Flare, depending on which version you buy. I got the Black Bolt version and pulled a Drilbur IR, so not a great experience with Black Bolt from the binder collection but the extras will come in handy. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Victini Illustration Collection</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-66-1752735430293.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of everything I opened, the Victini Illustration Collection was probably the most surprising. It comes with a Victini promo IR, a giant card of the same and a common Victini Pokéball, plus two Black Bolt and two White Flare. I managed to pull another Keldeo ex, Excadrill ex and a Amoonguss Masterball. The Victini promo’s are worth it on it’s own, but I got some half-decent pulls as well. Fantastic!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">White Flare Booster Bundle</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-67-1752735567011.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, I went through a White Flare Booster Bundle. Six packs, no extra promos or sleeves. This one was all about straight pulls, of which I got one Whimsicott ex, a Patrat IR (my favorite pull of this preview) and Hilda Trainer Full Art in one pack, another Woobat Master Ball. The demi god pack energy in Black Bolt and White Flare is real, and it’s so cool to open one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I really like Black Bolt and White Flare, with me leaning towards White Flare due to my personal luck with the set. If you’re not pulling IRs and Exs, you’re pulling Pokeball and Masterball rares. I think the ball rares are the new holo and reverse holos for Pokémon TCG, which is a win for everyone in my opinion.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Bolt / White Flare: Top Card Pulls</h3><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon TCG: Black Bolt and White Flare - 2</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't argue with the amount of pulls from this preview. Out of 27 booster packs I managed to pull four ex's, three Master Ball rares, five Illustration Rares, one Hyper Rare and one Secret Illustration Rare. That's an overall pull rate of over 50%, which isn't bad at all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have to consider this isn't a normal set thanks to the amount of Illustration rares and ball rares floating around, but it's an absolute blast to open. Although it's nice to see Pokéball and Master Ball rares coming back to English sets after Prismatic Evolutions, it feels like filling up an already packed set. It would be great to see how many epic pulls trainers could get without the inclusion of Pokéball and Masterball rares.</p><p id="my-favorite-pulls"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="My favorite pulls">My Favorite Black Bolt / White Flare Pulls</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Whimsicott ex Secret Art Rare</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/16/pixel-9-61-1752686302152.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was lucky enough to pull a Secret Art Rare version of Whimsicott ex, and as usual the artwork is fantastic. Full art cards have a special way of making you love Pokémon you either forgot existed or thought were a bit naff. Whimsicott is one of them and I couldn't be happier with this pull.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Patrat Illustration Rare</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/16/pixel-9-62-1752686685896.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I love these bold Illustration Rares that again make a big fuss about overlooked Pokémon. Patrat is a Pokémon that went straight out of my party as soon as I could catch something to take that sixth spot on my team, yet this is my favorite pull from this preview. Go figure.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Meinfoo Illustration Rare</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-68-1752735782131.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bringing that Charmander, Charmeleon and Charizard ex 151 vibe, Mienfoo Illustration Rare is a cracking snapshot of a wild Pokémon. We're at that point in Pokémon TCG where these cards are works of art. The pose, backdrop and overall artstyle pops out of the card and I'm here for it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hilda Supporter Full Art</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-69-1752736115458.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Supporter Full Arts rarely get much love and often plummit in value unless your a Kanto or Johto mainstay. Personally I love them, and the artwork with Hildas Supporter Full Art is just cool to look at. She's slightly popping into the borders and the subtle movements suggested in the artwork just make it interesting to look at.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Victini Illustration Rare Promo</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/pixel-9-70-1752736289302.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Christian Wait / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes I know it's a guaranteed promo, but I couldn't leave out Victini Illustration Rare. It takes me right back to the launch of Black and White working at Gamestation in the UK (which was owned by Game at the time). We had an event cartridge in an old DS that allowed customers to unlock the Victini event and play through Black and White with this absolute gem of a Mythical Pokémon. Owning Pokémon cards with great memories like this attached to it like this is one of the many reasons why I'm into the TCG, and this artwork is gorgeous. 100% a big preview highlight for me.</p><p id="should-you-buy-these-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Should you buy these cards?">Should You Buy Pokémon TCG: Black Bolt White Flare?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven't secured preorders for Black Bolt and White Flare sealed products, feel free to try your luck at launch at your local brick and mortar or online. Alternatively, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8lMP?object_uuid=fef23af1-ba18-495d-8c2e-dde794c8b1a7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCG Player</a> pricing for presale sealed product is crashing, so I reckon we're seeing the usual price crash post-launch coming earlier.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What do I think of the set? I think it's great and possibly the best opportunity to pull Illustration Rares in the Scarlet and Violet era, it's ending on a high note. Personally I'm not a fan of stuffing the set with Pokéball and Masterball rares, but in terms of quality and presentation they look cool. It would be grand to see Mega Evolution double down on the dual format and loads of Illustration Rares, but this is an encouraging sneek peek into what's next for Pokémon TCG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
