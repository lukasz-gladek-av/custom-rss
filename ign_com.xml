            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The newest PlayStation hardware is acoustic.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The PlayStation store is selling guitars now. If you're a fan of Naughty Dog's Last of Us series, either the games or the TV show, you can now preorder a replica of Ellie's guitar that Joel customized with the custom moth inlay fretboard. This guitar was first featured in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us Part II</a> and made an appearance in the second season of the HBO series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The guitar is a collaboration with Taylor Guitars and is a special edition of the Taylor 314ce. You can preorder it for $2,999.99 at the PlayStation Store and it will officially release on November 18, 2025. It's listed in the PlayStation store's hardware section among various consoles, controllers, and other accessories.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Taylor 314ce The Last of Us Part II Replica Guitar</h2><div catalogid="09a8041f-5e7d-4130-8508-ecf1bff3e86c" id="227110"><div id="227110" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Taylor 314ce The Last of Us Part II Replica Guitar</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The PlayStaton Store bundle includes a strap and replica case.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The guitar has distinctive rich tobacco sunburst top in Sitka spruce pulled straight from the game and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-spoiler-free">latest season of the TV show</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you think that $3,000 is a ridiculous amount of money to pay for a guitar, it's actually not <em>that</em> terribly priced, especially for a nice acoustic guitar. The standard Taylor 314ce costs around $2,499 on its own without the Last of Us details included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that Taylor is selling a <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjp1Ee?object_uuid=94cc8cdf-4912-495a-b122-00a9bf6fb1f1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">slightly cheaper version of this replica</a> directly from its website. It's a Taylor 314c (rather than a 314ce) and it's priced at $2,799 without the bundled accessories.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What's next for The Last of Us?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This replica guitar is the latest piece of merch inspired by the popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-naughty-dog-games-in-order">Naughty Dog game</a> and likely won't be the last. But what about new games and episodes of the show? Game-wise, The Last of Us Part 3 has yet to be officially confirmed and it seems unlikely that it ever will be. Creator Neil Druckman has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">during an interview</a> to not "bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the TV series, HBO CEO Casey Bloys <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-planned-for-2027-and-could-be-the-series-end-hbo-boss-says">confirmed</a> that Season 3 of the show is definitely planned to arrive in 2027. He also said that this season will potentially be the last run of episodes.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 19, 2025 10:30 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-opens-preorders-for-a-replica-of-the-guitar-from-the-last-of-us-part-ii]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live broadcast has given us a fresh look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> protagonist Grace Ashcroft, but no sign of fan-favorite Leon S. Kennedy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As expected, today's show brought with it a deeper dive into Capcom's hotly-anticipated upcoming survival horror (which is also playable here at Gamescom). Footage once again showed the game's new star Grace Ashcroft in action, though fans were left wondering about Leon's whereabouts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a phone call from unknown voice, Grace Ashcroft and her mom Alyssa attempt to escape from the hotel in which they had been staying, as the power is cut and the pair are attacked. We already know what happens next, as Grace is seen investigating the hotel years later, as an FBI analyst.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom previously promised that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">Requiem will feature a return to the series' "overarching narrative"</a> begun 30 years ago, after more recent games such as Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village focused on events set elsewhere, with fewer connections to past titles. Already, fans had noted the return of Raccoon City and references to the shadowy Umbrella Corporation, while hoping for more, including a first sighting of Leon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We always thought about making Leon the protagonist," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi previously said</a>, "but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn't jump at a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he's actually quite a bad match for horror."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fans took this comment to mean that Leon was still in the game somewhere, likely in sequences that offered more action-orientated gameplay, as while stating the character wouldn't be suitable for horror sections, Nakanishi notably stopped short of ruling the character out altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty of time still until Resident Evil Requiem eventually launches, on February 27, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
