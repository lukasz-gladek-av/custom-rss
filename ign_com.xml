Black Dragon is Mortal Kombat’s mercenary clan headed up at various points (the timeline is pretty complicated!) by fan-favorites Kabal and Kano. The lore justification here is Ghostface has been transported to Lui Kang's timeline without his partners from the movies, so recruits two members of the Black Dragon clan to help him out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, Ghostface is actually three characters in one. You can switch to temporarily playing as The Enforcer or The Assassin by holding a button during certain moves. You can tell them apart by their knives, if you look closely. You get 12 seconds to play as an alternative Ghostface before you revert back to the OG, or your opponent lands a hit and triggers the OG to come running back in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have analyzed The Enforcer and The Assassin’s unique movesets for hints at the Black Dragon characters’ true identities. Already, there are two outstanding suggestions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for the identity of Ghostface in Mortal Kombat 1 follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat fans have identified moves that are directly related to Kobra (Enforcer) and Kira (Assassin), two human Black Dragon members who each made their debut in 2004’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-deception">Mortal Kombat: Deception</a>. We also see Assassin do Kano’s famous roll attack, but Kira does this move as well in both Deception and 2006’s Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. As you can see from the movesets, this one looks nailed on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to this revelation has been positive, not only because it’s a clever way of bringing back two rather obscure Mortal Kombat characters that perhaps would never have seen the light of day otherwise, but also because it leaves the door open for other, perhaps more wanted characters to appear as Kameos or even fleshed out DLC characters with a potential, but so far unannounced Kombat Pack 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Ghostface, the OG version is voiced by Roger L. Jackson, who has voiced the character throughout the Scream franchise. Ghostface joins the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on November 19 as part of the early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners, followed by wide availability for purchase on November 26. Up next is Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 Terminator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

It’s a message that thanks fans for trying out Pokémon TCG Pocket since its launch a few weeks ago, and more importantly, it tells players what they can expect if they stick around. Update plans not only include new cards but even new, mysterious features that have yet to be announced.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone! Today, I'd like to share a brief statement by the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonTCGPocket?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PokemonTCGPocket</a> Team about more immediate updates coming to the game in the next few months.</p><p>I look forward to sharing more details with everyone as they become available! <a href="https://t.co/eaN35vRpSw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/eaN35vRpSw</a></p></div>— Pokémon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1856819952713453683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket will receive at least one “major update” in the near future, with the team saying that the plans is to release new booster packs before the end of the year. Those who have picked up the Pokémon mobile game so far have been treated to three packs – Genetic Apex Mewtwo, Charizard, and Pikachu – with three pools of cards to choose from. It’s unclear exactly how many more packs will release in the next few months or which creatures they will feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How and when the card roster will grow remains a mystery, but one feature that has been on everyone’s minds is currently slated to arrive early next year: trading. The ability to trade cards with other players is a Social Hub menu option that’s been grayed out since launch, and in January, Pokémon TCG Pocket will finally make it available to use. It’s worth noting that today’s message clarifies that only “certain cards” will be available to trade at release, with the team promising to “expand the selection of cards that are able to be traded” over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the message keeps more than a few details hidden, rest assured that more features will come to Pokémon TCG Pocket down the line. “Also, we have other new features in development outside of the trade feature introduced here,” the message says. “We plan to announce more details about the update as the dates for the addition of these features are finalized, so please look forward to it.”</p><div id="best-pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Pokemon TCG Pocket Cards Tier List</h3><h3>Best Pokemon TCG Pocket Cards Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This mobile version of everyone’s favorite pocket monster trading card game has taken the world by storm since it launched late last month.
