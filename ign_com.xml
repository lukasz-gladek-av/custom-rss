            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While it wasn't ready for a gameplay demo at Evo, the new Virtua Fighter project was still one of the most exciting games of the show, thanks to a brand new trailer released during Finals day that gave us our best look yet at what Sega and RGG have cooking for this revival of a series that has been dormant for more than two decades at this point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the show, I got a chance to sit down with Riichiro Yamada, producer on the New Virtua Fighter project, to dig into some of his previous statements about the game, ask about how he plans to modernize the series to compete with other more, current 3D fighters, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">[<em>Editor's Note: This interview has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The concept gameplay that we've seen for the new Virtua Fighter project has been very fluid with guards going for each individual attack, the arms moving to block each individual attack. How close to this do you expect the final game to look? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Riichiro Yamada, Producer on New Virtua Fighter Project: </strong>In terms of how it looks, yes, [the battle system is] 70% there, and tomorrow there will be an announcement made at EVO [Editor’s Note: This interview was recorded the day before the trailer release]. So I really feel that I’ll be able to showcase what the current situation is. And from a vision perspective, I really have a very strong vision and really feel that we are getting very close to that vision.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So fighting games are in a very different place than they were when Virtua Fighter V was released. What are some of the ways that you're ensuring that the new Virtua Fighter project will modernize the series?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>Virtua Fighter originally was a very simple game. It only has three buttons and everyone could basically touch and play it, but as the series went on, it became very complicated. And in terms of that and in terms of the progression, I feel that Virtua Fighter 5 is the complete version. In terms of a new Virtua Fighter, we need to keep progressing even more, not just in the gameplay but function as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I really feel that I need to look towards how do we progress this game, how do we improve this game, in terms of functionability, gameplay and how do we make it more modernized? Otherwise, I really feel like it won't sell. So those are the places that I’m really looking into. Not only gameplay, but functionality as well. We need to modernize those parts.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I really feel that modernization is very vital in order to sell.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>In a previous video, you said that the two words that come to mind when asked what is Virtua Fighter were innovation and reality. Can you explain a little bit more about what that means and how those words have guided you through production on this new game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>So in terms of innovation, I really won't be able to specify in details, but it used to be graphics at the very beginning, and then computer graphics like CG has been improving. But with CG, it's really up there right now. It's really difficult to improve the current CG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CG is already innovated, it's really up there. So in terms of innovation, I really feel that bringing up more ideas is very important when it comes to that term. And then as for reality, I feel like reality is a very difficult word, but Virtua Fighter, it's not a very UFC-like battle. It's more of like a kung-fu movie battle. It's more of that type.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And when I played Virtua Fighter at the very beginning, I felt like the reality of being hit, when you're being hit by an opponent, you felt that hurt in your arms or your legs, your body. So that sensation, I really felt that. So with the new project, not just the battles but reality, I really want that reality to be felt within the players, not only the battles but the other places as well, which I feel is very important. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So with this new Virtua Fighter project, do you envision this as a new beginning for the franchise? Not just for the franchise but for the characters? Like Akira obviously looks a lot different than what we're used to. He is not in his traditional gi, his hair is not styled up, he's wearing a hat. Are these the same characters from the previous games or is this kind of just a new reboot of Virtua Fighter?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>So in terms of characters, I really feel that new characters are necessary, and as you said, Akira looks different. So in this one, Akira is a little bit older than the previous series. So in terms of that, I feel that a new generation of characters is needed and [I’m not] saying that the character designs in the previous VF is not very good. That's not true.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We need to make the character designs look better, to look cool.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't want to say that the VF characters previously, that the character designs were a little bit weak. I’m not trying to say that. I feel that they were stylish, but we do need to evolve these characters, we need to make the character designs look better, to look cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not saying that they were bad before, but I just need to make them cooler. So that's why when I think about new characters, I said reality is one of the statements that I’m really focusing on. That too, when I create new character designs, I have to bring this reality to it and to make it a more good-looking character. So yes, using the same characters, but evolving it from the past, putting more elements to it, putting more design characters to it, making it more real is my stance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Speaking of characters, in a previous Virtua Fighter direct, you revealed Stella, a character that bears a striking resemblance to Sarah Bryant. Is there anything you can tell us about this character? And on the screen the text says that she's the bridge between worlds. Can you elaborate a little bit about what that means?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>Unfortunately, I won't be able to answer your question on that, sorry. But please be excited. Please look forward to that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You touched upon this earlier, Virtua Fighter traditionally is a three-button game — punch, kick and guard — but it derives a lot of depth from that very simple control scheme. Do you feel like the three-button control style for Virtua Fighter is core to the series, or is that an area where you see an opportunity to evolve the franchise by either adding another button or just changing the way the typical Virtua Fighter core gameplay works?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>So originally when Yu Suzuki created the Virtua fighter, he did a lot of testing. He actually tested with more than three buttons, like a lot of buttons. But they came to the three button conclusion. At the time it was more of a Game Center (Arcade) focused game, so that was the best at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the concept was that they wanted to create a game that was not too complicated and that anyone could enjoy. And so from that concept, I feel like, yes, I need to respect that concept. I want to create a game where anyone can play.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want to create a game where anyone can play.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But currently, or moving forward, it's not just a Game Center game, it's more of a household game. So when you think about how people could enjoy playing this game in their living room or in their house, that's when it kind of changes a little. So yes, the concept does stay the same, But… I’m not really focused on, oh, we need to keep it to three buttons. The more important thing is I want to create a game where anyone can play in their household when it comes to the new style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>For all the years that Virtua Fighter has been around, Akira has been the face of the franchise and he's also the character that you revealed the new Virtua Fighter project with, but we don't really get to see his face all that much. Do you feel like Akira is still the kind of face of this series or is it a new generation? Is there going to be a new person that's going to take that mantle of being the face of the franchise?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yamada: </strong>So when it comes to the protagonist, I really feel that users will still buy a game because of the protagonist. For example, for Street Fighter, it's Luke, there's probably a reason why it's still Luke. For Ryu-Ga-Gotoku (The Yakuza series), it used to be Kiryu, but it's changing. They did bring a new protagonist, Kasuga. Originally, RGG fans love Kiryu.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So I think there were challenges in bringing a new protagonist, a new character, Kasuga, into the series. Ideally, I would like to bring out more characters, but it feels like users really like Akira. History has proven or is proving that there is a lot of love for Akira.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, I would like to bring out new characters, but I really feel that the protagonist, because Akira has been a strong face, the users will still look forward to or see or would like to buy the game because it's Akira. So I feel that changing characters or bringing new characters is not a very easy thing to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Pick it up in under an hour at Best Buy.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 console only has two high-profile original games that you can get right now: Mario Kart World Tour and Donkey Kong Bananza. Although both are great games, Donkey Kong Bananza has staunchly entrenched itself as one of the best games of the year and an absolute must-buy game for any Switch 2 owner.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Bananza is the Only 10/10 Masterpiece of 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only did we rate Donkey Kong a 10/10, it's the <em>only</em> game we've given a Masterpiece rating so far this year. Granted there isn't too much competition in the way of Switch exclusive games for 2025, this has been a fantastic year so far for console gaming in general. We've seen some of the best games released in recent history, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/17/kingdom-come-deliverance-review">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Death Stranding 2</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, all of which got close to a Masterpiece rating but didn't quite hit the mark. That's not to say that Donkey Kong Bananza is necessarily better than those other games since, after all, different people have reviewed each of these games, but it's a testament to just how outstanding Donkey Kong Bananza is on its own merits to have achieved that score.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Pick it up in under an hour at Best Buy</h3><div catalogid="7e14ca20-d3b4-46c3-be95-0d920f6e2169" id="226427"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've read the reviews and are itching to pick up a copy to play immediately, the surest best is ordering online and picking it up in-store at a nearby retailer like Best Buy, Target, or Walmart. Best Buy, for example, offers pickup in as little as one hour. I find it more convenient to order online ahead of time and then picking it up in-store because you're pretty much guaranteed that it will be in stock, and you don't have to wander around the store looking for a copy. If you're looking for a discount, don't hold your breath. I haven't seen any deals this game, and to be honest, I don't expect any before Black Friday. That's not to say you can't find ways to incentivize your purchase. Best Buy, for example, gives you rewards points for every purchase if you sign up for its free membership, and Best Buy cardholders get 5% cashback, similar to Target's Circle card or Amazon's Prime card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still on the fence over getting the Switch 2 console? Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2 review</a>, in which Tom Mark aptly describes the new console as "a vital but unexciting upgrade to a console I already love."</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 5, 2025 8:05 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-is-the-only-ign-masterpiece-in-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Finish 'em. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Humble Bundle has announced its Humble Choice lineup for August. For just $14.99, you’ll get access to a solid selection of games, including one of my personal favorites, Persona 5 Royal. For reference, P5R’s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1687950/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest recorded price on Steam</a> is $23.99, making just that game alone a crazy steal. Even better, you get seven more games (and the feeling of giving back) out of it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Humble Choice August 2025 Game Lineup </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Each month, Humble Choice curates a selection of games for members to redeem. These games are sent as Steam codes, which you can keep forever, making Humble Choice one of our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-subscription-services">favorite gaming subscriptions</a>. Here's what Humble Choice members are getting in August: </p><div catalogid="f5ee5aee-bdfd-43a2-b5bb-4f4dbc146197" id="226429"><div id="226429" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Humble Choice August 2025</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Eight games, discounts on the Humble Bundle store, and one month of IGN Plus.</p></div></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Persona 5 Royal </li><li>Banishers: Ghost of New Eden</li><li>My Time at Sandrock 	</li><li>Let’s School </li><li>Lil Gator Game</li><li>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip </li><li>Wildmender  </li><li>Warpips</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">As noted, the highlight this month is certainly Persona 5 Royal. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-royal-review"><u>IGN’s 10/10 review</u></a>, Leana Hafer goes so far as to say, “Persona 5 was already a strong front-runner for being the best JRPG ever made, and Royal really gets me wondering what else could even compete.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The social links in Persona 5 Royal are a big standout for me, even compared to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">rest of the Persona franchise</a>. Every “Palace” (basically a dungeon) feels like a full season of an anime, with solid character development, laughs, and yes, plenty of emotional moments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you recently played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2024">IGN’s 2024 Game of the Year</a>, Metaphor: Refantazio, this is a great chance to check out Atlus’ hallmark series with plenty of the same mechanics. Otherwise, I highly recommend this entry point to anyone who’s considered getting into the modern generation of turn-based JRPGs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">August’s Humble Choice bundle also includes a solid selection of more casual games, including the co-op gardening survival game, Wildmender, and the cozy farming sim My Life at Sandrock, which, like many cozy games, is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/bomoore/lists/games-like-stardew-valley">a lot like Stardew Valley</a>. You’ll also pick up Banishers: Ghost of New Eden, an action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review"><u>IGN’s review</u></a> describes as having “a solid concept and a stellar paranormal investigation system.” Again, all of this for just $14.99. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>5% of Humble Choice Proceeds Go to Charity </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Every month, 5% of the proceeds from Humble Choice members go to a charity chosen by Humble itself. This month, those proceeds are going to <a href="https://donorschoose.org/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DonorsChoose.org</u></a>, an organization that helps teachers and educators get access to the resources they need in the classroom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You spend a lot of time in P5R studying for exams (I promise it’s fun), so this bundle makes sense to me. Charity Navigator and GuideStar have also awarded DonorsChoose, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, their highest ratings for transparency and accountability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Humble Bundle is part of IGN Entertainment, the division of Ziff Davis that includes GamesIndustry.biz, IGN, and MapGenie.</em>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Aggro Crab, the developer of Another Crab's Treasure and the recently-released co-op survival climbing game Peak, took aim at a Roblox clone version of the latter in a Twitter/X post today, in which the studio said it would rather people pirate Peak than play "this microtransaction-riddled Roblox slop ripoff".</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">tbh would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Roblox</a> slop ripoff <a href="https://t.co/ulRShLLGz2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ulRShLLGz2</a></p>— AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post in question</a> shows screenshots of a Roblox game called "Cliff", which does look suspiciously similar to Aggro Crab's Peak. Both games feature a round-headed protagonist whose goal is to climb a mountain at the center of an island, an activity that can be accomplished either alone or with friends. Cliff even calls out in its description that it's inspired by Peak!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though, "inspired" might be a bit generous. Take a look at the two game descriptions side-by-side. Here's Peak:</p><blockquote>PEAK is a co-op climbing game where the slightest mistake can spell your doom. Either solo or as a group of lost nature scouts, your only hope of rescue from a mysterious island is to scale the mountain at its center. Do you have what it takes to reach the PEAK?<p>WORK TOGETHER</p></blockquote><blockquote>Need a Hand? You’ll need to rely on your friends to have any hope of scaling the mountain, which changes every single day. Help each other up ledges, or place ropes and climbing spikes to make the way easier for those who come after.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">And this is Cliff:</p><blockquote>⛰️CLIFF is a challenging climbing game where even the smallest mistake can be your downfall. Trapped on a mysterious island, your only way to escape is to reach the top of the towering cliff. Do you have the skill and courage to make it to the summit?</blockquote><blockquote>✋WORK TOGETHER</blockquote><blockquote>Need some help? You’ll have to rely on your friends if you want any chance of reaching the top. The mountain is tough, so help each other up ledges and watch out for dangers to make the climb easier for those who come after you.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Woof, that's...the same? It's essentially just the same description copied wholesale with some swapped synonyms. And a comparison of the Badges for Cliff and the Steam Achievements for Peak reveals that Cliff also named its "Shore" and "Tropics" biomes directly after Peak's locations of the same names.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest material difference between the two games, apart from things like quality and scope, is that Cliff has microtransactions. You can buy certain items using Robux including a Climbing Pickaxe, a Parrot Friend, and a Starterpack. Peak doesn't have any such thing. It's $8 for the game itself, and that's it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is unfortunately a common phenomenon on Roblox. Plug the name of just about any game, AAA or indie, into Roblox's search feature and you'll find countless clones. On just a quick search I was able to find microtransaction-filled variations on Pokemon, Mario, Sonic, Undertale, Untitled Goose Game, Five Nights at Freddy's (woof, there are LOADS of those), Fortnite, Elden Ring, Stardew Valley, Celeste...I could go on. Some of these games are marketed as homages or fangames, but many just straight-up use stolen assets from the games they're based on, and others are pretty blatant clones trying to disguise themselves by changing some proper nouns around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Roblox's historical <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-makes-big-changes-to-parental-controls-amid-pedophile-hellscape-report">whack-a-mole approach to moderation</a> it's hard to say whether or not Aggro Crab's callout will have any effect on Cliff. But at least the studio has made its wishes known. Probably, the solution is just to buy Peak. But if you're so desperate you're going to play Cliff instead, the developers would prefer you engage in some piracy instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
