Yeah, okay, we've known that for a bit now, perhaps longer than Capcom wanted us too. But what <em>is</em> news today is that the long-rumored Leon S. Kennedy amiibo is real, and coming alongside the previously announced Grace Ashcroft amiibo this summer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This was announced during today's Nintendo Partner Direct, which showed a trailer for Reqiuem mostly containing footage and news we've seen already. We knew about the February 27 release date, the Gold Editions of Resident Evils 7 and 8 releasing alongside it, and the special Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. We'd also already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-gets-behind-nintendo-switch-2-with-resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-pro-controller-the-first-ever-resident-evil-amiibo-and-a-re7-re8-re-requiem-generation-pack">heard about the Grace Ashcroft amiibo before</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-2-5-2026-53-3-screenshot-1770301943694.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">But we didn't <em>actually</em> know about Leon. He was, uh, strongly suspected, even before we officially knew he was going to be in the game, something Capcom tried to keep hidden <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-finally-confirms-leon-s-kennedy-is-in-resident-evil-requiem-the-game-awards-2025-ign">way longer than was necessary</a>. Since his official reveal at The Game Awards, we've seen a sudden surge of love for the classic protagonist, with fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leon-kennedys-new-look-for-resident-evil-requiem-makes-him-a-hot-uncle-heartthrob-among-japanese-fans">referring to him as a "Hot Uncle"</a> and comparing him to Keanu Reaves.

Most recently, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-on-switch-2-is-horrifyingly-great">previewed it on the Nintendo Switch 2 at a Nintendo event</a>, and our previewer said that "I was so terrified by being relentlessly stalked by this monster that any concerns I had about the version I was playing instantly melted away." We also recently learned that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-director-gives-definitive-response-to-open-world-speculation">speculation the game would be open world</a> was "dead wrong" according to the game's direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at today's Nintendo Partner Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-everything-announced-updating-live">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

We also learned via the Xbox Store that the game will hit Xbox consoles simultaneously.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have known <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/entire-final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-square-enix-developer-reveals">the entire FF7R saga</a> would be on Nintendo platforms at some point. It was just a matter of time. Rebirth's appearance will effectively catch players on Nintendo platforms up with the story so far, just in time for what we hope will be the announcement and release of the third and final part of this saga.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pre-orders for Rebirth on the eshop begin today, and there are various digital bonuses available for those who take advantage of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7 Remake first launched in 2020 to insanely high expectations...and yet delivered anyway. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review">gave it an 8/10</a>, saying that it "breathes exciting new life into a classic while standing as a great RPG all its own." The game was originally a PS4 exclusive, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-announced-ps5-upgrade-details-revealed">came to PS5 with Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Intergrade</a>, and later to PC and Nintendo Switch, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-review-update">Nintendo Switch 2 as well just recently</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We similarly loved Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">giving it a 9/10</a> and saying it "impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion, both as a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenges and an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at today's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-everything-announced-updating-live">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/planet-of-lana-2-is-like-a-star-wars-story-made-by-studio-ghibli</link>
            <guid>1426807</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I may have only played the opening couple of hours of Planet of Lana 2, but I lost count of the number of ways it reminded me of Star Wars. From just a single glance at one of its many gorgeous landscapes, you can see in the geography and architecture what look like Studio Ghibli interpretations of Ralph McQuarrie’s original sketches for Lucasfilm’s immortal sci-fi series. Peek within that frame and you’ll see rickety sci-fi vehicles and clunking robots that wouldn’t be out of place on the streets of Mos Eisley. Lend your ear to that scene, and the whirring sounds of those same droids and digitised radio chatter of enemy guards could easily be coming from R2-D2 and Stormtroopers, respectively. All of these aspects add up to something that is far more than referential, though, instead shaping a confident, expansive puzzle platformer sequel of its own original design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the first things that hits you when booting up Planet of Lana 2 is the music. Again, the soaring of its strings and the twinkle of its brass conjure up strong images of a galaxy far, far away. But, this time, it shouldn’t come as a surprise — the sequel's score is once again composed by Star Wars: The Clone Wars orchestrator, Takeshi Furukawa. Incidentally, he’s also behind the music of The Last Guardian, a game that greatly inspired Wishfully, the small Swedish developer behind Planet of Lana 2. It carries on that same “child on a dangerous, yet wondrous adventure with a fantasy animal companion” legacy, this time with a darker tone as shades of Limbo and Inside come to the fore.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2.5D stealth-puzzle-platforming takes place on a bigger canvas compared to its 2023 predecessor. Two years after the events of that game, protagonist Lana has settled back into family life on the planet of Novo, though clearly mystery and intrigue still remain, both on its surface and bubbling below it. After a short tutorial section investigating the corpse of the hulking spaceship that brought her people to this new land, Lana’s sister is taken ill, and you’re promptly sent on a mission to hunt down rare ingredients for a remedy. This journey takes Lana to new regions of the world, which gives Wishfully’s art team new scope to stretch their creative muscles, but also presents welcome new ideas when it comes to puzzle design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A now older, more confident Lana is more agile than before, able to slide under low-hanging metal for quick escapes and even dive into the ocean to solve whatever conundrums its depths are hiding. Lighter on her feet this time around, she’s practically a backflip and a handstand away from moving more like a Lara than a Lana. Whether clambering through caverns or broaching darkened mine shafts, platforming is more about patience and precision than speed and reflexes. The sequel’s expanded vision also extends to the framing of its puzzles, with larger areas demanding further exploration of the scene – you must look for helpful items in areas high above and further off-screen than you might expect.</p><p>There’s a great sense of tactility to every heavy lever pull, as heavy machinery and hulking robots lurch and creak.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, many of the challenges I faced through this two-hour demonstration were largely the sort of combat-avoidant stealth sequences that reward patience – as in, you must remain motionless while waiting for obstacles to morph into the required shape, or for enemies to turn the other way, creating a safe passage through. I would never say this becomes tedious, but for those who prefer a bit more zip and thrust to their action, here's a heads up that I wouldn’t necessarily expect that here. To those who didn’t play the original Planet of Lana, it’s much closer to a Little Nightmares than it is to a Metroid in its level design and enemy encounters. But similar to Samus’ space adventures, there’s a great sense of tactility to every heavy lever pull, as heavy machinery and hulking robots lurch and creak inside a mountain facility, dwarfing Lana and her even smaller, spherical companion, Mui. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This little ball of charm provides a furry edge to many of Planet of Lana 2's puzzles, with their newly increased ability set adding welcome extra variety to the mix alongside their existing skillset. I particularly enjoyed further explorations of  Mui’s somewhat telepathic ability to control creatures around the world of Novo. For example, fish can be sent to zip around and deploy clouds of ink that masks the vision of larger-finned foes, and sticky balls of blob can create trails of sludge that transform into paths of fire to remove flammable obstructions. These fuse-like puzzles, which task you with examining the level geography as you trace its edges to reach your goal, were some of my favourites in this preview demo.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Planet of Lana 2 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although I’ve only seen around a third of the game, even at this early stage, I am wary that some mechanics are already on the edge of being used one too many times, threatening to turn some brainteasers into busywork. But, largely on the whole, the puzzles have proven fun and fair, compelling me to pause and think, but never to the detriment of the momentum of the story. It fits the urgency of the tale being told, with many mysteries lurking in the background. It's this intrigue that drove me through these early hours on the path to discovery, as well as the distinct sense of adventure as you hop around this thoroughly alien planet, painted with beautiful art and soundtracked by a sensational score.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Star Wars does with its flashy lightsaber duels and thrilling space battles, Planet of Lana never forgets to put character front and centre, even in its puzzles. Reassuring nods and moments of murmur in an alien tongue help solidify the bond between Lana and her furry friend, all while keeping the story of their adventure foremost in mind. And, just like The Empire Strikes Back, Planet of Lana 2 teases in these early hours that it’s certainly not afraid to enter darker territory on a grander scale, whilst leaving plenty of time for those smaller moments. It’s all very promising, and a reassuring sign that the heart of its short and sweet predecessor is being carried over into this expanded, more ambitious sequel on March 5th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

Expect modern gameplay systems, expanded roleplaying opportunities, and “the mechanical depth and tone that defined classic Fallout,” the modders said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Fallout: The New West is a fan-made total conversion mod for Fallout: New Vegas. In many ways, it tells the same broad story envisioned by Fallout: Van Buren, but restructured and expanded to form a cohesive, playable experience. The project’s primary narrative goal is to take the disparate plot threads and unfinished concepts found in the original design documents, including for example, the NCR–Brotherhood conflict, the Great Tribal War between Caesar’s Legion and the Daughters of Hecate, the fight for the soul of the Mormon State and much more, and weave them into a satisfying, unified narrative that adheres to the main plot as described in the design documents.</blockquote><blockquote>Players assume the role of a new protagonist, released from captivity in 2253, known as “the Prisoner,” and the story is set in an alternate continuity that predates and reinterprets the events of Fallout: New Vegas. Unfortunately due to many Van Buren concepts being folded into FNV, we cannot set the project in the same timeline. Our secondary goal is to incorporate many of the modern gameplay conveniences introduced through Fallout: New Vegas and its more than 15 years of modding, while preserving the distinctive mechanics and design quirks of classic Fallout found in the original design documents. Much of Fallout’s original charm is an acquired taste, and one that we believe remains worth acquiring.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Fallout Stories For the Amazon Show</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds exciting, and given the success of Fallout: London, which had Bethesda’s blessing, it may even have a chance of survival. Indeed, a new demo is apparently due out soon (an initial demo, which released under the name Fallout Revelation Blues, came out last year). This alternate start demo under the new name of Fallout: The New West will be followed up with the entirety of Act 1 of the game as a vertical slice, the modders said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Fallout: The New West does make it to release, it will see Van Buren realized — albeit in fan-made form — 20 years after it fell by the wayside. In 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-creator-tim-cain-reveals-involvement-in-cancelation-of-original-fallout-3">Fallout creator Tim Cain revealed new information on how it ended up canceled amid significant financial problems at Interplay</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cain, who worked on the first two, much-loved Fallout games in the mid-to late 90s before leaving Interplay to start a new studio called Troika Games, revealed that in the middle of 2003, an unnamed Interplay vice president asked him to play the Van Buren prototype, saying: “I don’t think they can get it done, so I’m just going to cancel it. But if you look over it and give me an estimate there’s a chance I wouldn’t cancel it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cain said he played the prototype for two hours and asked the development team a number of questions before delivering his verdict to the vice president. “I said, ‘I’m convinced in 18 months you could have a really good game shipped.’ And he said, ‘huh, could it be done any faster?’ And I was like, 'oh, shoot, I’ve said too long.' I said, ‘well, even if you did a death march crunch I don’t think you could do it faster than 12, and then you’d be shipping something that was unbalanced and buggy, and the team would be destroyed. So I don’t recommend that.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And he said, ‘OK, thanks.’ As we walked out he basically explained any answer over six months was going to result in him having to cancel it, meaning the answer I just gave got the game canceled. But he was going to cancel it anyway. He thought it couldn’t be done in six months, and I just confirmed that to him.”</p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Cain, the cancellation of Van Buren was, ultimately, about money; Interplay’s dire financial situation meant it simply did not have enough cash to fund more than six months of further development. Interplay went on to close Black Isle Studios and cut its entire staff. The company released the console spinoff Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel in 2004 for the Xbox and PlayStation 2, but it was not enough. That same year, Interplay announced a licensing deal with The Elder Scrolls developer Bethesda for future Fallout games, and in 2007, Interplay sold the Fallout IP to Bethesda outright. The rest is history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you’re wondering about the Fallout TV show’s journey to Colorado, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-the-wasteland-where-you-always-get-sidetracked-by-bullst-every-goddamn-time-fallout-showrunner-teases-non-linear-journey-to-new-season-3-location">check out what co-showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet and even Todd Howard himself have had to say about it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
