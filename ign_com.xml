Yakuza 0 had Out Run and Space Harrier, Yakuza Kiwami 2 had Virtua Fighter 2, Yakuza 6 had Fantasy Zone, and so on.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">‚Äî „Çª„Ç¨ÂÖ¨Âºè„Ç¢„Ç´„Ç¶„É≥„Éàü¶î (@SEGA_OFFICIAL) <a href="https://twitter.com/SEGA_OFFICIAL/status/1867147746702180584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Bringing over The Ocean Hunter, a 1998 on-rails shooter about killing giant sea beasties like great white sharks, was a "very difficult task that required the cooperation of many people," however, according to an <a href="https://x.com/YutakaIto_RGG/status/1867432429960802593/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> post from RGG Studio technical director Yutaka Ito.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned, The Ocean Hunter has never been ported to console, so RGG Studio had to do everything from the ground up. This included visiting actual arcades to understand exactly how it worked, since the game doesn't exist in any other, more accessible, capacity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ito said the development team had been talking about bringing The Ocean Hunter over for a year ahead of actually beginning work, because it's lack of license-related complications made it an ideal choice and it also very much fits the theme of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date-brought-forward-a-week-to-avoid-monster-hunter-wilds-clash">which arrives February 21</a>, is a spin-off sequel to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, the eighth mainline entry in the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review">or ninth including Yakuza 0</a>). <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/majima-focused-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced-at-rgg-summit-as-next-yakuza-game">It follows Majima</a> as he wakes up with amnesia and becomes a pirate, exploring the likes of Hawaii along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A trailer released at the October Xbox Partner Showcase revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-is-eating-assassins-creeds-lunch-in-new-trailer">a proper first look at ship combat akin to Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> and the return of the beloved character Taiga Saejima, perhaps teasing more ties to the main series than previously thought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will also be a decent bit longer than previous Yakuza spin-off Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-is-a-decent-bit-longer-than-previous-spin-off-like-a-dragon-gaiden">its story taking around 15 to 18 hours to complete</a>.

Oh, and all these items are only available for five days before they‚Äôre rotated out of the store.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs worth putting these prices into context. 1,000 SC costs $9.99 / ¬£7.99 in the in-game store. One of Helldivers 2‚Äôs premium Warbonds costs 1,000 Super Credits, which means that if you want all the Killzone items, you‚Äôre looking at just shy of twice the price of a premium Warbond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, there will be Helldivers 2 players who have Super Credits saved up after nearly a year of playing the game, and it‚Äôs worth noting that you can unlock 300 Super Credits in Warbonds with your medals, or find them out and about by looting in gameplay. But the fact remains that these items are also being sold for real-world money, and the pricing is unlike anything fans have seen so far in Helldivers 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Killzone assault rifle has sparked renewed pay-to-win accusations from some in the game‚Äôs community, despite it being considered a bit of a downgrade compared to already available guns. The Helldivers subreddit is already littered with complaints, many of which point out that Helldivers 2 is not a free game and so should take a different approach to monetization.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/hd-1734537347269.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Some Helldivers 2 players say the Killzone items are too expensive. Image credit: SIE.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgywpl/the_new_superstore_update_is_bad/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Straight-Break-4169 said</a>: ‚ÄúNo set should cost over 1,000 SC. Even if we forget the armor set, a new AR?? They seriously add a new gun and lock it behind a 600 Super Credit paywall!?‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚Äú615 SC for a primary weapon is straight up ridiculous,‚Äù <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyz51/615_sc_for_a_primary_weapon_is_straight_up/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added Goopmaster_</a>. ‚ÄúI get the game needs to be monetized in some way, I get that the devs‚Äô work isn‚Äôt free, but charging half a Warbond price for an assault rifle with no optic is straight up nonsense.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI knew it was a slippery slope, but didn't think we'd reach that part of the slope already,‚Äù <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyj28/comment/m2n69yx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SovietMarma commented</a>. ‚ÄúI've willingly paid for 1,000 SC packs for each and every Warbond release so I could support the game and buy the Super Store armors that came with them. Don't think I'll be doing the same here.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Arrowhead said the Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 belongs to a new tier of ‚Äúspecial‚Äù premium content reserved for collaborations and other ‚Äúuniquely-themed work.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur plan is to offer you something distinct and special,‚Äù the developer added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024">Helldivers 2‚Äôs recent Illuminate update</a> breathed new life into the game, sparking a resurgence in players and enthusiasm around the addition of a new faction to fight against. But as has been the case multiple times during the game‚Äôs rollercoaster first year of live service, it‚Äôs a case of one step forward, two steps back for community sentiment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, as you'd expect, fans are taking to Steam user reviews to express their dissatisfaction over the Killzone prices. "The Superstore items are straight scams," one negative review reads. "Such a shame after such a great update."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
