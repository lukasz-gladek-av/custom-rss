            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/open-world-action-rpg-the-seven-deadly-sins-origin-unveils-two-new-trailers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A new look at the combat, characters, and world of Britannia.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Open-world action RPG The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin recently dropped new trailers at Summer Game Fest and the Future Games Show, showcasing the world and characters developer Netmarble has been cooking up. They also announced that pre-registration has opened for all regions as momentum builds to its release window later this year.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/10/250529-sdo-press-en-1749585781087.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is being made by the same team that created 2019’s The Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross and tells an original story set in Brittania, the same world as The Seven Deadly Sins anime and manga series. That series has sold 55 million copies and Grand Cross reached 70 million downloads globally, so it’s fair to say there’s a huge fanbase that’s been anticipating the latest installment. It stars Tristan, son of series main characters Meliodas and Elizabeth, in a multiverse narrative that dives into parallel timelines and alternate character arcs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all begins with the Book of Stars, a pendant that lay dormant in a cave beneath a lake. It has the power to record and connect timelines, and it chooses Tristan to be its next guardian. That moment sets Tristan on his course to explore the world and save it from turmoil and chaos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new trailers provide a glimpse into the game’s central narrative, a deeper look at its expansive world, and show off the eye-catching art style that emulates the anime, powered by Unreal Engine. The first trailer, revealed on Friday during Summer Game Fest, begins with Tristan’s discovery of the Book of Stars. It seemingly sets off an explosion of power before settling into a celestial orb in the middle of the pendant.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We then see some of the game’s large and varied environments, including open fields, canyons, lakeside docks, a desert oasis, and an underwater area. You can fly or go diving to fully explore some of these regions, and you can take part in other activities as you explore, like fishing and cooking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We get a look at the flashy and fast-paced real-time combat system, showing several different characters and their abilities. At one point, two characters attack at the same time, hinting at the ability to strategically combine characters’ unique skills and weapons to create combos. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a variety of enemies featured, including spiders, golems, aggressive plants, and a horned monster that falls out of a flaming hole in the sky. And that’s on top of two hulking monstrosities that tower above the trees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second trailer, shown during the Future Games Show on Saturday, expands on the showdown with one of those monstrosities. We see that it’s not just a cutscene, it’s an actual boss fight where the controllable character has to dodge fireballs before climbing up the body of the massive creature.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That trailer also expanded on the environments, showing a deep forest, a cavern beneath the sand, the inside of a town, and a rain-drenched grassland. You can also see Tristan magically moving blocks into empty holes in a door or wall, possibly indicating that there will be environmental puzzles you need to solve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two trailers combined to give us our deepest dive into The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin yet, and they clearly have fans excited, since they gathered more than a million views on YouTube in just two days. Origin will be available on PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile, with crossplay available across all platforms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/one-elden-ring-nightreign-player-shows-the-power-of-the-humble-wraith-calling-bell-by-clearing-the-final-boss<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Do not ask for whom the bell tolls.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware games have a history of "unconventional" weapons and attire. In fact, compared to players with a jar on their head or the bubble-sprayer, a Wraith Calling Bell is not too strange. It's fascinating, though, to watch one player clear the big bad of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> with the bell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">YouTuber Syrobe posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXxRPBNAC6s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solo Recluse run yesterday</a> where, throughout the outing, they took down Nightreign's final Nightlord Heolstor using just the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Wraith+Calling+Bell" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wraith Calling Bell</a>. It's a great run to watch, and also highlights some interesting tech being discovered in Elden Ring Nightreign right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through the whole run, you can see Syrobe ringing and flinging the little ghosts from the bell at their foes. Now, the Wraith Calling Bell is not an imposing weapon; it's a little bell that the player rings, and then a small wraith floats out and damages the enemy. By itself, it might already seem like an uphill battle to clear bosses with this instead of some of Elden Ring's more tried-and-true armaments.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of this victory emerged from patience, skill, and really good play from Syrobe. There are some aspects that have helped, though. Namely, the technique Syrobe shows off at the beginning of the video, allowing players to be more mobile while casting spells, or in this case, ringing bells. It's a pretty handy bit of tech for the magic casters out there that I recommend writing down and trying out later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, Syrobe locks in and focuses on building a run that can enhance all the necessary aspects for winning. Generating solid FP recovery, picking up some solid upgrades and items, and putting together a route for solo success. Yes, keep in mind, this is a solo victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fascinating thing is, Syrobe is not the only one putting up great clears and exploring the power of the Wraith-Calling Bell.

But what we didn't see in that trailer is a new(ish) feature coming to Resident Evil: Requiem: we'll be able to play the game in either first- or third-person.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We saw this feature in action oh-so-briefly during a behind-closed-doors presentation at Play Days over the weekend. While the vast majority of the gameplay we saw was in first-person, at the very end, we saw a pause menu open with the option to toggle between the two.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a big deal for the series, which has had games in both first- and third-person before (as well as third-person fixed camera), but has only allowed players to choose which option they preferred once, as a part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-village-third-person-mode-dlc">the DLC for Resident Evil: Village</a>. This should also soothe some who criticized the switch to first-person perspective that took place with Resident Evil 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the gameplay we saw at the showcase was very, very familiar Resident Evil. We got to watch the new protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, pick up where the reveal trailer left off — strapped to a gurney in an old, decrepit hospital. We watched her escape and slowly explore the abandoned building, finding Resident Evil staple items like a lighter, a screwdriver, and a fuse that helped her progress, and eventually running into a few messed-up looking creatures that chased her around as she tried to escape.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil: Requiem - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What we <em>didn't</em> see was any sign of Leon S.
