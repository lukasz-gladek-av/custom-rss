            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot (an Amazon-owned retailer) has refreshed its 'Video Game Mega Sale!', and there are some real gems included in it right now. Among the variety of gaming deals is <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YRXWo?object_uuid=d344bc17-464c-4a53-8c9b-7b41875a14b0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silent Hill f for PS5</a>, which is marked down to $44.99 on the sale page. However, Woot's offering the chance to save even <em>more </em>on this game right now by using the code 'GAMER' at checkout. This knocks that price down even lower to $35.99 (not including tax).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This saves you an extra 20% on top of the discount that's already there. Considering it's usually priced at $69.99, you're saving 49% overall with this deal, which is an excellent offer to jump on. The sale page states that this bonus 20% off deal only runs through Sunday, February 1, though, so time is ticking to take advantage of it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save on Silent Hill f for PS5 at Woot</h2><div id="234921"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234921" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Silent Hill f - Amazon Exclusive Day One Edition</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're in the mood for a horror game, Silent Hill f can deliver, offering up a "fresh new Japanese setting to explore, a fascinatingly dark story to unravel, and plenty of twisted freaks to torment you with." Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-review">review</a> from IGN's Tristan Ogilvie continued on to say, "some spectacular art design, imaginative puzzles, and a compelling lead character means this latest mainline entry in Konami’s seminal survival horror series definitely earns a grade higher than a Silent Hill F; it’s probably closer to a Silent Hill B-."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Silent Hill f, there are plenty of great game deals to explore right now in Woot's 'Video Game Mega Sale!'. In particular, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/woot-has-a-video-game-mega-sale-now-live-featuring-several-excellent-nintendo-switch-games">ton of Nintendo Switch game deals</a> have caught our eye, which is good news for those with the handheld. The sale itself runs until February 6, so there's still about a week to go to scoop up the offers that get your attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/get-silent-hill-f-on-ps5-for-36-during-woots-video-game-mega-sale]]></content:encoded>
