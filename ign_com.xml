            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday deals</a> get messy fast, especially in the games world. Retailers love to hurl half-baked offers around in the run-up to what I like to call "Black Friday proper," the day after Thanksgiving. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are some genuinely good deals already available, it can still get a little tricky to work out what is actually worth your time, especially if you're on a limited budget.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's where I'm here to help. Sure, there are plenty of strong 2025 releases on offer, with big <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-best-games-already-on-sale-black-friday-2025">PS5</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Nintendo Switch</a> titles in the mix, but the real gold right now is the slew of games sitting at 20 dollars or less at retailers like Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That slice of the sale is stacked with some genuine heavy hitters from across the current generation's almost five-year life cycle. If you want actual bargains, this is the bin worth digging through.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Elden Ring</h2><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231670"><div id="231670" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Horizon Forbidden West</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, slightly overshadowed by Elden Ring (sorry, Guerilla Games). <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-review">Horizon Forbidden West</a> is another <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/79775" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100-hour plus game</a> that is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-is-down-to-its-lowest-ever-price-at-amazon-ahead-of-black-friday">absolute bargain for $19.99 on PS5</a>. Yes, it's also on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/playstation-plus-premium-tier-games">PlayStation Plus</a> if you're signed up. But do you remember the feeling of owning games? Like actual physical copies? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My advice? Pick this up for 20 bucks, and never have to worry about your PS Plus sub lapsing if you want to replay it, or perhaps spend more than a month getting through it (which is likely, this one is <em>big). </em>If you can stretch to $30, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8dO3?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">complete edition is also on sale</a>, and includes the games entire DLC collection as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Star Wars Outlaws</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231671"><div id="231671" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, here's one that might take a little more convicing. But, trust me, even a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">7/10 game</a> can be worth $20. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's another fairly sizable entry into this list as well, and I truely think there's a lot of fun to be had with Outlaws. Sure, it's got a bad rep, but for 20 big ones, you're actually getting <em>so </em>much genuinely great Star Wars content, it's no joke.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If anything, I really think it's worth a go for anyone who was ever on the fence about buying it. Dropping this down to just $20 for both PS5 and Xbox is a great deal, and it's also <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxx28O?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$39.99 for the complete Gold Edition on Switch 2</a> right now as well (but again I'm breaking the rules by mentioning that, woops).</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Resident Evil 2 + 3 + 7</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231672"><div id="231672" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Resident Evil 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey, look at me, cheating at my own game again. Yeah it's supposed to just be 10 games in this list, but I'm having some fun with it, sue me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's our first picks that are hitting the "or less" part of the article, and no $19.99 doesn't count, that's just $20, so don't start on me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Three brilliant Resident Evil games for just $14.99 each, now that's hard to argue with. In my opinion, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/22/resident-evil-2-review">Resident Evil 2's remake on PS5</a> is the best of the bunch, but there's still <em>a lot </em>of<em> </em>fun to be had with the RE3 remake, and Resi 7 as well. </p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrAeN?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 2<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$14.99</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2Bpx?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 3<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$14.90</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QdpWqv?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Resident Evil 7: Gold Edition<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$14.99</span></li></ul></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Armored Core 6</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231675"><div id="231675" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay here's where I've got to start admitting when I haven't played some games.

It’s let down by a dull story, but lands direct hits where it counts."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade + Final Fantasy 16</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231676"><div id="231676" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh no, I haven't played these either.

What, am I just gonna dedicate three slots of Resident Evil, and two more to Final Fantasy, that's half the article? ... and I haven't even played these two either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, look, look, put the pitch forks away. I've never <em>been</em> a Final Fantasy kind of guy, and that's okay, I can still trust in the many, many friends and collegues who tell me these games rock. For $20 each for FF7 and FF16, I definitely think it's worth it, even for how little I know.</p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/akwdeg?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy 16<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$19.93</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8D24?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$19.99</span></li></ul></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Red Dead Redemption 2 for $14.99</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231678"><div id="231678" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Red Dead Redemption 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey, I've played this one! It's great, we all love Red Dead Redemption 2, even if it is still stuck at 30fps. Another banger from Rockstar, and another game you can drop over <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/27100" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100 hours in</a>, no questions asked. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for another brilliant game to sink your teeth into while we wait for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> (which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">just got delayed again</a>, ouch), then this is a pretty solid pick for just $15. It's discounted at GameStop for a physical copy, or both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">PlayStation</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Xbox</a> have it for the same price digitally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I loved my time with it, and was even considering a cheeky replay over the holidays as well. IGN's Luke Reilly also awarded it a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review">10 in his review from 2018</a>... seven years ago!

At $20, that sounds pretty great to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, not every game in this article has to be certified 10/10 banger like RDR2 or Elden Ring, sometimes it's also nice to spend a reasonable low amount of money on games that are just plain, simple, fun. And Mortal Kombat 1 is exactly that: fun!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Shin Megami Tensei V</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231681"><div id="231681" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Shin Megami Tensei V</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I really should've put more games in that I've actually played. What is that, like four now? Yeesh, that's kinda rough. Okay, so at least ign.com's 7/10 review team can back me up again with this one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leana Hafer reviewed this one, and awarded it a very respectable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-v-review">8 in her review back in 2022</a>, stating: "Shin Megami Tensei V's excellent JRPG combat and deeply rewarding customization shine bright, even when it sometimes feels like Persona without the heart."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sounds pretty good to me, maybe I should actually start checking out some more JRPGs. In any case, this is down to just <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXVGmy?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$17.99 at Amazon</a> for PS5, Xbox, and Switch, and that's a certifiably great deal.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tekken 8</h2></div><div catalogid="452db8bd-573d-426b-8e06-6f815c16a3c5" id="231680"><div id="231680" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tekken 8</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Final game that's worth picking up for $20 or less! It's Tekken 8! No, I haven't played this one, either! Yes, I've heard it's very, very good! Listen, I spend way too much time just playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a> on my Steam Deck, and maybe I should find more time to play fighting games. Okay look, I promise I'll buy it and give it a go over Christmas. Happy?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ronny Barrier reviewed this one for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-review">IGN, awarding it a fantastic 9/10</a>, and stated: "Tekken 8 is an incredible evolution for the series, with tons of single player content, an excellent suite of training tools, a great online experience, and exciting new mechanics that make Tekken more dynamic than ever."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Honorable Mentions</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Some quick honorable mentions for under $20 bangers before I start badgering on about some more spenny games: <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrZGe?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LEGO 2K Drive is just $15</a>, and so is <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6DpO7?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4pMl?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mario + Rabbids Dual Pack for Switch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, anyway, like I said near the start of the article, there's actually <em>loads </em>more great games in the sales, and plenty I couldn't include (even with me already breaking the rules a few times). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're budget is more in the $30-$40 range, then I can recommend plenty of other top titles, like one of my favorites of the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-dropped-to-its-lowest-price-yet-at-amazon-for-black-friday">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 for $30</a>, or 2024's Game of the Year winner, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-is-one-of-the-best-ps5-games-and-its-33-cheaper-at-amazon-for-black-friday">Astro Bot, for $39.99</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my other top picks from 2024 is also just $25 in the sales, for both PS5 and Switch 2, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRMAlO?object_uuid=a0a45f2a-4de0-4081-9dc7-f44c0bece284&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a>. This is well worth it simply for the new Shadow levels alone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, some of the best Nintendo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-best-games-already-on-sale-black-friday-2025">Switch games are also down to just $30</a> right now as well, such as the all time great, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-odyssey-black-friday-deal-2025">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's all she wrote! Well, apart from this bit. And then this bit as well... and the rest of everything I'm going to write now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Good job getting to the end of this article and my non-sensicle ramblings about 13 cheap games I may or may not have played (also in an article that's meant to be limited to just 10). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right, that's me actually done now, if you pick up anything good over Black Friday, or just want to tell me how much of a fool I am, let me know in the comments ASAP.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">That's an insane price drop.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo thankfully isn't dropping <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/Amiibo_Unlockables,_Rewards,_and_Functionality">amiibo support for Switch 2</a>, and right now that matters because some of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp48gw?object_uuid=16df76a2-6333-46d8-b01c-17eaeaa1545c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">best Zelda figures have quietly crashed to just $9.99</a> ahead of Black Friday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sidon, Riju, Tulin, and Yunobo are all heavily discounted as the Nintendo Black Friday sale kicks off today, and honestly, deals this aggressive usually disappear fast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-sale-2025-early-deals">Amazon</a> has dropped Riju and Sidon to $9.99, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-2025-black-friday-sale-is-now-live-updated">Best Buy</a> has matched that price on <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5Xeq8?object_uuid=16df76a2-6333-46d8-b01c-17eaeaa1545c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tulin and Yunobo</a>. Street Fighter amiibo are also discounted for Black Friday, sitting at <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5Xeq8?object_uuid=16df76a2-6333-46d8-b01c-17eaeaa1545c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$14.99 at Best Buy</a>, if that's also of interest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of these was supposedly only meant to get a $10 cut for Black Friday, so either the retailers blinked or someone mispriced them. Either way, grab all of these before the correction hits, because this will not last. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each figure launched at $29.99, so seeing them down to $9.99 means you're saving 66% and shaving $20 off every amiibo. That's even stronger than the midyear sale, when they bottomed out between $14.99 and $19.99 at Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you're wondering what they actually do in-game, all four of the Zelda figures unlock content in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. All of which will be compatible with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/ACNH_3.0_Update_and_Switch_2_Edition:_All_Details_and_Everything_New">Animal Crossing 3.0 update</a> in January 2026, as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the Zelda figures, tap any of them via NFC while playing Tears of the Kingdom and you'll get exclusive paraglider fabric options, extra materials, and a weapon or rare item. Being part of the Zelda line also means they can unlock bonuses elsewhere. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening includes amiibo-exclusive Chamber Dungeons, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe gives you a new Mii racing suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on Switch 2 with the upgrade pack, you're getting a much smoother ride. The update bumps up frame rate and resolution, cleaning up the original's only real flaw, its performance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update">Tom Marks put it in his review update</a>, ”This [Switch 2 upgrade] really does feel like the way this game was always meant to be played, and I’m thrilled by the idea of a new generation discovering it for the first time.” Hard to disagree.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Switch 2 Black Friday Deals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.
