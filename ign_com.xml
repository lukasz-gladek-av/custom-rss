Gameplay for this Futurama mod also feels familiar, as you run around as Fry and complete missions for characters such as Bender, Professor Farnsworth and Dr. Zoidberg. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="fr" dir="ltr">ANNONCE ðŸ“£ ðŸŽ® : La dÃ©mo de Futurama Hit &amp; Run, sera disponible le 19 octobre ! Une idÃ©e juste parfaite ! ðŸš€ <a href="https://t.co/cy8WBhoLYL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/cy8WBhoLYL</a></p>â€” Mooonaa ðŸ’• (@lycheemoona) <a href="https://twitter.com/lycheemoona/status/1979533450718716390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">There's driving too, of course â€” with Fry able to zoom around a section of New New York in a hover car. One particular mission has Fry escorting Bender back to the Planet Express headquarters while avoiding police in hover cop cars. But there's no sign yet of actual flying â€” perhaps in future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, the demo includes four story missions, plus a set of street races, vehicles, costumes and other Easter eggs to find and unlock. The demo also comes with an acknowledgement that it currently uses AI-generated dialogue as a "temporary placeholder." The mod team states: "Professional voice artists are already engaged, and their recordings will replace the placeholder content in a future update."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 25 Futurama Episodes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Response to the demo has been positive, not least from Joe McGinn, who worked on the original The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run over two decades ago. "As the lead designer of the original game, I can only say... this looks awesome!" McGinn wrote in a comment on the mod's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKPz3PE7_4s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a>. "I want to play it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/matt-selman-simpsons-hit-and-run-remake">Fans have long hoped for another Simpsons game</a>, and previously cheered on a separate unofficial Hit &amp; Run project that looked set to remake the entire title in Unreal Engine 5. Alas, that idea ran into legal issues with Disney, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/awesome-looking-the-simpsons-hit-and-run-fan-remake-is-complete-but-it-will-never-be-released">its creator has now said the finished version will never be released</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there may well be something new and official for The Simpsons fans to play in the not-too-distant future, as the franchise's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-simpsons-long-rumored-fortnite-mini-season-now-feels-imminent-as-kang-and-kodos-turn-up-in-game">long-awaited Fortnite mini-season now finally appears to be near</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's your weekly PokÃ©mon TCG pricewatch and stock update, and it's an absolute banger. Amazon seem to be listening to me and the rest of community calling out their ridiculously high pricing on PokÃ©mon TCG right now, but probably not. Regardless, we're seeing their <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmOn4J?object_uuid=b99a287a-b3bf-40e4-8981-877bb1c3845b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">exclusive Blaziken ex and Volcanion ex Premium Collection in stock for MSRP</a>. That's right, no price hikes and no where near it's market value that's north of $90. Could this mean something positive for the future of PokÃ©mon TCG at Amazon? </p><p id="tldr-deals-for-today"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TL;DR: Deals for Today">TL;DR: Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunatley that's where the hope ends for big box retailers. TCGplayer is cheaper on every in-stock PokÃ©mon sealed product on Amazon right now. There's usually one or two, but it's looking grim for them. For you it's great, as you're getting the proper market value from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8JZm?object_uuid=b99a287a-b3bf-40e4-8981-877bb1c3845b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundles ($59.96)</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/98P5Xq?object_uuid=b99a287a-b3bf-40e4-8981-877bb1c3845b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Surprise Boxes ($43).</a> </p><p id="blaziken-ex-volcanion-ex-premium-c"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Blaziken ex &amp; Volcanion ex Premium C">Blaziken ex &amp; Volcanion ex Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="688f638e-8444-4126-a204-e1320f401009" id="229712"><div id="229712" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blaziken ex &amp; Volcanion ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Trainers and collectors will get five Destined Rivals Boosters and five Journey Together Boosters in this bad boy, so that's about the right kind of ball park for ten booster packs, plus you're getting the promo Volcanion ex and Blaziken ex promo card and a jumbo version of Blaziken ex. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think these promo's would work great together in a fire-themed deck. Use Blazikens Seething Spirit to grab fire energy from your discard pile to build up Volcanion. In the meantime Volcanion can burn opposing PokÃ©mon then use Scorching Cyclone for 160 damage then transfer all it's energy to a benched PokÃ©mon. So many possibilities here.</p></div><p id="pok-tcg-mega-evolution-in-stock"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="PokÃ© TCG: Mega Evolution In Stock">PokÃ© Price Check: Mega Evolution In Stock</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Evolution seems to be a well-printed start to the next era of PokÃ©mon TCG. I'm seeing boosters in convienience stores and some products on physical shelves, not to mention the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLM8mm?object_uuid=b99a287a-b3bf-40e4-8981-877bb1c3845b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Bundle ($52.89)</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxADp?object_uuid=b99a287a-b3bf-40e4-8981-877bb1c3845b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gardevoir ETB ($88.81)</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxA8p?object_uuid=b99a287a-b3bf-40e4-8981-877bb1c3845b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Three Booster Blister ($28.90)</a> available on Amazon. Like the rest of the products in this carousel though, the cheapest is TCGplayer right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
