            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Two actors from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> revealed today that they have been appointed ambassadors of the real life location in Japan that inspired the survival horror game’s eerie setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Takeshi Masago, who plays Kanta Shimizu, the father of main character Hinako, and Tamami Hiraoka, who plays her mother, posted a <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/fZn1IovXDYw?si=wHM01TAG7vfEWbIz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube short </u></a>cryptically entitled ‘Important Announcement’ on February 2, 2026. The video begins like a solemn apology or serious announcement, with the two actors suddenly jumping for joy at the end of the video, while holding their tourism ambassador certificates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The actors have both been made tourism ambassadors for Gero City in Japan's Gifu Prefecture. Gero City, specifically the Kanayama-cho area with its quiet, narrow alleyways and old houses, served as inspiration for Silent Hill f's fictional Ebisugaoka, a rural Japanese village in the 1960s. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Hinako's father in the game is abusive, the actors who play her parents started uploading wholesome videos on YouTube last month of themselves going on "husband and wife dates." The actors are not married in real life, but these videos have got some fans wishing they were. The solemn tone of the ‘important announcement’ video caught many viewers off guard, as did the ‘jump scare’ with the certificates. "I thought you were going to say 'we're getting married for real’ lol," said one commenter about the tourism ambassador announcement video, with others echoing the same sentiment: “When they revealed the documents, I seriously thought for a moment that they were marriage certificates.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of efforts to promote what Gero City has to offer, Masago recently visited the 300-year-old <a href="https://okuhida-sake.jp/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Okuhida Shuzo</u></a> rice wine brewery in the area, as <a href="https://x.com/okuhidashuzo/status/2017953960754286795?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted on X</u></a>. Last month, the brewery released <a href="https://x.com/okuhidashuzo/status/2013838908874723566?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Silent Hill f themed</u></a> sake and chocolates, the first batch of which quickly sold out.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— 奥飛騨酒造 (@okuhidashuzo) <a href="https://twitter.com/okuhidashuzo/status/2017953960754286795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Since Silent Hill f was released, many of the Japanese actors involved in the production have livestreamed all or parts of the game, while sharing behind-the-scenes stories about what filming was like. This kicked off when Hinako’s actress Konatsu Kato <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hinako-is-konatsu-kato/streams" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>began livestreaming</u></a> her playthrough of Silent Hill f back in October 2025, amassing over 5 million views. Shortly after, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@n_moon_a" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Yuuka Iijima</u></a> (who plays Rinko Nishida) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@natsuki_osaki" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Natsuki Osaki</u></a> (who plays Shu Iwai) also set up YouTube Channels and did their own livestreams of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Takeshi Masago and Tamami Hiraoka are the first game-related tourism ambassadors for Gero City, this is not the first time that video games have been used to attract visitors to lesser-known parts of Japan. Back in 2020, the Tsushima Tourist Board <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tsushima-tourist-board-partners-with-ghost-of-tsushima"><u>partnered with Sucker Punch’s hit PlayStation game Ghost of Tsushima</u></a> to promote the real life Japanese island. Not long after, fans banded together to raise funds to repair one of the island’s shrine gates, which was destroyed by a typhoon. The following year, Ghost of Tsushima lead developers Nate Fox and Jason Connell were <a href="https://sea.ign.com/ghost-of-tsushima-ps4/169560/news/ghost-of-tsushima-lead-devs-named-ambassadors-of-actual-island" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>made permanent tourism ambassadors</u></a> to the island, for spreading its history to the world in "such a wonderful way," according to Tsushima mayor Hiroki Hitakatsu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Makes it look like we were trying to hide it."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer of a game censored due to Nintendo's content guidelines has apologized to fans and said it that its own disclaimer on the changes should have been more visible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-is-censored-on-nintendo-switch-due-to-platform-content-criteria-developer-says">fans were shocked to discover that hit superhero game Dispatch had been censored on Nintendo Switch</a> — where enormous black boxes cover nudity and even a character raising their middle finger. While an option to hide these already existed on other platforms, on Switch it is enforced by default, and cannot be toggled off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, after a backlash largely aimed at Nintendo, and questions around why the game has been censored when others (such as The Witcher 3) have not, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a> maker AdHoc Studio has released a lengthy statement addressing the situation, apologizing for its own part in it, and promising it was working on changes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"As Nintendo states, any game that's going to be on the Nintendo platform needs to 'meet [Nintendo's] established content and platform guidelines'," AdHoc wrote, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-responds-to-switch-game-censorship-that-left-dispatchs-nudity-permanently-covered-with-black-boxes">referring to Nintendo's own statement on the matter last week</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is the key point. Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn't meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform. That's what happened here. Honestly we thought this would be obvious since we're the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In reality, numerous fans had blamed Japanese rating board CERO for the censorship, as it is widely believed to be the reason why an entirely separate Japan-only version of Cyberpunk 2077 exists for Nintendo Switch without nudity or beheading, even though an uncensored version was released for the platform everywhere else in the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We initially assumed, like some of you, that because games like Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk are on the platform with similar types of uncensored mature content, Dispatch would be allowed to do the same," AdHoc continued. "During the porting process it became clear that was not the case. So we asked that we include a disclaimer on the store page to inform customers that content would be different than on other platforms. We worked with Nintendo to get storefront language approved. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/02/screenshot-2026-01-30-105946-1769770848938-1770029802734.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dispatch's Nintendo Switch censorship. Image: AdHoc/Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Where we absolutely need to take full ownership is the placement of that disclaimer. Again, it was our intent to go out of our way to tell people looking to buy the game that the content was censored. While we didn't have complete control of the language, we did have control of the placement. Wires got crossed and we put the disclaimer in the field literally titled 'Disclaimer', instead of the 'About The Game' section. We didn't catch this until after the launch when we saw people saying we should have called out the changes on the store page, and we went to go make sure it was there. It technically has been the entire time, just in the absolute worst spot that makes it look like we were trying to hide it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is 100% our mistake and it was fixed in the Americas store pages a few hours after launch to give more visibility," AdHoc admited. "We've also added a disclaimer before purchase. As of writing this, the other regions have either published this change or are in the process of review."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, then, AdHoc says it was Nintendo that required the censorship, though it should have done a better job at ensuring fans were better warned about it. Exactly why the game has censored nudity when other games do not, however, remains a mystery. Did Nintendo see a comic book-style game with superheroes and think there was a greater risk of kids seeing nudity than in The Witcher, an RPG where slaying monsters in bloody combat? Neither Nintendo or AdHoc has elaborated.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dispatch Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the upside, and seemingly as a result of all this drama, changes sound like they'll come to Dispatch in the future that may ease the censorship somewhat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're already working with Nintendo on a path forward," AdHoc concluded. "While we can't make any specific promises just yet, we're confident we'll be able to push an update to address at least some of the censored content. I'll get ahead of it now and say that between dev time and the console submission process, we're talking weeks not days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To our fans who were looking forward to playing the uncensored version on Switch, we're truly sorry. People have a right to be pissed. Lots of lessons learned here. Thanks for sticking with us. More soon."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
