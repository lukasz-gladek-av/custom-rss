            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has released an update for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, with some handy item adjustments and a list of bug fixes for the game's Mega Dimension DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch and Switch 2 Pokémon adventure has today been patch to Version 2.0.1, which makes both berries and Mega Shards easier to buy and hold onto. With the update installed, you will now be able to purchase multiple berries at once from food vendors. Mega Dimension owners, meanwhile, will gain the ability to buy berries at Nouveau Café's Truck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Mega Dimension, players with the DLC purchased will see a range of bugs fixed — including Shiny Pokémon not registering in your Pokédex, a side mission progression blocker, and an issue where the game's weather was stuck being sunny (if only this was true in real life).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Launched last month, Mega Dimension adds a fresh story campaign to Pokémon Legends: Z-A, starring a donut chef and the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa. It's set within an alternative Hyperspace version of Lumiose City, where the franchise's typical level 100 cap can be surpassed. Most excitingly, it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-version-200-arrives-adding-mega-dimension-dlc-and-many-all-new-evolutions">adds a swathe of all-new Mega Evolutions</a> — though none as freaky as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-legends-z-a/Mega_Starmie">fan-favorite Mega Starmie</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking ahead, the Pokémon series celebrates its 30th anniversary in 2026, and fans are eagerly awaiting news on the next generation of mainline games. Many expect these to be announced on the franchise's anniversary during its annual Pokémon Presents livestream, due on February 27. There's also the promising-looking life simulation spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> to look forward to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Pokémon Legends Z-A's latest full patch notes lie below:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Ver. 2.0.1 (Released January 21, 2026)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Adjustments Applied for Obtaining Items:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>When purchasing Berries from a food stall, you can now purchase multiple Berries at once.</em></li><li><em>After beginning the story of the Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension DLC, you will be able purchase Berries from the clerk at Nouveau Café’s Truck No. 3.</em></li><li><em>The maximum number of Mega Shards you can carry has been increased from 999 to 9,999.</em></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fixes Applied for the Following Confirmed Issues Related to </strong><em><strong>Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension</strong></em><strong> Content:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>When using moves in certain pockets of hyperspace, Pokémon may sometimes have faced a different direction from the intended target.</em></li><li><em>There were cases in which the weather remained sunny and did not change.</em></li><li><em>Shiny Pokémon obtained prior to the release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension may not have been registered to the Mega Evolution Pokédex, even if their Mega Stones were obtained after becoming available in the DLC.</em></li><li><em>During missions, images from unrelated scenes may occasionally have been displayed.</em></li><li><em>Players may not have been able to complete side mission 188 “Start Special Scanning!” even after earning the maximum number of survey points.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Praise the Omnissiah!</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> will soon get the Techmarine, its seventh playable class, and with it comes a unique ability that sounds very exciting indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/21/space-marine-2-techmarine/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Space Marine 2 game director Dmitry Grigorenko revealed that the Techmarine is designed to be a crowd control and area defense specialist, leaning on tech to get the job done, as they do in the Warhammer 40,000 lore and tabletop wargame upon which Space Marine 2 is based.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In melee the Techmarine uses the Omnissian Axe for wide swipes. This is an upcoming weapon only the Techmarine will have access to upon launch. He also has mechanical arms and an automatic turret bolted directly onto his Power Pack.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Techmarine Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This means that while you’re actively fighting, you can use the Techmarine’s Combat Skill (Space Marine 2’s version of an ‘ultimate’ ability) to trigger the mounted Servo-Gun, which will lay down heavy fire without the player needing to aim it. “Just watch as Tyranids and Thousand Sons get vaporized before your very eyes,” Grigorenko teased.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But here’s the super interesting part: the automatic Servo-Gun frees you up by executing Gun Strikes for you. This is a big deal indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, in Space Marine 2, a Gun Strike is a powerful, quick pistol shot you perform after a perfect dodge or parry (or a heavy attack that stuns smaller foes) when a red reticle appears on an enemy, dealing significant damage and allowing for powerful follow-ups without needing to aim or use ammo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All other classes must manually do a Gun Strike for themselves. But Techmarine players, as Grigorenko put it, “will be free to continue aiming at other targets while their turrets stagger or kill their most pressing assailants.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Already fans are getting excited about this new ability, even though it’s limited to your Combat Skill (at least, that’s how the Xbox Wire blog post makes it sound). “Jesus Christ, I was already excited for this class, it just keeps on getting better,” said one fan. “I hope there’s a Techmarine perk or weapon perk that’ll help give more Gun Strikes to really take advantage of that.” Said another person who clearly knows their Warhammer 40,000 lore: “Get your blessing brothers, awake the machine spirit, refined the holy oil and praise the Motive Force, this new class looks dope.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s even more to the Techmarine. It also has the unique ability to locate and service Tarantula Sentry turrets during missions. “Though they can’t be carried or placed freely, these can provide much welcome support to your Combat Squad by attacking your enemies automatically until they either run out of ammunition or get destroyed,” Grigorenko explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Techmarine hits Space Marine 2 as part of Patch 12, due out in a few weeks. The new class will be available across all modes apart from the narrative campaign, as it centers around the story of Ultramarines Lieutenant Demetrian Titus.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Also coming with Patch 12 is a 12th mission to the Operations and Stratagems modes, a new mission pick-up type, three new Hero weapon variants, and new customization options for Space Marine helmetless heads. If you own the Season Pass 2 you also get a brand-new Assault Champion Raven Guard skin and a unique cosmetic pack for the Carcharodons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As announced this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-set-to-close-out-january-2026-with-a-bolt-from-the-grim-darkness-of-the-far-future-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2 releases on Xbox Game Pass, with Xbox Play Anywhere support, on January 29</a>, so expect an influx of new players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Polish language support has also been added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most notable is what appears to be a typo in the patch notes' list of bug fixes, which references an issue that has been fixed when <em>playing </em>as Kamek on Choco Mountain. Kamek is not a playable character (yet) in Mario Kart World, but this is likely just a reference to the Kamek item. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, nothing else interesting has been discovered in the patch — which is far less meaty than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-update-140-tweaks-track-layouts-adds-custom-item-rules-now-lets-you-see-what-music-is-playing">Nintendo's 1.4.0 update for Mario Kart World that launched at the end of last year</a>. That addition reworked the layouts of several areas to spice up the game's open world, and led fans to believe more changes would likely follow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of yet, Nintendo has simply been tinkering with its Switch 2 racer, without adding any extra DLC (free or otherwise).

But it's for his work with Retro Studios on the Metroid Prime series for which he's best known.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in an interview with <a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Dream</a> magazine, Tanabe has said that Metroid Prime 4 was his final game for Nintendo — meaning that he has left the series' story unfinished, and the fate of his villain Sylux uncertain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sylux has been built up as the next Big Bad of the Metroid Prime series, following his introduction in Metroid Prime: Hunters, and the end of the original Metroid Prime trilogy that pitted Samus against Dark Samus. During the interview, Tanabe said he saw Sylux as a way to "further expand the 'Metroid Prime Universe'" and create further games beyond the initial trilogy. Because of this, he implored developers to foreshadow Sylux's presence via cameos in Metroid Prime 3 and Metroid Prime: Federation Force, while keeping his full story under-wraps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A long time passed before I finally had the opportunity to make this game," Tanabe said of Metroid Prime 4 (via machine translation). "Considering my age, I felt that making this Metroid Prime series might be my last chance. Therefore, I conceived and planned this project as the 'first installment of the Sylux Saga.'</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I portrayed Sylux as a villain with a dark personality, deep resentment, and despicable methods; and from this game onward, Samus will realize that a direct confrontation with him is inevitable, and he must be completely defeated. Therefore, the final battle between Sylux and Samus is not yet over. However, it took longer than I had imagined to complete this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be able to participate in the production of the series," Tanabe concluded. "Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, [assistant producer Risa] Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is yet to comment on the report, or announce Tanabe's departure. IGN has asked the company for more detail today.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">After a lengthy delay, Metroid Prime 4 finally launched for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 last month, albeit to a more muted critical response than the franchise's beloved original trilogy. Nintendo has so far made no official announcement on how well the game has sold. However, earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">an unnamed Nintendo source</a> blamed the recent slowdown in Switch 2 sales over the holiday period on a "complicated" economic climate and the "absence of a major Western game" — despite the launch of Metroid Prime 4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's been 40 years since I joined Nintendo," Tanabe reflected. "Metroid Prime 4 will be the last game I work on at Nintendo. However, we didn't deliberately do anything 'special.' Instead, like all previous Nintendo titles, we worked together with Retro Studios to create it, hoping to bring a fun and unique experience to players of all ages and types.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If it becomes a game that leaves a lasting impression on players who have played it, I will be very gratified. And for those who haven't played it yet, I hope you will experience the unknown planet Viewros through Samus' eyes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
