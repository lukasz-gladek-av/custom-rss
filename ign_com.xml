This price cut brings it more in line with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3 competitor</a>, which is currently $499 for the Quest 3 and $299 for the Quest 3S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're hoping to pick up the PlayStation VR2 headset for yourself at this new price, now you can!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-game-club-revisiting-batman-arkham-asylum<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Welcome to Beyond! Game Club, a new segment for podcast Beyond! where each month we will be picking games to play as a group and talking about our experiences as we progress through them. The games will range from various classics to quintessential PlayStation games we consider must plays, and even revisiting some recent favorites to prepare for upcoming sequels (looking at you Ghost of Tsushima and Yotei)! However, for March we decided it would be a great time to revisit one of our favorite superhero games of all time: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/11/batman-arkham-asylum-review">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been at least 10 years since many of us dove into 2009's Batman: Arkham Asylum and now feels like the perfect time to revisit the game that almost singlehandedly revitalized the superhero genre. Whether it was the excellent freeform combat of snapping back and forth between enemies with precision, to unleashing devastating kicks or takedowns, or the way it trained our detective skills to solve the numerous riddles by the Riddler â€“ Arkham Asylum gave us the best depiction (for its time) of Batman and what it would be like to wear the cowl.  
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Beyond! team is eager to dive back into this amazing game, and over the month of March we will be talking about it weekly on each episode of the podcast as well as updating this column with our thoughts and hope that you will all do the same in the comments below.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
