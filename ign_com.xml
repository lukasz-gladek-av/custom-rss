IGN Japan was in attendance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Monster Hunter Wilds was first released on February 28, some players left harsh feedback, but Tokuda said the team worked to improve the game by taking advantage of that feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Immediately after the release, we apologized for the inconvenience caused by the volume of content and the difficulty level. Despite this, we were delighted to receive various awards, including Users' Choice awards. We would like to thank all the players who have given their opinions and spoken warm words even in this situation. The development team was able to turn everyone's feedback into an asset and work on the update with all our strength, and I think the result was also the reason why players voted for us," said Tokuda.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/img-3587-1764763663206.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yuya Tokuda (left) and Ryozo Tsujimoto (right) at the PlayStation Partner Awards 2025 Japan Asia held in Tokyo on December 3.

There are still updates left to come, so we will continue to do our best," added Tsujimoto.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Monster Hunter series celebrated its 20th anniversary last year. The franchise was a hit in Japan, and after the release of Monster Hunter: World in 2018, it grew into a literal monster title overseas. According to Tokuda, the Monster Hunter Wilds team were more aware than ever of being accepted by newcomers or those who had trouble beating the games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We analyzed what kind of places beginners were stuck in, including Monster Hunter: World. We have worked on these points in turn to make it easier for new users to clear hurdles such as being able to reach certain monsters or to craft certain types of armor. In addition, we have tried to adopt as many new elements as possible that are beneficial for both beginners and existing users, such as Focus Mode. This time, as a result of making the game easy to beat even for new players and players who could not clear it before, I think the difficulty curve was a little lacking for existing users,” said Tokuda. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda said the team has focused on creating more difficult content with each update. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you beat the game immediately after its release and stopped playing, I would appreciate it if you could pick it up again," said Tokuda.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds still has updates to come, but Tsujimoto also talked a little about the future of the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, we don’t intend to stop the series here. We plan to continue, and we want to let more people play. In addition, I would like to think about things beyond the games so that we can further expand the potential of the Monster Hunter IP," said Tsujimoto.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All Low Rank Armor in Monster Hunter Wilds</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From Tsujimoto's remarks, it seems we can continue to look forward to new games and more in the Monster Hunter series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tsujimoto was also asked where Monster Hunter stands within the overall catalog of Capcom IP, which he answered diplomatically. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Capcom is a company with various IPs, and every IP is very important. I'm in charge of Monster Hunter now, that’s all I can comment on, but as Capcom, we want to expand all our IPs,” he said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom is scheduled to release Resident Evil Requiem, Onimusha Way of the Sword, and Pragmata in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Takashi Nagasako, who previously voiced Donkey Kong for 21 years, has also been replaced as of the Switch 2's launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently caught up with Hale and discussed her past work as Samus, and questioned whether she had recorded any new material for Metroid Prime 4 over the course of its lengthy development. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't know," Hale told IGN. "I have no recollection of recording it or signing a contract, so it could be no. When we work, this is the thing, everything's under a code name, so they would've called it Sasquatch or Pineapple or Cookie Jar. And 'okay, I'm going to do Cookie Jar.'

"It's very specific. If you are a civilian and you're grunting, you're like... [makes surprised grunt noise] because it's all surprising and it's all new. If you've done it a million times, you're like [makes short grunt noise], because you've gone under fire 1,800 times and you're used to it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hale has voiced a string of famous video game characters over the years, including Ratchet and Clank's Rivet, Metal Gear Solid's Naomi Hunter, and BioShock Infinite's Rosalind Lutece. But it's for her role in Mass Effect that she remains perhaps known. Speaking to IGN, Hale said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-love-that-universe-im-ready-anytime-jennifer-hale-calls-on-fans-to-tell-bioware-theyd-love-to-see-commander-shepard-return-for-mass-effect-5">she hadn't been asked to return for Mass Effect 5 yet</a>, but "would be there before they finish the sentence" if BioWare got in touch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not all of Prime 4’s additions work, but this is still an excellent comeback," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Metroid Prime 4 review</a>, scoring the game an 8/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <title><![CDATA[Octopath Traveler 0 Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-review</link>
            <guid>1371343</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Lengthy RPGs are one of the great joys in my life, but it can sometimes feel a bit daunting to pack one into just a few weeks for the review process. As of writing this, I have played just over 70 hours of Octopath Traveler 0 and am nearing the final few chapters in its main questline – and having played these kinds of RPGs most of my life, I already know those "final few chapters" will be anything but short. However, I'm eager to wrap them up in the coming days because it's been a worthwhile journey so far. Between the new wrinkles in its dynamic combat system and some fantastic music that uplift its big battles, Octopath Traveler 0 is hitting the right notes and delivering the things I seek from RPGs. The tales told within its various quest branches have been hit and miss, though, and I'm still waiting to see if the story will come together and hit its stride in this last stretch before I settle with a final, scored review.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Octopath Traveler 0, Square Enix has adapted the 2022 mobile game Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent into a more traditional package, serving as both a prequel to the original and a reconfiguration of what's already available on phones. Regardless of where I land in my final review, I'm glad it exists in this form at all since it ditches the gacha/microtransaction elements that were used to build your party and instead has you recruiting team members through sidequests. Thus, the better parts of the mobile game come to the forefront and highlight that the foundation of the series held up then and still holds up now.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Octopath Traveler 0 Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Story is where most of my reservations are since it hits some pretty high highs and fairly low lows. While I'm not expecting it to be the most beautifully written script or deepest character study, I've found several plot beats to fall quite flat due to some shallow storytelling, rudimentary dialogue, or things that happen <em>just because</em>. Comically evil villains make for bosses I get fired up to absolutely destroy, but it's hard to take them seriously at times when their foolish cruelty and thirst for power is the main hook, so I'm not coming away with a sense of satisfaction I've felt elsewhere (namely, Octopath Traveler 2). Like the rest of the series, godly powers linger in the background and slowly reveal themselves as you uncover the real purpose behind the eight divine rings, one of which is assigned to "the chosen one" who is your created protagonist. Despite the inconsistent quality of its storytelling across this long runtime, Octopath Traveler 0 runs at a decent pace and propels you forward without sitting on any one story thread for too long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A big part of this is in how the main questline is structured; after a tragic prologue where your hometown is burned to the ground, you're given three story branches to pursue the trio of villains responsible. Themed around power, fame, and wealth, respectively, those three paths then converge into a conclusion for what is roughly the first half of the overall story (at about 40 hours). It then splits into three <em>new </em>questlines that pick up those themes once again, and although they retread similar territory, the stakes get higher as more of Octopath's world gets involved. That's a lot to chew on, but it's able to keep momentum rather than trying to build eight separate stories that have to run in parallel. Octopath Traveler 2 was very successful with regard to its cast of eight and made for some of the most memorable RPG stories in recent memory, but this is a smart direction considering that this (and the mobile game) centers around recruiting <em>a lot </em>of characters to swap in and out of your party. Unfortunately this means most party members feel rather disposable, so the disonance it creates is just the trade-off that gets made.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>So far the story has hit some pretty high highs and fairly low lows.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While I haven't experienced the same compelling, emotionally resonant character arcs I saw in the second game, specific moments remind me that there's still some heartfelt stuff tucked within. Whether it's a character wielding their pain from tragedy to summon a new power mid-battle or a quiet, reflective cutscene back at town to remind you what "home" really means, Octopath Traveler 0 has brief moments of greatness. The big picture is solid, too – the alliances and betrayals of various kingdoms don't get bogged down in exposition and deliver good old fashioned drama. The stories around Octopath's world religion get a bit unwieldy when it comes to the greater lore, but it's not incomprehensible and makes the mechanism of the church quite clear. Like the previous game, class warfare and going from nothing to something remains a prominent motif, and even though it sometimes fumbles the messaging here, it's willing to talk about those topics with enough clarity. Whether or not all these threads pay off, well, that's what's left for me to determine as I finish the main story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, that's the A-plot. There's a B-plot that revolves around rebuilding your hometown through an independent but related questline that's tied to the town-building system. In the process of bringing your hometown back to life narratively, you actually <em>rebuild </em>it in a similar vein to Fallout 4 or even Ni no Kuni 2. You collect crafting materials naturally throughout which then allow you to build housing, shops, and decor wherever you like within certain parameters. It’s an enjoyable side activity, with tangible benefits that come from constructing new buildings and recruiting new residents you invite from across the map. You get perks such as discounted shop prices, a self-sufficient flow of materials, and a training ground for inactive party members to continue leveling up, among other things. Town building may seem optional at first, but it becomes almost essential the deeper you get, especially when you consider the story's broader message about what home means to you and the people you care for. It's a bit cheesy at times, but its heart is in the right place as it gets sentimental about what it takes to rebuild after losing everything. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You get a ton of sidequests thrown at you as you progress in the main game, many of which are a short series' of objectives to unlock new party members – some of which are cast members from the original game. It's super cool to see, but don't expect them to have any particular depth as the main story is largely focused on specific, non-optional characters. One thing I do enjoy about Octopath games and RPGs like them is the sense of discovery and stumbling upon secrets or locations you wouldn't visit otherwise, and the sidequests, if anything, have been a good way to pull you in those directions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2023/2900-4972/#8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on record saying Octopath Traveler 2</a> has one of my favorite turn-based combat systems ever; it shines here as well and for slightly different reasons. The Boost and Break systems give the typical dynamic of hitting elemental affinities extra depth. Playing the guessing game of discovering what enemies are weak against gets a little tiresome, but once that part is solved, scheming for your plan of attack based on turn order to Break enemies and tee up the big hits is oh so satisfying. Building each party members' Boost points to add extra hits or increase spell potency gives you something to plan around for turns well in advance. And lining up all these variables while juggling the threat of hard-hitting bosses who impose some impactful status ailments have me feeling like a genius tactician. Octopath might be playing on our nostalgia with its HD-2D retro-style visuals, but I honestly believe it has continually set a higher bar for turn-based combat systems in modern gaming.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This series has continually set a higher bar for turn-based combat systems.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Party composition is quite different this time around since you have eight active party members at all times – four in the front row and four in the back who you can swap between mid-turn. With 30-something characters in my current roster, it's an overwhelming amount to process and manage. But while the fundamentals of Octopath's combat system are familiar, pairing characters as duos for the column they occupy is a unique strategic layer that allows for a lot of flexibility in combat. And because they build Boost points individually, you can dole out the big hits more frequently and keep up a brisk pace in battle. You sacrifice individual character depth, however, as each party member has just one Job to progress through (aside from your protagonist), but you can at least master specific Job skills to then equip on other characters to diversify their moveset. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm not quite ready to say whether I like this combat more or less than Octopath Traveler 2 since I found its character growth more meaningful, but it’s still been a welcome change of pace that hits the turn-based highs that've made the series special. The slow-motion cinematic camera cuts for Max Boost attacks and tide-turning limit breaks still get me hyped up, giving combat the visual flair that truly makes the HD-2D style stand out when the action picks up. The confluence of thoughtful gameplay, fantastic graphics, and a banging soundtrack that contends with some of the RPG greats, showcases why the genre is still in good hands.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Michael Higham's Top 10 Favorite RPGs of All Time</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Octopath Traveler 0 has so much firing off in parallel with its separate story branches, overarching themes, and complex-but-satisfying RPG combat system, and I'm excited to see how it all concludes as I inch closer to the end. Great RPGs live or die by how their final acts play out – with the expectation of wild boss battles, story revelations, and resolution to an 80-hour-plus journey, a lot is riding on it. And I'm just as eager to finalize my thoughts and feelings on Octopath Traveler 0 soon after.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-review]]></content:encoded>
