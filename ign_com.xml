            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gives-away-its-most-mysterious-card-to-all-players-today<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Trading Card Pocket has finally revealed its most mysterious card by giving it away to all players for free today, January 20.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An alternate art version of the Pokédex is now available as a reward for the worldwide player base of Pokémon TCG Pocket collecting a total of 40 billion cards. This Pokédex is Promo A card 008, which was blank until today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To celebrate achieving 40 billion cards acquired in total by players around the world, we are giving you a promo card," developer Creatures Inc. said. The Pokédex card is available until April 30, 2025, after which point it will seemingly become unobtainable for good.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/20/img-5531-1737376012565.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have long wondered how the Pokédex card would be made available, as the other Promo A cards from 001 to 009 were all available upon Pokémon TCG Pocket's launch. Creatures Inc. has since released every other Promo A card up to number 033, leaving the 008 slot strangely blank until now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This release also confirms the Pokédex is not connected to the Advance Ticket item hiding in players' inventories. "This ticket cannot be used yet," reads the description of the item, also available since launch. "Wait and see what it's for!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though one Pokémon TCG Pocket mystery has today been solved, fans will just have to be patient before this other one is detailed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October and follows the standard mobile and free-to-play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real-world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">outside of the occasional set drop like Mythical Island</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans' complaints over this high cost were exacerbated when Creatures Inc. outlined its highly anticipated trading feature too, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-trading-unveiled-but-is-so-poorly-received-the-developers-had-to-respond">which caused such an uproar that it had to release a follow-up response</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-insists-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-as-fans-obsess-over-a-picture-of-chocolate-cake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight fans have been through the wringer recently, with cryptic X/Twitter activity from one developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">sparking rampant speculation that the hotly anticipated follow-up Hollow Knight: Silksong will finally re-emerge at Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct in April</a> — and potentially even release on Nintendo’s next-gen console as a timed launch exclusive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all started when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i31gas/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_william_pellen/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>supersleuths on the Hollow Knight subreddit</u></a> noticed that on January 15, co-director of Team Cherry William Pellen had changed his Twitter/X profile picture to a picture of a chocolate cake. Alongside this, Pellen tweeted: “something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Nintendo’s Switch 2 reveal was rumored for January 16, and so it proved — that was the day <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name"><u>Nintendo finally announced the Switch 2</u></a>. Had Pellen really asked followers to keep an eye out for the Switch 2 reveal? If so, why?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans then reverse-searched the picture of the cake, leading them to a recipe for Brooklyn Blackout Cake on cooking website <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/blackout-cake" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bon Appétit</u></a>. The date the recipe was published: April 2, 2024. The date of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is April 2, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans also wondered what Pellen’s new X/Twitter handle, @everydruidwaswr, meant, if anything. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i36zi6/comment/m7l3uqu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Redditor Representative-True speculated</u></a> that the “wr” in “everydruidwaswr” was the start of a word, perhaps “wrong,” or perhaps stands for “was wrong,” and pointed to the Druid of the Moss Temple Silksong NPC as evidence of… something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pellen had a new X/Twitter name to go along with the new handle and profile picture: “little bomey.” Fans noticed Little Boomey is a wine from Southern Australia, where Team Cherry is based, but the spelling is different. The upshot of all this was that some fans thought Pellen had kicked off a Silksong alternate reality game (ARG), but over the weekend comments appeared to pour cold water on this theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, Hollow Knight YouTuber fireb0rn <a href="https://x.com/fireb0rn/status/1880411907552911626" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say Team Cherry marketing and publishing chief Matthew 'Leth' Griffin had got in touch “to confirm there was no Silksong ARG and that the changes to William's account and the tweet were a nothingburger. Apologies to have misled everyone. The cake was a lie."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/283467363729408000/586931790208434203/1330100156518891571" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on the Hollow Knight Discord</a>, Griffin backed this up, saying: "It wasn’t [an ARG]. But it was still some impressive sleuthing skills by the fans... like ya’ll are WAY beyond those 2020 riddles now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Griffin himself followed up to respond to one fan who wondered if Team Cherry had given up on Hollow Knight: Silksong. “Yes the game is real, progressing and will release,” <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Griffin tweeted</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has done little to calm all the speculation, as you can perhaps imagine. And at the time of this article’s publication, Pellen’s tweet remains online. Pellen himself has yet to explain whatever his X/Twitter activity is all about, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch"><u>when Hollow Knight: Silksong was announced</u></a>, Team Cherry confirmed the launch platforms as Windows, Mac, Linux, and Nintendo Switch. But that was six years ago. We have a few months to find out what this all means, but in the meantime, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-heres-everything-announced-and-confirmed"><u>everything announced at Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-price-many-in-the-video-game-industry-hope-for-80-if-not-100-analyst-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There is “hope” among some within the video game industry that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will be priced between $80 and $100, one analyst has said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a wide-ranging presentation on the state of gaming in 2025</a>, Epyllion CEO Matthew Ball said Rockstar’s guaranteed mega-hit “could re-establish packed video game prices after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6, due out fall 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, is the long-awaited follow-up to 2013’s record-breaking GTA 5. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-projected-to-make-over-3-billion-in-its-first-year-on-sale">Analysts have projected it will make an eye-watering $3 billion in its first year on sale</a>, with $1 billion in pre-orders before it even launches. It seems likely that GTA 6 will be the biggest entertainment launch in history, with revenue ahead of any film.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how much will GTA 6 cost the gamer? Most triple-A video games cost $70 as standard after a $10 price hike that kicked in with the current generation of consoles in 2020. Could Rockstar and its parent company Take-Two use GTA 6 as an opportunity to go higher five years later?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In his report, Ball reported that “some gamemakers hope GTA 6 will be priced at $80 to $100, breaking the $70 barrier and helping $50 titles to move up to $60, $60 to do $70, $70 to $80 etc.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this price hike would certainly raise eyebrows with the video game audience, Ball argued that a $70 GTA 6 would be the “cheapest” GTA game ever released, in real terms. That is, when taking inflation into account. In real terms, $91 would be average, Ball said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Packaged game prices have never been lower in real terms than they are today — even though budgets are at all-time highs and player growth is stalled,” Ball said in the report. “GTA 6 could re-establish packed video game prices after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ball’s report has sparked a discussion about the value of video games and the likelihood that Rockstar would actually go through with an $80 to $100 price range for GTA 6. Reacting to Ball’s comment, Michael Douse, publishing director at Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1881030119793299652" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>: “You’re not supposed to say this out loud!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “A good company raises salaries in-line with inflation so that their staff don’t die or something, but games prices haven’t risen with inflation. This isn’t the reason the industry is in the shit for now, but it is an uncomfortable truth. On the other hand, the responsibility for a game developer is to make sure that the game they show lives up to that promise, and that investment from the player.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of burning questions when it comes to GTA 6, including how exactly Rockstar will package the release. With GTA 5, Rockstar threw in its mega money-spinner GTA Online for free. Will it do so again with GTA 6? Could the single-player portion of GTA 6 be sold for the standard $70, but if you want GTA Online as well it will cost you more? And what about the inevitable microtransactions? Will pricing for those in the new GTA Online rise as well?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/ballmatthew/status/1881068551265825001" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Taking to social media to follow-up on his report</a>, Ball said he doesn’t actually think Rockstar will go to $100 with GTA 6, betting instead it will stick with $70 or at a push go for $80. “What I said is many in the market hope for $80 if not $99.99,” he clarified.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Might a price hike spark a backlash, though? “Can't really speculate on a game that is barely even revealed,” <a href="https://x.com/ballmatthew/status/1881071892557410389" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ball continued</a>. “But the $70 bump from $60 in 2020 (which bought under three years of inflation control) was pretty without issue.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever price GTA 6 ends up selling for, its huge projected revenue is up against similarly huge development costs, estimated from the high hundreds of millions to as much as $2 billion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-lot-riding-on-gta-6-and-not-just-for-rockstar-and-take-two"><u>There’s a lot riding on GTA 6, then, but not just for Take-Two and Rockstar</u></a>. In March last year, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella predicted Rockstar’s surefire hit would spark “renewed interest” in video games, before going one step further: “There's probably never been a more important thing to ever release in the industry, so no pressure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is the kind of game that will sell consoles, too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-likely-out-later-in-2024-analysts-say"><u>Sony’s PS5 Pro</u></a> will no doubt benefit greatly from interest in GTA 6, too. Let’s remember: GTA 6 is not coming out on PC at launch; to play you must own a PlayStation or an Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The almost guaranteed success of GTA 6 comes amid one of the toughest periods for the video game industry in recent memory. More than 33,000 people have lost their jobs since 2022, with huge layoffs at the likes of Microsoft and Sony. Indeed, Take-Two itself has suffered layoffs and studio closures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on Rockstar for a firm GTA 6 release date, or, as some are predicting, a delay into 2026. While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, the boss of Take-Two's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
