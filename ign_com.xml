It’s a livestream that acted as a showcase for drastically altered visuals as well as a handful of gameplay changes that will have Cyrodiil looking and feeling more foreign than ever, and fans have already taken notice. Although some players are hesitant about some of the many, many changes, most players seem to be happy to have another excuse to dive back into one of Bethesda's defining games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Oblivion in Unreal Engine 5</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion is approaching its 20th birthday and is known for some somewhat potato-y character models and stiff animations. It’s part of the charm that has kept the RPG classic in players’ minds for decades, but it’s also something that Bethesda and Virtuos wanted to touch up in the Oblivion remaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Models and environments have been rebuilt from the ground up, a new lighting system will make shadows feel more realistic, and lip-syncing technology will spruce up some of those previously awkward conversations. In many ways, Oblivion Remastered looks more like a remake, something many are latching onto as they either return to Cyrodiil or embark for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Oblivion Remastered is quite literally a REMAKE," declared X / Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1914700461896077312" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SynthPotato</a>. "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion feels more like Remake than Remaster, <a href="https://x.com/HazzadorGamin/status/1914704199587180791" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said HazzadorGamin</a>. "Good job by team Virtuos." "The Elder Scrolls Oblivion Remastered?

Virtuos jumped on the opportunity to modernize the classic formula with a variety of tweaks, with some as small as a cleaner lock-picking system, while others, such as the added ability to sprint, offer massive changes to the formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The level-up system now falls somewhere in between the one fans know from Oblivion and the system present in The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim. Third and first-person perspectives have been altered as well, as Virtuos aimed to take advantage of the leaps gaming has made in the last two decades. Whether it’s a surface-level adjustment or a fundamental change, most fans are at least interested to see how 2025 Oblivion stacks up against the original.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It looks so good. That reveal was amazing,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1k592j2/comment/mog4kbk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user commented</u></a>. “So many good decisions with how to handle an Oblivion remake. The UI, keeping the old lock picking instead of pasting in Skyrim/Fallout style, making the leveling a hybrid. My only (very minor) complaint about the reveal was that they kind of spoiled the thieves guild quest line a bit for new players lol.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">For many people, myself included, who didn't play as much Oblivion or were very young, this is essentially getting a BRAND NEW Elder Scrolls today.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OblivionRemastered?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#OblivionRemastered</a> <a href="https://t.co/wpIoTHSJa6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/wpIoTHSJa6</a></p>— Robin (@SpectreRobin) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpectreRobin/status/1914707193078698042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Look at character creation.

You want some of that old charm.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtuos carried these ideas into its remaster. Animations still fit with the same clunky awkwardness players have come to love, and so much of that same stiff dialog has been kept intact, too. The team even brought back much of the original cast’s lines, so don’t worry, you’ll still be quoting much of the same lines that have been stuck in your head since 2006. These are choices that fans are already glomming onto.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I agree with every decision they made,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1k592j2/comment/mog1v0e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a>. “Keeping old voice actors, adding in new ones to break up the monotony. Updating gameplay, but keeping the old Oblivion bones. Updating the UI but keeping the parchment aesthetic. God damn work can’t end fast enough.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I love how despite being 20 years ahead and a million times more realistic, Oblivion's faces still look goofy as hell and the lines still sound utterly hilarious.</p><p>Also the quality of these clothing and armor sets is INSANE <a href="https://t.co/WCh1OMtE0e" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WCh1OMtE0e</a></p></div>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1914702982194638860?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">16yr old me played Oblivion so 34yr old me could play Oblivion almost 20yrs later. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OblivionRemastered?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#OblivionRemastered</a> <a href="https://t.co/7Oaq19fxyD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/7Oaq19fxyD</a> <a href="https://t.co/8ZCvQfwqkK" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8ZCvQfwqkK</a></p>— Kevin G.

It’s remained a favorite among RPG fans for nearly 20 years, so when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-images-leak-from-developer-website">rumors of a remake or remaster emerged</a> in the past few months, excitement began to grow. Today’s reveal is anything but a surprise, but it does at least come with a full breakdown of some of the biggest changes to be found when seeing how the classic has been reimagined.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is out now for everyone on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S priced $49.99, as well as on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
