            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony and Sucker Punch Productions just wrapped up their July 2025 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei"><u>Ghost of Yōtei</u></a> State of Play, showcasing a better look at its world, combat, and new modes ahead of its release date this fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgM6poO2JmY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>20-minute gameplay presentation</u></a>, hosted by creative directors Jason Connell and Nate Fox, arrived today to help showcase how Atsu’s journey will be both familiar and new for players who enjoyed 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima. Any way you cut it, the Ghost of Yōtei State of Play is the closest look at one of the PlayStation 5’s biggest games of the year that we’ve seen yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who missed out on the State of Play, IGN took the time to gather all of the highlights for you right here. You can check out everything revealed during the presentation below while we wait for more updates ahead of Ghost of Yōtei’s October 2, 2025, release date.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">The Sights and Sounds of Ezo</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Yōtei focuses on Atsu as she seeks revenge against the Yōtei Six at any cost. It's a bloody journey that has led Atsu's enemies to fear her, with many worried that she is a legendary Onyro spirit come to life. Ghost of Yōtei fuels its journey of vengeance in a completely new way, allowing players to flash back to its protagonist's younger years with the simple press of a button.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Traveling throughout Ezo means encountering a land far different from the war-torn island of Tsushima. Beautiful in its own right, Ghost of Yōtei's new map encourages players to experience Atsu's journey how they please, with Sucker Punch going as far as to say the adventure "focuses on player freedom more than any game" it has ever made. One example of this newfound player freedom can be found in the Clue System, which can lead the player in new directions. While some information gained during an interrogation may see Atsu travel to snowy mountaintops that hide hidden attackers, another may take her to a village ravaged by fire and an army of samurai.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch wants players to choose to focus on combat, exploration, story, or whatever it is that satisfies their quest. However, one recommended way to see all Ezo has to offer involves simply using a spyglass and walking toward whatever catches your eye.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploring a 1603 Japan means finding familiar points of interest, such as new Bamboo Strike challenges and even more Hot Springs to relax in, but players can also look forward to taking out difficult fights as a bounty hunter, too. There are also Altars of Reflection, which unlock new abilities for Atsu that will no doubt aid her on her journey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Ghost of Yōtei Combat Get an Upgrade</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With a hefty price on Atsu's head, players will need to utilize an arsenal of new tools and weapons. While it looks like fans will have plenty of opportunities for standard sword encounters, some new blades will help spice things up. Highlights include the weapons like the katana and spear as well as the more unconvential kusarigama chain blade, the lengthy odachi, and even dual swords. Each offers specific advantages in battle depending on the circumstances, with all weapons featuring upgrades to utilize, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ranged combat, meanwhile, will see Atsu primarily using two tools: a bow and a gun. The Ghost of Yōtei gameplay showed off a glimpse at how the latter can be used to quickly take out a distant enemy at the cost of stealth. In other words, Atsu comes with a few more tools than Ghost of Tsushima's Jin did, and she's got no reservations when it comes to using them to take out the Yōtei Six.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In between combat encounters and brushes with death, players can allow Atsu to rest under the stars. Here, you can cook food, play music, and even meet up with allies while taking in all Ezo's skies have to offer. With these changes also comes a replacement for the standard journal that is known as Atsu's Wolf Pack. Sucker Punch calls the menu system a "more character-driven way of managing allies and vendors" met during Atsu's journey. It's a straightforward way to see who might have something to offer, and it's wrapped up with art for each face you meet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Ghost of Tsushima approached its connection to nature in one way, Ghost of Yōtei appears like it may depend the connection players have with the world around them. One way it will do this involves a new wolf companion who, as shown during the State of Play, can tear out an enemy's throat during combat. Traveling through a field of flowers, meanwhile, can give your character a boost while riding on your horse. Sucker Punch also showed off a first look at what appears to be a dense customization system for Atsu's armor as well as the ability to disarm enemies with enough well-timed attacks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ghost of Yotei State of Play July 2025 - Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Kurosawa Mode Returns Alongside New Immersive Options</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Kurosawa Mode, a black-and-white omage to legenadary director Akira Kurosawa, makes its return after fans fell in love with it in Ghost of Tsushima. It's a sign not only that Sucker Punch is happy with the response it received the first time around but that the team remains influenced by some of the prominent artists in the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This influence can also be felt in two additional modes: Miike Mode and Watanabe Mode. As some movie fans might have guessed, the former takes after 13 Assassins director Takashi Miike, moving the camera in closer with more blood and more mud. The latter, meanwhile, brings in the work of Samurai Champloo anime director Shinichirō Watanabe by featuring original lo-fi beats that back moments of exploration and combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other highlights from the Ghost of Yōtei State of Play include a first look at photo mode as well as options for Standard English audio, Subtitled English audio, and Samurai Cinema, which features fully voice acted Japanese dialogue with English subtitles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Yōtei launches October 2, 2025, for PS5. As a last-minute surprise, Sucker Punch promised that special edition Ghost of Yōtei PS5 consoles and unique DualSense controllers will also be available at launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Per Krafton, the three removed executives allegedly would have been eligible for 90% of the $250 million bonus promised to staff.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The ongoing drama around Subnautica 2's delay and its team's upheaval continues, with the company Krafton issuing a lengthy public statement today accusing the studio's leaders of having "abandoned responsibilities" on the game, alleging they focused on personal projects rather than fulfilling their contracted roles and suggesting the game's delay is their fault.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the published statement sent to press, which we've reprinted in full below, Krafton claims it made "multiple requests" to Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire to resume their responsibilities as game director and technical director respectively, but claims they both declined. "In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, KRAFTON asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project," the statement reads. "KRAFTON believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton also makes reference to a reported $250 million bonus that was promised to the development team, which would have paid out just a few months from now if it hit revenue targets. Per Krafton, 90% of this bonus was intended to go directly to Cleveland, McGuire, and former CEO Ted Gill prior to their removal from the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement concludes with Krafton promising "fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees...and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The full content of the statement is as follows:</p><blockquote>To Our 12 Million Fellow Subnauts,</blockquote><blockquote>— <strong> Inevitable Leadership Change Driven by Project Abandonment–Despite Holding 90% of Earnout for Themselves</strong></blockquote><blockquote>First and foremost, we sincerely thank you for your continued support, passion, and unwavering dedication to Subnautica. We wish to provide clarity on the recent leadership changes at Unknown Worlds, a creative studio under KRAFTON.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Background of Leadership Change</strong></blockquote><blockquote>KRAFTON deeply values Subnautica’s unique creativity and immersive world-building. To provide fans with even better gaming experiences, we acquired Unknown Worlds, fully committed to supporting Subnautica’s future success. We collaborated closely with the studio’s leadership, who were central to the creation of the original Subnautica, to foster the optimal environment for a successful Subnautica 2.</blockquote><blockquote>Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.</blockquote><blockquote>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them. Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. KRAFTON made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, KRAFTON asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</blockquote><blockquote>KRAFTON believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.</blockquote><blockquote>The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.</blockquote><blockquote>We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>KRAFTON’s Full Support for the Dedicated Development Team</strong></blockquote><blockquote>To uphold our commitment to provide you with the best possible gaming experience, we made the difficult yet necessary decision to change the executive leadership. Subnautica 2 has been and continues to be actively developed by a dedicated core team who share genuine passion, accountability, and commitment to the game. We deeply respect their expertise and creativity and will continue to provide full and unwavering support, enabling them to focus solely on delivering the exceptional game you deserve.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>KRAFTON’s Commitment to its Promises in Rewarding Employees</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Additionally, KRAFTON has committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to Subnautica 2’s development. We believe that the dedication and effort of this team are at the very heart of Subnautica’s ongoing evolution, and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised.</blockquote><blockquote>Fans will always remain at the center of every decision we make at KRAFTON. Moving forward, we promise transparent communication and continued efforts to sustainably develop and expand the beloved Subnautica universe.</blockquote><blockquote>Honoring your trust and expectations is a core tenet at KRAFTON. We are committed to repaying your patience with an even more refined and exceptional gaming experience.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Subnautica 2's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum">entire leadership team was replaced last week</a> with former Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis by owner Krafton, and the game was delayed to 2026. The replacement came as a "shock" to Cleveland, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-developer-breaks-silence-after-shock-removal-to-find-that-im-no-longer-able-to-work-at-the-company-i-started-stings">claimed in a Reddit post shortly after his removal</a> that Subnautica 2 was "ready for early release", that the decision was "in Krafton's hands," and saying the decision to remove him and the other leaders "stings."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was followed by a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-drama-in-the-murky-world-of-subnautica-2-as-official-delay-confirmation-comes-hot-on-the-heels-of-damaging-report-into-now-unlikely-250m-bonus">Bloomberg report</a> that alleged this decision was made just before the $250 million bonus was scheduled to be paid out to the team, with staff expecting bonuses ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to seven figures that they were now concerned they would not see. In a statement to IGN at the time, Krafton claimed the delay was a response to playtester feedback, and had nothing to do with "any contractual or financial considerations." In response to the removal of the three members of leadership and concerns about the denial of promised bonuses to staff, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lvyc7f/do_not_buy_subnautica_2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans have begun organizing boycotts of the game on social media</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/jigsaw-puzzle-sale-amazon-prime-day-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazons-massive-jigsaw-puzzle-sale-is-my-prime-day-kryptonite.1240944/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I have always loved jigsaw puzzles. They are the perfect combination of relaxation and challenge that just seems to fire off all the right neurons for me. But it wasn't until fairly recently that I got really into collecting puzzles. Because of this job, I spend a surprising amount of time browsing Amazon deals and have found that puzzles are discounted almost every month. So naturally, every time there's a big sale I end up buying at least one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise that Amazon is having a huge puzzle sale once again for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-prime-day">Prime Day</a>. This is the biggest collection of jigsaw puzzle deals I have seen all year and the discounts are very tempting. I'm doing my best to limit my spending this year, but this sale might just break me. If you're interested in picking up some cheap puzzles yourself, I've gathered some of the best options below. You can also check out all of the Prime Day puzzle sales by clicking the first link I've featured below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Puzzle Deals at Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has had a lot of different types of puzzle sales and this one is sort of mish-mash of all of them. That means that some of the options I've featured here are lightning deals, some have coupons, and some are just straight up discounts (like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theory11-jigsaw-puzzles-and-playing-cards-prime-day-2025">theory11 puzzles</a>). The last sale like this I covered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-has-stacking-discounts-on-cool-1000-piece-puzzles-today">included some complicated stacking coupons</a>, but thankfully none of that is necessary this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">best puzzle brands</a> are included here, including popular Ravensburger puzzles. You can usually judge the quality of the puzzle by both the brand and the price, so some of the cheaper options I've listed here might not be as nice as the puzzles that cost $15 or more. The extra amount you pay is really just for the extra thickness of the cardboard used so you don't get any really flimsy pieces.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What's the best piece count for jigsaw puzzles?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're new to the puzzle game, you may be wondering what size puzzle you should get. Most jigsaw puzzles that are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">targeted at adults</a> or teens can range anywhere between 300 and 5,000 pieces. There are some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">much larger puzzles</a> that go way beyond that, but unless you're looking for a massive challenge, I'd suggest you stick in the 300 to 1,000 piece range. One of the most common piece counts for adults is 1,000 pieces, but a 500-piece puzzle can be just as fun to put together with half the pieces. Deciding which puzzle size is right for you is more about how much time and space you have to actually put it together.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Consider a Puzzle Table or Board</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're serious about puzzling like me, I'd suggest also looking into picking up a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-tables">decent puzzle table or board</a>. Having a dedicated space to put your puzzles together will save you a lot of stress. I have a dedicated puzzle area in my home office right now and I'm able to leave it and come back to it easily without worrying about pieces disappearing or taking up the entire dining room table for weeks at a time. Jigsaw puzzling should not be a stressful activity and being able to dedicate a space or pack it up when you aren't actively puzzling can help maintain that level of leisure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Day has a lot of deals on puzzle tables, boards, and storage accessories right now. If you're interested in picking something up for yourself, here are some of my top recommendations. All of these make for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">great gifts for any puzzler</a> in your life as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Board Games Are Also on Sale Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to all of the puzzle deals, it's also worth noting that there are some pretty incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals-prime-day-2025">board game deals for Prime Day</a> this year. Here are some of our top picks below:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jacob Kienlen is a Senior SEO Strategist and Writer for IGN.
