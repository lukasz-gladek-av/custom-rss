            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The newest PlayStation hardware is acoustic.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The PlayStation store is selling guitars now. If you're a fan of Naughty Dog's Last of Us series, either the games or the TV show, you can now preorder a replica of Ellie's guitar that Joel customized with the custom moth inlay fretboard. This guitar was first featured in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us Part II</a> and made an appearance in the second season of the HBO series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The guitar is a collaboration with Taylor Guitars and is a special edition of the Taylor 314ce. You can preorder it for $2,999.99 at the PlayStation Store and it will officially release on November 18, 2025. It's listed in the PlayStation store's hardware section among various consoles, controllers, and other accessories.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Taylor 314ce The Last of Us Part II Replica Guitar</h2><div catalogid="09a8041f-5e7d-4130-8508-ecf1bff3e86c" id="227110"><div id="227110" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Taylor 314ce The Last of Us Part II Replica Guitar</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The PlayStaton Store bundle includes a strap and replica case.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The guitar has distinctive rich tobacco sunburst top in Sitka spruce pulled straight from the game and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-spoiler-free">latest season of the TV show</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you think that $3,000 is a ridiculous amount of money to pay for a guitar, it's actually not <em>that</em> terribly priced, especially for a nice acoustic guitar. The standard Taylor 314ce costs around $2,499 on its own without the Last of Us details included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that Taylor is selling a <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjp1Ee?object_uuid=94cc8cdf-4912-495a-b122-00a9bf6fb1f1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">slightly cheaper version of this replica</a> directly from its website. It's a Taylor 314c (rather than a 314ce) and it's priced at $2,799 without the bundled accessories.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What's next for The Last of Us?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This replica guitar is the latest piece of merch inspired by the popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-naughty-dog-games-in-order">Naughty Dog game</a> and likely won't be the last. But what about new games and episodes of the show? Game-wise, The Last of Us Part 3 has yet to be officially confirmed and it seems unlikely that it ever will be. Creator Neil Druckman has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">during an interview</a> to not "bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the TV series, HBO CEO Casey Bloys <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-planned-for-2027-and-could-be-the-series-end-hbo-boss-says">confirmed</a> that Season 3 of the show is definitely planned to arrive in 2027. He also said that this season will potentially be the last run of episodes.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 19, 2025 10:30 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-opens-preorders-for-a-replica-of-the-guitar-from-the-last-of-us-part-ii]]></content:encoded>

Kennedy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As expected, today's show brought with it a deeper dive into Capcom's hotly-anticipated upcoming survival horror (which is also playable here at Gamescom). Footage once again showed the game's new star Grace Ashcroft in action, though fans were left wondering about Leon's whereabouts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a phone call from unknown voice, Grace Ashcroft and her mom Alyssa attempt to escape from the hotel in which they had been staying, as the power is cut and the pair are attacked. We already know what happens next, as Grace is seen investigating the hotel years later, as an FBI analyst.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom previously promised that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">Requiem will feature a return to the series' "overarching narrative"</a> begun 30 years ago, after more recent games such as Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village focused on events set elsewhere, with fewer connections to past titles.

He wouldn't jump at a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he's actually quite a bad match for horror."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fans took this comment to mean that Leon was still in the game somewhere, likely in sequences that offered more action-orientated gameplay, as while stating the character wouldn't be suitable for horror sections, Nakanishi notably stopped short of ruling the character out altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty of time still until Resident Evil Requiem eventually launches, on February 27, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <title><![CDATA[Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 - We FINALLY Played It]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-we-finally-played-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-the-masquerade-%E2%80%93-bloodlines-2-we-finally-played-it.1275036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It was almost surreal awakening as an ancient monster in Vampire: the Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 and getting my first taste of blood. Phyre the Nomad, a semi-customizable character with a fixed backstory, has been asleep for 100 years when she wakes up in modern Seattle – and I feel like I've been thinking about this game almost as long. From its announcement in 2019 through multiple delays, development woes, a sort-of soft cancellation, and an almost complete reboot under The Chinese Room, finally playing it allowed me to start to answer my big question: was it worth waking up from an eternal slumber for? So far, I'm cautiously optimistic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First things first: The Chinese Room is not the studio I would have drafted to make a sequel to one of the most beloved cult hit RPGs of the early 2000s. They made a name for themselves with what are sometimes disparagingly called "walking simulators" and linear first-person horror games like Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and Still Wakes the Deep. But this is genuinely a free-roaming open-world spectacle, albeit on a modest-sized map, once you get out onto the city streets. It's not just smoke and mirrors.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Vampire: The Masquerade -- Bloodlines 2 Screenshots [2024 Update]</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was impressed with the level of freedom my vampire had to climb up utility ducts and fire escapes, leap from rooftop to rooftop, glide down moody alleyways, and of course engage in the time-honored vampire tradition of dropping a very long way without taking any fall damage. It's not safe to do all of these things in front of Seattle's many mortal citizens, though, as it will start to fill up a Masquerade meter that can result in a game over if you hang around or leave too many witnesses.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Humans can't be allowed to know that vampires exist.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I found that system to be a bit too forgiving in the demo – you can chow down on someone in the middle of the street and as long as you run away fast enough, you’ll suffer no consequences – but it's nice to see a nod to one of the setting's most fundamental rules: humans can't be allowed to know that vampires exist.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>THIS BITES</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Dropping in for a nice, sticky hemoglobin smoothie has two main purposes in Bloodlines 2: humans serve as mobile healing potions and recharge your vampiric disciplines – special abilities tied to each vampiric clan. This isn't really a survival game in the sense that your bloodthirst won't naturally increase over time. But I felt like I needed to feed often enough that it never became something I could ignore, which is good.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's an interesting blood resonance system in which characters feeling a certain emotion – fear, anger, or lust – can be encouraged to indulge in it depending on your clan, which gives you currency for unlocking certain disciplines when you feed on them in that elevated state. As a Toreador, I loved seducing someone into a dark alley before taking a bite, and it creates a feeling that your vampire has a favored type of mortal to prey on. You can also feed in combat on enemies that are near death, which is a bit on the forgiving side due to how fast it is. I didn't feel like I was putting myself at serious risk by pausing for a snack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The combat is probably the weak link here, at least from the handful of hours I've been able to play. I'll allow for the possibility that I just haven't gotten the hang of it yet. But I ran through the whole thing as a blood mage Tremere, a brawling Brujah, and a seductive Toreador – that last one, along with the Lasombra, being part of a day-one DLC that comes with the Premium Edition. And in each case it felt like melee combat in particular was a bit imprecise and chaotic. I tried it out with mouse and keyboard as well as a controller, and the latter was definitely better. But I found myself really wishing for more of a "hard" lock-on. It's also a little disappointing that you can only use weapons, including guns, by way of telekinesis. I get that Phyre is older than modern firearms, but being a vampire with sweet-ass dual pistols is an iconic vibe that just isn't featured in Bloodlines 2. Kate Beckinsale would weep.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In fairness, combat was by far the weakest part of the original Bloodlines, so I won't hold that against it too much. Things do start to pick up as you unlock more disciplines, with your core clan line being the cheapest in terms of skill points, and cross-clan disciplines with a keyword like Celerity that your clan specializes in getting a moderate discount. But there's nothing stopping you from learning any discipline you want other than out-of-clan, non-affinity disciplines being very expensive.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As a Tremere, I could lure enemies into a group by boiling a target's blood, placing a curse on him to turn him into a volatile blood bomb, then hitting him with a telekinetically-thrown bottle to make him explode and take out an entire room at once.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Tremere, I could lure enemies into a group by boiling a target's blood, placing a curse on him to turn him into a volatile blood bomb, then hitting him with a telekinetically-thrown bottle to make him explode and take out an entire room at once. This is absolutely sick nasty amazing the first couple times, but it does get a little repetitive. It feels more like a gimmick than a playstyle. The Brujah and the Toreador are a bit more like traditional melee fighters, which I ended up vibing with better in the long run. Toreadors also get a neat blink ability, and the power to temporarily turn an enemy to your side with a kiss.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>WORLD OF DARKNESS</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Where The Chinese Room has always excelled, though, is in atmosphere, and there's no exception here. Neon-lit alleys, spooky warehouses, and decadent hotel suites are dripping with small details. I really applaud the way the reticle changes when exploring as well, letting you know there are undiscovered secrets nearby without simply telling you where they are. That way, searching the dark corners is still a fun challenge, but I can also satisfy my inner obsessive completionist that when the circle turns back into a dot, I've found everything there is to find.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story is compelling and filled with memorable characters, as well as top-notch voice acting for the main cast. We don't know at the start why Phyre has suddenly been awakened or what's up with the mysterious symbol on her hand limiting her powers. But the Prince of Seattle has recently been assassinated, there's a loose canon vampire Sheriff ripping out spines, and, oh yeah, a Malkavian police detective living inside our head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fabien, who is every part the hard-boiled film noir hero until you notice the fangs, somehow ended up sharing Phyre's brain meat. Certain flashback sequences are played from his perspective, technically making Malkavian the final playable clan. So far, these segments don't include combat. All of his disciplines are geared toward solving mysteries, like the ability to compel someone to tell him what they're leaving out of their testimony. I found him to be an interesting change-of-pace.I didn't really know what to expect from Bloodlines 2 given the long, shadowed path it took to finally rest in my undead talons. But leading with a well-written and well-voiced mystery story that lets me explore my urban hunting ground with cool movement abilities has me intrigued to say the least. I don't love the combat so far, and the Masquerade system seems a bit too forgiving. But I'm thirsty to spend more time with it. It's a very different sort of game from the original, but I dare to hope it may be something genuinely special. Vampire: the Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 will be released to stalk the night on October 21.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-we-finally-played-it]]></content:encoded>
