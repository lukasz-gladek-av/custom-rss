In fact, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe sold almost as many copies as the brand new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> so far this financial year, and more than either <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door">Pario Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/luigis-mansion-2-hd">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/05/screenshot-2024-11-05-110303-1730808759816.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to sell incredibly well. Image credit: Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is comfortably the best-selling Nintendo Switch game, ahead of Animal Crossing: New Horizons (46.45 million) in second place. And its enduring popularity is easy to understand; not only is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe superb in its own right, but it’s an almost essential buy for any new Switch owner looking for a fun game to play with family and friends pretty much out of the box. Speaking of which, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe looks set to continue to sell well with Nintendo pushing the Switch ahead of the crucial holiday sales period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, will Nintendo release a sequel, presumably Mario Kart 9, for the upcoming Switch 2, or continue Mario Kart 8 Deluxe’s dominance via backwards compatibility and a beefy next-gen update?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has so far kept its cards close to its chest when it comes to Switch 2 information. All it’s said on the record is that an announcement will be made at some point during this financial year, which ends March 2025. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analysts-say-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-now-unlikely-before-end-of-2024">Analysts are now saying it's unlikely Nintendo will announce Switch 2 this year</a>. A release for the console itself looks set for the next financial year, meaning April 2025 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-begin-a-new-modern-day-story-after-the-series-post-desmond-blues<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will lay the foundation for a new modern day story after years of Ubisoft struggling to match the interest in Desmond's storyline from the original Assassin's Creed games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marc-Alexis Coté, Ubisoft's vice president executive producer of Assassin's Creed, said at a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) event attended by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> that Ubisoft has "struggled to find its footing" with the modern day aspect of Assassin's Creed in recent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Desmond's journey was at the heart of the modern day conflict driving the search for powerful Isu artefacts, Pieces of Eden, that could change the course of history," Coté said. "However, with his death at the end of Assassin's Creed 3, we faced a creative crossroads. Ending Desmond's arc was a difficult decision, and afterward, the modern storyline struggled to find its footing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed 3 arrived in 2012, however, so Coté had admitted the franchise has struggled to find a strong modern day story in more than a decade. This has certainly been a point of frustration for fans over the years, some of whom have complained the modern day storyline has no real direction and only detracts from the main game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mainline Assassin's Creed Games in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed Shadows looks to return some direction to the franchise though. "As we move forward, our goal is to put history back at the centre of the players' experience," Coté said. "The modern day narrative will serve to enhance, rather than overshadow, the historical journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"By drawing meaningful contrast between past and present, we aim to restore the balance that was once the hallmark of the franchise. The modern day storyline will explore deeper themes of memory, identity and autonomy, how the past shapes who we are, and how controlling this past can impact our future. These themes will allow us to reflect on contemporary issues: freedom versus control, the power of knowledge and the tension between individuality and conformity, all through the lens of history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will lay the foundation for this narrative evolution that will grow in the years to come."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will likely be welcome news for fans and is perhaps the first bit of positivity to emerge around Shadows in a while. Issues began as some fans expressed frustration with inaccuracies in the game's depiction of Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">leading the development team to issue an apology</a> and say the game is not intended to be a factual representation of history but instead "a compelling, historical fiction." This despite art director Thierry Dansereau telling IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Ubisoft looked to make Shadows as "authentic as possible to match historical events"</a> just two months prior.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Concern was also raised when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission. Ubisoft apologized for doing so but refused to remove the artwork from the aforementioned and presumably already printed artbook available in the Collector's Edition. The historical re-enactment group said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says">this was not good enough</a>, but Ubisoft hasn't publicly acknowledged it since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes as fans are already frustrated by the delay to the game, which puts Assassin's Creed Shadows in more direct competition with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">PlayStation's Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei</a>. This is also expected in 2025 and is another open-world action adventure game set in Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained confidence</a>, however. "There's a lot of space for very high-quality games, and those two games can sell very well," he said in the company's latest earnings call. "The focus is to really make sure that we deliver a fantastic experience with this dual protagonist approach and two different and complimentary gameplays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassins Creed Shadows indeed features two protagonists, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-brings-back-double-assassinations">stealthy assassin Naoe</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained">savage samurai Yasuke</a>. The game's story will weave between the two but players can otherwise switch between them at will as they explore Ubisoft's open-world take on Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

The three remaining cards include alternative art versions of Pikachu, Butterfree, and Clefairy, and all five cards come stamped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players must persevere through some random chance encounters before they can pick up all five cards. The Lapras event introduces Chance Rewards, essentially giving players more incentive to repeat battles again and again, as these can drop after each win against a Lapras deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players then have just a one-in-five chance of pulling the Lapras ex in the booster pack, though those looking to collect 'em all will be eager to pick up all five cards anyway. Grinding through the Lapras decks will be necessary to do so, but the Auto Battle feature is still available to speed things up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lapras ex itself is a Basic Pokémon with 140 hit points and an 80 damage attack at the cost of three energy: two water and one colorless. This Bubble Drain attack heals 20 damage from Lapras ex too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October as a streamlined, digital version of the beloved trading card game. It lets players open packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collect cards</a>, build decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battle others</a>, a simple formula that has already proved popular given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">it made $12 million in just four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
