            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-showa-american-story-gets-dramatic-new-trailer-release-window<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been close to three years since the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/showa-american-story-wild-sexy-chinese-depiction-america-showa-66-interview">January 2022 reveal of Showa American Story</a>, whose B-movie style trailer depicting 1980s America as a colony of Japan became a viral hit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Updates have been few and far between since then, but IGN can now exclusively reveal a new trailer along with a 2025 release window on PlayStation 5 and PC (Steam). The game genre is described as an “end of the century romantic RPG fantasy ensemble period drama”.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The dramatic trailer introduces new boss character named Shogun, a tough-looking villain who holds a shield like Captain America, a fluttering cape, and floats like Superman against the sunset. Elsewhere in the video, we see Shogun riding on the back of a pitch-black giraffe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative Director XY.Luo told IGN, “Shogun is a boss character who stands 6 meters tall. He uses the giraffe’s long neck to strike, and he can also fly, throwing his shield to attack the player.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luo explained that the battle against such an oversized enemy who rides on the back of an even taller beast will create an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for">epic scale reminiscent of Monster Hunter</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/31/shogun-1730411017501.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Meet Shogun, one of Showa American Story's major villains. Image source: Showa American Story. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Showa American Story is a road movie-style action RPG in which you cross America in a camper van and motorcycle, and the trailer shows a wealth of locations to visit. We see San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge decorated with Japanese lanterns, Las Vegas awash with neon signs in kanji, the Hollywood sign replaced with “Neo Yokohama”, and the newly christened Neo Tokyo-4 (Austin, Texas) awash with cherry blossoms. A man commits seppuku before Mount Rushmore. America is irresistibly dyed in the colors of Japan’s Showa era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Protagonist Chouko Chigusa fights her way across America, fighting zombies and strange humanoid creatures with a variety of brutal combat options. In addition to her primary weapons of swords and guns, we see Chouko fight with a giant drill. Luo told us that Chouko’s arsenal will grow throughout her adventure, with a wide variety available. The trailer also shows a wealth of customization elements and minigames inside the camper van. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Showa American Story - Exclusive Art and Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story is still shrouded in mystery, but there’s no doubt it has a strong cast of characters. In August, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-meet-showa-american-storys-new-boss-character-texan-samurai-cowboy-gokou"><u>IGN exclusively revealed boss character Gokou</u></a>, the Texan governor turned cowboy-samurai who sold his state to Japan. And with the new trailer showing Chouko Chigusa stomping on enemies with her high heels and putting zombie heads with a golf club, our interest is piqued for further updates as Showa American Story’s 2025 release approaches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/NoMoreDaniels" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Daniel Robson</em></u></a><em> is Chief Editor of IGN Japan, and </em><a href="https://x.com/rined1987" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Esra Krabbe</u></a><em> is a member of the editorial team.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It sits one spot ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which continues to enjoy ongoing success thanks to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-download-more-than-50-million-mods-including-10000-that-rename-withers-bone-daddy">introduction of mods</a> and other new features. EA previous high watermark was Jedi Survivor, which managed an all-time peak of 67,855.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA CEO Andrew Wilson predicted success for Dragon Age during Tuesday's earnings call, saying that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-boss-says-bioware-has-returned-to-its-strengths-with-dragon-age-predicts-breakout-potential-thanks-in-part-to-limited-competition">BioWare had "returned to its strengths,"</a> and that it would be benefit from limited competition thanks to Ubisoft's decision to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">delay Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We wrote in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">our own review</a>, "Dragon Age: The Veilguard refreshes and reinvigorates a storied series that stumbled through its middle years, and leaves no doubt that it deserves its place in the RPG pantheon. The next Mass Effect is going to have a very tough act to follow, which is not something I ever imagined I'd be saying before I got swept away on this adventure."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN BioWare Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall it's a solid start for BioWare's new RPG given that it launched on a day when most of its fans are either at work or in school. It'll be worth keeping an eye on its performance heading into its first full weekend as players properly dig into the first new Dragon Age release since 2014.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dragon-age-the-veilguard/Major_Choices_and_Consequences">guide to Dragon Age: The Veilguard's major choices and consequences</a> as well as our romance guide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-drops-steam-deck-support-over-rampant-cheating<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Respawn Entertainment are making a change to Apex Legends that will no longer allow players to access the game via Linux OS, including Steam Deck using Linux.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers announced the shift away from Linux support in <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on its website</u></a>. Although it’s a move that will no doubt surprise those affected, EA says dropping support for the OS option is part of the company’s wider initiative to maintain “competitive integrity” and fight off cheaters.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/01/apexlegendshockwavegameplaytrailer-ign-blogroll-1722525419976.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Apex Legends losing Linux support as EA continues fight against cheaters.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we've identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats,” the post says. “As a result, we've decided to block Linux OS access to the game. While this will impact a small number of Apex players, we believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA calls Linux an “attractive” OS for those looking to cheat for a variety of reasons. The thought process behind the decision involved weighing the number of legitimate Linux players against the impact the growing number of cheaters has had on the average Apex Legend fan. While it’s unclear exactly how many players utilize Linux when playing Apex Legends, EA and Respawn say it’s a tradeoff they are willing to make.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This means that Apex Legends will be unplayable immediately for those running this operating system.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason the team says it’ll be ending support for Steam Deck, which uses Linux by default, is that there is “currently no reliable way for us to differentiate a legitimate Steam Deck from a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck (via Linux).” However, if handheld users <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/steam-deck/How_to_Install_Windows_10_on_a_Steam_Deck">manage to install and use Windows on Steam Deck</a> instead, they’ll be able to continue playing on the device. So, while the developers continue to crack down on cheaters plaguing the long-running battle royale game, all Linux users will no longer be able to enjoy the experience at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To eliminate this cheat vector, we have made the decision to prevent access to the game for Linux users,” EA continues. “This means that Apex Legends will be unplayable immediately for those running this operating system.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Apex Legends brought the Titanfall universe into the free-to-play battle royale world in 2019. We gave it a 9/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-review-2"><u>our review</u></a>, saying that the experience’s “mix of exciting characters, excellent gunplay, and unmatched FPS movement keep it a consistently fresh thrill.” Although fans took the first-person shooter’s gameplay upon launch, it’s not been without its struggles. Respawn announced that it would <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-battle-pass-changes-met-with-anger-confusion-from-fans"><u>make alterations to its Battle Pass model</u></a> in July of this year but quickly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-announces-changes-to-apex-legends-battle-pass-after-community-outcry"><u>reverted many changes</u></a> after widespread outcry from fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/apex-legends-official-shockwave-dev-update-video"><u>Apex Legends Season 22</u></a>, titled Shockwave, is currently wrapping up, with Season 23 set to soon continue a long run of seasonal updates.
