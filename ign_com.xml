            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The latest Secret Lair sold the same drop at different prices, drawing anger from the community.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning Wizards of the Coast put a new Magic: The Gathering product up for sale with an unexpected twist. The <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/chaosvault" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“Prints Charming” Secret Lair drop</u></a> contains four reprinted cards with pretty excellent new art – but rather than simply telling us how much it costs, it was given five different non-foil store listings and five more for the foil version, each with a different price ranging from $10 all the way up to $50. The product description on all of them is careful to point out the following: “The only difference between listings is the price. Higher-priced listings do not include anything extra.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, by my estimation as someone who has been playing Magic since the 90s and literally wrote <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/25/magic-the-gathering-reveals-new-secret-lair-drop-series-with-wild-art"><u>the announcement for the very first Secret Lair</u></a>, is pretty lame. Taken graciously, it’s a goofy marketing stunt meant to do something silly and get folk talking about it, but it nevertheless leaves those who arrived too late with a very sour taste in their mouth. A more pessimistic reading would be that WOTC is price testing what people are willing to pay for a Secret Lair drop in broad daylight, shedding even the thinnest veneer that may be hiding the capitalist hunger <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lawsuit-claims-hasbro-misled-investors-regarding-sales-of-controversial-magic-the-gathering-anniversary-set"><u>a lawsuit recently alleged</u></a> is designed specifically to hide shortfalls in other parts of Hasbro’s business. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - "Prints Charming" Secret Lair Drop</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1qu0vyc/sld_chaos_vault_prints_charming/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The reaction</u></a> amongst the Magic community has been muddled. Some were confused. Some very generously assumed the higher price points were to bait automated scalper bots into spending more while real people could snag a more affordable version – an argument that doesn’t exactly hold water when you consider that <em>they could just make them all cheaper </em>if that was the desire. And some were just angry, either because the cheapest versions sold out so fast, or because they similarly see this as bold-faced market research in cardboard form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I actually really love the idea of Wizards of the Coast’s Secret Lair line overall. Directly selling small drops of thematically linked cards with cool and unique art treatments is quite fun, and often comes at little-to-no cost for those who just want to ignore it. Being able to give <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-secret-lair-superdrop-brings-the-last-of-us-god-of-war-and-more-to-magic-the-gathering-in-october"><u>Kratos or Aloy their own cards</u></a> without the production lift a larger product would require is a neat tool in WOTC’s toolbelt. The “Chaos Vault” moniker this latest one was released under intentionally pushes the envelope even further with weird, off-schedule ideas and one-offs that are explicitly meant to experiment. I dig that! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that does not mean Secret Lair is free from criticism. Most pressing here, folk (myself included) were already displeased by WOTC’s 2024 decision to move these drops from a “print to demand” model to one with limited and undisclosed quantities. The former system meant anyone who wanted a certain drop could get it within a specific timeframe, while the latter has historically meant you need to get in line <em>right </em>when a popular drop arrives in order to have a <em>chance </em>at purchasing it – something you can’t do if you, say, have work or school at the same time.</p><p>Regardless of intent, the result is a majority of players feeling like they were the ones left holding the bag.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, given there is already anxiety around the availability of Secret Lairs, one that got almost no pre-promotion offering an early bird discount (alongside the option to pay WOTC <em>more</em> money) is understandably frustrating. It’s the sort of thing that independent creators admittedly do with their products from time to time without drawing any ire, rewarding their most dedicated fans while also providing a way to support them even further for those who want to. But for a multibillion-dollar corporation to do it is not endearing in the same way – it comes across more like profit analysis wearing a sign around its neck that reads “it’s just a prank, bro.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much to my dismay, both the lowest <em>and</em> highest priced versions of Prints Charming sold out the quickest, either lending some credence to the “ha ha stupid bots” theory or offering evidence that “speaking with your wallet” is and will always be a doomed suggestion. The standard Secret Lair pricing of $30 for non-foil and $40 for foil lasted much longer than the others, so it seems likely the “stock” for those versions was intentionally the largest of all the options. But even if that does make this one big stunt, or even a cute way to subsidize a few discounted drops through folk who are willing to spend a little more, the ultimate result is still that a majority of players feel like they are the ones left holding the proverbial bag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t know, maybe I am yelling at the clouds. The card-selling company is experimenting with how much money it can sell its cards for. This should not be a shock, nor am I surprised to see Prints Charming sell out within hours (the art is really excellent, even if its total reprint value of around $5 is not). But the quiet part is being said louder than usual here. The teacher has handed us a test, and I fear what the results will be. The theme of this drop is cards that speed up your green resource production, and if that’s not as on the nose as naming your giant evil space station the Death Star, I don’t know what is.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Associate Reviews Director and local MTG Cube obssessive.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> fans are on the edge of their seats as rumors and leaks seem to suggest a potential Chappell Roan crossover coming to Fortnite in February.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Femininomenon of the pop music world has been the talk of the Fortnite community since cosmetics related to some of her most iconic songs supposedly leaked late last month. Developer Epic Games hasn’t confirmed whether Chappell Roan or her famous pink pony mascot will actually show up in-game, but fans are still expecting an announcement as soon as this week.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">CHAPPEL ROAN POTENTIALLY NEXT FESTIVAL ARTIST <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortnite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Fortnite</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ut2jTrm6Ok" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Ut2jTrm6Ok</a></p>— Leaky (@itsmeleaky) <a href="https://twitter.com/itsmeleaky/status/2014267037674013053?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 22, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">X/Twitter user @itsmeleaky seems to have been the first to kick off rumors that the Midwest Princess was next to join Epic’s roster of Festival stars, sharing images of some very Chappell Roan-looking music cosmetics and what appears to be a llama sidekick dressed up as a pink, cowboy hat-wearing pony. Players were then able to find these same items in <a href="https://x.com/realAlucar/status/2014308961957056613?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a special room in-game</a>, with some other familiar visuals, including flashy pink stars and some knight armor, adding to the pile of alleged evidence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All three items would certainly fit the occasion, especially the potential sidekick, which looks a lot like a reference to the star’s mega-hit song, Pink Pony Club. The knight armor, meanwhile, has been taken as a sign that at least one of what could be a few skins could pull from Chappell Roan’s medieval-themed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ENzV125lWc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Video Music Awards performance of Good Luck, Babe!</u></a>. She’s known for her many, many memorable looks, though, so music fans are still guessing which direction Epic could take her cosmetics should she have a substantial presence in Fortnite this month.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">👀| Fortnite appears to have begun teasing a possible collaboration with Chappell Roan <a href="https://t.co/zUMRqjXlxx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zUMRqjXlxx</a></p>— Chappell Roan Now (@ChappellRoanNow) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChappellRoanNow/status/2014734311988113832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 23, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the studio confirmed plans to launch <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2017289932310479080?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fortnite version 39.40</u></a> this week on January 30, leaving fans to look out for new content in the days ahead. Again, Epic hasn’t confirmed whether the star will show up at all, but for some, it’s not a question of if, but when and how.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chappell Roan’s status as a <a href="https://www.grammy.com/artists/chappell-roan/56864" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammy award-winning artist</a> with millions of listeners has many expecting her to headline an upcoming Festival update as its new icon. It would mean potentially multiple skins to accompany the inclusion of more of her music, though how the star’s career could be represented is unclear. It’s possible she could have a more muted presence, but with the previous icon, Lisa, set to rotate out in just a few days, fans believe it could be the perfect time for Chappell to make her proper Fortnite debut.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">FORTNITE VALENTINE'S DAY EVENT TEASER <a href="https://t.co/ew7rxBrrzg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ew7rxBrrzg</a></p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/2018022087365951661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As Chappell Roan rumors for Fortnite heat up without official confirmation, players are still looking forward to other updates for February. The game’s official account recently put out <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2018021999876984903?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>what appears to be a tease</u></a>, saying, “In February, Fortnite wears pink.” It could be more evidence that Chappell Roan is on the way, but it’s also likely referencing its upcoming Valentine’s Day plans. Another <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2018399099192848442?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>post from today</u></a> has music and movie fans looking forward to more KPop Demon Hunters content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite leapt into Chapter 7 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-draws-105-million-players-as-godzilla-king-kong-iron-man-and-kpop-demon-hunters-unite-for-avengers-endgame-style-finale">an Avengers: Endgame-style event</a> late last year.

Recently, as I was perusing Instagram, I came across a video by Daniel Powell (aka JollySaintClick), who brought to my attention the new “<a href="https://zdcs.link/aX4ZrZ?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mirrorform</u></a>” card that is part of the latest set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This card, costing four colorless and two blue mana, reads as follows: “Each nonland permanent you control becomes a copy of target non-aura permanent.” JollySaintClick pointed out how the card can get out of hand with something like Coveted Jewel, and it got me thinking: What other cards would be great to copy with Mirrorform?”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mirrorform Explained</h2><div id="234979"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234979" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mirrorform</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Before I get into the list, let’s break down a couple of important things about Mirrorform:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It doesn’t say “until the end of the turn” anywhere on the card: </strong>Your cards won’t be changing back at the end of your turn, so take care when you drop Mirrorform, and just as important, make sure your hand is set up so you aren’t leaving yourself too restricted after playing it. You don’t want to put yourself in a rough spot after getting all your copies out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Legendary cards are out (mostly): </strong>Because Mirrorform is changing all nonland permanent cards, artifacts like Mirror Box that remove the legend rule will get overwritten, so making copies of legendary cards will be tough, though not impossible. If this is the route you want to take, you will need to find a way to remove the “Legendary” aspect of the creature in question; otherwise, all but one of your copies will be destroyed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tokens are okay to copy: </strong>Nothing in the card stipulates that your target has to be a nontoken, so just make sure you are aware that if you manage to make a really cool token of something, it is just as viable as anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It’s an instant: </strong>While Mirrorform may feel like it should be a sorcery, being an instant means you can cast it outside of your turn or in response to something else. This can be a big help and a great answer to a threat on the board or when you’re the target of an attack.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Cards To Use With Mirrorform</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Giggling Skitterspike</h3></div><div id="234980"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234980" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Giggling Skitterspike</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Growing up, the spider-doll creature in the original Toy Story terrified me, and thanks to Duskmourn, that critter was turned into a nasty Magic card in the form of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqJ3N6?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Giggling Skitterspike</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turning a pool of dull random tokens or boring creatures into indestructible spider dolls that can dish out damage equal to its power to ALL opponents whenever it is targeted is especially scary. The fact that you can boost them to 6/6 with its Monstrosity 5 ability makes the Skitterspike a prime option to use with Mirrorform. Just be prepared for nightmares…</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ouroboroid</h3></div><div id="234981"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234981" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ouroboroid</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Feel like getting some +1/+1 counters? Then Mirrorform some <a href="https://zdcs.link/zE8mEM?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Ouroboroids</u></a> onto the field, and you will have more counters to hand out than you will know what to do with. Throw in a card like Doubling Season to really up those numbers, and all of these giant space plants will be swarming the battlefield in no time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your opponents may give up, so they don't have to wait for you to tally up all the counters each turn.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mother of Runes</h3></div><div id="234982"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234982" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mother of Runes</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">An army of moms that can give each other protection of whatever colors you want? Sounds good to me! As each creature can be activated separately, this means that you can save their protection and use them on a case-by-case basis, depending on what your opponents do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you manage to power up one <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YRXmr?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mother of Runes</u></a> and make it stronger, that protection will also let them hit directly at your opponents, too, circumventing their blockers altogether.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ruin Crab</h3></div><div id="234983"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234983" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ruin Crab</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, this list could have been all Landfall, but I wanted to restrain myself a bit; <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8nxq?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Ruin Crab</u></a> is just too good not to include.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are running a deck with some solid token generation, which would be preferred if you are running a copy of Mirrorform period, having a ton of Ruin Crabs on the field will make every single land you drop an immense pain for every one of your opponents, thanks to each trigger of them having to mill on each land drop.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Consuming Aberration</h3></div><div id="234984"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234984" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Consuming Aberration</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My friends and I still can't believe that <a href="https://zdcs.link/91wKn3?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Consuming Aberation</u></a> isn't a legendary, but seeing as it matches a color with Mirrorform, this is one of the easiest recommendations on this list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to Ruin Crab, as it deals with Mill, an army of this horror will not only terrify your opponents from a mill risk, but the massive amount of power and toughness they will all have, due to their strength coming from the number of cards in your opponents' graveyards. Every little spell you cast will spell terror for your enemies.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Battletide Alchemist</h3></div><div id="234985"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234985" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Battletide Alchemist</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Who needs blockers when you can just prevent all the damage that you get hit with? The <a href="https://zdcs.link/ae8nq1?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Battletide Alchemist</u></a> Kithkin Cleric has a compounding ability, as each card will be able to prevent more damage on its own from each copy Mirrorform creates, while also multiplying prevention by the number of copies you have.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you only have 5 copies after Mirrorform resolves, that will still mean that each <em>source</em> (not total damage) will need to exceed 25 damage to deal any damage to you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Miirym, Sentinel Wyrm</h3></div><div id="234986"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234986" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Miirym, Sentinel Wyrm</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, before you go into the comments to explain to me how the Legend rule works and how all but a single copy would be destroyed, let me stop you and tell you that yes, you are right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But we aren't using Mirrorform on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yPZrn?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Miirym</u></a>; we are using it on a token of Miirym that it itself creates. A token, mind you, that specifically reads (thanks to Miirym's ability) "Except the Token isn’t legendary", and as I specifically pointed out earlier, Mirrorform doesn't stipulate your target has to be nontoken.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yes, there is a bit of a setup that you will need to do to get this to work, but once you have that non-legendary token out, having multiple copies of each dragon you cast is just far too tempting a proposition to deny. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Roil Elemental</h3></div><div id="234987"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234987" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Roil Elemental</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qb8Yko?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Roil Elemental</u></a> is another one of those fun Landfall trigger cards that will be great fun to have a ton of copies, but whereas Ruin Crab caused your foes to mill, Roil Elemental instead lets you steal their creatures instead for each land you drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upkeep of keeping track of which copy stole which cards might be annoying, but that delightful feeling of taking that annoying creature of your friends from them will more than make up for it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Admonition Angel</h3></div><div id="234988"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234988" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Admonition Angel</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A bit like Roil Elemental, since it allows you to mess with the board states of your opponents, <a href="https://zdcs.link/znBbwj?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Admonition Angel</u></a> has a nasty landfall trigger that allows you to exile any other nonland permanent for as long as the angel remains on the battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having a bunch of copies courtesy of Mirrorform would mean a single land allows you to wipe out boards in an instant, and if you have a way to make your permanents indestructible, protecting your copies, then you will really be putting yourself in a solid spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact that the cards exiled this way have the chance to return should the angel leave the battlefield does give your opponents hope that things can turn around -  hope that you can dash with that next land you play.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Relentless Rats</h3></div><div id="234989"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234989" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Relentless Rats</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Whereas Battletide Alchemist had a compounding effect that prevents damage, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpBKng?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Relentless Rats</u></a> is a sort of antithesis. Each copy of rats that your Mirrorform makes will empower every other copy that is made, leaving you with a swarm of cute little murderous creatures to sic on your opponents. It's simple, yet effective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With tens of thousands of cards in the Magic: The Gathering library, there are hundreds, if not thousands, more cards that would be great options to use with Mirrorform.

It’s early confirmation for this year’s show, securing its spot at Peacock Theater in Los Angeles nine months before viewers tune into what Keighley has previously referred to as “<a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/804027837216739329?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming’s biggest night</a>.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/2018346170121146678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 2, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Gaming fans often spend the months leading up to the award show predicting which titles will take home awards for major categories like Game of the Year, Best Narrative, Best Game Direction, and Best Performance. At just one month into 2026, you’d think there would be no reasonable predictions as far as the winners (and losers) go for this year’s Game Awards, but fans already have one game on their minds: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>Grand Theft Auto 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar Games has a history of big wins at shows like these (Red Dead Redemption 2 had the most awards at The Game Awards 2018), so the long-in-development sixth mainline GTA game is on everyone’s radar. Other highly anticipated titles, like Resident Evil Requiem, Saros, Fable, and Control Resonant have some expecting steep competition, especially when it comes to the Game of the Year award, but there are a few other issues to consider, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any other industry award show, The Game Awards has a cutoff date a few weeks before the event itself, keeping some games from being competing despite being released in the year the show is held. For The Game Awards 2025, the cutoff date was November 21, 2025, at 9 p.m. PT / 12 a.m. ET. GTA 6 has a release date of November 19, 2026 – and that’s if it can dodge <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026"><u>yet another delay</u></a>. Meanwhile, with so much time left in the year, there’s a high likelihood at some of the year’s best game may not have even been announced yet.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">“And the most anticipated game award in 2026 goes to GTA 6” <a href="https://t.co/CoHBHJtN1W" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/CoHBHJtN1W</a> <a href="https://t.co/GMslOQ90d8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GMslOQ90d8</a></p>— GTA 6 Countdown ⏳ (@GTAVI_Countdown) <a href="https://twitter.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/2018356216045482318?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 2, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s announcement arrives less than two months after Keighley hosted The Game Awards 2025 on December 11. The show brought <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced"><u>a number of bombshell announcements and reveals</u></a>, including Divinity, a first look at Leon S.
