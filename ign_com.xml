That’s because the word Paladin was found in the name of a build uploaded to Blizzard’s servers (2.5.Xpaladin67961).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Paladin is one of the most popular classes from Diablo 2, so its arrival in Diablo 4, should it happen, would be celebrated by the game's community. Now, this may be <em>nothing</em> (and Diablo 4 fans are already joking that the Paladin will be added as a Mercenary rather than a new class), but a new class is expected from Diablo 4’s second expansion, and the Paladin would certainly be a crowd-pleaser.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Blizzard confirmed earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-next-expansion-after-vessel-of-hatred-wont-come-until-2026">Diablo 4’s next expansion was pushed out of 2025 and into 2026</a>. The game’s first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, added the Spiritborn class. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-blizzard-tells-ign-whats-coming-to-diablo-4-in-2025-and-2026-including-new-expansion-new-ranking-system-and-finally-leaderboards">A Diablo 4 roadmap image</a> teased a new ranking system, leaderboards, and more alongside the expansion for 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo 4 hit the headlines last week after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rod-fergusson-departs-blizzard-diablo-franchise?_gl=1*v7k1i8*_up*MQ..*_ga*NTc3MTg0MzczLjE3NTUyNTAxMTg.*_ga_BBZCZLHBF6*czE3NTUyNTAxMTkkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTUyNTAxMTkkajYwJGwwJGgw">development chief Rod Fergusson announced his exit from Blizzard</a>. "After five years of driving the Diablo franchise forward with four big launches, it's time for me to step away from Blizzard/Microsoft, sword in hand, and see what's next," Fergusson wrote. "The teams are set up for success, with an exciting slate of releases ahead. I'm incredibly proud of what we've built together and looking forward to what comes next for Diablo, and for me."</p><div id="diablo-iv-classes-tier-list-overall-rating" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Diablo IV Classes Tier List - Overall Rating</h3><h3>Diablo IV Classes Tier List - Overall Rating</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-team-votes-to-unionize">Blizzard's Story and Franchise Development team (SFD) voted in favor of unionization with the Communications Workers of America</a>. “After more than a decade working at Blizzard, I’ve seen all the highs and lows," said organizing committee member and principal editor Bucky Fisk. "For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability’s been fading. With a union, we’re able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald's has announced fresh restrictions aimed at combating scalpers, as it launches the next wave of its enormously popular Pokémon promotion in Japan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last weekend, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mcdonalds-pokmon-card-giveaway-ends-early-amid-restaurant-chaos-scalping-and-widespread-food-waste-as-fans-buy-dozens-of-happy-meals-only-to-dump-uneaten-burgers">fast food chain was swamped by scalpers who bought up dozens of Happy Meals just for the exclusive Pokémon cards within them</a>. Photos and videos posted to social media by outraged fans highlighted arguments among patrons over the scalping, and showed examples of huge food wastage, with the Happy Meals dumped by the side of the road or left in the restaurant uneaten. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The incident meant McDonald's ran out of its cards within hours of its three-day promotion going live, forcing the burger brand to apologise to Pokémon fans left empty-handed. And now, McDonald's has gone further — with new rules regarding the availability of Pokémon merchandise in Happy Meals applied from today.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We deeply apologize to our customers who regularly use McDonald's restaurants, as well as to our store staff and many others for any inconvenience caused by the Happy Set Pokémon Card Campaign," McDonald's wrote in a new <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0814a/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> released this morning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will continue to release the Pokémon Happy Meals, which include five different toys, as scheduled from Friday, August 15. However, in light of the current situation, we will be implementing the following purchase restrictions for three days until Sunday, August 17th."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These restrictions include a maximum purchase of three Happy Meals per group (this was previously higher, and per person). "If you order four or more," McDonald's now says, "we will refuse your purchase and cancel the order."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Furthermore, during this period, there may be restrictions on use at some stores and during certain hours," the chain continued. "We will not allow purchases from customers who do not follow the above rules and etiquette."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest difference with the coming weekend's promotion, however, is that it no longer features Pokémon cards at all — just Pokémon toys. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/untitled-1-1754903573029.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A Pokémon fan shows a collection of Happy Meal card packs, while food lies unopened and dumped. Image credit: daihonyaku/daiyamoto69.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On scalping specifically, McDonald's said it "does not tolerate the purchase of Happy Meals for the purpose of resale, or the abandonment or disposal of food," in a direct response to the activities of some customers last weekend. However, it's unclear how the chain can and will be able to enforce this. Still, what's obvious is the brand has taken note of the social media outrage — and the disappointment among young Pokémon fans and families at not being able to get cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to customers who look forward to dining with their children, grandchildren, or friends due to these purchase restrictions," McDonald's concluded. "We will continue to review and improve these sales methods and measures, listening to the opinions of our customers and store staff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Pokémon news, last week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-updated-with-new-card-art-following-ho-oh-plagiarism-controversy">The Pokémon Company replaced the art for its Lugia and Ho-Oh cards</a> which had fallen foul to claims they included fan designs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
