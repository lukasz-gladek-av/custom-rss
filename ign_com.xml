            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-overture-trailer-leaks-online-teases-imminent-shadow-drop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If what looks like a leaked trailer is anything to go by, Lies of P's upcoming DLC, Overture, could shadow-drop very soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer — which is <a href="https://x.com/Elite_Gaming_X/status/1930966673193943544" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>already making the rounds on social media</u></a> — concludes with the statement: "Available now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This trailer has leaked just hours ahead of the Summer Game Fest showcase and two days before Microsoft's Xbox Games Showcase, so perhaps we'll get an official announcement and release at one of the presentations. Summer Game Fest kicks off at 2pm PT / 5pm ET today, June 6, while Xbox Games Showcase starts at 10am PT / 1pm ET on June 8.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— EliteGamingNews (@Elite_Gaming_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/Elite_Gaming_X/status/1930966673193943544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Lies of P is a unique, darker twist on the classic story of Pinocchio, offering a challenging action game with a unique "lie" system where what you do and say dynamically affects gameplay. The upcoming new DLC — which features new locations, new enemies and bosses, new characters, and new weapons — also introduces Death March, a new mode that enables you to face off against the game's myriad of bosses all over again. In all, the DLC will take experienced players roughly 15-20 hours to complete, and will unlock once they’ve passed a “certain” chapter of the game. Neowiz has also already announced a full-blown sequel to Lies of P.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-director-explains-u-turn-on-difficulty-we-wanted-to-make-sure-a-wider-audience-could-play-the-game"><u>Overture will introduce difficulty options for the very first time</u></a>. As a "Soulslike" game, Lies of P can be punishingly difficult, especially for inexperienced players perhaps attracted by Lies of P's dark story and setting. Director Jiwon Choi had said the team <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiesOfP/comments/1kscdcj/why_did_he_change_his_mind/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>didn't think Soulslike games should have difficulty options</u></a> and it shipped without any.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neowiz changed its mind, however, following feedback from players, saying: “We wanted to make sure a wider audience of players could play the game. We have a lot of feedback from customers, and from our developers. So by making development adjustments and introducing these difficulty options, we can offer the experience to different types of players. This broadens the base.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We had a good time with Lies of P, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-review"><u>awarding it 8/10</u></a>. We said: "Lies of P might not branch out particularly far from its soulslike inspiration, but it plays the part extremely well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For all the news coming out of Summer Game Fest and <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IGN Live this weekend, we've got you covered</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Movie</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But you won't find Kelly in Mario Kart World's credits. And after fans spotted her name was not present, the actor has now confirmed her time as Peach and Toad is over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thank you for so many years of friendship and joy," Taylor wrote in a message to fans on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKj0BYwxhgj/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>. "I'm sad that it's over, I truly would have wanted to voice Peach and Toad forever. Nintendo let me know yesterday that they decided to recast these roles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm grateful that I got to do these voices for so many years. Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them. So much love &lt;3 #princesspeach #toad"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has become increasingly strict when it comes to sharing information found in the credits of its video games ahead of time — to the extent that it frequently refuses to acknowledge the developer of its games prior to their release. (This is the situation currently with the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, demos of which have already been publicly played at Switch 2 hands-on events.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kelly's situation here feels like a bizarre extension of this, where the information that she was not in the credits — because she had been replaced — was held back even from her until Mario Kart World was launched.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, it's unclear who does voice Peach and Toad in Mario Kart World, and presumably in other Mario games going forward. </p><div id="mario-kart-world-best-tracks-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mario Kart World: Best Tracks Ranked</h3><h3>Mario Kart World: Best Tracks Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eyed Nintendo fans have spotted another veteran voice actor also missing from the Mario Kart World credits: Takashi Nagasako, who has voiced Donkey Kong for 21 years, since 2004's Mario Power Tennis. In this case, fans have noted that Koji Takeda, who voiced DK in the Japanese version of the Super Mario Bros. Movie, <em>is </em>listed — suggesting that in this case, Nintendo has aligned the video game character's grunts with the Japanese voice of his big-screen counterpart. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn't the first time recently that Nintendo has replaced one of its veteran voice actors.
