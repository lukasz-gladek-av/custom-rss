Fans think that the filing, originally lodged in May this year, points to a further project due out after Nintendo's next main Mario film.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It is perhaps the most beloved intro cinematic in Warhammer 40,000 video game history, a precious relic of a bygone era that is seared into the memories of fans of Games Workshop’s grimdark setting. And woe betide anyone who dares to change it, lest the wrath of all four Chaos gods descend upon them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s how I imagine the developers at Relic Entertainment felt after releasing a high quality version of <a href="https://youtu.be/_oqr06cHAGw?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dawn of War’s iconic intro cinematic</a> to accompany the announcement of the August 14 release date of the Definitive Edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video, below, reveals the insertion of dialogue from the 2004 Dawn of War real-time strategy game into its intro cinematic, replacing some of the original audio along the way. Chief among the changes is the removal of an “iconic” (at least, for Warhammer 40,000 fans!) guttural scream bellowed by the Space Marine who leads the forces of the Blood Ravens to battle against the monstrous Orks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In its stead is the battlecry of Gabriel Angelos, Chapter Master of the Blood Ravens, as it is heard in Dawn of War gameplay. The thing is, that’s not even Gabriel Angelos screaming in the trailer. It’s a Blood Raven sergeant. And, Dawn of War fans say, the new dialogue compares poorly to the heroic scream it replaced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. Those with keen hearing and an even keener memory will notice other audio changes. The Dreadnought’s dramatic entrance is “ruined,” some say, by the addition of voice lines that distract from the heart-pumping sound of its Assault Cannon revving up and unleashing on the enemy lines. New Ork lines are inserted, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“THEY'VE RUINED IT! THEY REMOVED THE SERGEANT'S HOLY SCREAM!” declared one Emperor-living fanatic in the YouTube comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The original sound effects were PERFECT.  You didn't need to add all those voices. I'll be honest, they kind of ruined it,” said another devotee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Makes it feel less well done and not as cohesive. They just seemed so out of place and you can tell they're just shoved on top.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The new audio is awful. Really takes me out of it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Leaving the sergeant's scream out is a crime against humanity, and therefore heresy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mind fixing the cinematic by restoring the original audio? The new stuff spliced in doesn't work at all and it kinda ruins the nostalgia for us. Hopefully it can be reverted by launch,” said another, perhaps more considered worshipper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps that’s exactly what Relic will do. I asked the developer for comment on this online complaint barrage, and its response suggested the whole thing has taken the studio by surprise.</p><blockquote>“We decided to change the scream as the original audio was quite distorted which was notable when compared to some of the audio touch ups in the enhanced trailer. That said, we’ve heard the feedback from fans — the roar was even more beloved than we realized! Who knows, we may have something for OG roar enjoyers before long.”</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it sounds like Relic has a solution up its sleeve, which will hopefully go some way to placating the wrath of Warhammer 40,000’s passionate fanbase. I realize, however, that for the uninitiated, all this fuss may sound like an overreaction. All we're talking about here are a few audio changes, after all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s something unmistakingly gritty about the original intro trailer’s look, feel, and, yes, old-school audio. It reminds fans of a time in PC gaming’s history when RTS ruled the roost, the Astra Militarum were called the Imperial Guard, and Warhammer 40,000 superfan Henry Cavill had just finished filming Hellraiser: Hellworld. The original rekindles memories of hazy summer days spent hammering out Heretics, my flatmate desperately trying to outmaneuver my attacks. This new and “improved” intro cinematic is too clean, too… nice, and it will always be too recent.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">None of this is to say Relic’s Dawn of War Definitive Edition is on a hiding to nothing. I’m genuinely excited to play it, and not just for a short-lived trip down memory lane. It’s a fantastic game — perhaps the greatest Warhammer 40,000 video game ever made — and I look forward to hammering out those Heretics all over again. Perhaps I’ll even convince my old flatmate to join me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to the trailer! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-interview-i-am-going-back-and-fixing-typos-i-made-20-years-ago">I interviewed design director Philippe Boulle back in May when the Definitive Edition was announced</a>, and we gushed over Dawn of War’s intro cinematic. Here’s why it’s so good, according to Boulle:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was an amazing accomplishment at the time in terms of the fidelity. We really hadn't seen that for 40K at that time, and it really stood up as something that would reach out and grab you and say, ‘Hey, this is awesome. You need to pay attention.’ And it will still be in the game. It will be playing in beautiful 4K.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The thing that amazes me about it when we look back at it is the directing really holds up. That I think is the undervalued key to it. For the time the rendering was phenomenal, but what really holds up is the pacing, the drama, the ending on this guy running up the hill and getting shot, planting that flag and the drop pods coming down… that just works and that didn't need any changing obviously. That just was like, ‘Oh yeah, that's the stuff.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fun fact! Dave Wilson, executive producer and supervising director of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-40000-secret-level-animation-is-a-sequel-to-space-marine-2">the excellent Warhammer 40,000 episode of Prime Video’s Secret Level animated anthology series</a>, led the creation of the Dawn of War intro cinematic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
