            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Some kinds of games...are going to get priced out of existence."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Hollow Knight: Silksong out now, many players are celebrating its unexpectedly low $20 price tag. But some independent developers are pointing out that great as this may be, it could lead to unreasonable expectations for other indie games that can't afford to sell for that low.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a number of threads on social media from developers of games such as Unbeatable, Dorfromantik, and others. In one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rj.dcellgames.com/post/3lxlbk2ldkc2s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky thread</a>, Unbeatable director RJ Lake says that Silksong should cost $40, "and I'm not even joking."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Lake isn't upset at Team Cherry for charging $20 - that's their perogative. But it will have an impact on gaming audiences. As Lake explains:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"millions of people will probably buy silksong on day one, and it was a game that had a very 'low' budget, because the budget is 'these devs worked on it without direct pay for however long they wanted to do that,'" Lake writes. "it had a 'these devs are independently wealthy' budget of 'effectively zero dollars.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"they can price however low they want, as a result. their return on investment is infinite no matter what they do. but by charging such a low amount, they are causing lizard brain signals to fire off saying 'this kind of game is worth twenty dollars. you should expect this game for twenty dollars.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"if enough of those lizard brain signals fire, some kinds of games with actual budgets to pay people who need to live are going to get priced out of existence unless they can get the kind of organic groundswell you can't plan for"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot of other indie devs think Lake might have a point here, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ivanlesan.bsky.social/post/3lxr3siklds2m" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">folks from Deck 13</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/redsquirreltim.bsky.social/post/3lxm4n7ajgk2j" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Squirrel Games</a>. Over on Twitter/X, Basti Games, the developer of Lone Fungus: Melody of Spores, asked the audience how much Lone Fungus should cost given Silksong's $20 price. Basti had originally been planning on making Lone Fungus $20, too. But because it's shorter in length than Silksong, should it be cheaper?</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>As a dev making a smaller Metroidvania than Silksong, which I originally though would be fairly priced at 20 USD... what should I price it now?</p><p>It'll be a 10-15+ hours game, but it was made by one person with limited dev time and funds, I can't afford to give it away for free. <a href="https://t.co/FFcgz6TI1z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/FFcgz6TI1z</a></p></div>— Lone Fungus (@BastiArtGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/BastiArtGames/status/1962412246039953783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately for Basti, the replies overwhelmingly encourage them to price it at $20 if that's what's required. "Dude charge 20$," wrote one fan. "Price is not about the game is about context. They are able to price 20$ for a bigger game because they steem to receive a million times the cost. You are a small company, dude charge 20$ you deserve thst"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another wrote, "10-20 is totally fair imo. Team cherry could have made silksong 40 and still sold hotcakes, the fact they didn't just means they are cool as fuck. Don't hold yourself to standards of giants, or else you'll have to climb a staircase."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, other developers are worried too. In an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-hollow-knight-silksongs-cheap-price-a-problem-for-other-indie-games-devs-and-publishers-weigh-up-its-impact" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer article</a> on the subject, Dorfromantik developer Toukana's co-founder, Zwi Zausch, said that the studio's next game, Star Birds, would have its pricing impacted by Silksong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're trying not to compete too directly with Silksong, both in terms of release date and pricing. Of course, these are two very different games with potentially different player bases, but there's definitely some overlap. That makes things tricky, especially since Star Birds is a joint project between two studios, together employing more people than Team Cherry."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indie game prices has historically been a challenging subject, as teams balance needing to ensure all their members are adequately paid, uncertainty around sales numbers, and the volatility of audiences in deciding not to buy smaller games at prices they perceive as too high. As AAA game prices climb fro $60 to $70 to $80, there has been renewed discussion on where indies should fall - many can't afford to go lower than $20, but many will also lose sales if they don't.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People have less money now and are buying fewer games," says Mike Rose, founder of No More Robots, "so you have to set yourself up to hopefully be that one game they buy when they do have money. And if you are a higher price, it's now actually a bit offputting."</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/indie-developers-are-worried-silksongs-20-price-tag-will-make-it-harder-to-price-their-games]]></content:encoded>

It's all due to the Switch 2's data speeds, and how quickly the hardware can read information from its bespoke cartridges, versus games downloaded to the console's internal memory. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Star Wars Outlaws game engine] Snowdrop relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments, and we found the Switch 2 cards simply didn't give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for," Bantin <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:l45oa4c3p2ndptazexy33q3z/post/3lxzsvi6s7c2e?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%252Fnews%252Fstar-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-because-of-storage-speed-not-cost-dev-says%252F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The information has come as a surprise to some Nintendo fans who have previously grumbled over the use of Game-Key Cards, which are cheaper and therefore increasingly popular among developers of larger games which would otherwise require more costly cartridges with increased memory capacity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't recall the cost of the cards ever entering the discussion – probably because it was moot," Bantin continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not a comprehensive reason for all developers to use Game-Key Cards, Bantin went on to explain that it was important for Ubisoft and its Snowdrop development team, especially as Outlaws was originally developed for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S — console platforms that had faster SSD memory on board.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think if we'd designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different," Bantin said. "As it was, we'd build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case I think our leadership made the right call."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Nintendo launched a fresh <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-survey-asks-your-openness-to-digital-games-and-offers-a-chance-to-give-feedback-on-switch-2-game-key-cards">fan survey that quizzed Switch 2 owners</a> for their opinions on buying digital games instead of boxed copies, and specifically asked for feedback on Game-Key Cards, following their less-than-stellar initial reception among fans who prefer their physical games to include... well, the full game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First released last year to a mixed response and lackluster sales, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-flopped-because-the-brand-itself-was-in-choppy-waters-ubisoft-ceo-says">blamed <u>Star Wars Outlaws</u> disappointing sales performance on the "choppy waters" of the sci-fi saga's own fandom</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
