            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-where-to-buy-2026">Lorwyn Eclipsed</a> now out, our attention will soon sharply be turning to the next Magic set of 2026, which is also the first "Universes Beyond" release of the year: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-where-to-buy-2026">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, if you’re already sold on meeting up with cardboard versions of the Heroes in a Half Shell, their friends, and their foes, then good news - Amazon is once <em>again</em> discounting booster boxes, which are <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8YwG?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>now down to their lowest ever price</u></a>, and even lower than a previous best we saw just a couple of weeks ago.</p><div id="229417"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229417" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TMNT Booster Box (30 Packs)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now down to just $124.99, and containing 30 of your finest Play Boosters (each containing 14 cards), this is a certified $84.71 in savings compared to its original $209.70 list price. That's also just over $4 for each booster ($4.17, to be precise), which is more than a couple of bucks off what you’d usually pay when buying them individually. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In comparison, the market price for these is still sitting around <a href="https://zdcs.link/aA8lWq?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$139, according to data at the trusted resale marketplace TCGplayer</a>. While this will likely continue to drop (fallen 45.71% in the past three months), you're certainly ahead of the trend if you pick up the preorder at Amazon right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, just a heads up, as it's important for those looking to buy: Amazon doesn't charge until dispatch (so your card won't be charged until closer to release on March 6. Plus, the retailer also has a preorder price guarantee, so if it drops even further or somehow goes<em> back up </em>in price, you can be absolutely certain that you're paying the lowest price possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magics-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-set-is-months-away-but-play-boosters-are-discounted-already"><u>This is also even better than the deal we saw just before Christmas</u></a>, and now even lower than the next best price at Amazon from earlier this month ($148.20). Although it does make you think, is the discount indicative of Wizards of the Coast’s expectations for the set? Let's hope not!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, the price dropped to $159.99, bringing the Universes Beyond box of Play Boosters to around the standard price of a Universes Within box, but dropping even further to just $125, this seems like a mighty good deal for what is already looking like a very popular set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We saw similar drops for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrJe7m?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spider-Man</a>, which would be a little worrisome if <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm8mKK?object_uuid=e5a55cc3-78d3-4da0-90cf-36cfc4206e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Avatar</a> hadn’t got the same treatment - and that set was great.
