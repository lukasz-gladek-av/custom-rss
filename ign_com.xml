This game normally costs $79 new. This is the best price I've seen for a domestic (non-imported) version of the game. The seller seems to be legitimate with 300,000 feedback and a 99.9% rating.

Mario Kart World is a completely new addition to the MK series, with the last new entry being Mario Kart 8 way back in 2014. Mario Kart Word's biggest updates include a completely open world design with interconnected tracks, a big and boisterous "Knockout Tour" multiplayer mode, and a massive visual overhaul that looks great on a 4K TV. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Logan Plant reviewed Mario Kart World</a> and wrote that "Mario Kart World may not make the most convincing case that going open-world was the boost the series needed, but excellent multiplayer racing, incredible polish, and the thrilling new Knockout Tour mode still more than live up to its legacy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
