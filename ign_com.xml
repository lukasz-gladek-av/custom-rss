Ahead of San Diego Comic-Con 2025, IGN can exclusively reveal the next chapter in the Cult of the Lamb Saga, Cult of the Lamb: Schism Special #1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cult of the Lamb: Schism Special #1 is a one-shot, 48-page comic that reunites the creative team from The First Verse, including writer Alex Paknadel (Red Goblin) and artist Troy Little (Rick and Morty vs. Cthulu). This new issue is again a collaboration between comic book publisher Oni Press, game publisher Devolver Digital, and development studio Massive Monster.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/unnamed15-1752169639896.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Art by Peach Momoko.

More potential followers are rescued by the day, but with no one to indoctrinate them, Lamb’s power stagnates and The One Who Waits becomes weary of his earthly vessel’s resistance to the full power and responsibility of the Red Crown. When famine strikes the cult, a challenger to Lamb’s mantle emerges, and a new struggle begins...</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let me just clear the air here: I’m not a gamer. At least, I thought I wasn’t until this extraordinary story landed in my lap," Paknadel told IGN about The First Verse. "A perfect innocent – a sacrificial lamb - is given the means to avenge themselves against the tyrannical system that threw them under the bus for a paltry superstition. It’s a classic revenge fantasy, but it also contains the seeds of truly epic tragedy.Get ready to experience the events of the game from the Lamb’s perspective – their fall and rise and fall - and see why the tragedy of The One Who Waits’ anointed avenger only began with their death."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/unnamed16-1752169639896.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Art by Troy Little.

Its combat is immensely satisfying even if its short runs and the relative lack of variety between them doesn’t give it the lasting appeal of other action roguelikes, and building my very own cult base and tending to a flock of followers was just as fun as any swing of the axe. I may not revisit it now that the credits have rolled, but Cult of the Lamb is something altogether different that I had an absolute blast playing."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cult of the Lamb: The First Verse Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cult of the Lamb was recently updated in August 2024 with the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/cult-of-the-lamb-official-unholy-alliance-launch-trailer">the DLC expansion Unholy Alliance</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

Reasons for canceled games range from fast-shifting market dynamics and corporate restructuring to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/major-publishers-report-aaa-franchises-can-cost-over-a-billion-to-make"><u>ballooning development costs</u></a> and other creative challenges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2025, 17 games have been confirmed or reliably reported to be canceled so far.

In the aftermath of the dispute, the team evaluated the state of Earthblade and decided it wasn’t “as far along as one would expect after such a protracted development process.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio said it's now "prototyping again and exploring at our own pace, and trying to rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at Celeste's or TowerFall's inception."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Football Manager 25</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/football-manager-25-canceled-dev-apologizes-for-letting-fans-down"><u>Football Manager 25 was canceled</u></a> on February 6, 2025. It's the first time the annual sports sim has skipped a release in its 21-year history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Football Manager 25 had been delayed twice prior to the official cancellation, and the decision to end development ultimately came when developer Sports Interactive concluded it “would not achieve the standard required [to release the game], even with the adjusted timeline.” The studio specifically cited issues with “the overarching player experience and interface.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sports Interactive is expected to resume the series with the release of Football Manager 26 later this year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Wonder Woman</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In February 2025 it was announced that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-cancels-wonder-woman-game-closes-three-studios"><u>Wonder Woman game was canceled</u></a> and the developers, Monolith Productions, would be shut down.

In a statement, a Warner Bros. spokesperson said, “Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Wonder Woman's cancellation, comic writer Gail Simone, who worked on the project, said the now-canceled game was "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/canceled-wonder-woman-was-gorgeous-and-expansive-comic-book-writer-who-consulted-on-the-game-says">gorgeous and expansive</a>," adding, "[Monolith] made sure it had WW and DC lore on every aspect of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wonder Woman was first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-monolith-wb">announced</a> at the 2021 Game Awards.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Respawn Multiplayer FPS</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">An <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-has-quietly-canceled-a-multiplayer-fps-incubation-project"><u>unannounced, multiplayer first-person shooter</u></a> from Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment was canceled in early March 2025.
