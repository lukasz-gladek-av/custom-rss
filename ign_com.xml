            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-devs-tear-up-the-rulebook-let-the-bulwark-class-use-a-thunder-hammer-only-because-we-think-it-will-be-very-cool<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> have essentially said "it’s what the Emperor would have wanted" and made a big weapon change in the game not for balance reasons, but because it’s just really, really cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber Interactive released <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/221-pts-patch-notes-8-0-siege-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a> for the Siege Update (Patch 8), which is available now on the Public Test Realm (PTS) for PC players, and in those confirmed it had extended the weapon arsenal in PvE to add the Thunder Hammer for the Bulwark class.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thunder Hammers are perfect for bonking the crap out of Tyranids and Chaos Marines with wide, swinging attacks that have great reach, but the weapon type is limited to the Assault class. The Bulwark class is also great, with its huge shield and overpowered, game-saving abilities. But up to this point the Bulwark was unable to wield a Thunder Hammer. It made sense that it couldn’t, given you need two hands to bring a Thunder Hammer to bear on a heretic’s noggin, and you can’t do that while holding a Storm Shield.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, a Bulkwark can equip a Thunder Hammer, but there is an understandable catch: if the Bulwark uses a Thunder Hammer, it can’t also use a Storm Shield. This significantly changes what the Bulwark is all about, which is being a Space Marine who hunkers down for proper last stand stuff. The class has various abilities tied to using the Storm Shield, such as Shield Bash, which when using a Thunder Hammer are no longer available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I love is the patch notes explanation from Saber Interactive justifying this change. It basically amounts to an admission that it doesn’t make a great deal of sense lore wise, but they’re doing it anyway for FUN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are adding this option only because we think it will be very cool and it's a shame that only one class can use the Thunder Hammer,” Saber explained. “We are not done with Bulwark, more interesting gameplay things are to come.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, the Bulwark’s perks have been updated, which you can find detailed in the patch notes below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Siege Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there is a hugely exciting tease for expanded customization options coming to Space Marine 2, one that’s already got fans hyped for what’s to come in future patches. </p><blockquote>We are preparing a very big update for customisation, players will be able to reuse chapter champion armour parts on other classes (with lore accuracy, clipping and technical restrictions). While it's not going to be in this patch, we wanted to mention this in this patch notes to assure you that we are going to continue expanding our customization system.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch notes do not reveal any new weapons or Operations mode maps, so it seems the focus here is squarely on Siege, which arrives in fully fleshed out form as part of Patch 8 on June 26. But Saber has confirmed new content is set to hit the game, including a new class. Season 4 also includes a new game mode for PvP and a new Chaos enemy.

When overwhelmed, players may call reinforcements for assistance. Engage in intense battles across three distinctive sectors, each requiring strategic adaptation. Side objectives emerge during combat, providing essential resources used to summon elite Space Marines or a formidable Dreadnought, drastically shifting battlefield dynamics.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Battlefield</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle unfolds within a fortified Imperial stronghold on Kadaku, relentlessly attacked by endless waves of Tyranid and Thousand Sons enemies. The fortress has three rotating sectors: Defensive Positions, the Arsenal, and the Control Room. In each sector, you will face five waves of enemies before your squad advances to the next sector, ultimately cycling back to reinforce earlier positions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Survival Against Waves</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Face increasingly challenging enemy waves, with direct assaults from Tyranids and cunning sabotage by Chaos forces. Brief (1 minute) intermissions between waves offer strategic opportunities, clearly indicated through UI notifications.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Side Objectives</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dynamic tasks such as capturing strategic points or retrieving Data-slates from fallen allies deepen tactical gameplay and supply critical resources essential for continued survival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shop and Reinforcements</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earn Siege Mode resources through successful combat and Side Objective completion. You can spend these resources at the fortress Shop. You can:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">1) Buy ammunition, medicae stimms, equipment, armour boosts, guardian relic (these items have the same exact behaviour as in Operations Mode).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2) Summon specialized Space Marines providing targeted support and bonuses. Each player can have only one summoned Space Marine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">3) Deploy Cadian Troopers to provide additional firepower.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">4) Collectively pool your resources to unleash the devastating power of a Dreadnought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Boss Encounters</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every fifth wave introduces formidable boss battles, occasionally facing multiple elite foes simultaneously. Triumph in these encounters to progress to new fortress sectors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Infinite Waves</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If your resolve endures through fifteen brutal waves, prepare for endless combat of increasing difficulty, reduced resources, and shorter preparation times. Even the Primarch of the Ultramarines understands that ultimate victory here is unlikely — but your bravery will echo through the halls of eternity."</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added option to<strong> disable bots spawn in Private Mode.</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Perfect if you’re looking for a challenge</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>RTAO</strong> experimental feature added — enables in in-game video settings</li><li><strong>DLSS 4</strong>  — better upscale for 50xx series cards.</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>New Season Pass Content</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Added White Scars Chapter Champion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Added White Scars Chapter Weapon Skin Pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Added White Scars Chapter Customisation Pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Added Blood Angels Customisation Pack.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GAMEPLAY AND BALANCING TWEAKS</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Extended Weapon arsenal in PvE </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added <strong>Thunder Hammer for Bulwark</strong>. Picking this weapon <strong>will prevent you from using the Storm Shield</strong>.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We are adding this option only because we think it will be very cool and it's a shame that only 1 class can use the Thunder Hammer. We are not done with Bulwark, more interesting gameplay things are to come.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Finishers for Bulwark</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Adding new finishers for Bulwark with shield — 1 for Hormagaunts and 1 for Tzaangors.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Terminus Update for Absolute Difficulty</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>A second Terminus can now appear during a mission.</li><li>The Terminus's HP has been increased by 66% and additional enemy packs will appear upon its spawn and again when its HP is reduced to 50%</li><li>These additional packs are now slightly more challenging featuring more Extremis enemies</li><li>Mission with final bosses can now also spawn Terminus enemies (previously, missions like “Decapitation” didn't allow any Terminus spawns)".</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This change is made according to the community poll that we made a while ago. We think that Absolute difficulty wasn't that hard to begin with and now with a slight power creep of constant weapons buffs, perk buffs and prestige perks the situation is much worse.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>After doing multiple test we have scrapped the idea of having 2 Terminus enemies in Operations mode at the same time (except in Siege mode), because this meant that you would have to encounter them all of the time, otherwise one run with dual terminus spawns would be much harder than a run with 2 Terminus enemies spawning one by one. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Instead we've tried to make Terminus spawns harder and more intense. We are going to continue to monitor how Absolute Difficulty is, and make necessary tweaks.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Prestige Perks Class Update</strong></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bulwark Prestige Perks Update</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>“Rally Point”</strong>: The perk has been reworked.
