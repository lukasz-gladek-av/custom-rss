These are Undisputed, Subnautica: Below Zero, Ultros and Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also a great time to remind PlayStation Plus members that you still have until February 2 to add January's games to your library, which include Need for Speed Unbound, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed and Core Keeper.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/28/68d851adc3e83474dd2f8230fc762126f5468002-1769618574245.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-of-sonys-playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-has-leaked">As reported earlier this week</a>, boxing game Undisputed will be part of next month's offerings. Originally launched in October 2024 for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, Undisputed is notable for being the first major licensed boxing video game in over a decade, since the EA-published Fight Night Champion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Developer Steel City Interactive's approach to boxing in Undisputed is on the right track, but there's a long road ahead of it," IGN wrote in its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undisputed-review">Undisputed review</a>, which returned a 6/10 score.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be joined by fighter jet game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a>, which launched back in 2019 for PlayStation 4. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/18/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-review">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown review</a> dubbed it as "a great-looking arcade flight combat game... weighed down by its weird and convoluted but persistent story and poor communication of objectives." Ultimately, we rated the game with a 7/10 score.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out February's additions are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ultros">Ultros</a>, a colorful indie Metroidvania from one of the brains behind Hotline Miami, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/subnautica-below-zero">Subnautica: Below Zero</a>, the leaner but meaner follow-up to one of the best ever open-world survival games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Another big, frosty bite of one of the best open world survival games to come along since the genre's inception," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-below-zero-review">Subnautica: Below Zero review</a>, scoring it 9/10.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"A design that would make anyone's heart throb."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The director of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> has said that the game's female staff members worked hard to ensure hero Leon S. Kennedy "would make anyone's heart throb."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have praised Leon's appearance in Requiem, which sees the rookie cop turned grizzled agent sporting stubble, wrinkles, but still a full head of floppy hair. Online, may have dubbed Leon as an "ikeoji" character — an attractive older man that is also referred to as a "hot uncle" — and it's this definition which has now been put to Requiem's director by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon's visuals," director Koshi Nakanishi said when asked about Leon's ikeoji status. "Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/28/tgas-2025-resident-evil-leon-1769613081364.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leon S. Kennedy.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck," Nakanishi continued. "When I mentioned that story in the past, a female fan told me, 'The women developers at Capcom did a really good job' (laughs). Throughout the development process, Leon was thoroughly refined, and I think we managed to come through with a design that would make anyone's heart throb."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leon was finally revealed for Resident Evil Requiem late last year, following months of teases, rumors and speculation over his appearance. The returning hero of Resident Evil 2 and 4 (and a bit of 6), Leon will feature in action-heavy gameplay that will contrast with the quieter, horror-led sequences that feature series newbie Grace Ashcroft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How have the years treated Leon? Is he still pining for Ada? Will he be given a happy ending, after nearly three decades fighting zombies? And what is going on with that ominous-looking mark on his neck? All of these are questions that Requiem will hopefully answer, as well as just providing us all with more eye candy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every staff member had their own interpretation of Leon's 30-year-long history, so they would tell me things like, Leon would definitely not act like that in this kind of situation," Nakanishi continued. "So, there were more opinions about what he's like on the inside compared to his looks, and after many discussions, we were able to settle on something that clicked for us. When players see this Leon in the game, hopefully they will be able to find their own interpretation of him as well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, and we just got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-the-final-preview">final hands-on look at Leon in action</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Do you like tense survival horror? It’s here," IGN wrote. "Wanna go all guns blazing with intense action and a quip-obsessed hero? You get that too. Do you prefer playing RE games in first or third person? Doesn’t matter; you can do either. All these choices, along with my fears of a jarring play experience being mostly squashed, make it easy to believe that Capcom’s bold move to have its cake and eat it is going to pay off in a big way."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

But we do not want to be using AI to drive creativity." Jagex is even speaking with its external partners to make sure no genAI is being used in “inappropriate ways in any of their work that might filter through to the end game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of generative AI in game development is one of the hottest topics in the industry, and it has sparked a number of controversies. Following the reveal of Divinity at the 2025 The Game Awards, Swen Vincke, boss of developer Larian, met with a backlash after he said the studio was using genAI in various capacities. Larian ended up having to address AI concerns in a reddit AMA in which the studio confirmed a U-turn on some aspects of its use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jagex's "hard line stance" is in contrast to the approach of some video game companies that have gone all-in on the tech. The CEO of Genvid — the company behind choose-your-own-adventure interactive series Silent Hill Ascension — has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gen-z-loves-ai-slop-former-square-enix-exec-claims-a-lot-of-ai-sentiment-is-driven-by-emotion-rather-than-logic"><u>claimed "consumers generally do not care" about generative AI, and stated that: "Gen Z loves AI slop."</u></a> EA CEO Andrew Wilson, meanwhile, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>said AI is "the very core of our business,"</u></a> and Square Enix recently implemented mass layoffs and reorganized, saying it needed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan"><u>be "aggressive in applying AI."</u></a> Dead Space creator Glen Schofield also recently detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered"><u>his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in game development</u></a>, and former God of War dev Meghan Morgan Juinio said: "... if we don’t embrace [AI], <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short"><u>I think we’re selling ourselves short</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of video games, some entertainment companies are banning the use of genAI altogether.
