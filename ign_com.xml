            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Truth and reconciliation.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has announced plans to put <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> into maintenance mode later this month so developer Halo Studios can focus on working on multiple new Halo games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Halo Studios said Operation: Infinite, due out November 18, is the last major update currently planned for the Xbox and PC first-person shooter, but insisted it will support players with challenges, ranked rewards, and community events throughout next year and beyond. Operation: Infinite’s free, 100-tier Operation Pass and 100-tier Premium Pass have no planned expiration date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the new Halo games Halo Studios is working on is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, which is due out at some point in 2026 across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5. Halo Studios did not say what the other upcoming Halo games are.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo Games in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As we look back on four years of evolution and updates in Halo Infinite, we’d like to thank our community for your steadfast support,” Halo Studios said. “Without your feedback and enthusiasm, Halo Infinite multiplayer would not be the special place it is today: a robust arena for slaying and playing, with something for every Spartan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With multiple Halo titles in development, we’ll need our whole team's combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us. While we remain committed to supporting Halo Infinite on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo Studios, once called 343 Industries, leaves Halo Infinite behind four years after its delayed launch across Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC in December 2021. Microsoft had intended for it to be an Xbox Series X and S launch title and come out a year earlier, but pushed it back following negative feedback to a hotly anticipated gameplay reveal in July 2020.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo Infinite went through significant changes in the years following its release, including the rebranding of its developer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name"><u>343 Industries, to Halo Studios</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hit-by-layoffs-on-anniversary-of-activision-blizzard-announcement">multiple rounds of layoffs</a>. This came after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-steam-player-count-doubles-following-season-5-launch"><u>player numbers for Halo Infinite dropped off dramatically after launch</u></a> as fans expressed frustration over a lack of content, poor progression systems, and aggressive monetization. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-battle-royale-was-real-and-could-have-been-a-game-changer-dev-says"><u>A "game changer" battle royale mode was scrapped</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamers are already pointing out that Halo Infinite hasn’t even managed to reach the halfway point of Microsoft’s well-documented 10-year plan for the game (it wasn’t called Halo: Infinite for nothing). In July 2020, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-infinite-2-wont-be-happening-says-343-industries">IGN spoke with now former Halo Infinite Studio Head Chris Lee</a>, who described Halo Infinite as “the start of our platform for the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want Infinite to grow over time, versus going to those numbered titles and having all that segmentation that we had before,” he continued. “It’s really about creating Halo Infinite as the start of the next 10 years for Halo and then building that as we go with our fans and community.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While continued updates have significantly improved the experience, Halo Infinite never quite managed to realize its potential. The focus now is on Halo: Campaign Evolved, although this, too, has suffered a bumpy ride since it was announced, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-made-it-right-and-they-are-breaking-it-for-no-reason-one-of-the-key-members-of-the-original-halo-dev-team-doesnt-sound-thrilled-with-microsofts-halo-campaign-evolved">one of the key members of the original Halo development team at Bungie expressing concern about some of the changes made</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">And is that... Grunt?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect fans have uncovered fresh artwork teasing the franchise's next game, which will feature the krogan race in the middle of a civil war. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clues hidden in today's blog post from series boss Mike Gamble have been decoded by fans to uncover a hidden link on BioWare's website — and on it, our first piece of new Mass Effect teaser in two years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a> artwork shows a battle-scarred krogan firing his gun, flanked by an army of helmeted krogan warriors. The title of the image is simply: "Civil War." </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/07/mass-effect-krogan-civil-war-jpg-adapt-1920w-1762543620424.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mass Effect artwork showing the krogan civil war. Image credit: <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/mass-effect/411826207">BioWare.</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect fans are already poring over the image, and there's a couple of obvious observations right off the bat. Firstly, the hero krogan in this image is <em>old</em>, the kind of old we've already seen in Mass Effect Andromeda, like your ancient krogan squadmate Drack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn't Drack, which begs the question — who are we looking at? The armor color is reminscent of Grunt, your Mass Effect 2 squadmate who was then just a youth. Though for him to be looking as old as Drack (who was over 1,000 years old!), it might suggest the next Mass Effect is similarly more than 1,000 years into Mass Effect 3's future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From what we've seen already — a lightly-wrinkled Liara — this seems a little too far. Asari and krogan both have long lifespans, but Liara looked hundreds of years older, rather than 1,000. Could this be a new character? Or... could it just be Wrex? Mass Effect 1's fan-favorite krogan squadmate was already middle-aged in the original trilogy, so with another few hundred years on top, he may now be as old as Drack was in Andromeda.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The next big question, of course, is why are the krogan in the middle of a civil war? This one is perhaps easier to answer, when considering the range of endings Mass Effect 3 offered for the krogan race.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krogan have always been portrayed as warlike and expansionist, though they have suffered from infertility due to an artifical plague which saw their numbers dwindle and homeworld left almost barren. But Shepard can choose to aid their cause and reverse the plague's effects — with results then dependent on your other choices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect 3's myriad of endings range from the krogan pursuing a peaceful renaissance, to their new-found numbers supercharging fresh calls for galactic expansion. Perhaps the next Mass Effect game will offer a storyline that caters to all of the above by suggesting two factions emerging: one which wants that expansion, and another that seeks to curb the race's worser instincts? Whatever's going on, it seems all is not well with the krogan, hundreds of years after the Reapers were destroyed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps we'll hear more of the krogan civil war within Amazon's upcoming Mass Effect TV series, which we learned today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-wont-retread-shepards-story-and-will-be-set-after-the-original-trilogy">will be set after the events of the Mass Effect trilogy to avoid rehashing Commander Shepard's story</a>. BioWare also used today to reassert that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-and-bioware-remain-committed-to-next-mass-effect-game-and-yes-romances-will-return">remained committed to developing its next Mass Effect project, with publisher EA onboard for the future of the franchise</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

And just last week, Rockstar fired between 30 and 40 employees, claiming later that they were "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-studio-rockstar-accuses-fired-employees-of-leaking-confidential-information-in-a-public-forum">distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum</a>" against company policy. The fired employees, however, say they were participating in a union-related Discord chat, and that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-dev-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-in-sudden-firing-of-dozens-of-staff">their firing was "blatant" and "ruthless" union busting</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick is defending the company's culture and labor record, saying Take-Two is "incredibly proud" of its labor relations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN yesterday ahead of the earnings announcement, Zelnick pointed me to Take-Two and Rockstar's existing public statements when I asked if he had any response to the allegations of union busting, and reiterating that "we fully support Rockstar."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So then I asked Zelnick, what is Take-Two's stance on unions, generally? Zelnick did not reply to that specific question. But here's what he did say:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Here’s what we have a stance on. We value every one of our colleagues greatly. We have 13,500 colleagues worldwide. We’re so proud of our culture. In the last few years we’ve been recognized over 15 times as an employer of choice... we’ve been certified this year as a great place to work in the U.S. and UK, Forbes recently called us one of the world’s best employers, and further... our attrition rate is half or less of the industry average. To be specific, our global attrition rate is just over 6%, in the UK it's less than 4%. The industry average is over 12%, and Rockstar is even lower than our average."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, you know, the proof is in the pudding, and the food is good, and I think our culture is extraordinary. And we strive to be the most creative, most innovative, and most efficient company in the business. So that’s how we look at it. We’re incredibly proud of our labor relations."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/07/gettyimages-1440125158-1762538511589.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Strauss Zelnick has defended Rockstar's company culture. Photo by Steven Ferdman/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>[A Take-Two spokesperson later clarified Rockstar's global attrition rate is 4%, and in the UK it is "half that number." IGN followed up to ask for the source of the over 12% industry average attrition. The spokesperson clarified it was for "entertainment and tech" and that the source was Take-Two's own internal research: "we use a variety of related data platforms/sources to compile."]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick's response comes amid ongoing uproar over the firings, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-employment-protests-outside-take-two-and-rockstar-north-offices-as-fired-staff-deny-leaking-company-secrets">affected employees and supporters picketing outside Rockstar and Take-Two's UK offices yesterday</a>. According to the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), the only non-Rockstar people inside the private union Discord were union organizers. IWGB boss Alex Marshall issued IGN the following statement:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rockstar continue to deflect from the real reason for these dismissals: they are afraid of hard working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA 6, and that they’re prioritising union busting by targeting the very people who make the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In recent years, Rockstar executives have benefited from £443 million in tax relief, while showing total disregard for the law or the livelihoods of their staff. At every turn, they’ve chosen profits over both workers and fans of their games. The only non Rockstar employees in the union Discord channel were union organisers."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar maintains that the firings were for "gross misconduct, and for no other reason."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rockstar North and Take-Two Office Protest Photos Nov 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first instance of labor unrest at the company. Last year, the studio <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-is-asking-employees-to-return-to-office-amid-gta-security-concerns"><u>asked employees to come to the office five days a week</u></a>, citing a desire for both increased productivity and security following a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-leaks-everything-thats-happened-so-far"><u>massive leak of the in-development GTA 6</u></a> in 2022 and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-the-gta-6-trailer-appears-to-have-leaked-a-day-early"><u>day-early release of GTA 6 Trailer 1</u></a> the following year.
