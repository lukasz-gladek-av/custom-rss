The decision follows the April cancellation of Project Dagger, an action-adventure game originally set to co-developed and published with Take-Two Interactive before it pulled out in September 2022.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/10/people-can-fly-1733856176352.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">People Can Fly announced that it's cutting back or suspending multiple in-development games.

The video game market is still evolving, and we have to adjust with where things are today. We are redoubling our efforts with new work for hire engagements and focusing on the development of a single independent game," Wojciechowski wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">People Can Fly's announcement further whittles down its list of seven projects revealed back in July 2023. Another, codenamed Project Gemini, is in development with longtime partner Square Enix, but its status is unclear. Project Red, meanwhile, is in the "concept stage."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">People Can Fly's most recent project is Bullestorm VR, an updated version of the classic shooter for Meta Quest and PSVR 2 developed in conjunction with Incuvo. Project Gemini is expected to release sometime in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?
