The creatures that dominated Earth ages ago, populating our world for 165 million years, will always be fascinating. And, on screen, as part of movie history, dinosaurs have always been a go-to genre for incredible spectacle and chilling thrills - whether you're into t-rexes, pterodactyls, raptors, or gentle giant brontosauruses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dinosaur movies transport us back in time to the era of these wondrous reptiles, while other instances show dinosaurs living among us, either on a secluded island lost to history or as cloned beings brought back by science for our amusement (and dismemberment). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Jurassic Park/World franchise has raked in over $6 billion in box office bucks over the past 30 years, proving that these glorious beasts can bring home the bacon. But which dinosaur films are the best?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are our picks of the 10 best dinosaur movies, from trampled theme parks to warring prehistoric titans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Looking for more movies featuring giant lizards?</strong> </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dragon-movies">The best dragon movies</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/godzilla-movies-in-order">Godzilla movies in order</a></li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Dinosaur Movies</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Jurassic Park (1993)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/nllhr4ja4wstlcbfb2bbwu-1681955831135.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Um, duh. Yup, not only is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/jurassic-park">Spielberg's Jurassic Park</a> one of the best "dinosaur movies ever," it easily doubles as one of the "best movies ever." Adapted from Michael Crichton's novel (and <em>second</em> story about a futuristic amusement park gone lethally haywire), Jurassic Park is endlessly entertaining and infinitely quotable, providing equal parts laughter and horror. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum star in this tyrannosaurus-sized tale about scientists evaluating a - er - unique family attraction before it opens to the public. Hold onto your butts, because this appraisal winds up with a body count.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">See our guide on how to watch the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-park-movies-in-order">Jurassic Park movies in order</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Jurassic World (2015)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/chris-pratt-bryce-dallas-howard-jurassic-world-1681955850181.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More than 20 years after the original Jurassic Park (which wound up becoming a trilogy), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/jurassic-park-iv">Jurassic World</a> kicked off a new segment of the franchise, with greedy corporations and opportunistic scientists learning nothing from previous tragedies and opening "Jurassic World" to patrons everywhere. Naturally, things go horribly awry and carnage ensues and Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard anchor a budding dino-apocalypse. The films would eventually bring back the original three stars but the first World installment stands tall as a formulaic but fun feast for the senses.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Land Before Time (1988)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/we-1681955967848.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, this Don Bluth animated classic blossomed into a decades-spanning franchise featuring 13 sequels, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/the-land-before-time">several video games</a>, and a TV series. The story of a young orphaned dinosaur named Littlefoot, who embarks on a great journey to find a paradise called the Great Valley, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-land-before-time">The Land Before Time</a> is a beautifully animated '80s staple. The saga teaches kids about the importance of friendship, the dangers of prejudice, and the power of hope. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dinosaur (2000)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/s-1681956084110.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Buena Vista Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/dinosaur">Disney's Dinosaur</a>, the company's 39th animated feature, finds a lot in common with The Land Before Time as it also follows a young orphaned dino, this time on a trek to discover to the idyllic Nesting Grounds after a meteor shower devastates their island. A mix of live-action, many of the backgrounds were filmed on location while the dinos themselves were computer-generated, making it the most expensive computer-animated film at the time. Voiced by D.B. Sweeney, Julianna Margulies, Alfre Woodard, Ossie Davis, Joan Plowright, and Hayden Panettiere.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Good Dinosaur (2015)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/nycu8byhvifswllfwdyd-1681956104324.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Walt Disney Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though it's technically the first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ranking-pixar-movies">Pixar film</a> to not quite meet profitable expectations, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-good-dinosaur">The Good Dinosaur</a> is wacky, charming family entertainment, supplemented by the voices of Sam Elliott, Anna Paquin, Jeffrey Wright, and three-time Oscar-winner Frances McDormand. Like most animated dino films, the story involves a thrilling, meaningful journey, though this time it's within an alternate history where reptilian dinosaurs never went extinct. In The Good Dinosaur, a shy Apatosaurus, Arlo, meets an unlikely human friend while traveling through a dangerous and mysterious landscape in order to return home.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>King Kong (1933)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/movie-king-kong-1933-wallpaper-preview-1681956195912.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: RKO Radio Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Most King Kong films are good for a ravenous dino or two, so why not revisit the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/king-kong-1933">1933 original</a> and watch humans discover Skull Island, home of not only Kong but prehistoric life of all kinds: including the Tyrannosaurus-rex, the Stegosaurus, the Pteranodon, and more. King Kong is a classic, famous for being a true spectacle at the time with game-changing special effects, from stop-motion pioneer Willis O'Brien. Kong is still thriving today, as part of Legendary's MonsterVerse, with the latest entry, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire">Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</a>, worth checking out too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Kong: Skull Island (2017)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/21/ymvm3eiygs303nvwjl0n-1682103563791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">King Kong's MonsterVerse reboot began with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/kong-skull-island">Kong: Skull Island</a>, a rollicking Vietnam War-era adventure starring Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, and John Goodman as a part of a mix of scientists, soldiers, and scholars trapped on Kong's dreaded isle of terrifying creatures. In a twist though, the island's usual dinosaurs have been beaten and eaten by new giant monsters, unique to the film and the MonsterVerse itself. And it totally works. Separating itself from the Jurassic Park/World franchise, Kong: Skull Island gave viewers a fresh batch of nightmare fuel to fawn over.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>One Million Years BC (1966)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/one-million-archelon-1681956482588.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Warner-Pathé Distributors</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This '60s British fantasy-adventure, from Hammer Films, starred Raquel Welch as a cavewoman struggling to survive in a fictional past where humans and dinosaurs coexisted. A remake of a film from 1940, One Million Years BC is a largely enjoyable, kitschy featuring dinosaurs (and giant sea-turtles) roaming a scortched Earth, brought to life by stop-motion genius, and Willis H. O'Brien apprentice, Ray Harryhausen (Jason and the Argonauts, Clash of the Titans).</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Valley Of Gwangi (1969)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/ew-1681956529069.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Warner Bros.-Seven Arts</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Harryhausen home run was cult dino-Western, The Valley Of Gwangi, as the stop-motion pro took over the project from mentor Willis O'Brien after O'Brien passed away before production. The story itself was conceived by O'Brien and combined cowboys and dinosaurs as a rodeo horse is revealed to be a fifty million-year-old, prompting members of a Wild West show to venture into Mexico's Forbidden Valley in search of fame and untold wealth. There, however, they confront prehistoric monsters, including "Gwangi," a giant dinosaur that decimates their ranks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Land of the Lost (2009)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/90-1681956714215.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Ferrell and Danny McBride turn a 1970s Sid and Marty Krofft TV series (which itself got a short-lived '90s revival) into a comedic romp in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/land-of-the-lost">Land of the Lost</a>, where a mysterious vortex sucks a disgraced scientist (Ferrell), his assistant (Anna Friel), and a survivalist Will (McBride) into a world populated by marauding dinosaurs and fantastically bizarre creatures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's it for our pick of the best dinosaur movies of all time. Did you favorite make the cut? Let us know in the comments.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Upcoming Dinosaur Movies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Two new dinosaur movies are in the works and are worth keeping an eye on. The first is the next installment in the Jurassic World series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/jurassic-world-rebirth">Jurassic World Rebirth</a>, due to release July 2, 2025. The second is a bit more of a mystery. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/it-follows">It Follows</a> director David Robert Mitchell is working on a dinosaur movie, set to release in 2026, which will feature Anne Hathaway and Ewan McGregor. According to rumors, the film has been <a href="https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2023/3/te3854nr94ytqtptif8gphqzlj0p4b" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">titled Flowervale Street</a> and is rumored to be about dinosaurs and set in the 80s.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dinosaur-movies]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Alters developer 11 Bit Studios has responded to fan accusations it used generative AI text and translation in the game, and has promised an update to both to replace the AI-generated content with handcrafted assets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, players of The Alters spotted what appeared to be text generated by AI in the game, on a screen in the Command Center. Specifically, the text includes the line, "Sure, here's a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data:" followed by a Captain's log, which suggests that someone prompted an AI for the text and forgot to delete the AI's lead-in response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the English-language version of the game, that was the end of it. However, players of other language versions <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:o7fzbrxgcaoek5sjkxq3acq3/post/3lsm3lzvb3s2b" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">began to point out</a> that some of the game's translations include lines like, "Sure! Here is the translated text into Brazilian Portuguese.", suggesting that 11 Bit Studios had used generative AI to localize at least some portion of the game. The Alters does not include a disclosure on its Steam page stating that it includes generative AI, which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve makes mandatory</a> for all games that use the technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement sent via email to IGN and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published across social platforms</a>, 11 Bit Studios offered an explanation for the generative AI text and translations. The studio explained that the Captain's Log text was intended as a placeholder and simply got missed during final release, and that no other such instances appear in the game. As for the localization, 11 Bit says that generative AI translations were limited to a few cutscenes added very late in development that needed last-minute translations, and that it always intended to replace them with professional translations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the studio's statement, in full:</p><blockquote>We’ve seen a wide range of accusations regarding the use of AI-generated content in The Alters, and we feel it’s important to clarify our approach and give you more context. AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary WIPs during the development process and in a very limited manner. Our team has always prioritized meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game.</blockquote><blockquote>During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder. This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game. We have since conducted a thorough review and confirmed that this was an isolated case, and the asset in question is being updated. </blockquote><blockquote>For transparency, we’ve included a screenshot to show how and where it appears in the game. While we do not want to downplay the situation, we also want to clearly show its limited impact on your gaming experience.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition to that, a few licensed movies that the alters can watch in the social area of the base were added at the final stage of development. While those were externally produced, our team was not involved in the creative process, and these required additional last-minute translations. Due to extreme time constraints, we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch. It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localization hotfix, to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game. That process is now underway, and updated translations are being implemented.</blockquote><blockquote>To give you a better understanding of what a small part of the overall scope of the game’s narrative layer they are, those few external movies are approximately 10k words out of 3.4 million across all languages in the game, or just 0.3% of the overall text. The alternative was to release those specific dialogues in English only, which we believed would be a worse experience for non-English speakers. In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know. </blockquote><blockquote>As AI tools evolve, they present new challenges and opportunities in game development. We’re actively adapting our internal processes to meet this reality. But above all, we remain committed to transparency in how we make our games. We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we work towards that goal.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">11 Bit Studios is just the latest company to come under fire for generative AI usage. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-no-longer-includes-generative-ai-portraits-following-fan-backlash">Just last week</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 developer Frontier Developments had to walk back its use of generative AI characters portraits after widespread criticism. Activision has been skewered repeatedly for its generative AI use, including recent examples of an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-once-again-under-fire-over-alleged-generative-ai-use-now-for-a-fake-guitar-hero-game">ad for a Guitar Hero game that doesn't exist</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">certain Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assets.</a> Other games, such as Palworld, have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood">accused of using generative AI</a> but have gone to great lengths to prove the accusations were unfounded and that no generative AI was used.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of generative AI usage, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-review">gave The Alters an 8/10 in our review</a>, calling it "a highly atmospheric sci-fi character study mixed with simple but effective resource and base management that cleverly builds existential and interpersonal pressure throughout its story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

That then powers up Vivi, too. Market price is up to $9.10, over a 50% boost versus last month. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we covered in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-cards-spike-thanks-to-new-final-fantasy-synergies"><u>our recent synergies feature</u></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7YxR?object_uuid=67938489-581a-4492-bdf6-893e4937d6a5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Harmonic Prodigy</a> gives double Wizard triggers – nice! That means it's gone up by 118.70% in the past month (246.76% in three) – not so nice! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's good for those that own the card, not so good for those who are looking to pick it up standalone. Still, market is still just $12.75 right now, so it could be <em>a lot</em> worse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving away from Vivi, Tifa’s getting some love from <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKg47j?object_uuid=67938489-581a-4492-bdf6-893e4937d6a5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bristly Bill, Spine Sower</a>. This Outlaws of Thunder Junction card can help power up our martial artist heroine, but at a cost of almost $40 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another nifty synergy that's climbing is Perch Protection. This Instant has climbed from a dollar to almost $6, since it handily ties into Chocobo decks.</p><p id="crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers">Crashers: Doctor Whom?</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/mtg-final-fantasy-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-5-1751281272924.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As we also covered in our synergies feature, Doctor Who's <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xEZe?object_uuid=67938489-581a-4492-bdf6-893e4937d6a5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Barbara Wright</a> is a great companion (in and out of the TARDIS) for summon-focused Final Fantasy decks, and she’s dropping<em> ever so</em> <em>slightly</em>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She’s just now at $3.80, down from a $4.44 high a week back (albeit still massively <strong>up</strong> versus 3-months ago... 2135.29%!)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy’s Golbez, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRJ6K?object_uuid=67938489-581a-4492-bdf6-893e4937d6a5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crystal Collector</a> has dropped to well under $3 now, as has <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OkBL?object_uuid=67938489-581a-4492-bdf6-893e4937d6a5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Aerith, Last Ancient</a>, who was $15 just a short while ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpX1e?object_uuid=67938489-581a-4492-bdf6-893e4937d6a5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kefka, Court Mage</a> has seen a big drop since pre-release, but keeps climbing and dropping ever-so-slightly since. It’s just $4 right now.</p><p id="bonus-climbers-surge-foils"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bonus Climbers: Surge Foils">Climbers Again? A Surge [Foil] in Price</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/27/most-valuable-surge-foils-ign-mtg-final-fantasy-1751017874205.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/magic/final-fantasy?Language=English&amp;productLineName=magic&amp;q=surge+foil&amp;direct=true&amp;view=grid&amp;ProductTypeName=Cards&amp;page=1&amp;setName=final-fantasy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surge Foils</a>, which appear in other MTG Universes Beyond sets like Fallout and Warhammer 40K, are a unique style of foiling that is significantly <em>prettier </em>than their regular foil counterparts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER, currently has a $718.89 market price.  Yes, you read that correctly. He has extremely powerful abilities, and is now a game-changer in Pioneer Sacrifice decks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The market prices for some of these are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-most-expensive-surge-foils">obviously a little bit insane</a>, but I expect they'll go down a bit once the hype dies down. Though, that could be a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in the old days of Magic (like ten years ago), single card prices were based mostly on their age, availability, and playability. For awhile, cards like <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/100191/magic-magic-origins-jace-vryns-prodigy?Language=English&amp;direct=true&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jace, Vryn's Prodigy</a> were $100+ extreme outliers due to its power and prominence in that Standard format.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with Universes Beyond sets, casual Magic fans buying into the game to chase these gorgeous treatments have driven up prices. Jace is now sitting around $4 since it's been a victim of power creep, but I'm not sure these Final Fantasy Surge Foils will follow the same trend.</p><p id="sealed-sets"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Sets">MTG Sealed Sets</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything else Final Fantasy is pretty hot right now, so if you manage to find anything in stock, it might be worth picking up ASAP to avoid disapointment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more TCG discussion and market watch?
