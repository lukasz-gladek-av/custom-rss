            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-gets-its-first-ever-discount-at-woot<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">November is an excellent time to track down deals in the lead-up to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a>. Numerous retailers usually offer a variety of discounts for shoppers to check out, and Woot is one spot that's had several great game deals catch our eye recently. In particular, as part of its ongoing 'Fall In Love With Video Games' sale event, you can score <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wG12q?object_uuid=eb4dd661-3480-4a33-bcc1-890279fffda3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership there for $49.99</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Discounted at Woot</h2><div catalogid="9aa5e897-6851-4647-a77c-58034e329afb" id="210359"><div id="210359" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is $10 off its list price of $59.99 and marks its first-ever price drop. As with many game deals from Woot, though, it's important to <strong>keep in mind that it's probably not the North American version with ESRB rating</strong>. However, since the Switch is region-free, it'll play just fine regardless. Check it out at the link below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot's got a couple more game deals that are definitely worth checking out right now alongside Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-on-sale-woot">Sonic X Shadow Generations for the Switch has a great discount there to $39.99</a>, while the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/score-the-silent-hill-2-remake-for-ps5-at-its-lowest-price-yet">Silent Hill 2 Remake for PS5 is also enjoying a discount that brings it down to $59.99</a>. There's plenty more available as part of Woot's 'Fall In Love With Video Games' sale event as well, but there are soon to be even more video game deals with Black Friday coming up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We consider this sale event one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-video-games">best times of year to buy video games</a>, and for good reason. Considering how many retailers participate in the sale event, there are several different locations to turn to for discounts. And while we don't know what exactly will be in the sale, we've made some predictions of games and items we'd like to see on sale from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-game-deals-black-friday-what-to-expect-2024">PlayStation</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-deals-black-friday-what-to-expect-2024">Xbox</a> this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelance writer who works with the Guides and Commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 11, 2024 3:00 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-exists-in-part-because-younger-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-series-anymore-konami-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami has revealed that one of the reasons it greenlit the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake is because younger gamers aren’t familiar with the series anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to Play and shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-exists-because-konami-was-starting-to-get-worried-that-the-younger-generation-of-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-metal-gear-series-anymore/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, series producer Noriaki Okamura admitted Konami is looking to capture a new audience with the remake, which arrives 20 years after the original Metal Gear Solid 3 and nine years after the last mainline entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the things that really sparked us to do the remake in general is because we realized that a lot of the newer, younger generation of gamers aren’t familiar with the Metal Gear series anymore,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations. After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say — but again, who is Solid Snake?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, this is one of the reasons Konami chose the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater name for the remake, as opposed to simply calling it Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Timeline wise, Snake Eater is the first game in the series, so going with the Greek letter 'delta' helped get this new beginning across.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thr franchise began in 1987 with Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear, and last saw a mainline entry with Kojima’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain">Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain</a>, released in 2015. Spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-survive">Metal Gear Survive</a> launched in 2018, with only collections of older games coming out in the subsequent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it’s easy to understand where Konami is coming from here. Metal Gear is well-known by fans of a certain age and has enormous nostalgia potential, but without a brand new mainline entry in nearly a decade, interest among younger gamers probably isn’t where Konami wants it to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, after Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater comes out, where will Konami take the series next? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-had-a-pretty-rough-launch-so-konami-says-its-being-more-careful-with-vol-2">We know MGS: Master Collection Vol. 2 is in the works</a>, but could Konami be set to remake Kojima’s seminal Metal Gear Solid next? After that, could fans finally get a brand new Metal Gear Solid game? If so, would Konami continue the story as set out by Kojima, or start fresh?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Konami is yet to announce a release date, but it's due out on 	</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC at some point in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-datamine-alludes-to-expansion-set-in-january<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> players may want to get cracking Genetic Apex packs as quickly as possible as a datamine of the mobile game has alluded to expansion sets arriving in December and January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@CentroLeaks</a> revealed an event scheduled in the backend of the digital TCG that references A2 and is therefore seemingly linked to a new card drop. Genetic Apex, the first Pokémon TCG Pocket set and the only one currently available, is labelled as A1 in the game, so A2 is presumably the second full set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event is listed as beginning October 29 (the game's global release date) and running until January 29. It's dubbed "Period A1 to A2 (After Global Release) and therefore appears to indicate the end date of Genetic Apex being the main set in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Genetic Apex</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, another scheduled event could indicate a supplementary set or expansion to Genetic Apex coming in December. "Period A1 to A1a" is similarly listed as already begun but ends December 16, so players should perhaps expect a smaller card drop then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is far from an official announcement, of course, and no further details will be available until developer Creatures Inc. shares them itself. But a full release every three months lines up with the proper Pokémon TCG schedule and standard card game practice in general.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The December event is more mysterious, as Genetic Apex already includes 226 standard numbered cards and 60 super rare alternate arts. Collecting all of these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take upwards of a year</a>, so it's perhaps unlikely Creatures Inc. will expand the set even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event may point to a special event for Genetic Apex instead, where more packs become available, or perhaps even a new bumper booster pack that contains more cards. Doing something like this is fairly common practice in games, with the larger, more expensive packs usually only available by spending real money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only time will tell what these events actually are, but fans can enjoy the myriad existing events already added by Creatures Inc. in the meantime. One offers players a free Wonder Pick with the chance of pulling either a Meowth or Chansey alongside event tickets and Wonder Hourglasses, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-adds-new-rewards-and-missions-to-wonder-pick-event">its second part currently active</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A solo battle event <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">lets players take on a handful of water themed decks</a> for the chance of winning new promo cards including Lapras ex, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-pvp-event-today">a PVP event puts badges on the line</a> in true Pokémon fashion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo and Charizard are naturally dominating the meta so far</a>, but one outlier comes via Misty, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">whose heads or tails effect is driving many up the wall</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the collecting front, some players are focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-think-theyve-discovered-a-secret-way-to-get-super-good-cards">a conspiracy theory about crinkled corners</a> while most are swooning over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-swoon-over-mythical-god-packs-that-have-5-alternate-art-cards">mythical god packs that award five alternate art cards in one go</a>.
