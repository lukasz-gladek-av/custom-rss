            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is out today, over six years after its initial announcement. Fans who have been waiting that entire time for the game finally have their hands on it in what is sure to mark an exciting new era for a community that’s driven itself to often-surprising lengths of hype and anticipation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for one fan in particular, today is not just a beginning, it’s an ending, an ending of a nearly five-year project that’s become a staple part of the Silksong community during the long wait for Team Cherry’s game. Today, September 4, 2025, marks the final video for the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DailySilksongNews" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Daily Silksong News</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Daily Silksong News is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a YouTube channel run by Silksong community member Araraura, where he publishes a daily video covering what, if any, news about Hollow Knight: Silksong has surfaced on that day. But simple as the premise is, Daily Silksong News is impressive due to Araraura’s sheer dedication. Since the start of the channel, Araraura has made 1,693 videos. He tells me he hasn’t missed a single day.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/04/silksong-1756972150246.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Daily Silksong News can finally rest.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Araraura doesn’t self-describe as a content creator or streamer or anything like that. He’s simply a fan. He was inspired by a channel tackling a similar Herculean task <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EldenRingNews" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Elden Ring News</u></a>, which was conducted by a fan going by Mordecai and which similarly provided daily updates on the game in question. Araraura saw this channel and wondered if there was a similar daily update for Silksong. When he saw there was not, he decided, on the spot, to make it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as anyone with an interest in Silksong will know, most days over the past four years, there simply has been no Silksong news. Thus, the vast majority of the videos on Daily Silksong News are less than a minute long. These simple videos consist of a basic thumbnail showing the main character, Hornet, and the text “Daily News Day 1577 [or whatever number] News?: No”. The videos themselves are mostly just Araraura narrating the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Today is December 2023, 2023. This is Araraura, your host for today, bringing you your daily Silksong news. There has been no news to report for Silksong today. This has been your daily news for Silksong for today, December 23, 2023.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might imagine, days with news are a bit more interesting. News days feature Araraura providing a brief explanation of what the news actually is, typically only a few minutes long, as well as a “Yes” in the thumbnail declaring that there was, in fact, news on that date. Some days are “Maybe” or “No, but…” news days, where there’s no actual news but something relevant and Silksong-adjacent happened that Araraura found worth reporting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those days, however, are few and far between. Mostly, it’s just Araraura reciting the same no-news script. He tells me that as time went on, he looked for ways to spice up the videos. He began inviting guests on to read the news, largely focusing on bringing in members of the Hollow Knight community, such as noted Hollow Knight lore expert Mossbag. He once did a crossover with Mordecai, where Mordecai read the Silksong news and Araraura read Elden Ring news. Araraura also sometimes has incorporated other fun and funny elements into his videos, such as short video clips, images, or gags. These additional bits have become more prevalent in the later videos, Araraura tells me, as some friends in his Discord group got more involved and helped make various projects and video elements for the channel, including a recurring puppet cutaway gag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But mostly, for four-and-a-half years, it’s been the same update, day after day. And that’s suited Araraura just fine. The simplicity of the videos is what allowed him to keep going for so long. He tells me most of the videos take about 5-10 minutes to make. “Obviously, some of them take a very long time and a lot of effort from myself and from multiple other people who work on the videos, but the regular ones are just, record for 20 seconds, put it on Premier, and just change the numbers. That's how it works for the most part.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong Release Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s most impressive about Araraura’s effort, though, is his dedication. Easy as he makes it sound, Araraura says he’s never missed a daily update. He says when he wasn’t available on a given day, he’d record a “no news” video in advance, and “just hoped that there wouldn’t be Silksong news when I did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Usually, when we get Silksong news after a massive drought, the first thing I do is I just quickly try to record and edit video, and just upload as fast as I can, because it feels like it's my job, and it's something really important that I need to get done,” he tells me, remembering one particularly memorable news day. “The most viewed video on my channel is when we got the release year back in April, and that was right when I was in the middle of work. And when I saw this, I had to try to get back home as fast as I could to record. And by the time I got there, I was already kind of in a frenzy, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3QECuK0_tE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>you can even just hear it in the video</u></a>. I was just screaming.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That video in question has 1.5 million views and is, in fact, entertainingly frantic. But most of the videos on Araraura’s channel aren’t quite that big. Most of the “no news” videos have a few thousand views, unless there’s a particularly popular guest, which might bring them up into the tens of thousands. News days, of course, are far more popular, reaching into the hundreds of thousands of views. It’s not enough to make Araraura some kind of star YouTuber or anything, but he was able to make some money off the channel eventually.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/04/screenshot-2025-09-04-085244-1756972379175.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Big Silksong news day.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“At the start it took me half a year to get a channel monetized, because YouTube's requirement is to have 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in your videos, and it's really hard when your videos are like 20 seconds,” he says. “But yeah, eventually I made it, and it helped me build a nice side income. Not like something to live off of, but it was really nice financial support.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through it all, Araraura says he never even considered quitting, and was even prepared to keep on going even if Silksong didn’t release in 2025. Sure, he didn’t realize when he started that he was signing up for four-and-a-half years of this video series. He thought it would be a year or two, max. But it was so easy to keep going once he started, he just charged onward. “It didn't feel like daunting or exhausting, or anything like that. It was just five minutes. It's like brushing your teeth. You don't even really think about it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But today, that’s coming to an end. Araraura has published his final Silksong update to Daily Silksong News. In it, he does a face reveal, and shares some of his feelings about the channel and his work on it over the last few years. Turns out, as simple and goofy as his channel’s premise might be, it’s meant something to people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lately I've had a lot of people come up to me and tell me, ‘Thank you for going with the channel for this long and for giving us the news,’ all this stuff,” he says. “And it felt really surreal to see all of this. I knew I had a following and the people knew about my channel, but I don't know, seeing people being so, so grateful, it really hit in a different way.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even so, Araraura doesn’t plan to continue the updates, even if Silksong gets DLC, though he points out that one of the mods from his Discord server has<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DailySilksongDLCNews" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> just made a new channel specifically for that</u></a>. Instead, Araraura is going to hand out some giveaway keys for Silksong as he promised his following, and then he’s going to log off. No streaming, no videos, “full blackout mode, no internet, all Silksong,” he says. “I just want to fully be immersed in Silksong and just enjoy it in peace.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Araraura says there might be one thing that could get him to publish one last Daily Silksong Update. “Team Cherry, if you're reading this, hit me up on Discord. We will try to make an extra day for you on the channel or something.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Be sure to stay up-to-date with all the latest from IGN by clicking </em><a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJYGV?object_uuid=b89de07a-df65-427a-9fd2-14419cace841&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><em>here</em></u></a><em> and setting IGN as a preferred source in Google.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

This is the big anniversary update that makes a number of significant changes and additions to Saber Interactive’s explosive third-person action game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that while Patch 10 is live now, Season Pass 2 and the Black Templars and Imperial Fists cosmetics do not go live until later today, September 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 10.0 adds new game modes and maps, along with the Chaos Armour Pack, Champion Customisation, new weapons, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Chaos Armour Pack is available for free. You can finally change the armour set of your Heretic Astartes in PvP, but you have to unlock the set first. Each class requires you to score a certain amount of kills per match to unlock the corresponding skin.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/04/swaglords-driplegion-1756984305758.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Chaos Armour Pack is free with Update 10.0. Image credit: Focus Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The new PvP mode is Helbrute Onslaught, which is playable on all maps. Two teams of Chaos Marines fight to control strategic areas, but also to take control of the Helbrute. The first team to take control of an objective gets to control the Helbrute, until the opposite team takes it down. One player gets to control the Helbrute at a time, and this player is picked randomly among players who participated in securing the control point. For the team that failed to secure the first control point to have the Helbrute on their side, they need to slay their opponents’ Helbrute and secure a new designated control point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Controlling the Helbrute grants the team a strong advantage, but killing it rewards significant amounts of points to your team. The Helbrute uses a Helbrute Thunder Hammer in melee and a Plasma Cannon in range, and it can unleash a battle cry with its special skill to regenerate its HP.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/04/disturbingthepeace-1756984335976.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Patch 10 adds a playable Helbrute.

Unlike classic Operations, there are only two difficulty modes: Normal and Hard. What makes this new game mode different are the various Battlefield Conditions, which change every day and week and make each operation different. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield Conditions can either help or hinder your progress. Upon successful completion, you receive a new currency called Accolades, which can be exchanged for valuable rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are weekly and daily Stratagems, and each Operation has its own set of modifiers. <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/253-august-community-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publisher Focus Entertainment provided a few examples</a>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Summoner</strong>: Every uninterrupted call for Reinforcements summons the Extremis enemy.</li><li><strong>Where you aiming at</strong>: Friendly fire damage from firearms and explosives is enabled</li><li><strong>Cadia Stands</strong>: Imperial Guards spawn on levels.</li><li><strong>Hunted</strong>: An unkillable Lictor constantly pursues you.

The Chaos Spawn comes in three variations, and is swifter and more agile than its bulk suggests.

While existing Chapters like the Blood Angels and Salamanders are to receive new cosmetics, fan-favorite Chapters like the Raptors, Iron Hands, and Carcharodons will get their due time in the spotlight.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/04/spacemarine2-patchnote-10-anniversary-1920x1080-1756991568632.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Space Marine 2 Patch 10.0 contents.

Your task is to investigate and cleanse the Relay of lingering heretical presence, and confront a mighty enemy lurking in its deepest levels.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">NEW ENEMIES</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Mutalith Vortex Beast</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mutalith Vortex Beast is a new boss in Operation Vortex. It is a towering, warp-twisted monstrosity that drags reality into spiraling chaos. It rends and crashes with its claws and unleashes storms of sorcerous energy upon the Astartes.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Chaos Spawn variations</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chaos Spawns are new Majoris enemies that can appear in all Operations featuring the Thousand Sons.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chaos Spawns are dark abominations, powerful melee units infused with forbidden sorcery. They are fearsome opponents, especially when encountered in greater numbers. Their varied mutated limbs grant them a highly diverse and lethal moveset. However, it is an Astartes’ duty to study them and purge the heresy.</em></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/04/newboss-vortexbeast-2-1756991630349.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The new Mutalith Vortex Beast.

Wielded by the Vanguard, Assault and Bulwark classes, it allows a Space Marine to unleash a hail of blows upon their foes.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This is a fierce yet tactical weapon. Successfully executed perfect parry puts the Marine in a Power Stance, creating a moment of tactical choice: step back and release a devastating Power Wave or press forward to continue the fearsome combo.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Pyreblaster and Pyrecannon (for PvE)</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>In this update, we are introducing a new weapon: the Pyreblaster &amp; Pyrecannon, for the Tactical and Heavy classes.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The flamer weapons now apply a burning effect on enemies, which inflicts significant damage over time (which scales based on difficulty). In addition to that, flames also slow down Minoris enemies.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>An effective strategy would be to try to set as many enemies on fire and keep them burning.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">NEW PVE MODE "STRATAGEMS"</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Battlefield Conditions change weekly and daily, completing a Stratagem grants a new currency called “Accolades”.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reworked Data Refinement Shop on Battle Barge:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The “Data Refinement” shop has been renamed and now offers a variety of additional items.

The first team to take control of an objective gets to control the Helbrute, until the opposite team takes it down. One player gets to control the Helbrute at a time, and this player will be picked randomly among players who participated in securing the control point. For the team that failed to secure the first control point to have the Helbrute on their side, they will need to slay their opponents’ Helbrute and secure a new designated control point.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Controlling the Helbrute grants the team a strong advantage, but killing it rewards significant amounts of points to your team. One last thing, the Helbrute uses a Helbrute Thunder Hammer in melee, and a Plasma Cannon in range, and it can unleash a battle cry with its special skill to regenerate its HP.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">NEW PVP MAP: BRIDGE</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ADDED 6 CHAOS RELIC ARMOUR SETS FOR PVP</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>​These Armour Sets are now available to unlock by playing and scoring kills in Eternal War mode.

The problem is that other guns, like Bolt Rifle, Bolt Carbine, Stalker Bolter and even Heavy Bolt Rifle are always going to be more specialized and more effective at what they do no matter what. Since the gun has a very limited number of versions, its perk tree is also very, very limited and it's difficult to find a gameplay role with it. The correct move would probably be to merge it with Bolt Rifle variants, but the problem is that it would mess up with  saves too much and that drastic move is too risky.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>With this update we are going to try to make it a mix of all bolters, to make that "default" gun at least more effective, but I fear that this gun will always be outshadowed by more specialized bolters.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Base damage increased by 25%.</li><li>Added damage falloff curve from distance.
