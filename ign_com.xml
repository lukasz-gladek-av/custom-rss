It's a huge plastic expansion, the biggest since the faction launched, that includes new troops, new artillery, new heroes and new abominable intelligence. There's a new Combat Patrol (an army starter pack or a set to bulk out an existing force) for The Leagues of Votann, and check out Buri Aegnirssen, a specialist Tyranid hunter, below. Yes, that's a Tyranid Prime on top of his head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Supporting the release is a new Leagues of Votann Codex, packed with lore and new rules.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer: The Old World</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up was a reveal for Warhammer: The Old World. Brand new units are coming to the Tomb Kings of Khemri. There are two new Arcane Journals, the first dubbed The War of Settra's Fury, which was described as "a really cool way of looking at the lore of The Old World," the second called Dawn of the Storm Dragon.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-192127-1752862895173.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to Age of Sigmar, which celebrates its 10-year anniversary, there are two factions from the Grand Alliance of Death on their way with new units, new battletomes and new army rules.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have the Flesh-Eater Courts Death Battletome, alongside a new mini to support: High Falconer Felgryn. Also coming to the Flesh-Eater army is the Charnel Watch. And there's the Death Battletome for the Nighthaunt, packed with lore and "some significant defensive buffs." Check out the wonderfully-named Lord Vitriolic, below:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-193107-1752863496722.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Helsmiths of Hashut</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's a big one: the Chaos Dwarfs faction returns for Age of Sigmar as the Helsmiths of Hashut. This new faction includes the Infernal Cohort with Hashutite Spears, the War Despot, the Dominator Engine, and the Tormentor Bombard war machine. As you'd expect, the set includes a new Battletome.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer: Underworlds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop then revealed the Spitewood Expansion set for Warhammer: Underworlds. Designed as an expansion to the Embergard boxed set, Spitewood contains two brand new warbands, two new Rivals decks, a new double-sided board, and a token board that includes new feature tokens representing deposits of Aqua Ghyranis.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-195458-1752864905965.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Legions Imperialis</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaving Age of Sigmar behind, Games Workshop revealed new tanks for the Horus Heresy game, Legions Imperialis, including the Typhon Heavy Siege Tank Squadron, the Cerberus Heavy Tank Destroyer, and the Mastadon Assault Transport, the latter of which was described as the "30,000 equivalent of a siege tower."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-200120-1752865299831.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Also coming to the 30,000 setting is the MKII Assault Squad and the Journal Tactica: The Forges of Saturn.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-200506-1752865516174.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Black Library</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Scouring is confirmed! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/big-summer-warhammer-preview-adds-black-library-logo-and-now-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-are-hoping-games-workshop-is-finally-ready-to-move-the-narrative-forward">As fans had speculated</a>, The Scouring period of Warhammer 40,000's long history is getting its own novel series, kicking off with Ashes of the Imperium by Chris Wraight. This multi-book, multi-author series is set to reveal what happens to the Imperium and the Traitor Legions after the end of The Horus Heresy. Ashes of the Imperium will be released later in the year.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-200852-1752865809523.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">40K is getting five new Space Marine characters: Vulkan He’stan (Salamanders); Darnath Lysander (Imperial Fists); Aethon Shaan (Raven Guard); Caanok Var (Iron Hands); and Suboden Khan (White Scars). It's worth noting Aethon Shaan is the new Chapter Master of the Raven Guard, replacing Kayvaan Shrike, who's decided to step back from the top job and operate from the shadows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a series of Combat Patrols coming to accompany the release of the characters for the Imperial Fists, White Scars, Iron Hands, Raven Guard, and Salamanders.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-201450-1752866098139.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop announced the first ever officially licensed, wearable Space Marine helmet.

The lenses inside illuminate!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-202243-1752866572347.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Kill Team</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop announced a brand new Kill Team box set featuring the Necrons versus the Deathwatch, which Games Workshop said is probably the most requested Kill Team release ever. Tomb World sees Kill Team "return to the Close Quarters gameplay pioneered in Kill Team: Into the Dark, this time with an all-new Necron-themed killzone complete with shimmering portals, teleportation pads, and regenerating walls."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Tomb World Dossier book contains background lore for the two kill teams and the Tomb World of Somneft they’re fighting over, "setting up a decisive showdown between Kill Team Vaskovian and Amhetra’s Cryptoretinue."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's it!

This also mean said chase cards are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-cards-2025">worth significantly less</a>, but Japanese cards are far easier to get perfect grades in given they're always busting out of booster packs in perfect condition. Want a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Pokémon card collection</a> on a budget?

Whilst that unfortunately means it's still way above MSRP, some of these sets are at the best prices they've been in the last month.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet base set prices have been shifting noticeably ahead of the final sets Black Bolt and White Flare, with Psychic-type Illustration Rares like Ralts 211/198 and Kirlia 212/198 each climbing 28 percent this month while Gardevoir ex 245/198 now sits at $54.99 after a 25 percent jump. Miraidon ex and Koraidon ex are both trending upward as well, holding value around $23.99 each. At the same time several cards are sliding down as Fidough 213/198 dropped 15 percent, Armarouge 203/198 is down 11 percent, and Pachirisu 208/198 fell 19 percent. The steepest dips hit Dondozo 207/198 and Starly 221/198, now around $9.99 each after dropping 30 percent and 37 percent respectively, reflecting a market that is narrowing in on long-term playability and collector interest.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As newer Pokémon TCG sets grab the spotlight, Paradox Rift is seeing its high-rarity SIR ex cards drop in value while several Illustration Rares quietly climb due to shifting collector interest and low inventory. Cards like Altaria ex, Gholdengo ex, and Steelix have dropped between 16% and 25%, while Illustration Rares including Morpeko, Plusle, Minun, Groudon, and Iron Valiant ex are climbing fast, with Morpeko leading at a 43% increase. This mirrors earlier trends where less flashy cards gain traction as availability tightens.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Edge of Eternities Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering’s next set, Edge of Eternities, officially launches August 1 with preorders now live on Amazon for bundles including Play Booster Boxes, Commander Decks, and Collector Booster Boxes.

Fan-favorite tribes like Eldrazi and Slivers return alongside reprints of coveted Shock Lands. Wizards of the Coast is gradually revealing more details, with a full card gallery arriving July 18 and prerelease events happening July 25 through 31, so now is the time to lock in your preorder if you want first access.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Pricing Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a bit of a mixed back for Magic: The Gathering prices this week, so it's always worth double checking eBay before TCG Player and Amazon for a last minute bargain.

The HD-2D visuals really stand out with that mix of pixel art and depth that makes the world feel fresh but still familiar.
