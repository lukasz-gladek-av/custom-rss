We see Ellie, played by Bella Ramsey, view an infected whose breath releases the spores.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">You can‚Äôt stop this.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheLastOfUs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#TheLastOfUs</a> returns April 13 on Max. <a href="https://t.co/DH8UzAugIV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/DH8UzAugIV</a></p>‚Äî Max (@StreamOnMax) <a href="https://twitter.com/StreamOnMax/status/1898500551521825174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for The Last of Us Season 1 follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the video games, the cordyceps infection spreads via spores, which forces the characters to wear a gas mask at points. But for Season 1 of the TV show, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-hbo-swaps-spores-for-tendrils-in-its-most-horrifying-change-yet">spores were ditched in favor of tendrils</a>, whose menace certainly appears more horrifying and cinematic. In Season 1, we see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-episode-two-brings-one-of-the-games-creepiest-sequences-to-life"><u>clickers sprout terrifying tendrils</u></a> that simulate the way mushrooms communicate with each other through a root-like network.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a practical reason for the change, which is that using spores in the show would mean big-name stars like Pedro Pascal would be forced to wear a gasmask every other scene. While this works on The Mandalorian thanks to his cool helmet, a lot of the tension would be lost in The Last of Us, and tendrils are also way more menacing, visually speaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disturbing and it‚Äôs violative. I think it‚Äôs very primal in the way it invades your own body,‚Äù Mazin said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/last-of-us-clickers-flour-theory-game-changes-explained-1235495180/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a> about the decision to swap spores for tendrils, particularly in the final scene where Tess receives what can only be described as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-most-devastating-tv-deaths-of-all-time"><u>world‚Äôs worst goodbye kiss</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/10/infected-1741624851517.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The latest The Last of Us Season 2 trailer confirms the return of spores.

And then one shot you see in this trailer, there are things in the air."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mazin later confirmed "spores are back," before Druckmann added: "The reason [we‚Äôre doing it now], I mean, we really wanted to figure it out, and again, everything has to be drama. There had to be a dramatic reason of introducing it now. And there is."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Last of Us Season 2 Character Posters</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In other The Last of Us Season 2 news, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2s-abby-kaitlyn-dever-says-its-hard-not-to-see-those-things-on-the-internet">actress Kaitlyn Dever discussed playing Abby</a>, admitting she finds it hard to stop herself from looking at the reaction on the internet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">HBO's plans to extend The Last of Us Part 2 beyond a single season, unlike the critically acclaimed Season 1 which covered the entirety of the original game. Mazin has said previously that Part 2 features a lot more story to cover, so while Season 3 isn't greenlit as of yet, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-will-be-shorter-than-season-1-but-showrunners-tease-larger-potential-third-season"><u>they've built Season 2 with a "natural breakpoint" after just seven episodes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: HBO Max.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The appropriately named celebration always features announcements and treats for fans of the iconic plumber, and this year is no different. Although we‚Äôve not yet seen anything quite on the level of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mar10-day-2024-everything-announced-including-a-new-super-mario-bros-movie"><u>2024‚Äôs reveals</u></a>, which included the promise that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-new-super-mario-bros-movie-is-officially-in-development-and-will-arrive-in-april-2026-mar10-day"><u>The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2 will arrive next year</u></a>, 2025 has already delivered some exciting Mario news.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Mario Offerings for Nintendo Switch Online Subscribers</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just hours before MAR10 Day officially kicked off, Nintendo announced that the Super Mario Bros. 3 original soundtrack had been added to its Nintendo Music application for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. That means earworms like the World 1 Map tune Ground BGM are only a tap away, but there are even more deal sweeteners now available for Mario fans. Last Thursday, as an early surprise, Nintendo added the Game Boy releases of Mario‚Äôs Picross and Donkey to its library of Switch Online titles. It‚Äôs all available to help make MAR10 Day feel a bit more special right now.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Lego Mario Kat Set Drifts Into Stores This May</h3><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Here we go! üèÜ Launching May 15th üèÅ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOSuperMario?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#LEGOSuperMario</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKart</a> <a href="https://t.co/NZ13sCIFHo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NZ13sCIFHo</a></p>‚Äî Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1899083988142092785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo hasn‚Äôt been shy when it comes to adding more Lego sets based on its iconic cast of characters. While Mario has gotten plenty of love in this department in the past, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-reveals-170-mario-kart-set-specifically-designed-for-adult-builders"><u>new Mario Kart build</u></a> revealed as part of today‚Äôs festivities might be one of the toy line‚Äôs coolest yet. It‚Äôll cost a whopping $170 when it drops May 15, 2025, but it also manages to pack in quite a bit of detail into the 1,972-piece kit.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Super Nintendo World Sweepstakes Offers 4-Night Stay for Lucky Fans</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you‚Äôre looking for every way you could possibly celebrate Mario Day, this new sweepstakes has you covered.
