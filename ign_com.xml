"Sonic Frontiers is an ambitious open-world adventure that mostly succeeds at mixing up the Sonic formula, even when some of its ideas fall flat," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-frontiers-review">IGN said in our 7/10 review</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Forspoken Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A PlayStation 5 exclusive, Forspoken arrived with grand promises of an open world full of magic but fell flat on release due to a lacklustre story, gameplay, and performance. "Forspoken’s flashy combat and parkour can be fun, but they aren’t enough to make its cliche story and barebones open world very interesting to explore," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forspoken-review">IGN said in our 6/10 review</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just in time for the holidays, party game Rabbids: Party of Legends brings mayhem to PlayStation through four player local multiplayer. "Embark on a legendary journey filled with colorful characters with the Rabbids in this uproarious party game," reads the synopsis.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">WRC Generations Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another entry in the WRC racing series, WRC Generations is promised to be "an authentic and comprehensive rally racing simulation, giving players the chance to drive powerful cars in the most famous rallies of all time." <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wrc-generations-review">It earned an 8/10 in IGN's review</a>, in which we said: "With its absolute mountain of rally locations, WRC Generations is uncommonly generous package for gravel groupies, asphalt addicts, and mud-slinging maniacs alike."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">F.I.S.T. Forged in Shadow Torch is described as a "diesel-punk exploratory platformer" where players must fight through intense combat sequences, overcome challenging puzzles, and interact with an anthropomorphic cast of vibrant characters.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screens  -  Jurassic World Evolution 2</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When managing zoos becomes too tiresome, players can turn up the intensity by putting some dinosaurs on show. Jurassic World Evolution 2 allows just that: dinosaur park management simulation where players take charge of their own Jurassic World park. "While park management and customization aspects are a bit shallow, Jurassic World Evolution 2 has tons of excellent dinosaurs and exciting ways to interact with them," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-2-review">IGN said in our 7/10 review</a>.</p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2024/12/5cf60c15d992071250b45318795c2447f9384e22.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If that's too much, players also have the option for something cozier. "As the Barista in late-night coffee shop, Coffee Talk offers players friendly conversation and late-night warm drinks to the colourful and fantastical inhabitants of alternative-Seattle including elves, aliens, and orcs," its synopsis reads.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fancy a double shot? "Dust off your coffee machine and prepare your warmest smile to meet your favorite customers again in the second episode of Coffee Talk: Hibiscus &amp; Butterfly, a coffee brewing and heart-to-heart talking simulator."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another quieter game comes in the form of A Space for the Unbound, a 2023 game with pixel art and a heartwarming story. "A Space for the Unbound is a slice-of-life set in the late 90s rural Indonesia that tells a story about overcoming anxiety, depression, and the relationship between a boy and a girl with supernatural powers," its synopsis reads.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What's better than one dog? A two headed dog? Maybe. "In Phogs! you play as a two headed dog called Red and Blue. Linked by a stretchy belly, you’ll need to bark, bite and bounce your way through obstacles set across the themed worlds of Food, Sleep and Play."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More multiplayer fun comes in Biped, "a co-op action-adventure game that emphasizes real-time collaboration between two players" according to its official synopsis. "Guide Aku and Sila, two charming bipedal robots, through intricate paths leading to planetary beacons."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, virtual reality fans can this month enjoy Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge - Enhanced Edition. IGN called it "an excellent way to showcase the best features of a fancy new PlayStation VR2," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-tales-from-the-galaxys-edge-enhanced-edition-review">IGN said in our 7/10 review</a>. "The first few hours of the story are its Episodes 1 and 2 (bad) but then things turn around and immerse us in Star Wars greatness."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-meet-the-medieval-cast-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't need to have played the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance to get up to speed with the sequel, thanks to an extended intro that fills you in on the broader details. But it might help to know a bit about the main cast before you set off into the medieval Bohemian countryside. The story features a rich cast made up of both real historical figures and fictional ones, and the politics of it all can be tricky to untangle. Luckily, we've got you covered. Let's meet the characters of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be warned that these bios contain some spoilers from the first game!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Wenceslaus IV and Sigismund of Hungary: A Clash of Kings</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1378, 25 years before the events of Kingdom Come: Deliverance, the emperor Charles IV, who was widely regarded as a pretty cool guy, died. As is often the case when a really cool king or emperor dies, this led to an inconvenient series of events. His son Wenceslaus became his successor to the throne of Bohemia, and gained a reputation for spending his days doing sod all, not showing much interest in his kingly responsibilities.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In response to this, his younger half-brother, Sigismund of Hungary, decided to make a play for the Bohemian throne and took Wenceslaus prisoner. During the events of the first game, he is seen riding around demanding the loyalty of local nobles and burning down villages he believes are harboring rebels – including Skalitz, the hometown of our protagonist, Henry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In real life, it was a complicated situation with no clear good guys and bad guys, necessarily. I mean, if you ask me, pretty much all medieval nobles were bad guys. But in the context of KCD, Wenceslaus is the good and true king and Sigismund is the plunderous pretender. That's how Henry sees it, anyway. And if the guy on one side of a civil war had burned down my village and killed my parents, I'd probably agree.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As an additional fun fact, the real-life Sigismund founded the chivalric Order of the Dragon. You may have heard of it, since a certain Romanian prince, Vlad Dracul, was nicknamed such for being a member of it. His son, Dracula ("son of the dragon"), would go on to be even more famous.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Henry of Skalitz: The Blacksmith's Son</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The protagonist of both Kingdom Come: Deliverance games is a common lad named Henry who saw his whole life go up in flames and his family murdered. The son of a blacksmith, he was forced to make his way in the world without many useful skills to speak of – the very picture of a level-one RPG character. But steadily, over the course of the first game, he became a capable swordsman, a daring adventurer, and even learned to read and write – which was a rare enough skill in the middle ages, even among the nobles, that it was practically a superpower.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Henry becomes involved with a faction of nobles who oppose Sigismund and want to see Wenceslaus restored to the Bohemian throne, rising from his lowly status to be a trusted and valued retainer. He also spends some time as a monk. It's kind of a long story. But he also has a more specific quest: retrieving the stolen sword he and his father made for their lord, Radzig Kobyla, before the village was attacked.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Istvan Toth: A Big Ol' Jerk</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the jerk who stole said sword. A Hungarian noble and supporter of Sigismund, he was the main antagonist of the first game and managed to wriggle free from the good guys' grasp by exchanging some hostages. While Henry certainly feels a sense of duty to Wenceslaus, his more personal motivation is getting that dang sword back from Toth. And then probably giving it back, pointy end first, if we're being honest. His whereabouts are currently unknown.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Sir Radzig Kobyla: A Friendly Noble</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lord of Skalitz before its destruction, Sir Radzig is part of the pro-Wenceslaus faction, which is why Sigismund saw his seat of power ransacked. Also – last warning for spoilers – he's Henry's real, biological father. Which sort of makes Henry nobility. Or at least, there is a nobleman with a very strong interest in his future and wellbeing. Martin the blacksmith is still definitely Henry's father figure. But Sir Radzig has become a very important man in his life.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Sir Hans Capon: Your Spoiled BFF</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Sir Hans Capon is a young nobleman about Henry's age and a member of Wenceslaus' faction who plays a much larger role in KCD2 than he did in the first game, being Henry's main compatriot. They're not always the best of friends, though. Hans is a bit of a playboy nepo baby who was raised with the proverbial silver spoon in his mouth and tends to act petulant and entitled, often to Henry's frustration. He's also quite easily distracted by women.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the start of KCD2, Henry and Hans have been dispatched on a mission to feel out which of the remaining Bohemian nobles might be willing to stand up against Sigismund and help restore Wenceslaus to the throne. And while he's not entirely apathetic to politics, he mostly looks at this as an opportunity for travel and adventure. To be blunt, he's a bit of a dick. But he seems to have a good heart, even if he doesn't normally let it guide him. Can we fix him? That remains to be seen.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Theresa: The Girl Who Saved Your Sorry Butt</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A fellow refugee from Skalitz who now lives with her uncle, Theresa is a bold woman who has saved Henry's life more than once. She's also the potential main love interest in KCD1, if you choose to pursue her side quests. It's not clear what role, if any, she will play in KCD2. But especially considering she and Henry were likely to have become romantically involved, I would be somewhat surprised if we've already seen the last of her.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Sir Divish: The Guy Who Saved Your Sorry Butt</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Sir Divish is the Lord of Talmberg, where Henry took refuge right after the destruction of Skalitz. The fortress was later seized in an intrigue orchestrated by Toth, and the climax of the first game involves a siege to reclaim it. He is, along with Radzig, one of the main conspirators of the Wenceslaus faction, and a very shrewd leader who has kept his people safe by holding his allegiances close to his chest.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Markvart von Aulitz: Probably The Real Final Bad Guy</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If I'm being honest, I don't give Istvan Toth long to live. The fact that we didn't get to stick it to him at the end of the first game was a huge tease, and he only made it out by the skin of his teeth. Markvart is a bit higher up the food chain, as one of Sigismund's main army commanders and the man who led the attack on Skalitz. He was a somewhat distant enemy in the first game, seeming almost untouchable. But if I had to place my bets on who we'll be crossing swords with at the end of KCD2? I think it's probably this guy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That should give you a pretty good idea of which important pieces are on the board at the start of this new adventure. For more, stay tuned all December long as our exclusive IGN First coverage of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 continues.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sony later decided to kill the game entirely, and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord was the latest in a string of recent hero shooter flops, which includes Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Post-launch content for that game comes to an end early 2025, just a year after launch, having left a $200 million hole in publisher Warner Bros.’ finances.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase’s Marvel Rivals, however, appears to have avoided a similar fate. It is a free-to-play live service hero shooter in the Overwatch style and benefits from the power of the Marvel brand, but it clearly clicked with the audience, hitting an impressive 10 million players in just three days.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/marvel-rivals-dev-concord-failed-it-didnt-bring-any-unique-value/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer.com</a>, Marvel Rivals game director Thaddeus Sasser said Concord “didn’t bring any unique value proposition,” which contributed to its failure. But speaking more generally about the hero shooter market, Sasser said live service games need a hook to convince players of already successful hero shooters to jump ship having already invested their time and money in those games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s a switching cost,” Sasser said. “I’ve already invested in Overwatch, I’ve got 15 skins for Pharah, I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, Sasser said, the market is incredibly difficult to predict, and game developers never know how popular their game will be until it’s actually out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a game developer you’re always worried until the audience has responded,” Sasser continued. “The truth is that I don’t think anybody can accurately predict this or the game industry would be radically different today. There’s a lot of games that come out that people are like, ‘It’s going to do well,’ then it flops or people come out and go, ‘It’s going to flop,’ and it succeeds amazingly. So, I think it’s really hard to tell ahead of time and you’re always worried about that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Marvel Rivals, Sasser suggested its superhero factor is the reason fans are willing to leave their favorite games behind to give it a shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t know about you, but when I heard the concept of the game I was like, ‘Oh my God I want to go be Storm in a game, I want to go be Doctor Strange in a game. I want to be those heroes in the game, that sounds awesome.’ And of course my mind immediately leapt to all the cool possibilities you could have with that. That’s what I think will pull people in as well too. If we’ve done our jobs well, they’ll love what they play and they’ll want to play some more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For NetEase, it will be hoping not only to keep Marvel Rivals’ player count as high as possible for as long as possible (something that’s proved particularly tricky for live service games of late), but to make enough money from players to meet the company’s internal revenue projections. To that end, Marvel Rivals sells a battle pass and premium skins, but are they convincing players to open their wallets? Early signs suggest they are — Marvel Rivals is the second top-selling game on Steam by revenue, behind only Grinding Gear Games’ action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/path-of-exile-2"><u>Path of Exile 2</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep an eye on the latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-codes">Marvel Rivals codes</a> for free skins, and vote on the strongest Marvel Rivals characters in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvel-rivals/Marvel_Rivals_Characters">community tier list</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
