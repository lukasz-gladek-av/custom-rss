            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-and-limbo-are-currently-free-on-the-epic-games-store<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">One of the better offers in recent memory.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Epic Games Store is giving away a beloved indie title and the most recent Borderlands game as part of <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its weekly rollout of free PC games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an especially notable addition to Epic’s long-running free game promotion, which sees the company dropping a variety of titles for all Epic Games Store users at no additional cost every week. This week, PC users can add Playdead’s breakout video game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/limbo"><u>Limbo</u></a>, and Gearbox’s Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired Borderlands spinoff, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands"><u>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</u></a>, to their libraries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both titles are available to nab from now to next Thursday, June 5, at 8am PT / 11am ET, at which point they’ll no longer be free to own. Even if you don’t find yourself playing games on PC very often, you might as well sign into an Epic Games Store account and claim both games for the future just in case.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is a Borderlands side story that launched for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S in early 2022. While previous entries in the series see players team up to loot and shoot across twisted sci-fi settings, this spinoff drops fans into a fantasy setting with a few gameplay shakeups, such as new weapon types and fleshed-out character customization, to keep things interesting. Thanks in part to a surprisingly star-studded cast that includes Andy Samberg, Wanda Sykes, Will Arnett, and more, we felt Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands was a fitting addition to the Borderlands universe, giving it an 8/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review-pc-xbox-playstation"><u>our review</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Limbo, meanwhile, is a much more scaled-down adventure that sees players controlling a small child as they trudge through an unforgiving, colorless world. It’s a short story that <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/5304" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>HowLongToBeat</u></a> says takes just over three hours to complete, but it’s been more than enough to leave an impression on gamers for nearly 15 years. We gave it a 9/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/02/limbo-review-2"><u>our original review</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands and Limbo follow <a href="https://in.ign.com/sifu/231653/news/free-video-games-this-week-epic-games-is-offering-sifu-gigapocalypse-and-deliver-at-all-costs-amazon" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>last week’s free Epic Games Store titles</u></a>, which included Deliver At All Costs, Gigapocalypse, and Sifu.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hasbro-reveals-marvel-vs-capcom-inspired-marvel-legends-figures<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Minus the Capcom, unfortunately.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro wants to take Marvel Legends fans for a ride this year, as they've revealed a new wave of Marvel Gamerverse action figures inspired by the classic Marvel vs. Capcom games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out the slideshow gallery below for a closer look at these stylish new figures, including new takes on Wolverine, Thanos, Venom, Captain America, Juggernaut, and more:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These figures will be released as both two-packs and single figures, depending on the size of the figures in question. The full Marvel vs. Capcom lineup includes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Wolverine vs. Silver Samurai</li><li>Psylocke vs. Thanos</li><li>Captain America vs. Venom</li><li>War Machine vs. Omega Red</li><li>Gargantos (formerly known as Shuma-Gorath)</li><li>Juggernaut</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">While Hasbro has released most of these characters in Marvel Legends form in the past (save for Gargantos), these figures are embellished to better capture the dynamic sprite designs from the classic games. For example, Wolverine has the exaggerated claws and mask, while Venom is decked out in his game-accurate blue color scheme. The Psylocke figure in particular showcases the extreme articulation possible with these new figures.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, not every character from the Marvel vs. Capcom games is represented here, but collectors can always look to past Marvel Legends releases to fill out their lineup. At this point, even relatively more obscure characters like Marrow and Blackheart have been featured in the Marvel Legends line. The bigger challenge is assembling the Capcom side of the roster. Might we recommend Jada Toys' Street Fighter line when it comes to Ryu, Chun-Li, and the rest of the Street Fighter gang?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro also showed off their line of The Fantastic Four: First Steps figures, which includes the titular foursome along with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantastic-four-mcu-silver-surfer-shalla-bal-woman">Julia Garner's Silver Surfer</a>. Check them out in the slideshow gallery below:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Preorders for The Fantastic Four: First Steps figures will open on the Hasbro Pulse website and other retailers on Friday, May 30 at 10am PT, with the figures slated for release in Summer 2025. Preorders for the Marvel Gamerverse figures will open throughout the month of June, with the figures expected to release in Fall 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until then, why not check out <a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/marvel?srsltid=AfmBOoqL6mV0yFZ4wpcR_14mfT7FbYSdT2QrDPog3nuG3yTG45ww6dRO" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the many Marvel collectibles available on the IGN Store</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.
