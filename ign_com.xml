It’s an 834-piece build, so is ideal for intermediate builders, and shows off arguably the most iconic helmet in cinematic history (seriously, who comes close other than Stormtroopers?).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Target also has some Apple tech deals.

I’ll be honest, there’s a good chance an M5 version arrives in a few weeks, but this is a phenomenally powerful tablet that can take advantage of iOS 26’s new features like multitasking and more Mac-like features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Apple deals continue, with half off the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8MwE?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Beats Studio Pro</u></a> over-ear headphones, and 32% off the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2VOd?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>AirPods Pro 2</u></a>, although expect the latter to get cheaper for Black Friday since the third-generation ones are out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, you can get a compact <a href="https://zdcs.link/QdpMl6?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Anker Power Bank</u></a> for $14.99, saving around $10 - ideal for charging your phone while out and about. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up Target is running a <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBDd54?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Buy 2, Get One Free</u></a> promotion across books, movies, music, and uh, Funko Pop figurines. If you’ve been lacking in any of those areas, now’s the time to splurge, with books like the recently released Alchemised, movies like Moana 2 and Thunderbolts, and more included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 gamers can pick up some first-party exclusives on the cheap, too. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8Vg0?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>The Last of Us Part 1</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjld0?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Gran Turismo 7</u></a> both see 56% discounts, dropping to $29.99 each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally (ha!) the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwnv0?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy Limit Break Commander Deck</u></a> is now cheaper than MSRP. This is the one that’s tended to hold its value since launch in June, and it’s now reduced by 22% - and you don’t even have to be a Target Circle member for this one, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

This includes plenty of board games, if you're looking to stock up on some new ones to keep you busy as the cooler months start to roll in. One of the best deals to cross our radar is on the racing board game <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqJJV?object_uuid=450d1954-60f2-4517-9c6f-d337f5f36d34&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0BGXPZG4B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Heat: Pedal to the Metal</a>, which has dropped to a new low price just for Prime members.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prime Big Deal Days: Heat: Pedal to the Metal Board Game for $47.99</h2><div catalogid="54319546-e7ab-4e72-a797-ce72aa73d05a" id="229300"><div id="229300" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Asmodee HEAT: Pedal to the Metal Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqJJV?object_uuid=450d1954-60f2-4517-9c6f-d337f5f36d34&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0BGXPZG4B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Heat: Pedal to the Metal</a> is currently on sale for $47.99 for Prime members as part of Amazon's October Prime Day event.

There are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda plans to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps it’s more likely that we’ll get further updates on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, which just announced the upcoming Burning Springs update and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walton-goggins-is-set-to-play-the-ghoul-from-the-fallout-tv-show-in-fallout-76-but-how-does-the-character-fit-in-the-fallout-76-timeline">the addition of The Ghoul from Prime Video’s Fallout TV show</a>, featuring the likeness and voice work from Walton Goggins himself. It’s also worth noting that Season 2 of Fallout, which is set in New Vegas, is due out this December, so maybe we’ll get a new trailer or images.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success">Bethesda Softworks head Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</a>. Howard opened up about the future of the hit post-apocalyptic RPG series during <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?si=Ua6SywsuPtdIr0yv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with YouTube content creator MrMattyPlays</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76… we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans slowly flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG, it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series reached a new level of attention.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2: Who's Confirmed to Return and Who's New?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Howard wouldn't budge when it came to desires for a substantial video game release. For him, it comes down to wanting to treat Bethesda's franchises with care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game," he said. "And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
