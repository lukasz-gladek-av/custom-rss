"I think there's such a rich lore to that game that could be explored in a TV or movie adaptation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what are the chances the Bioshock movie actually gets made? In July last year, producer Roy Lee said that, following leadership changes, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflixs-bioshock-film-is-still-in-the-works-but-is-being-reconfigured-sdcc-2024">the video-game-to-movie BioShock adaptation had been “reconfigured,” resulting in a “more personal” film</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lee said some of the changes came from lower budgets from Netflix. Details about the BioShock movie’s plot have not been revealed, so it’s unclear what it would have looked like before the shift. Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence is still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflixs-bioshock-movie-has-its-director"><u>attached to direct</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The new regime has lowered the budgets,” Lee said at the time. “So we’re doing a much smaller version. It’s going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Quaid’s comments on BioShock come alongside an admission that he looks a lot like video game action star Max Payne, whose likeness is based on Remedy writer Sam Lake. Indeed, there are shots from Quaid’s new action movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/novocaine-2025">Novocaine</a> that have caused fans to wonder if it’s a Max Payne movie in disguise.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Live action Max Payne. Seems so real so worth it. This is Max Payne. You got me watching this now. Even the woman looks like the woman from Max Payne 2 lol. The resemblance is almost as if NovoCaine characters (basically is) by the same actor (Jack Quad looking like Sam Lake) <a href="https://t.co/kawh2C1B2n" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/kawh2C1B2n</a></p>— Adam Owns 6 (@AdamOwns6) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamOwns6/status/1900843671651557849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, it seems Quaid is less familiar with Max Payne, which is currently getting the remake treatment from Remedy in a deal with original publisher and rights holder Rockstar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've seen people say that I look like Max Payne, and when I've looked at the box art, even I did a double-take," Quaid continued. "I love Rockstar's games, but unfortunately I've never played that one - it's next on the list, for sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apart from Bioshock, Quaid loves FromSoftware games. In the same Reddit AMA, Quaid said he loved the challenge presented by the likes of Bloodborne and Elden Ring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm a huge video game nerd,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j8e1wm/comment/mhexakq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>. “And lately I've been diving headfirst into the FromSoftware library. I beat Bloodborne, then I beat Sekiro, and now I'm going full boar into Elden Ring. Actually, the thing I use Reddit the most for is tips and tricks on beating Fromsoft's bosses. I love how challenging the games are - it took me a while to get into them, but now I'm obsessed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-fans-notice-a-neat-detail-hidden-in-the-eyes-of-its-final-boss<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Little details can add a lot of character when it comes to the many monsters of Capcom's Monster Hunter series. When it comes to one of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' biggest battles, eagle-eyed players have noticed one tiny detail that lends credence to a running theory. It's all in the eyes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for the final boss and story of Monster Hunter Wilds' low rank campaign follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">After fighting through the roster of Monster Hunter Wilds' fearsome foes, including the souped-up Guardians, you'll eventually come face-to-face with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Zoh_Shia">Zoh Shia</a>. This enemy is the final bout for low-rank Hunters to clear in Wilds, and it's a doozy. It also might feel a little familiar, if you've played some past Monster Hunter games, and that seems pretty intentional.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1jc61tr/some_rather_disturbing_implications_have_emerged/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j8gv1g/interesting_details_about_zoh_shia/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users</a> have pointed out that Zoh Shia's eyes bear a striking resemblance to Fatalis'. Fatalis is an infamous and powerful species of dragon in Monster Hunter's universe, able to raze kingdoms and cause mass devastation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a neat, tiny detail you might have missed in all the chaos of battling Zoh Shia, but it's also not the only signifier pointing towards a link to Fatalis. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1jc61tr/comment/mhzo4wa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one replier pointed out</a>, many aspects of the Zoh Shia fight share similarities with Fatalis bouts. The monster has moves from Black, White, and Crimson Fatalis, and has other small cosmetic similarities like its horns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Zoh Shia also draws on other classic, terrifying monsters — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1jc61tr/comment/mhzr8ws/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find some more here, in this reply</a> — Fatalis definitely seems like a core touchstone. What does it ultimately mean, though?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, keep in mind Zoh Shia is a created monster. And if Zoh Shia was made to combat something or counter a threat, what kind of threat would be countered by a Fatalis-like monster? It opens up a lot of fun theorycrafting for where Monster Hunter Wilds' assumed expansion could go. Most importantly, this connection teases that there are even bigger, badder monsters to contend with further down the line.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It might be a while until Monster Hunter Wilds theory-crafters see their guesses pan out or not, though. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-gets-early-april-release-date-adds-an-endgame-hub-for-players-to-gather">next big update will be in April</a>, which will bring some more hunts to the title alongside other additions, like an endgame hunter hub. So for now, best to just get your rank up high and be prepared for whatever kind of monster awaits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Things_Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Doesn%27t_Tell_You_-_Tips">what Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you</a>, and a guide to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">all 14 weapon types</a> in the game. We’ve also got a detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds walkthrough</a> in progress, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Multiplayer_Guide_-_Crossplay,_Link_Parties_and_More">Monster Hunter Wilds multiplayer</a> guide to explain how to play with friends, and if you’ve played one of the open betas, here’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/How_to_Transfer_Beta_Character_Creator_Data">how to transfer your Monster Hunter Wilds Beta character</a> over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Monster Hunter Wilds review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Monster Hunter Wilds continues to smooth off the rougher corners of the series in smart ways, making for some extremely fun fights but also lacking any real challenge.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
