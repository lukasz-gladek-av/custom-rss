A small number of popular mats, like fan-favorite <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBDeLV?object_uuid=6958a291-dcbb-44cb-a594-4da64607c061&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi, Stray Black Mage</a> are sold out, but there are many other mats with incredible art to pick from at new discounted prices. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Playmats On Sale</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're new to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/trading-card-marketplace-tcgplayer-has-a-special-offer-this-weekend">TCGs</a>, people use playmats as a way to show off their favorite art or accomplishments, and also for practical reasons: have you tried picking up cards off of a kitchen table? I assure you, it gets annoying <em>fast</em>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Final Fantasy crossover set that launched this past June, TCG accessory maker Ultra Pro released tons of playmats featuring some of the most iconic characters and moments from throughout the game series' long history, including Y'shtola from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiii">Lightning from XIII</a>. Mats for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII</a> characters Cloud and Tifa feature the new art from their cards, and some mats, like those for Clive or Sephiroth, are double-sided to represent mechanics of the cards they're based on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whichever Final Fantasy character speaks to you the most, odds are there's a playmat for you to bring to your game night or local game store for some cardboard slinging. These also make great mousepads if you're in the market to spruce up your home office or gaming setup. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've been on the lookout for MTG Final Fantasy cards, Amazon has the Revival Trance Commander deck featuring Terra <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-commander-deck-is-better-than-half-price">on sale for 53% off</a>, and Final Fantasy play booster boxes (30 packs) are at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-boosters-down-to-lowest-price-ever-for-black-friday">their lowest price ever</a> for Black Friday, down to $162.57 (22% off). </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">More Magic: The Gathering Gifts</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out our detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-the-gathering-gift-ideas">Magic: The Gathering gift guide</a> for inspiration while shopping for that special Planeswalker in your life.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a Nintendo Switch or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> owner, there is no better series of games to collect than Mario. The plumber has had some of his best adventures ever across the two systems, and this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday</a>, you can save on select Mario games for a limited time. Nintendo rarely puts its games on sale, so now is the time to pick these Mario games up before deals run out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Black Friday Nintendo deals</a> have been very popular so far and have mostly sold out at Amazon. We've included the other retailers that still have the games in stock.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Mario Switch Game on Sale for Black Friday 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">First up, it's hard to beat <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review">Super Mario Odyssey</a> for only $29.99. Mario's quest to stop Bowser from forcibly marrying Princess Peach sees him traversing various Kingdoms with a new friend named Cappy, a sentient hat creature and this game's central gimmick. Mario can throw Cappy to possess and take control of enemies, inanimate objects, and more. If there's one game from this list I cannot recommend enough, it's Super Mario Odyssey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another fantastic Nintendo Switch game on sale is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/28/luigis-mansion-3-review">Luigi's Mansion 3</a>, starring Mario's ghost-hunting brother. This time, Luigi enters a giant hotel with Mario, Toad, and Princess Peach for vacation, but as always, things go horribly wrong. One of the great new features involves solving puzzles using a cloned Luigi, named Gooigi, who can walk on spikes and squeeze through bars to get to places Luigi otherwise can't reach. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-black-friday-deal-2025">Paper-Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> was one of the best Switch games of 2024, and this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-video-games-best-early-deals">Black Friday</a>, you can save 50% on the beloved remake. Originally released for GameCube, The Thousand-Year Door brings a fantastic story, great characters, and a satisfying turn-based RPG combat system. The Nintendo Switch remake added numerous quality-of-life features, like the Partner Ring to switch Partners on the fly, a fast travel system to cut down on backtracking, and more. And that's not to mention the overhauled graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-showtime-review">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> is on sale for $39.99 for Black Friday. Princess Peach must defend the stage in multiple plays against threats from a new group of enemies in this action-packed adventure. Each play brings a different outfit and ability set for Peach, opening up a completely new gameplay style. This is unlike any other Mario adventure, so if this one went under your radar last year, it's a great time and a worthy addition to your Nintendo Switch library.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Great Nintendo Switch Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While there aren't any <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-console-best-black-friday-deals-2025">Nintendo Switch 2 console deals available</a>, you can still get the bundles before Christmas if you buy now. The Mario Kart World bundle includes a copy of the latest Mario Kart game while shaving off some of the cost of buying it separately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.
