Its promise of a back-to-basics approach for the series has attracted a lot of attention, especially in the Call of Duty community.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/img-4509-1760111192999.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shipment recreated in Battlefield 6 Portal. Image captured in-game by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players can hop into the community tab on the main menu and play on the close-quarters map for themselves right now by simply searching “Shipment” in the Search Experiences or Browse Servers tab. It’s chaotic, noisy, cramped, and constantly riddled with bullets or, in other words, exactly the same as it is in Call of Duty. There are even some Shipment 24/7 servers already live for those looking to dive headfirst into the action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most popular result already features more than one hundred likes and sends their thanks to X/Twitter user PR officer at Deep Worlds, <a href="https://x.com/Matavatar/status/1976422539279868200" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Matavatar</u></a>, who is responsible for bringing Shipment in Battlefield 6 to life.

It’s mostly been used to recreate and remix fan-favorite experiences from across Battlefield’s long history, but Battlefield 6 removes many of the restrictions, encouraging imaginative fans to even bring maps from other franchises.

The bad news, the prices might be a little too hot to handle for some.

You're getting nine Mega Evolution booster packs, one full-art foil promo card featuring Riolu or Alakazam, 65 card sleeves, 40 energy cards, a player’s guide to the Mega Evolution expansion, six damage-counter dice, one competition-legal coin-flip die, and the collector’s box to hold everything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MSRP is $49.99, but these run at a 100% markup right now, and the market price sits around $90-$100 at the time of writing. So, while Amazon does have this in stock, it is also listed at <em>market </em>price ($99.99), not MSRP. It's good for those who have the cash and want an easy and reliable free delivery. You might even have some gift card credit leftover you want to use.</p></div><div catalogid="4aaeaa5d-9765-4a22-8fef-b266790ea2f0" id="227470"><div id="227470" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Booster Bundle (6 Packs)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mega Evolution Booster Bundle is in similar situation, and in stock for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgykM?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$59.99 at Amazon</a>. That's around a 100% markup from the MSRP of $29.99. It includes six Mega Evolution boosters, which works out at almost exactly $10 per pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, if those prices arent what you're looking for, you're next best bet for finding ETBs or Booster Bundles for the new set is via trusted resale sites like <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7Gpv?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>.

There was also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-preorder-walmart-plus-early-access-in-stock">Phantasmal Flame preorders</a>, including ETBs for $55, another giant saving considering these go for $150+ resale right now as well. There was a bunch more included as well, such as action figures, Magic: The Gathering sets, and more, but you get the gist.</p></div><div catalogid="33f87b44-ee72-4240-98ad-021acd5d3806" id="192311"><div id="192311" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ Membership</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>30-day free trial available. Then it's $12.95/month, or $98/year.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea is that after that early access period, the deals will then be made available to the wider public who don’t have Walmart+. However, given how quickly almost any MSRP-priced stock sells out, most items are typically gone way before general buyers can even get a sniff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't want to miss out on the next one, alongside any of Walmart's upcoming Black Friday deals (which they also put on early access for), I'd suggest picking up a Walmart+ membership when you can. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's $12.95/mo, or $98 annually, and offers a range of benefits beyond early shopping privileges. Members receive free delivery with no order minimum, savings on fuel, access to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/paramount-plus"><u>Paramount+</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/peacock"><u>Peacock</u></a> at no extra cost, and additional perks such as pharmacy delivery and discounts at selected partners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">During its panel at New York Comic Con, Playground Productions not only looked back on the return and relaunch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/backyard-sports-revival-officially-announced-by-playground-productions">the beloved Backyard Sports video games,</a> but it also announced it will be completing its Backyard Sports retro collection with Backyard Basketball '01 and Backyard Hockey '02 in mid-November, that there are high scores and events coming to Backyard Baseball '97, and it shared a few new details for the series' upcoming animated special. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To learn more, IGN had the chance to speak to Playground Productions CEO Linday Barnett and Chief Product Officer Chris Waters about the past and future of this fan-favorite franchise, and we began by chatting about what makes these games so special.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We think it works because the games have always been character-first, comedy-forward, and accessible," Waters said. "These games weren't, 'Hey, let's make the most incredibly realistic simulation,' they were, 'let's recreate the experience of what it felt like to go out and pick up a bat and a ball, grab whatever friends you had around whether they're athletic or not, and go out and play baseball and see what madness ensues.' That madness transcends time and transcends technology." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Backyard Sports' Retro Library Will Be Complete in Mid-November, New Features Headed to Backyard Baseball '97</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you are new to the franchise or returning to it, you'll be happy to know that the Backyard Sports retro library will be complete when Backyard Basketball '01 and Backyard Hockey '02 are released on Steam in mid-November. Oh, and did we mention both will be free to download and keep?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These games, alongside Baseball '97, Baseball '01, Football '99, Soccer '98, will also be part of the Backyard Sports Retro Bundle, which will be available for $26 - a 40% savings from buying all the games individually. Players will even be able to 'Complete the Set' and only pay for the games you don't have yet at the cheaper price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, the Backyard Soccer '98 and Backyard Basketball '01 mobile versions will be free on iOS and Android when that Steam retro bundle goes live later next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of mobile, Backyard Baseball '97 is getting a new gamification feature in collaboration with Lucra. Fans can now compete against each other in week-long and month-long events like Home Run Competitions or Most Strikeouts. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/123-1760093189150.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Global high scores will be tracked in real-time, and the new feature will be free for fans and even includes a chance to win tickets to the 2025 World Series, a Pablo Sanchez trading card, and more. This feature will begin on iOS to start, and players will need to opt-iin and provide some personal information. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we want to do is allow that community to grow and for players to be able to engage with each other," Waters said of the new gamification features. "And again, without the source code, we can't make these games, but by adding a tournament layer onto them, we're sort of creating a backdoor co-op mode."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fun fact, Playground Productions did not get the source code for most of these games when they acquired the rights, so the team had to hack the old CD-ROMs and rebuilt the games themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We thought those games were just dead," Barrnett told us. "And it was an incredible feat that Mega Kat Studios was able to do, which is reverse engineer and hack the CD-ROMs to make them playable. The thing that we didn't know in all of this, however, was that we'd be able to make the games even better and we were able to remove certain bugs that existed in the original games and add leaderboards and add competitions and just make them playable on systems that didn't even exist back then, like Nintendo Switch."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Future of Backyard Sports Includes an Animated Special That Just Finished Production</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We then shifted our talk to the future. While the team wasn't ready to reveal anything about future games, they did confirm that Backyard Sports officially wrapped production on their new animated special that builds upon the brand's beloved IP and characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This special is being produced by Lighthouse Studios, which is known for its work on Bob's Burgers and Rick &amp; Morty, and it will feature an "all-star cast" that will be announced in early November. As for when you can see it, the special will be released at Dave &amp; Buster's in early 2026 and direct to consumer shortly after. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What makes Backyard Sports special is the characters," Waters said. "For us, the opportunity to take your favorite characters and bring them to life in a new way was a no-brainer as we've already said this is a multi-platform franchise we want to go beyond games. We all loved how beautiful the animation was in the games and how much love and care they put in, and it made you love and understand the characters and made you want to pick a certain character. So, we are really, really humbled to be able to extend that into more animation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This special was our way of establishing a tone, establishing a look, and really putting our flag down to say, Backyard is a multi-platform franchise. You're going to be able to experience it in lots of different ways. I can't wait until we can say more, but I can promise you that I've got a 20-year history in animation and we have pulled out all the stops to make something that captures the tone and magic and comedy of this world."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/20240818-055213000-ios-1724085212284-1760093211100.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">First look at the Backyard Sports revival from 2024, featuring Pablo Sanchez and Stephanie Morgan</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With Backyard Sports, the team wants these games and multimedia projects to showcase just how fun sports can be and for this new generation to enjoy all of this alongside those that grew up with them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Streamers have picked these games up and people aren't watching them because they're amazing video game players," Waters said. "They're watching them because they're bringing these kids to life through their own lens. It reminds you of what it was like to play baseball the first time you picked up a glove and a bat and a ball and you were just playing for fun. I think that's been the big thing for why this really is a timeless and classic franchise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is celebrating all of the different characters in your backyard and all their strengths and maybe even some of the weaknesses," Barnett added. "You laugh and you get through everything together. You play together and you might win, you might lose, but you always had fun doing it. And unfortunately, a lot of sports, not just sports video games, but also just sports in general aren't really like that anymore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"You repeatedly refused to listen."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">More than 90 staff who worked on this year's blockbuster flop <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> have sent a searing open letter to the company's management calling for change, after "one of the worst video game launches this decade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://x.com/IWGB_GW/status/1976622237848658253" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a> states that between 250 and 300 staff have now lost their jobs due to MindsEye's failure, something which is blamed squarely on the decisions of company bosses. There's strong criticism, too, of the way layoffs were handled, with the suggestion that misinformation may have lead to the "wrongful dismissal of dozens of staff members."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's letter, published through UK game development worker union IWGB, calls on MindsEye developer Build a Rocket Boy, and specifically its founder Leslie Benzies and co-CEO Mark Gerhard, to apologise for the "mistreatment" of staff and provide "proper compensation for laid-off employees," as well as make improvements to layoff processes, ahead of what sounds like expected "future reduncies."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"For years, you have expected [employees] to adapt to your every whim, with those in disagreement being shut down or cast aside," the letter reads. "These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce's years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Examples of issues faced due to management failures include "radical changes" to working practices with little explanation, "confusion and distress for all staff" as redundancies began — including various errors in the dismissal process, and four months of mandatory overtime ahead of MindsEye's launch for which staff say they still have not been fully compensated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These and many other issues," the letter continues, "have caused pain and stress for your employees. Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an email to IGN, the IWGB provided further quotes from former staff members backing up the letter's claims. One ex-MindsEye developer said that Build A Rocket Boy's "public statements of care have not matched the reality of working conditions" at the company. Another detailed seeing "mental and even physical illnesses, beyond the usual burnout" among fellow staff due to the months of overtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Studio leadership have chosen not to take responsibility for the game's failure and instead blamed saboteurs, as if individual employees or online influencers could have caused this," one former employee stated, referencing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments">the bizarre comments made by Gerhard ahead of release</a> that blamed unnamed hostile forces for the game's poor reception — a position that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye">MindsEye publisher IO Interactive later distanced itself from</a>. "The arrogance of leadership to believe they can act with impunity throughout development and the following redundancies has pushed myself and many former and continuing employees to take a stand."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/barb-image-04-1500x1125-1760105423781.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally planned as a single-player component for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everywhere-the-ex-gta-devs-game-creator-that-may-be-too-late-to-the-party">Everywhere, a seemingly now-abandoned metaverse-style platform</a>, MindsEye ultimately launched to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-says-its-working-around-the-clock-to-improve-performance-amid-mixed-steam-user-reviews">negative response and lackluster sales</a>. Build a Rocket Boy has since said it wants to continue working on the game and give it something of a relaunch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-delays-hitman-crossover-update-says-updates-may-be-less-frequent-going-forward">though more recently cautioned that this would take longer than planned</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's letter concludes with demands for a public apology and proper compensation, for remaining staff still at risk of redundancy to take payment in leave of notice, a commitment to use an external partner in future layoffs to prevent unfair treatment, and for a "concerted, meaningful and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The treatment that workers at Build A Rocket Boy have been facing in the past 12 months has been shocking," IWGB Game Workers chairperson Spring McparlinJones said in a statement passed to IGN. "They have been routinely belittled, cheated, and manipulated by the company they dedicated years of their lives to. Despite this, they were able to keep trust in each other and work together to fight for fair treatment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: IWGB </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
