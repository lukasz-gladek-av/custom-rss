            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bring me that horizon.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Yakuza series has no shortage of weird and wonderful games. From the serious but goofy at times mainline entries to its plethora of historical spinoffs, prequels, and side stories. There’s something for everyone here, really. Whether you’re looking for the next installment in the long running Like a Dragon series, or just want to play something a little different, our last hands-on with Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii ahead of release suggests that it’s shaping up to be another solid spin-off that will plunder dozens of hours from you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag dropped way back in 2013, I’ve been itching for another worthy pirate adventure. While there have been a few decent attempts released since then, none of them managed to capture my attention and made me excited to get to pirating until I got the chance to play Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. At first glance, Pirates and Yakuza may seem like a combination that’s about as compatible as oil and water. But upon closer inspection, Like a Dragon’s world, eccentric main character, and not too overly serious presentation makes for a surprisingly competent and fun pirate adventure. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Combat Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii you assume the role of longtime series favorite Goro Majima after he loses his memory and winds up on an Hawaiian island. From everything I saw during my few hours of hands-on time, the series’ weirdness is cranked up to 11 here. Outside of beating up roving gangs of pirates and the occasional bounty with my small tiger companion, I found myself recruiting a wide assortment of weirdos to my pirate crew, playing a plethora of fun and surprisingly addicting minigames – such as a home run derby, karaoke, and sailing the pacific ocean in my pirate ship, complete with ship-to-ship combat and aggressive weather. To put it bluntly, there’s a lot to do here. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Island Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">During my preview I spent a lot of time in the pirate city of Madlantis, an area overrun by pirates, criminals, and some genuinely strange people even by Yakuza’s standards. I was able to participate in numerous minigames and side activities such as claw games, ports of classic SEGA arcade games like Virtua Fighter, and the Pirates’ Coliseum, an area where I was able to engage in ship-to-ship combat to battle it out with an assortment of unique pirate crews, as well as other combat-based minigames. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of combat, in main gameplay, it strays away from the JRPG turn based style of the two previous Like a Dragon games in favor of a more traditional beat-’em-up combat style. Majima has two fighting styles: Mad Dog and Sea Dog. While both fighting styles are rooted in the standard “heavy and light attack mixed in with dodges” formula, both styles play differently enough that I found myself swapping between them in order to keep the momentum on my side and deal out as much damage as possible. In Mad Dog mode, Majima will don his familiar getup and use a plethora of fast combos to quickly dispatch an enemy. Sea Dog, on the other hand, has Majima wearing a pirate getup and relies on pirate-themed weaponry such as two cutlass swords, a pistol, and a grappling hook. While Mad Dog was fun to play, the majority of my combat time was spent in Sea Dog due to its diverse assortment of weapons and abilities. Regardless of what fighting style I had selected, though I found myself having a ton of fun beating up dozens of rival pirates. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It strays away from the JRPG turn based style of the two previous Like a Dragon games in favor of a more traditional beat-’em-up combat style.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say combat didn’t have its shortcomings, though. Blocking and dodging took a bit of practice to get used to, and the enemies can range from a total pushover to a challenge that had me seeing the game over screen more times than I had expected to in a Yakuza game. Still, once I figured out how to effectively switch between fighting styles and take advantage of every tool and ability I had available, the combat became a challenging but rewarding experience. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Set Sail</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Naval combat is a welcome addition to the Like a Dragon universe. While some games tend to over complicate ship combat, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii goes with a “less is more” approach to its maritime warfare sections. My ship had a few methods of destroying enemy vessels the port side of my pirate ship was donned with short-range flamethrowers that could deal immense damage as long as I was close to my target, while the starboard side of my ship was equipped with long-range cannons. Firing off these two options in addition to the front-facing machine guns is how I spent most of my time in ship-to-ship combat. The third option was to leave the helm of my ship and use Majima’s rocket launcher. While this didn’t do as much damage as the other options, it was pretty fun to jump around my boat and take pot shots at enemy ships. Regardless of which method I chose to engage in, I found myself having fun drifting my boat around and sinking enemy vessels.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on everything I’ve played so far, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is definitely shaping up to not only live up to the high standards of the Like a Dragon series, but it also has the potential to become one of the better pirate games released since Black Flag. With its fun and creative combat, intuitive ship warfare, and genuinely interesting and wacky world, you’re going to want to pack your Hawaiian shirt.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Even better if you're a fan of Sonic: Ever since the Switch arrived in 2017, Sega has worked like clockwork to consistently release Sonic games for the hybrid console. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> out on Switch alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-sonic-the-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> in theaters, it's safe to say Sega's speedster is bigger than ever. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">Switch 2 has been officially announced</a>, it's pretty much guaranteed more Sonic games are on the way. Thankfully, the Switch 2 trailer confirms the system's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-officially-almost-fully-backward-compatible">backwards compatibility</a>, so your existing Sonic games aren't going anywhere. For anyone looking to check out the modern era of Sonic (and friends), here are all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-sonic-games">Sonic the Hedgehog games</a> you can play right now as well as upcoming Sonic games we expect to see on the Switch 2. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Many Sonic Games Are There on Nintendo Switch?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A total of <strong>nine Sonic games have been released for Nintendo Switch</strong>. This spans the first year of the system back in 2017 to the most recent game, Sonic x Shadows, released in October 2024. Keep in mind that this list below does not include the games available with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p><div catalogid="6381d2be-7f83-4285-91f2-acb37fdd2982" id="213268"><div id="213268" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic x Shadow Generations</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Sonic Game Released on the Switch (in Release Order)</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Mania (2017)</h3><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/thumbs/userUploaded/2017/8/14/sonicmania1280-1502683395450.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sonic Games: Sonic Mania</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review">Sonic Mania</a> was developed by PagodaWest Games and Sonic fangame community member Christian Whitehead as a love letter to the classic Sonic the Hedgehog titles released on the Sega Genesis and Sega CD platforms. Taking place after the events of Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, the game remixes eight iconic levels, including Green Hill Zone and Chemical Plant Zone, and introduces five new ones, including the glamorous Studiopolis Zone and the peaceful Press Garden Zone. This game also introduces a new troupe of Eggbots called the Hard-Boiled Heavies for Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles to beat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mania is considered one of the best Sonic games of the 2010s because of the experiment in allowing a group of Sonic fans to create a game other Sonic fans would love, the vivid neon graphics, and the new challenges present in every stage.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Forces (2017)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/11/sonic-forces-review">Sonic Forces</a> makes Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic form a resistance against Dr. Eggman after he conquered most of the world alongside Infinite, a masked jackal who uses the Phantom Ruby to create doppelgangers and warp reality. The game switches gameplay modes between third-person Boost gameplay with Modern Sonic, side-scrolling gameplay with Classic Sonic, and a mode with the custom avatar character, which can be any animal you want, whose weapons use Wisp power-ups. Forces’ writing and lighting aren’t exactly the best in the series, but the game is still tolerable for some people.</p><div id="197171" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Forces</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Team Sonic Racing (2019)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/17/team-sonic-racing-review">Team Sonic Racing</a> takes racing games to a whole new level by having players race <em>with</em> each other, not <em>against</em> each other. This game has a cooperative gameplay mechanic similar to Splatoon and Overwatch, using Sonic Heroes as a frame of reference, where you play in teams of three characters and work together to win each race, paying very close attention to your teammates’ performance and sharing Wisp power-ups with them to allow them to speed up and pull your ranks. Since most of the karts are sports cars, you can customize them with gold rims and paint your car any color you want West Coast Customs style.</p><div id="181380" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>2 Games Sonic Mania + Team Sonic Racing</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 (2019)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Released a year before the real-life Tokyo Olympic Games was scheduled to begin (only to be postponed to 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/05/mario-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-tokyo-2020-review">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020</a> brings the platform rivalry between the jolly red plumber, the speedy blue hedgehog, and their respective friends back to the world stage with new events, like surfing, skateboarding, karate, and sport climbing, and bonus features. The game includes a story mode that takes Mario and Sonic back to the Tokyo 1964 Olympics and their early 2D sprite selves, while everyone else works to help bring them back to the real world in the present day. You get the best of both eras and some history lessons about the Olympic Games in Tokyo to go with it.</p><div id="195359" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mario &amp; Sonic at The Olympic Games Tokyo 2020</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Colors: Ultimate (2021)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-colors-ultimate-review">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a> is a remastered version of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-colors">original Sonic Colors</a> developed by Blind Squirrel Games for Sonic’s 30th anniversary in 2021. The remaster enhanced the graphics to brighten up the colors of Eggman’s interplanetary amusement park and the character models, introduced a new Jade Ghost Wisp to help Sonic phase through walls and ceilings, replaced the traditional lives with rescues from Tails, and introduced mini races against Metal Sonic. You can also collect Park Tokens to customize Sonic with the wackiest designs for his shoes and gloves.</p><div id="197172" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Colors Ultimate</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Origins (2022)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-origins">Sonic Origins</a> compiles the first four classic Sonic games released on the Sega Genesis and Sega CD and remasters them for modern consoles and the audience that plays on them, whether they’re veteran fans seeking a nostalgia fix or young fans who want to understand Sonic’s history. Players can experience the game in Classic Mode, which is the original format presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio, or Anniversary Mode, which replaces lives with coins and allows Sonic to use Drop Dash as he did in Sonic Mania. Each game in the compilation features new animated cutscenes at the beginning and end done by the incomparable Tyson Heese to connect all four games into a cohesive story, provided you play them in the original release order.</p><div id="187208" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Origins Plus</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Frontiers (2022)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-frontiers-review">Sonic Frontiers</a> is the first open-world game in the Sonic franchise – or should we say, “open-zone”? – born out of a trend of open-world games being styled after The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Sonic explores the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-frontiers/maps">vast Starfall Islands</a> to fight cybernetic enemies, solve various puzzles, and run through Cyber Space levels modeled after the levels from past Sonic titles in an effort to save his friends from the digitized dimension. Both veteran and new Sonic fans alike will enjoy running around the mysterious island set to a soundtrack that strikes a delicate balance between serenity and chaos.</p><div id="172543" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Open-World Sonic Frontiers</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Superstars (2023)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-superstars-review">Sonic Superstars</a> is a collaborative effort between Sega and Arzest to bring 3D graphics to a Classic Sonic game, a move that surprised everyone at the 2023 Summer Game Fest (including this author). With Classic Sonic being a CGI character on his own for the first time and classic levels getting revamped with new music and upgraded level designs, the game allows up to four people to locally play together as Sonic and his friends throughout 11 levels across the Northstar Islands and grants new powers for every Chaos Emerald they collect to overcome obstacles. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic X Shadow Generations (2024)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Sonic's latest is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a>, a remastered version of 2011's Sonic Generation that goes beyond graphical upgrades and quality-of-life improvements by including an all-new campaign comprised of reminagined Shadow stages from past Sonic games.
