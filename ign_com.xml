            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pockets-triumphant-light-expansion-just-gave-water-decks-another-powerful-card-and-everyones-a-little-over-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When Pokemon TCG Pocket first launched, the meta quickly came to be dominated by a very small handful of decks. One of those, centered around Misty and water-type Pokemon, came to be hated early on due to its potential to overpower opponents early on based entirely on how well some coin flips went. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, three expansions later, you would think other cards would have swooped in to replace or counter Misty decks. But instead, Pokemon TCG Pocket's latest expansion just added a new card that makes Misty decks stronger than ever, and a lot of players are kind of over it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, it's not that Misty decks are necessarily the most powerful in the game. It's that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">the luck-based nature of Misty makes losing to them feel very, very bad</a>. Misty is a Supporter card, with the unique ability to allow the user to pick a water-type Pokemon, and flip a coin until they land on tails. They then attach a water-type energy to that Pokemon for every heads they flipped. This could result in a player attaching 0 water-type energy, effectively wasting a deck spot on the card and a supporter card play. Or they could attach 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 energy, or more, if luck is on their side that day. A well-flipped Misty could allow a player to win on turn one in certain situations, before the opponent even has a chance to make a move. Or, in more common scenarios, the user gets enough bonus energy to bring extremely powerful cards online before their opponent can build a meaningful defense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that's fine and dandy, but what's made Misty worse are the numerous cards in subsequent expansions that have made it even more powerful. Mythical Island added Vaporean, which has an ability allowing players to essentially move all that bonus energy freely around between their water-types. Space-Time Smackdown brought Manaphy in, which adds <em>even more water energy</em> to the board. Both expansions saw new, powerful water-type Pokemon that can make use of that energy, such as Palkia ex and Gyarados ex. As a result, water decks have been at the top of the meta consistently for multiple expansions in a row.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, with Triumphant Light, there's <em>another</em> card out there making Misty decks even more hellish: Irida. Irida, like Misty, is a Supporter card, but its effect is that it can heal 40 damage from each Pokemon that has any water-type energy attached. Up to this point, grass-type decks have been the healing experts. But with Irida, water-type decks can make significant comebacks as long as they've collected and spread out enough energy...and between Misty, Manaphy, and Vaporeon, they're very likely to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For what it's worth, some Pokemon TCG experts are offering a pretty logical explanation for Irida. In TCG Pocket, decks are limited to 20 cards That means if you want to add something like Irida, you need to take something else out. Water decks are simply swimming in good cards - at a certain point, players must weigh whether or not it's actually worth removing Misty for a card like Irida. Some players are speculating that developer DeNA added Irida in an effort to crowd Misty out and force players to make tough choices about which Supporters to include. But that doesn't mean plenty of wise deckbuilders haven't found ways to include both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the player above points out, Pokemon TCG Pocket is gearing up for a regularly-scheduled event, where rewards will be doled out for going on win streaks in the game's online competitive mode. The best reward, a gold profile badge, will be given out for winning five matches in a row. This is surprisingly difficult to do, and even moreso when many decks you'll be facing can sweep you away within the first few turns if they flip coins correctly, and have backups like Irida to save them even if the flips go bad for them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect to see a lot of water decks during this event and for a long time to come. In fact, at this point, it may just be worth playing one yourself if you're not already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-once-again-under-fire-over-alleged-generative-ai-use-now-for-a-fake-guitar-hero-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Also a fake Crash Bandicoot and a fake Call of Duty?</h2></p><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision is once again in trouble with fans over generative AI. Just one week after it admitted to using generative AI in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> for a number of assets, the publisher is now being accused of using generative AI again to promote a different game: Guitar Hero Mobile. But even as audiences criticize the promotion, sharp-eyed fans are discovering that Guitar Hero Mobile may not even be a real game in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/guitar-hero-mobile-ad-ai-art/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by Insider Gaming</a>, the generative AI in question appears to have been used in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram ad for the newly-announced Guitar Hero Mobile</a> posted two days ago. The ad features four guitar players on a stage in very similar poses with similarly-blobby red guitars, surrounded by distorted speakers that look suspiciously like washing machines and some mass of blobby microphones directly behind them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In front of them is an audience that includes a number of visible legs that don't seem to belong to anybody, and down the center is a Guitar Hero track with incorrectly colored tracks and blobby, inconsistent notes, some of which don't color match the track they're on. Put together, all of these issues are tell-tale signs of generative AI art, and given Activision's recent track record, it's pretty likely that's what's happening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the comments, fans are furious. "Shows how much effort went into this when you can't even get your own game right," reads one response. Another calls the ad "Lazy AI slop," while another reads, "you’d think a giant company like Activision would have some budget for a real graphic designer". A fourth says, "Wow. It appears they're still using midjourney 1.0. I haven't seen AI art this bad since the early days."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn't where the weird generative AI ads end. As a few websites such as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/activision-comes-under-fire-for-using-ai-art-to-gauge-interest-in-new-mobile-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Extension</a> and <a href="https://80.lv/articles/activision-gets-criticized-for-ai-generated-mobile-game-advertisements/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80.lv</a> have pointed out, Activision appears to have quietly dropped a number of generative AI-created ads on Instagram for a smattering of games that haven't otherwise been announced by the company. These include a Call of Duty Zombies mobile game, something called Call of Duty: Sniper, and something else called Crash Bandicoot Brawl. At the time we're writing this, none of these ads are viewable publicly on Activision's official Instagram, but the Guitar Hero Mobile game ad is still <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available via direct link</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where this gets even weirder is that fans have managed to <a href="https://store.geeklab.app/p/f6c46a6e325cb82fbb206399" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a page for Guitar Hero Mobile</a> on a website called Geeklab, complete with even more AI imagery. Geeklab is a user acquisition and insight company that allows publishers to create "look-alike" store pages for mobile games in order to test user interest. Clicking "GET" on the Guitar Hero Mobile page <a href="https://lab.geeklab.app/survey/7562005b447f52556c832f82?tq=267a0d4c6151982266fa5a03d97051&amp;pid=3252054" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">takes users to a survey</a> that claims "This isn't a real game, but could be some day!" and asks them a number of questions about why they clicked on the ad and how likely they would be to play something like Guitar Hero Mobile.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>OFFICIAL: Activision is currently looking into making a new COD Zombies mobile game. The kicker?</p><p>They're using AI Generated advertisements in order to garner interest on it. </p><p>Full story below:</p><p>Recently, an official Call of Duty Instagram ad has been posted a few hours ago… <a href="https://t.co/CQeQYiVwFq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/CQeQYiVwFq</a></p></div>— COD: Zombies News (@MargwaNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/MargwaNetwork/status/1895612833821536676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">What appears to be happening here is that Activision launched some sort of ad campaign to gauge user interest in a number of possible mobile games that don't exist yet. Because those games aren't real, it used generative AI for its advertising art, and confused the heck out of fans who otherwise would have been stoked for an actual Guitar Hero Mobile game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes just one week after Activision admitted to using generative AI in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Said generative AI assets were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash">actually discovered and called out back in December</a>, but it took the publisher nearly three months to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">admit it had used generative AI in Call of Duty loading screens, calling cards, and other in-game art</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision declined to comment to IGN for this piece.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
