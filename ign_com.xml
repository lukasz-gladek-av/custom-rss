The Ghost of Tsushima sequel did show up for a brief appearance during the tail end of the presentation but mostly served simply as a reminder that Sucker Punch is still hard at work to meet its October release date.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it may have been disappointing to see Ghost of Yōtei come and go so quickly, it sounds like the July State of Play gameplay deep dive will do more to help with the wait. Sucker Punch’s showcase doesn’t have a release date yet but is said to focus entirely on Ghost of Yōtei and its “evolved gameplay mechanics, including exploration, combat, and much more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch formally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">announced</a> its Ghost of Tsushima sequel last September, promising to place players in the shoes of new protagonist Atsu as she embarks on a bloody journey through Japan in 1603. Although the wait for story and gameplay details has been painful for those hoping for a sequel since the original game launched in 2020, director Nate Fox has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-director-vows-to-deliver-a-respectful-representation-of-japan-on-par-with-ghost-of-tsushima">said the experience will be "a respectful representation" of Japan</a>, just like its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Yōtei has a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-confirms-ghost-of-ytei-ps5-release-date-with-new-trailer"><u>release date</u></a> of October 2, 2025 for PS5.

We later see Bond as a young recruit in the Royal Navy, from which he is recruited by MI6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's here that players pick up Bond's story as he becomes an agent, picks up an Omega watch, and starts annoying Q by trying out his gadgets in the lab. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A press release issued alongside the game's State of Play appearance lists Bond's age in 007 First Light as "a young 26-year-old". Players will be traverse the globe in what is described as "a story-driven action-adventure game" where you can choose how to navigate various challenges — either with brute force or 007's trademark charm.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">007 First Light screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What looks like gameplay footage shows James Bond on a mission, stealthing around, using gadgets — and his fists — to subdue enemies, as the hero is sent off to target a rogue agent. "009 is a master manipulator," Greenway says at one point. "Whatever the endgame is, we won't see it coming." Oh, and yes you can dress up in disguises, as you'd expect from the Hitman studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive's James Bond game was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-developer-announces-new-bond-game-project-007">first announced back in 2020</a> as Project 007, and since then we've learned very little about it. Still, from the off, IO said that it was developing a fresh James Bond origin story and a wholly original piece of work, rather than anything that followed the events of any particular film. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak has said he hoped 007 First Light would be the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy">start of a new trilogy of games</a>, though unfortunately the studio's beloved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-franchise-on-hiatus-as-io-interactive-focuses-on-james-bond-game">Hitman franchise is on hiatus</a> while IO works on this game. We also learned just this past April that in addition to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-bond-origin-story-game-project-007-officially-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">007 First Light is getting a Nintendo Switch 2 release</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

A demo is live now on PS5 until June 18. Players who complete the demo will unlock an exclusive in-game helmet at launch. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb, from <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/nioh-3-announced-for-ps5-limited-time-demo-available-today/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>:</p><blockquote>In Nioh 3, the protagonist is a young warrior poised to become the next Shogun. Why is he dedicated to battling against yokai? We’ll save those details for another day, but what we can tell you today is as the battles unfold, players will now be able to fight using two distinct combat styles: Samurai and Ninja.</blockquote><blockquote>The Samurai style provides a gameplay experience similar to previous Nioh titles. New actions such as Arts Proficiency, which enhances the power of martial arts, and Deflect, which allows players to block enemy attacks at the last moment have been added, helping create a series of intense and deadly face-to-face confrontations.</blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, the Ninja style excels in quick movements like dodging and aerial actions, giving ninjas the advantage of being able to attack from outside of the enemy’s range by utilizing a variety of “Ninjitsu” techniques according to the situation on the battlefield. Players have the ability to use techniques like Mist, which leaves a clone after an attack, and Evade, which allows for narrowly avoiding enemy strikes. Both techniques help players outmaneuver foes while delivering devastating speed attacks from behind.</blockquote><blockquote>Players will be able to switch between battle styles instantly at any time, playing in their preferred style in a storyline defined by the strong, the swift, and the wicked. Based on the tendencies of the enemies and stages, some players will prefer to switch seamlessly between Samurai and Ninja techniques, while others will choose to fight using only one style continuously based on the challenge ahead. Feel free to play with the style you like best as you battle some of the fiercest enemies we’ve created to date!</blockquote><blockquote>Aside from the new battle styles, Nioh 3 also enables players to enjoy an open field that offers a new freedom of exploration to the unique tension and confrontations that have become a defining characteristic of the Nioh series. Experience unexpected encounters with formidable yokai, explore suspicious villages riddled in violent secrets, and take on the daunting challenges of The Crucible. Enjoy the thrilling, hostile new environments as you fight to survive the cursed kingdom!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">We're pretty big Nioh fans here at IGN. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nioh">gave the original Nioh a 9.6/10</a>, calling it "an epic, unforgettable adventure carried by a fierce combat system that cleverly balances style and strategy." We similarly praised Nioh 2 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-2-review">with a 9/10</a>, saying that its "many systems may be a little overwhelming, but the stellar combat and satisfying difficulty make it worth it." The Nioh series has been very, very quiet ever since the 2020 release of Nioh 2, though Team Ninja itself has kept busy with releases such as Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, Rise of the Rōnin, and the upcoming Ninja Gaiden 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you missed it, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Sony's State of Play June 2025 showcase</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

You play as an astronaut man, Hugh, who's come into some unexpected enconter in space that's left him vulnerable. He's saved by a little girl whose name is actually DI0367, but who the astronaut dubs Diana.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though she's small, Diana's far from helpless - she has some sort of magic-techno-hacking powers that enable her to help out her astronaut friend as they fight off the weird robot-alien creatures trying to "neutralize" them. You'll play as both characters simultaneously, with Diana riding on Hugh's back. Per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/pragmata-coming-to-ps5-2026-new-gameplay-revealed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, it looks like the main threat is a lunar station AI that's preventing Hugh from returning to earth...from the moon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pragmata was first unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pragmata-capcom-release-date-2022">way back in 2020</a>, with a trailer of an astronaut, a little girl, and some weird yet beautiful imagery, but little explanation as to what sort of game we were looking at. It was originally planned for a 2022 release, but was then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-delayed-2023">later delayed until 2023</a>, and then paused indefinitely <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-delayed-indefinitely-as-capcom-apologizes">with an apologetic trailer</a>. We haven't seen anything of it since, so this re-unveiling hopefully means that its development is finally making some serious progress, and we'll get our hands on it soon...in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/open-world-racing-game-carx-street-coming-to-consoles-pre-orders-open-now-on-xbox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Build your car from the ground up and prove you’re the best racer in Sunset City.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer CarX Technologies has made a name for itself over the last decade with series like Drift Racing, Highway Racing, and Rally. In 2022, they branched out with CarX Street, an open-world racing game with a level of freedom they’ve never had before. Then they brought it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114150?utm_source=ign&amp;utm_medium=cpv&amp;utm_campaign=productlanding" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">to Steam</a> in 2024, where it was wishlisted by over 600,000 people. And now, they’re bringing it to consoles — it arrives June 18 <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nn082lmvv2c?cid=ign_street" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">on Xbox Series X/S</a> and later this summer on PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CarX Street takes you to the sprawling Sunset City and its suburbs, where your goal is straightforward: prove you’re the best racer in the city. There are racing clubs scattered throughout the city, each with their own identity. For example, Union Underground is a crew of automotive engineers who value a car’s performance but don’t care about looks. Kanjo Spirit is for hatchback enthusiasts who use volatile, high-risk driving styles.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/04/screenshot-2-1749055195431.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll need to be prepared for a variety of different race types, like classic sprint races, circuit races, and drifting competitions. All of the races make use of CarX Technologies’ car physics engine, designed with a focus on realism. That realism means that the cheaper cars you can afford at the start of the game won’t handle well enough to tackle harder races and won’t make the grade necessary for you to enter them in the first place. So you’ll need to upgrade your ride early and often.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luckily, there are tons of options when building a new car. That starts with 92 different vehicles, with additional ones added regularly. There’s also an extensive customization and tuning system that lets you tailor your ride to your preferred driving style — including the engine, drivetrain, suspension, body, and wheels.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/02/screenshot-5-1748885683850.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sunset City might be full of racing clubs, but beating them isn’t the only thing to do in the city. You can accept quests to deliver cars or parts to people across the city, and completing them can net you resources to improve your vehicle. You can explore the map on your own and speed down open highways or find mountain roads with sharp turns and narrow passages to put your driving skills to the test. Or you can buy properties across the city that come with parking lots where you can display your custom cars. Through all of this, Sunset City has a dynamic day-night cycle, leading to races having a different feel depending on what time of day you do them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also multiplayer modes if you’re feeling competitive. Battle Mode is a 1v1 showdown in circle or sprint races, Chase Mode has one player try to escape through the city while their opponent tries to keep up, Speed League has circuit and sprint races in a 1v5 format, and Time Attack challenges you to set the best lap time you can while you rise up the leaderboard and earn increasingly valuable rewards. The multiplayer modes will also have crossplay between the PC and console versions of the game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/02/screenshot-4-1748885649922.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these features will be present when the game arrives on console, but the developers have also announced their plans for future additions. That includes new competitive multiplayer modes, gymkhana (obstacle courses), a team multiplayer mode, dynamic weather effects, a network of high-speed expressways, full narrative campaign, and police chase mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CarX Street releases on Xbox Series X on June 18, and pre-orders are open now. It’s planned for release on PlayStation 5 later this summer.
