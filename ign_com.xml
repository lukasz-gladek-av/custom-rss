            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Final Fantasy VII is getting a makeover on Steam. No, not the remake. I mean the actual, original game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/39140/view/514107648813039662" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Announced last month</a> and released today, this updated version of Final Fantasy VII comes with a handful of new features as seen on the storefront. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3837340/view/498346952550779352" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to an official post</a>, this new version of the old game will include a 3x speed mode, the ability to turn off random encounters, a "battle enhancement" mode that will max out Limit gauge and let players recover HP/MP during battles, and an autosave feature.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The new version of the game will replace the 2013 edition on the Steam store, and the 2013 edition will no longer be available to buy. However, those who already own the 2013 version will receive the new version free of charge, <em>and</em> will still have access to the 2013 version in their libraries simultaneously with this new version. Critically, though, save files are not compatible between the two versions, so you will have to start a new game to enjoy the re-release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This update effectively brings the game up to parity with the other modern console ports of Final Fantasy 7. For years, the 2013 edition on Steam had been behind the times, effectively just an old (and often buggy) PC port.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's still worth checking out the original Final Fantasy VII if you missed it back in the day, or even if you just want a walk down memory lane ahead of the conclusion to the Final Fantasy VII Remake Trilogy. It's been teased that we're getting "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-will-share-more-updates-than-ever-before-on-final-fantasy-7-remake-project-this-year-says-director">more updates than ever before</a>" on the trilogy this year, leading fans to hope that the announcement of Part 3 is imminent. Meanwhile, Part 2, Rebirth, is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-and-xbox-this-year">coming to Switch 2 and Xbox later this year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro shareholders who filed a lawsuit last month against the company, alleging its management was overprinting Magic: The Gathering Cards, breaching its fiduciary duty, and deceiving consumers, have decided to drop the suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A notice of voluntary dismissal filed last week (and spotted by <a href="https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2026/02/23/hasbro-shareholders-drop-suit-alleging-toymaker-overprinted-magic-the-gathering-card-sets/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rhode Island Current</a>) shows Joseph Crocono and Ultain McGlone dropping the case without prejudice, suggesting they may attempt to file again at a later date. There are no further details in the notice as to the reason the lawsuit was dropped.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - "Prints Charming" Secret Lair Drop</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The lawsuit, filed in January, alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, gross mismanagement, abuse of control, and violations of the Exchange Act on the part of Hasbro management. Its primary claim revolved around the idea that leadership was steering the company poorly by overprinting card sets, thereby devaluing the existing ones and putting the company on track to financial ruin. In particular, it named the culprit as Universes Beyond and Secret Lair, alleging that the company was teeing up the crossover sets to release any time the other segments of its business were struggling and the company needed cash to make up for the shortfall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And indeed, Hasbro subsidiary Wizards of the Coast has been printing more sets in recent years than in the past, though its revenue has been increasing along with it. In fact, upon its last earnings call, it was revealed that Magic just had its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-just-had-its-most-successful-year-everagain">most successful year ever</a>, in no small part thanks to the very sets that the lawsuit claims were at issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the lawsuit claimed that Hasbro management essentially faked being out of stock of the controversial, extremely expensive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-players-are-up-in-arms-over-999-dollar-anniversary-set">Magic 30th Anniversary Set</a> in order to encourage demand, sharing testimonies from former company leadership claiming that they had opted to "pause" sales to give the appearance of the product being out of stock. With the lawsuit dismissed, the merit of this anecdote in particular remains up in the air. It is worth noting that in the weeks since the lawsuit, Wizards of the Coast has put out another <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-newest-product-says-the-quiet-part-out-loud">controversial, weirdly-priced card offering</a> in its "Prints Charming" Secret Lair set, which consists of five identical listings, all at different prices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering is gearing up for its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-preview">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set</a>, which releases on March 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios has published full patch notes for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> update 1.17.0, revealing a wave of nerfs for PvP and PvE players hopping into Shrouded Sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The finer details for the new Arc Raiders patch were published on <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/shrouded-sky-patch-notes-1-17-0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the extraction shooter’s official website</u></a> today. It comes with the promise that players will be met with more than just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-trailer-teases-hurricane-map-condition-and-windy-gameplay-hazards"><u>Hurricanes</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embark-shows-off-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-with-first-look-at-two-new-threatsand-beards"><u>new Arc threats</u></a> when they log in to check out the new February content drop.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">PvP players should know three of the most useful multiplayer weapons – the Stitcher, Kettle, and Venator – have all suffered from reductions to their base damage. The Stitcher and Venator pistols have also had their headshot multipliers reduced. These are targeted nerfs from Embark that will have a noticeable impact on PvP lobbies, while buffs for the Jupiter and Aphelion will likely make them more useful across the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PvE players will likely appreciate the update’s improvements for the two energy weapons, but they didn’t make it out of Shrouded Sky without also facing nerfs. Let’s rip the Band-Aid off: the Deadline, Trailblazer, Wolfpack, and Showstopper will now be much more difficult to craft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As each piece of equipment can be extremely useful when taking down Arc, Embark is asking players to gather at least one more Arc resource to build them. That’s not so bad in the case of the Vita Spray, which only requires an additional Tick Pod. The Wolfpack and its flurry of aerial homing explosives, on the other hand, now asks Raiders for one Rocketeer Driver per craft. The Rocketeer resource is quite rare and notoriously difficult to farm, making this one of the more substantial crafting adjustments and a steep ask for PvE fans.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders - Shrouded Sky Update Images</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We knew Shrouded Sky would be one of Embark’s biggest updates so far, but the version 1.17.0 patch notes reveal more highlights following its launch earlier today. For example, players can now interact with topside pianos, adding to the growing list of playable instruments. Raiders will also notice that troublesome feats can now be rerolled three times per day, while PvP feats have been removed entirely. The patch notes also sign off with a message from the team regarding its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters">ongoing anti-cheat initiative</a>, confirming it plans to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-says-players-who-used-recent-exploits-will-face-warnings-and-suspensions-starting-this-week">continue punishing cheaters</a> and exploiters following today’s fixes for a few additional glitches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The launch of Shrouded Sky now puts Embark halfway through its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026"><u>four-month roadmap</u></a> for Arc Raiders in 2026. The next update, Flashpoint, is expected to bring more threats and a Scrappy changes in late March, with Riven Tides set to add a new map and a new large Arc in April. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve"><u>interviewed studio CEO Patrick Söderlund</u></a> earlier this month and learned all about how the team plans to keep Raiders engaged throughout this year and beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, you can check out all of the nerfs, buffs, and other balance adjustments included today in the full patch notes below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arc Raiders Update 1.17.0 Patch Notes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Attention Raiders!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Violent hurricanes are sweeping topside, forcing new strategies for low-visibility combat, powerful gales, and hurtling debris.

In 1.13.1 we reverted that fix, but something else made it into the update that shouldn't have. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of you have reported a "shadow buff" to the weapons, and after investigating it we found that 1.13.1 had inadvertently impacted our weapon input buffers. Where you previously would have to time your inputs to the intended cadence of a weapon to reach its full potential, you could now instead spam-click the button, effectively bypassing any skill requirement to learn the weapon's cadence. We want to keep some of that skill expression, but we also recognize that what we had previously didn't feel very responsive. To address that and land in some sort of middle ground, we have since added more levers for us to control the weapon input buffering window on a gun-to-gun basis, and we've adjusted the semi-automatic weapons accordingly. The weapons should now still be more responsive to fire when spam-clicking, but the players who choose to pace their shots will see better results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these changes, we've also been looking into the balance between our low tier and high tier weapons. A lot of you have expressed concerns that some low tier weapons outperform our higher tier weapons at significantly reduced cost, and we're hoping to shift that balance a bit while still keeping some of that flexibility to punch above your weight if you are skilled enough. We're starting by reducing the overall TTK of the Stitcher and Kettle, and increasing the maneuverability of the Aphelion and Jupiter. We're also taking a second stab at the Venator, which still seems to be dominating a lot of our PvP encounters.</p><strong>Stitcher</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note: </strong>The Stitcher has played its role well as a close quarter weapon that rewards thoughtful positioning, but we've found that its fast TTK can sometimes lead to situations where you're ambushed and killed before you have much time to react. As many of you have pointed out, the high headshot damage is a large contributor to this problem. The TTK is often fine when the weapon is aimed at the center of mass, but when you get close enough to land the majority of the shots in your target's head, we see TTK numbers that are much faster than other weapons. These changes aim to bring that headshot TTK a bit closer to the body shot TTK by both reducing the full-spray accuracy of the weapon, and reducing the headshot multiplier.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced Headshot Multiplier from 2.5 to 1.75</li><li>Reduced Base Damage from 7 to 6.5</li><li>Increased Per Shot Dispersion by around 50% (Making it bloom faster)</li></ul><strong>Kettle</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note: </strong>The Kettle has been in a bit of a weird place. Its high damage output was intended to be used in a more medium range setting at a more deliberate pace, but we see many of you bringing it up in close quarters and effectively turning into an SMG. We want to distinguish it more from the Stitcher, but we also see that you enjoy the versatility of this weapon. So we're reducing the base damage to bring its TTK more in line, but we're keeping the high headshot multiplier to see if we can push players to go for more headshots.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced Base Damage from 10 to 8.5</li></ul><strong>Venator</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note:</strong> Since the last nerfs to the Venator in 1.3.0, we've kept an eye on our data to see how it performs. During this time many of you have raised concerns that it's still dominating in PVP, and our data has shown that it is one of the highest performing weapons in the game right now. For a weapon of this tier we want it to perform well, but maybe not this well. We're looking at an overall nerf to its damage to bring down its TTK, and if that doesn't work we might need to look into its ammo consumption and cost efficiency.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced Headshot Multiplier from 2.5 to 2</li><li>Reduced Base Damage from 9 to 8</li></ul><strong>Jupiter</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note: </strong>In PVP, the Jupiter does the most headshot damage in the game, but it's quite difficult to hit headshots with it at longer ranges. You're also quite vulnerable when you use it in closer ranges since missing one shot will make you a sitting target until you either reload or swap weapons. We're increasing how much you zoom when you use ADS to give you a better view of the targets you're trying to hit, and we're reducing its equip and unequip time to make it easier to swap to a secondary weapon to follow up on your shot.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improved ADS Magnification from ~1.9x to ~2.2x</li><li>Improved Equip Time from 1.2s to 1.05s</li><li>Improved Unequip Time from 0.9s to 0.75s</li></ul><strong>Aphelion</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note: </strong>We weren't quite happy with the previous balancing of the Aphelion. It was intended to be a more PVP focused legendary weapon, but it couldn't quite keep up with the pacing of many of our other PVP weapons. We've made some changes to make it feel less bulky and a bit more nimble to use, to make it more viable in PVP.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced Base Reload Time from 4.5s to 3.5s</li><li>Reduced Time Between Shots from 0.9s to 0.7s</li><li>Reduced Vertical Recoil by ca 50%</li><li>Improved ADS Settle Speed by ca 35%</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Item and

Our defenses operate on multiple levels: some checks are simple and definitive, while others are behavioral and data-driven and evolve over time. We also leverage broad gameplay telemetry and machine learning techniques to spot patterns that aren’t obvious at first glance. These methods take longer to develop, must adapt as game systems change, and don’t always offer instant certainty the way blunt software detections can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve recently taken action against different exploits and we are further tightening our rules and stepping up enforcement. Serious infractions now carry stricter consequences. Strong detections will receive permanent bans right off the bat, while others will receive a temporary suspension and a single chance to correct the behavior. Recent updates to Family Sharing have strengthened our ability to curb misconduct and streamlined the removal of bad actors from the game. We are preparing to launch a systematic manual review of ban appeals. The game is young and the volume of telemetry is enormous, but this process ensures every case is handled with care as we continue to learn quickly and invest heavily in the precision of our enforcement tools.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our dedicated anti-cheat team works tirelessly to keep the game fair. It’s an ongoing fight, and we’re committed to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">//Ossen<br>And the ARC Raiders Team</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.
