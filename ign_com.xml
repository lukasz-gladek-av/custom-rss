            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Few sports are more primed for the whole “being a video game” thing than professional wrestling, but it’s kinda weird when you think about it: the WWE itself is more akin to an elaborately choreographed fight or dance sequence in a movie than it is an actual competition, whereas the goal of the games based on it is to fight to win.  But inherent contradictions aside, I’m enjoying my time with WWE 2K25 so far – just a couple of days in – thanks to its much-improved Showcase mode and generally great game feel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I step into a new version of an annualized game like this, the first thing I try to do is get the lay of the land. Even though I’ve been playing wrestling games since the N64 days, my first stop is the tutorial because, unless things have gone very wrong, something is always a little different (this year, for instance, sees the long-requested return of Chain Wrestling) or I’ve forgotten how to do some very important, very specific button sequence you need to be able to do. WWE games have had a good introduction for a while now, especially compared to other sports game franchises (Hi, Madden!), and WWE 2K25 is no exception. This is an incredibly detailed tutorial that will walk you through everything you need to be a champ in the ring, with in-depth explanations of what moves do and how to do them. The Performance Center is a great teaching tool whether you need a quick refresher or you’re learning to do an Irish Whip for the first time. This may seem like an odd thing to spill ink over, but every version of a game is someone’s first – or maybe their first in a while – and I’m glad Visual Concepts seems to remember those people.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once I’d refreshed my memory, I spent a while just looking around. WWE 2K25’s got an absolutely stacked roster, whether you’re here for classics like Bret “Hit Man” Hart, wrestlers-turned-movie-stars like Dave Bautista/Batista and Dwayne Johnson/The Rock, megastars like “Stone Cold” Steve Austin, or weirdos like Doink the Clown. I also appreciate that there are several versions of the same dudes from across their history in the WWE. Why yes WWE 2K25, I <em>do</em> need a handful of Triple Hs, each with their own different stats, thank you! Did you know that, compared to the modern version of The Rock, the 1997 version is considered a bum? Me neither, but that’s what the stats say! Remember what Rhea Ripley’s visual style was in 2020? Or 2017? When was the last time you thought about “Ravishing” Rick Rude? This stuff is great, and what’s better is you can edit just about every aspect of these wrestlers, from how the crowd reacts to them to tweaking individual stats and changing out moves if you don’t like Visual Concepts’ take on them. The ability to tweak individual wrestlers is not new, but as this roster gets bigger, it’s good to be reminded of how impressive all of it is.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What’s captured most of my attention so far is this year’s Showcase mode.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Among other new things in WWE 2K25, so far I’ve briefly toyed with intergender matches, The Island (I mean, who among us <em>hasn’t </em>wanted to impress Roman Reigns?), and new MyRise storylines. But what’s captured most of my attention so far is this year’s Showcase mode, which follows the Bloodline and the Anoa’i, Fatu, and Maivia families. Paul “The Wiseman” Heyman hosts the thing this year, and he’s clearly having a <em>very </em>good time providing the backstory that explains who the players are and why these matches are significant. There’s a lot of archival footage here, as in years past, though the problem of blurring out some folks’ faces (maybe due to rights issues?) persists. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, Showcase feels better than last year’s version (partially because this time we’ve got full ring entrances and the mid-match commentary is really excellent, and here for every match) and a fun twist this time around is that you’re sometimes asked to change the outcomes of matches members of these families lost in the real WWE storyline. If what I’ve played is any indication of the whole, there are also no longer any cuts to match footage that interrupt your gameplay. Big moments are instead recreated in-game, which means they play out more organically, even if you’re not following the checklist. So far, I’m having a blast doing things like beating the ever-loving snot out of Hulk Hogan with Yokozuna.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bruises, blood, and sweat are more realistic.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing that’s stood out is just how good it all looks. The WWE series has always been a looker, but this year Visual Concepts has managed to make things noticeably prettier than ever. Bruises, blood, and sweat are more realistic, and you can tell how long a match has been going, who is winning, and where the guys in the ring are taking the most punishment at a glance. It’s really impressive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s kind of where I am with WWE2K25 as a whole as we head into the first weekend. There’s a lot left to do before I can slap a number on this bad boy, but it looks fantastic, feels pretty great (just like WWE 2K24), and there’s a lot of it. An upscale wrestling buffet, if you will. What I’ve had so far is scrumptious, but there’s still a wide selection of dishes on the table, and your boy’s gotta taste test ‘em all. Better get back to it – that circle’s not gonna square itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Are you playing? Let us know what you think so far!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN WWE Game Review Ever</h3></div></output></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-best-weapons-tier-list<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Let's start by saying this: there is no best weapon type in Monster Hunter Wilds. If you're looking for a definitive answer on which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">weapon type</a> will get you the fastest hunt times every time because it's just <em>that</em> good and overpowered, there isn't one. The truth of it is that you should choose what feels good to play with for <em>you. </em>If you're not carting, are consistently hitting the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Monsters">monster</a>, and having fun while doing it, that's what matters the most. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a lot that goes into making a build for any given weapon successful, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Best_Armor_Sets">armor,</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Decorations">decorations</a>, and a <em>particular </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Artian_Weapons">Artian weapon</a> for the particular monster you're up against, and those are the most important aspect, but if you're looking for weapon types that just might help you get those hunt times down, these are great ones to try. This tier list of best weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds was created by Frankensteining IGN's community tier list, online sentiment, my own opinion based on difficulty to master, and some current speedrun time averages.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title1">Monster Hunter Wilds Best Weapons Tier List</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The "best" weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds are Sword and Shield, Great Sword, Long Sword,  Gunlance, and Bow, in no particular order, but the rest of the weapons are absolutely viable. These just stand out above the rest for a variety of reasons, which we'll describe below. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S-tier: 
</strong>These are the best of the best for both damage output and relative ease of use to get there. The Gunlance is the most technical weapon here, but its benefits are worth it according to the community. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Sword_and_Shield_Guide_and_Tutorial_">Sword and Shield</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Great_Sword_Guide_and_Tutorial">Great Sword</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Long_Sword_Guide_and_Tutorial">Long Sword</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Gunlance_Guide_and_Tutorial">Gunlance</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Bow_Guide_and_Tutorial">Bow</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A-tier: </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">A-tier weapons have the potential to be as good as S-tier weapons in the right hands as they tend to be a bit more technical and less forgiving, or they fall just a tiny bit short. The Hunting Horn, though potentially not the best solo weapon, is exceptional in co-op. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Insect_Glaive_Guide_and_Tutorial">Insect Glaive</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Charge_Blade_Guide_and_Tutorial">Charge Blade</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Dual_Blades_Guide_and_Tutorial">Dual Blades</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Hunting_Horn_Guide_and_Tutorial">Hunting Horn</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Heavy_Bowgun_Guide_and_Tutorial">Heavy Bowgun</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Switch_Axe_Guide_and_Tutorial">Switch Axe</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>B-tier: </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">These may fall a bit short compared to S- and A-rank weapons even when in the most experienced hands, but that doesn't at all mean they're "bad." They just might take a little more effort and fine-tuned builds for the results of some of the others. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Lance_Guide_and_Tutorial">Lance</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Hammer_Guide_and_Tutorial">Hammer</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Light_Bowgun_Guide_and_Tutorial">Light Bowgun</a> </li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Best Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Explained</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Sword and Shield</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sword and Shield is amazing in Monster Hunter Wilds. It's long been grossly underrated as solely the "beginner" weapon, and while it's easy to pick up and get to it, it's also one of the most versatile, consistent weapons in the game that can deal a ton of damage once you get your combos and movements down. Not only is it incredibly mobile even in the middle of attacks, allowing you to stick on monsters like mud on a Jyuratodos, but it can <em>also</em> guard and deal punishing damage. It can even <em>perfect</em> guard incredibly easily, letting you perform quick, powerful counter slashes and proc an Offensive Guard buff if you have that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Equipment_Skills">Equipment Skill</a>. For support hunters, it can even use items without putting it away, letting you administer life-saving Lifepowders and buffing items for your whole party in a flash. Whether you prefer to evade or block, deal slashing or blunt damage, or even attack from above, the Sword and Shield has got it all--even a Power Clash. The only thing it's missing is an Offset attack. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Great Sword</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Monster Hunter developers have said the first weapon they tool in new games is the Great Sword, and it shows. It can take advantage of Wilds' new Power Clashes and incredibly satisfying Offset attacks, and its kit in general is quintessential Monster Hunter satisfaction in a nutshell. It will take more getting used to than the Sword and Shield, as it's quite slow, and mishits can be punishing, but the introduction of Focus Mode makes it easier than ever to aim.  If you're looking for the highest damage output in a single strike, the Great Sword is a <em>great</em> pick, and those True Charged Slash hits look <em>so </em>satisfying. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Long Sword</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Long Sword is consistently Monster Hunter's most popular weapon for good reason. It's fast and fairly easy to pick up, with a fun, flashy, and satisfying playstyle that relies on its powerful perfect-evading counterattack, the Foresight Slash, to quickly build up the Spirit Gauge to deal max damage. It's also got amazing reach, considering its size, so slicing off tails is a breeze with the Long Sword. It takes some management to maintain a maxed Spirit Gauge, but doing it is well worth the incredible damage output the Long Sword can accomplish when you're in a flow with it. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Gunlance</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be honest, I know little about the Gunlance, but IGN's community tier list contributors, speedrunners, and people around the internet seem to love it in Monster Hunter Wilds. I have found it much more difficult to pick up than the other S-tier weapons, but if you master it, it's got amazing defense with its huge shield capable of Perfect Guards and <em>explosive</em> power in exchange for some mobility. In Wilds, the Gunlance can now fire two Wyvern's Fire shots, which also have longer range. Its new attack, Wyrmstake Full Blast, is also incredibly powerful! </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bow</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though the bow isn't doing too hot in Tempered Arkveld speedruns, many agree it's an amazing pick in Monster Hunter Wilds, and I've seen it often voted as the strongest weapon in community polls. It certainly <em>feels</em> powerful, even despite its minor Focus Strike nerf since the Open Beta Test. So, what makes it S-tier? The Bow has a new move in Wilds that <em>guarantees</em> your shots will hit its intended target <em>and</em> crit: Tracer Ammo. Wilds also makes it so the Bow never runs out of its damage-boosting or ailment-inflicting coatings, further increasing its damage potential. Finally, if you perfect your dodge timing, the Bow's Discerning Dodge replenishes your stamina so you almost never need to stop attacking! The Bow is mobile, strong, and its Focus Strike looks rad, what more could you ask for? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember, this is all just for reference, and we recommend sticking with your preferred weapon. For example, if you're skilled with the Light Bow Gun, knowing exactly where to aim with what ammo and dodging every monster attack, you're going to get better times than with the Great Sword if you keep whiffing your True Charged Slashes and can't time your Offset attacks consistently. Any weapon takes time to get good at! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What weapon do <em>you</em> think is the best in Monster Hunter Wilds?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/carmen-sandiego-review.1128729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/carmen-sandiego-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Revisiting a game series from your youth is like exploring the basement in your childhood home. As you sift through the boxes and shelves, old memories come flooding back — which is exactly what happened as I started playing Carmen Sandiego, the latest game in a multimedia series that spans four decades. When the master thief appeared onscreen in her iconic trenchcoat and fedora, I was eight years old again, my face inches from a computer screen as I used my nascent knowledge of math, geography, and history to solve Carmen’s latest caper. 40 years later, Carmen Sandiego gives me that same thrill of solving puzzles by collecting clues, even if some of the modern additions to the visual novel-esque interface miss their mark.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a former child gumshoe whose grasp of geography was gleaned from tracking down the world’s worst criminals as they scurried around the globe, I was more than ready to revisit the Carmen Sandiego-verse with the release of this eponymous new adventure from Gameloft. Though it takes some story cues from the animated Netflix series that wrapped up in 2021 — and emulates its cartoony visual style — it’s not necessary to know anything about Carmen’s backstory with the evil organization VILE to enjoy her latest quest. Significantly, this is the first time in the long-running series that players get to step into Carmen’s shoes and don her famous fedora, but it doesn’t make a real difference to the crook-hunting formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the series got its start as an edutainment game, modern Carmen Sandiego is a mix of puzzle-solving, quick-time events, a dash of third-person top-down exploration, and (of course!) the occasional trivia question. In some ways, the newer elements make the world feel bigger and more exciting than its early DOS iterations; there’s more to do than simply click on icons representing key locations, parse through dialogue, and answer questions that wouldn’t be out of place on a fifth-grade final exam. That said, I wouldn’t have missed new activities like hang-gliding and grappling from rooftop to rooftop if they weren’t included.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In some ways, the newer elements make the world feel bigger and more exciting than its early DOS iterations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you follow VILE thieves from one country to the next, you’ll need to collect two types of clues: those that help them figure out where to go next, and those that help narrow down the list of suspects in the ACME detective agency’s database. In the ’80s and ’90s, Carmen Sandiego games relied on physical almanacs full of geographical and historical facts to help answer the in-game trivia questions and figure out what their clues meant. This time around, all of that information is kept within the game itself.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Carmen Sandiego - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the campaign, you’ll find pieces of data like airport codes, exports, national languages, government structures, and more. This self-built almanac comes in handy when you’re on a VILE villain’s tail and need to decide what to do next. Typically, you’ll have a handful of clues to go by — a color or pattern on the flag, the spoken language, or whether residents drive on the left or right side of the road. You’ll use those clues to determine your next city from three provided choices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, you’ll use personal information to narrow down the criminal behind each caper. The reimagined ACME Database makes this process smooth and streamlined; you can easily filter out suspects based on details about their hair and eye colors, hobbies, favorite foods, and fears. It’s quite satisfying to whittle down a list of 30-something suspects until there’s only one remaining and issue a warrant for their arrest. Just make sure you have the right person, otherwise it’s game over for Carmen (and time to start over for you).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s quite satisfying to whittle down a list of 30-something suspects until there’s only one remaining.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Clues are found by exploring key spots throughout a variety of exotic locations around the globe, from New Orleans to Barcelona to Singapore to Brisbane, with a few stops in between. This is similar to how the early games worked, but there’s a bit more room for exploration and making choices this time around. In some places, Carmen gets to wander around, question multiple witnesses, and seek out local trivia that could come in handy later. You don’t get to choose which activities happen in which location, but there’s more action involved than there used to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every case has several chapters with individual heists connected by an overarching villain. The cases start out at the scene of the crime, whether that crime is the theft of a Japanese bullet train, or the replacement of a city’s free Wi-Fi hotspots with paid “Vi-Fi” versions. In each city, you can visit three locations to collect clues that bring you one step closer to solving the case.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Mysteries Abound!</h3><p>Games that give your brain a workout.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how it works in practice: As you visit each of the in-city landmarks and districts, such as Singapore’s Merlion statue, or a viking-themed museum in Reykjavik, you’ll need to complete pre-determined activities to uncover that location’s clues. Sometimes, that means walking around and questioning suspects and witnesses, often picking up some geographical fun facts along the way. Other times, you may have to complete a hacking or lock-picking puzzle or use Carmen’s hang glider or grappling hook.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of these gameplay elements are more fun than others. Completing puzzles to hack safes or boost wireless signals was satisfying, but the more physical activities are mostly on rails and not particularly thrilling. I have a particular beef with the grappling hook mini-game, which requires a simple button press as icons align on your screen. The problem is, those icons sometimes move erratically, so grappling is either way too simple or frustratingly obtuse. There’s also a hang-gliding activity that’s perfectly… fine, but I’d rather have fewer gameplay elements that are more fleshed out than some forced action that feels like filler. I would have been perfectly happy with more brain-teasers instead.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I would have been perfectly happy with more brain-teasers.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though not as unforgiving as the 1985 iteration, it is possible to fail cases in Carmen Sandiego. The clock is always ticking. You typically have five or seven days to solve each case, and all of your activities take time — as does flying from one city to the next. If you missed a critical clue and ended up flying to Singapore when you’re supposed to be in Buenos Aires, you just wasted 11 hours. If you run out of time, the thief gets away and you have to start the case over. However, I never really felt the time crunch in the main campaign; I typically had at least a day left over, if not several.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other ways to fail cases in Carmen Sandiego, and these represented more of a threat in my playthrough. If you’re pickpocketing a VILE lackey and get noticed, you’ve just missed out on a key piece of evidence. Missing one clue won’t blow your case, but do that a few times and you won’t have enough information to make an arrest. Most of the time, I could pinpoint the exact moment when I blew it — I was too slow when following a mark, I didn’t pay close enough attention to actions that required precise button presses. Other times, I found myself at the end with several suspects still in my database and no idea where I missed a clue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though I did make some mistakes, the main campaign isn’t exactly what I’d call challenging. But considering the series’ history as a children’s educational resource, I may not be the target audience. I could see parents and kids playing through Carmen Sandiego together and having a great time as children build critical thinking skills and parents brush up on elementary-school geography. And though it’s on the simpler side, Carmen Sandiego never feels dumbed down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For my fellow olds looking for more of a challenge, you’re in luck. Aside from the main campaign, you can explore the ACME Files for what we’re told are cold cases dating back to the ’80s. These cases have adopted the modern systems for filtering out suspects and jetting around the world, but they’re presented in a retro, pixel art style — and injected with questions that might make you feel like you’re back in school and your teacher just slapped a pop quiz on your desk. Quick, what’s the biggest island in the Caribbean? Which country was the biggest producer of wheat and rice back in 1985? What’s 4x13x80? (Thankfully, despite what my teachers told me, I do have a calculator in my pocket everywhere I go.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ACME Files use a simplified interface that made me feel like I was back in front of my family computer in the early ’90s frantically paging through a physical book to find the answers. This time around, Google was my almanac. That might make the retro cases seem easier than those of the campaign, but they’re actually more difficult, particularly the time crunch. I actually did run out of time in the ACME Files, and watching those last few hours tick away filled me with a determination to do it better next time. Overall, these cases are a smart addition that add variety to the experience and provide some comforting fan service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The historical cases pull from the same list of cities as the main campaign, and it’s only a few hours before you’ve seen everywhere in the world that Carmen Sandiego can visit. I’m not sure why they couldn’t have expanded her global reach in the main campaign, but it results in every environment feeling a bit repetitive after a while. Still, there are often new facts to find upon revisiting, so every city is always worth another look.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe it’s the nostalgia goggles, but none of these shortcomings bothered me enough to make me want to stop playing. Each chapter is paced really well, so it always feels like you’re making progress. I love games that make you think your way out of problems, and for the most part, that’s exactly what Carmen Sandiego demands of the player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a shame, however, that the campaign ends rather abruptly. There’s another caper coming in a free DLC release later this year, but it was jarring to gear up for the final mystery and see “Coming Soon” in the menu of a completed, publicly released game. The story doesn’t feel like it’s reached a natural conclusion yet, but there’s still a good 15 hours of content between the campaign and the ACME Files — even more if you complete all of the cold cases from way back when. After my initial confusion, I took this as an opportunity to explore more old cases and await the day when I can complete Carmen’s adventure.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

IGN understands this was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/game-design-director-incubation-team-at-respawn-entertainment-3789765830/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a multiplayer FPS (for which at least one job posting was listed last year)</a> spun off by members of an internal team that was formerly working on a Star Wars FPS at Respawn, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawns-star-wars-fps-is-canceled-but-work-on-next-jedi-game-black-panther-and-iron-man-will-continue">which was itself canceled last year</a>. IGN can also confirm that a number of individuals have been laid off as part of the cancellation. Though we are unable to confirm the exact number, it has been characterized as "small" by a source familiar with the project. IGN has also identified at least one individual connected to the project who has clarified on LinkedIn that their departure was voluntary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This continues an ongoing trend of canceled projects, layoffs, and restructuring across EA, which kicked off in 2023 with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">elimination of 50 jobs at BioWare</a> and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs">unknown number more at Codemasters</a>. The culling continued almost exactly one year ago when the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">laid off 670 workers</a> company-wide and shuttered multiple projects, including the aforementioned Star Wars FPS. As part of those cuts, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-hit-by-layoffs-amid-eas-ongoing-reductions">around two dozen workers at Respawn lost their jobs</a>. Since then, EA has restructured BioWare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">moving developers to other projects internally</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">laying off another unknown number of key individuals</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to Electronic Arts for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
