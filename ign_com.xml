            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"It unfortunately did not meet our expectations."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile"><u>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</u></a> will go dark on April 17, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-game-closures-and-a-declining-audience-call-of-duty-is-in-a-rough-spot-so-whats-next"><u>We already knew</u></a> that Activision had decided to walk away from Warzone Mobile — the publisher admitted last May that it "unfortunately has not met [Activision's] expectations" — but now we have a specific date as to when the smartphone battle royale will be taken offline.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a brief <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>statement</u></a> posted to its official website, the team thanked players for their "dedication and passion," and said "as a final step in the previously communicated service changes to Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, the servers for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile will go offline on April 17, 2026, after which the game will no longer be available for play."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Up until that time, players can still play and "engage with existing content," but refunds are not available for any unused COD Points or previously purchased in-game content, so you're advised to use them up before the game shutdowns in April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mobile fans are encouraged to migrate to the free-to-play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-mobile"><u>Call of Duty: Mobile</u></a> — a different game, albeit with a confusingly similar title — "which offers franchise-favorite game modes, including Battle Royale, Multiplayer, and Zombies, as well as the new extraction-based DMZ: Recon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The standalone Call of Duty: Mobile delivers frequent seasonal content updates that include Ranked Play, Events, and the tier-based Battle Pass rewards system offering," the team explained. "Call of Duty: Mobile is available to download through Google Play and Apple’s App Store. Additionally, Call of Duty: Warzone is available on PC and console and is also free to play."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warzone Mobile launched in March 2024 on iOS and Android as a Warzone-specific Call of Duty mobile experience that offered battle royale for up to 120 players, with cross-progression to the PC and console versions of Warzone, Modern Warfare 2 and 3, and, later in the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6"><u>Black Ops 6</u></a>. It struggled right out of the gate, though, and failed to make a mark with "mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences," leading to Activision's decision to cull it just a little over a year later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-review"><u>Call of Duty Warzone Mobile review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile includes all the best elements of Warzone, while speeding up and streamlining matches and using cross-progression to make this a meaningful extension of the traditional experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been almost a year since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> released, and Ubisoft is not done updating its feudal Japan-set stabathon. This month brings the addition of a manual jump option, alongside two other fan-requested changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the 1.1.8 update going live today, February 17, Ubisoft will add a manual jump option to the game (if you've toggled on your Advanced Parkour setting), which returns from previous titles in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two other small additions are also set to become available: a detailed stat page so you can analyze your build in granular detail, and some visual improvements to when you make a critical hit. All of these changes had been requested by fans, so are likely to be positively received. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, this is a pretty small set of additions that look like the game's only major update across the first three months of this year. Update 1.1.7 launched back in December, capping off a first nine months of post-release additions that had arrived pretty much every month. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's update to Assassin's Creed Shadows is the first notable addition to the game of 2026, and according to a Winter Roadmap released by Ubisoft looks to be the only one coming ahead of the game's March 20 anniversary, which the company will celebrate with a livestream and giveaways. Here's hoping we hear more of what's coming to the game in its second year then. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only other item of note before then is the Switch 2 launch of the game's Claws of Awaji expansion on March 10. The add-on caps off the game's main narrative and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">now looks to be the only major expansion the game will get</a>. It's hard not to compare the level of support for Shadows with that for the series' previous game Valhalla, which received three major expansions, an Odyssey crossover DLC, an epilogue DLC and several major new modes, and feel like Shadows has been underserved in comparison.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/17/assassins-creed-shadows-winter-2026-roadmap-900x-1771321968443.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Shadows' Winter Roadmap. Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, a report stated that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-rumored-cooperative-multiplayer-assassins-creed-game">Ubisoft had scrapped a multiplayer Assassin's Creed game that originally began as Shadows DLC</a>.
