Recently filed records related to the suit, which involved the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aspyr-says-kotor-2-switch-dlc-was-canceled-because-a-third-party-objected"><u>cancelation of the Restored Content Modification (RCM) for the Nintendo Switch KOTOR 2 re-release</u></a>, appear to contain both updates for the KOTOR remake as well as mentions of a mysterious project known as “Juliet.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">11 Goofiest Silliest Weirdest Dumbest Star Wars Video Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Attorney Ray Kim prodded for details about what Project Juliet was during the deposition of Lucasfilm Games vice president Douglas Reilly. The Star Wars company VP’s response left little room for ambiguity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Juliet was the code name for a project where we were going to do a full remake of KOTOR II with modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general—the general content of KOTOR II, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kind of things,” Reilly said. “It was something we were discussing with Aspyr.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for that long-lost cut KOTOR 2 content, Reilly clarified that “the plan was we would remake the content that was in the RCM as it relates to Star Wars in that Juliet project.” Whether or not a KOTOR 2 remake remains in development is hazy for now, with Reilly’s last update saying Juliet was “technically on the roadmap” as of March 2025. Should Saber continue development, it seems the plan is for a reimagined version of the entire experience, even the RCM content, to be included in the final build.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many other details on the supposed KOTOR 2 remake remain a mystery, but the good news is that Reilly says “we’re starting with the remake of KOTOR 1,” clarifying that “Aspyr isn’t working on those games.” Instead, the KOTOR remake is said to now be in the hands of the team behind Hellraiser: Revival at Mad Head Games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s yet another update on a remake of a classic Star Wars video game that was first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kotor-aspyr-remaster-playstation-showcase-announcement-news"><u>announced all the way back in 2021</u></a>.

No details have yet emerged as to what the new studio will work on, or if any other former Perfect Dark employees joined them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked, a 2K spokesperson provided the following confirmation of the hire:</p><blockquote>With a combined six decades of AAA game-making experience across franchises like Tomb Raider, Call of Duty, Destiny, Marvel’s Spider-Man, Hitman, Deus Ex, and more, we’re thrilled to confirm Darrell Gallagher and Brian Horton have joined 2K for their next all-new venture. We don’t have additional details to share at this time, but look forward to sharing updates on their work in the future.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes after the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">cancelation of Perfect Dark</a> by Xbox earlier this year as part of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">larger wave of devastating layoffs</a>. The project had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-years-away">previously been a troubled one</a>, with multiple studios being brought into help and a number of internal revisions as studio leads tried to figure out what the game should be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While The Initiative was closed down upon the game's cancelation, Crystal Dynamics had also been working on the project. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Per Schreier's reporting</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-was-nearly-saved-by-take-two-but-the-deal-fell-through">corroborated by IGN's own sources</a>, leadership from both studio sides of the project spent two months after its cancelation shopping it around to publishers in an effort to save it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Which Tomb Raider? Who knows!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomb Raider will be at The Game Awards this week. Which Tomb Raider, you ask? The game or the show? We don't know! Maybe both!</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Tomb Raider (@tombraider) <a href="https://twitter.com/tombraider/status/1998095607001681987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from tweets both by <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1998093056692895923" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Awards creator Geoff Keighley</a> and the official Tomb Raider account. As Keighley puts it, "As just revealed in our The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in Thursday night for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises, Tomb Raider. This is one you won't want to miss."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what could be shown? There are a few possibilities. The first and most likely is that we're about to see the Tomb Raider game that's been in development at Crystal Dynamics for several years now. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-tomb-raider-unreal-engine-5-crystal-dynamics">First announced in 2022</a>, we have yet to actually see this game in action, though we did <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-dev-reveals-lara-crofts-official-redesign">get a look at the Lara Croft redesign last year</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One could forgive Crystal Dynamics for being so quiet the last three years, though, as the studio has been through it. Shortly before the announcement, Embracer Group purchased the studio and the franchise from Square Enix. Then, it sold both off to Middle-earth Enterprises in 2024. Amazon is still publishing Tomb Raider, but Amazon has had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mmo-new-world-enters-maintenance-mode-as-amazon-cuts-14000-jobs-but-whats-happening-with-its-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">its own issues</a> with the struggles of its New World MMO, its Lord of the Rings MMO, and mass layoffs. Amazon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-tomb-raider-and-lord-of-the-rings-video-game-reveals-not-too-far-away">said over a year ago</a> that the game would reveal was "not too far away," leading one to wonder what exactly was meant by that. Meanwhile, Crystal Dynamics has undergone three waves of layoffs this year, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-30-more-workers-in-third-wave-of-cuts-this-year">30 individuals last month</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">an unknown number of workers in August</a> following the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">cancellation of Perfect Dark by Xbox</a>, and<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 17 people earlier in the year</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-is-latest-embracer-studio-to-suffer-layoffs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 others back in 2023.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's the game side of things. On the TV side, we know there's a live-action Tomb Raider series in the works at Amazon in partnership with Story Kitchen, starring Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. The show will, per Story Kitchen, "reinvent the franchise on a massive scale" and will interconnect “live-action television series and video games into a unified storytelling universe.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Tomb Raider Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But again, it's been in the works for a while with no updates. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-tv-series-in-the-works-at-amazon-from-fleabag-writer">first heard of its development</a> in January of 2023, and it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-phoebe-waller-bridge-confirms-shes-working-on-amazon-series">was officially confirmed</a> later that year. There were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-show-from-fleabags-phoebe-waller-bridges-could-be-dead">reports in April of this year</a> that the TV show was "dead" in part due to Tuner's busy acting schedule and in part due to Jennifer Salke, who greenlit the show at Amazon, being "booted" from her job. There were also allegations that a script hadn't been provided yet. But then, in September, Amazon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-x-men-star-sophie-turner-confirmed-to-play-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-series">re-confirmed the Tomb Raider series was happening</a> and would start shooting in 2026, with Turner still to star.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's...a lot going on! With all that background, it seems most likely we're going to see the game, as the series hasn't begun shooting yet. However, it's possible we're due for a look at Turner as Lara Croft. Given the vagueness of Keighley and Crystal's tweets...why not both? In the meantime, at least we have the anime...I guess. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-review-netflix-hayley-atwell">didn't much care for the first season</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Awards will take place on Thursday, December 11, at 5pm PT/8pm ET. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-the-game-awards-2025">Here's our guide</a> on what else to expect at the show.

            <title><![CDATA[A Closer Look at Riftbound: The TCG That’s Hooking League Fans and New Players Alike]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/a-closer-look-at-riftbound-the-tcg-thats-hooking-league-fans-and-new-players-alike</link>
            <guid>1376599</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps it’s the smell and feel of new cards fresh from a pack, or just the expectation of what could be, but I love me some colorful cardboard rectangles, commonly referred to as “trading card games”. As someone who has been playing some manner of TCG or another for close to 30 years at this point, it feels like this particular hobby has seen an explosion in popularity and options for potential deck-builders to pick from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest offering that has drawn in crowds is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-is-an-impressive-league-of-legends-trading-card-game">Riftbound</a>, designed by Riot Games and published in partnership with UVS Games (the same group behind Universus, another TCG that brings massive properties like Godzilla and Street Fighter together in a competitive card game) and based on the immensely popular League of Legends IP. With Riftbound: Origins, the game’s first set, debuting only a few short weeks ago, Riftbound looks like a pretty neat game, but just how neat exactly?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I hopped in my car and dropped into my FLGS (friendly local game store) to get a more boots-on-the-ground look at Riftbound.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">To the Rift!</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/riftbound-impressions-1-1765225053055.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pulling into Game &amp; Company, located in Walled Lake, Michigan, I popped in during their recently added weekly Riftbound night. Spread across a few tables, players were fending off one another, holding down their battlefields, and making pushes to claim their opponents in an effort to score points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walking over to one of the tables, the players kindly let me sit down and watch and graciously answered my basic questions about the game - I had yet to play it at this point. At a glance, I could tell both of them were TCG veterans, with one playing on a gorgeous Dragon Ball Super playmat and the other one adorned with the MagicCon logo, so I asked what they both thought of Riftbound.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It quickly became apparent that both Brandon M. and Alex H. felt the big initial draw for Riftbound was the attached League of Legends IP. “I’ve played a lot of League [of Legends] so that’s definitely a draw,” Brandon explained, “I’ve always liked card games but just haven’t found that I have related to one as much as Riftbound.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/riftbound-impressions-3-1765225053055.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Alex echoed a similar sentiment, mentioning that he is a big fan of how the resource system is handled in Riftbound, known as Runes (basically mana for the MTG players out there), and that “you only have yourself to blame if you manascrew yourself” since Runes are placed in a separate, small side-deck you draw from each turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Popping into the shop’s Discord channel, I spoke with active member Chris, who attributes not only the IP to the reception but also the quality of the game: “Riftbound seems to have been developed by a team that has been paying attention both to what these games have done correctly or incorrectly as well as how they could connect this trading card game to the universe of Runeterra fans already know and love."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There is an incredible amount of depth to this game that I have only experienced in Magic:The Gathering. This is a great thing, as I feel a lot of the trading card games that have come after haven't really captured the complexity that leads to truly outstanding plays. Riftbound feels alive and vibrant, without feeling watered down and tired. I feel like most players are aware there is so much more to come due to the depth and expanse of the Runeterra lore, but we welcome it as players and are ready to take that journey.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">But how is it selling?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/riftbound-impressions-4-1765225053055.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaving the players to finish their best-of-three match, I wanted to get some perspective from the other side of the FLGS coin, the folks who run the shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking a break from stocking the shelves with board games and packs of the hottest TCGs, I asked Alyssa Dean, one of Game &amp; Company’s owners, what she makes of Riftbound so far. “What stands out to me the most about the Riftbound release is just how passionate the players are about the IP. They’re already in love with all these characters so just seeing them come to life in the game has been really rewarding for us as a store and for the players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That excitement looks to be translating into sales too, Alyssa continues, ”Sales are really high. TCGs are kind of at a high right now, so I wouldn’t say that it’s wild, but it is definitely very strong. If I could get, you know, 20 times more product than what I did, I guarantee I’d still sell out, which is a really great way for a game to start off, with this level of excitement.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/riftbound-impressions-6-1765225053054.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With the hype and the store’s excitement absorbed into my veins, I cracked some packs and wanted to see if Riftbound could sink its claws into someone who never played much League and could barely tell you what “jungling” means. First and foremost, holy crap is it tough to find <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-league-of-legends-where-to-buy">ANY sort of product right now</a>, be it single packs, champion decks, or the Proving Grounds boxed game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting some games in and cracking a couple of packs, even without much in-depth knowledge of the IP, it’s clear that Riftbound has some fun gameplay backing up the hype and some gorgeous card art too. The card games I've played, predominantly being Magic, Digimon, and some Gundam, mean my focus is always on how I dish out damage or tank the blows against me. I found Riftbound’s focus more on holding ground and shoring up your position to be a refreshing change of pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, I enjoy countering moves by my opponents and taking out their units, but I got far more of an adrenaline boost by overtaking an enemy battlefield and watching my victory points creep up as I held the line. I don’t need to know who Lee Sin is to know that this game feels good. Now I just need to track down enough packs to try my hand at making my own deck and really get into the jungle with this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riftbound looks to be riding high out of the gate with fans and game stores alike, and even as a League newbie (that’s still a word folks use, right?) its quick matches and its capture-and-hold gameplay have yanked me in like a champion out of formation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no shortage of options available for connoisseurs of colorful cardboard rectangles out there, so it remains to be seen if this up-and-comer is able to protect its lanes from the likes of Magic, One Piece, and whatever the next new TCG turns out to be. The next set, Spiritforged, is due out in February and with players rabid to get their hands on every bit of Origins they can, Riftbound looks to be a serious contender for TCG players’ time and money, but it remains to be seen for how long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Play an in-game month with most of the gameplay systems in place.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Management sim Esports Manager 2026, from developer Neurona Games and publishing platform indie.io, just released a new demo on Steam that gives an in-depth look at the systems that will be present in the final game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you could probably guess from the name, the game puts you in the role of a manager of an esports organization and challenges you to lead it to victory. The demo focuses on the three key systems that define the gameplay: talent acquisition, management of staff and players, and match simulation.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-8230edeea63e7deee47edfa8b1f742ed03bc67de-1920x1080-1764973274573.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can create your own organization from scratch or take control of a real esports organization, like EternalFire, Copenhagen Wolves, M80, and GamerLegion, and additional teams will be added when the game fully releases. And with the Transfer Module, you can scout, buy, and sell players, including real-life players like <a href="https://x.com/neLendirekt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@neLendirekt</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/BanKsEsports" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@BanKsEsports</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/PiNGCasts" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@PiNGCasts</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/bit1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@bit1</u></a>, and many more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player has ratings in several different categories. Some define their technical gaming ability, like their skill with different weapon types or how clutch they are. Others define their personality, like leadership, amicability, and loyalty. And still others define their physical attributes, like eyesight, reaction time, and endurance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll be competing with other organizations for their services, negotiating contracts and building a roster that best aligns with your current goal. Timing and market conditions will affect these negotiations, so your strategy might need to change as circumstances do. And you’ll need to balance your income, expenses, and sponsorships to keep your organization from going bankrupt.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-26db38347b8fcfd4dfc17bac991af74122c430ea-1920x1080-1764973296841.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve built your team, you can use the Talk Module to communicate directly with your players and staff members to manage their growth, morale, and relationships. You set training plans to improve players’ skills, but you also need to keep an eye on their well-being and how they’re feeling. You don’t want to overwork them or wear them down. You’ll also need to monitor how your players and staff members feel about each other and resolve any conflicts that might come up. It’s all part of the nitty gritty of running an organization; it’s not always sunshine and rainbows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it wouldn’t be an esports team without the actual esports. Using the Simulation Module, you’ll take the team you’ve built into tournaments, where you can watch it perform in semi-3D simulated matches. Will all your hard work pay off in a tournament win? Or will it be clear you need to develop your team more? There’s no way to know until you actually see them in action. And with the Tactic Creator, you can design and test strategies that you can use during simulations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These systems make up the core gameplay loop of Esports Manager 2026, and about 70% of the final systems are present in the demo. The demo doesn’t limit the real-life amount of time you can play it, but it is limited to one in-game month. That’s plenty of time to go through the full process of creating your manager profile, choosing a team, building your roster, communicating with players, signing up for a tournament, and going through simulated matches.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-56e08dc15e864c548deeb239ab7187ecf86fd4b7-1920x1080-1764973253420.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While most of the core gameplay is there, the developers have also made it clear that more is on the way. In particular, match simulations will be significantly expanded and more complex, with added options for tactical control and in-game events. And, of course, everything that’s present in the demo will be further balanced and polished between now and release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the full game, the demo is meant to be replayed to test out new strategies and experience more of what it has to offer. And it should give you a pretty accurate idea of the scope of the final game. The demo is available to download <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2749950/Esports_Manager_2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>on Steam</u></a> now, and if you want to get the latest updates, you can follow Esports Manager 2026 on <a href="https://x.com/EManagerGame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Twitter</u></a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/esportsmanager" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Discord</u></a>.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/esports-manager-2026-drops-new-demo-on-steam]]></content:encoded>
