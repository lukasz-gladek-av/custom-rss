After all, Microsoft has form when it comes to mid-cycle hardware refreshes, offering a more powerful version of the Xbox One.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Xbox boss Phil Spencer, though, times have changed, and while he failed to definitively rule out releasing a more powerful Xbox Series console, it doesn't sound likely.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/gettyimages-2183768660-1731684332414.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer. Photo by Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Microsoft's gaming boss questioned the value of a mid-gen refresh, suggesting it is unnecessary given the diminishing returns developers are seeing with increased horsepower.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We think about hardware that can create unique value for our players or creators on our platform,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We don’t need to do incremental hardware for our own benefit. Does a new device really give you a unique experience on screen in some way? [It’s] less like the old days, going from the original Xbox to 360; that was standard definition to high definition. Now, [it’s] harder to show the benefits."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t the first time Spencer has cast doubt on a possible Xbox mid-gen upgrade. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer doubled down on Microsoft’s focus on expanding Xbox’s audience via new devices, saying: "To reach new players, we need to be creative and adaptive of new business models, new devices, new ways of access. We're not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this doesn’t mean Microsoft is getting out of the console business. In fact, in the Rolling Stone interview Spencer confirmed: “we’ll definitely do more consoles in the future, and other devices.” What form they take, however, remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-job-ad-confirms-upcoming-open-world-shooter-is-in-the-works-and-all-signs-point-to-starcraft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard is hiring for an “upcoming open-world shooter game,” a new job ad has revealed — and all signs point to it being a StarCraft FPS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1grd6c1/new_blizzard_open_world_shooter/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, on November 13 Blizzard posted a <a href="https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/job/R024230/Associate-Design-Director-Innovation-Unannounced-Game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job ad</a> for an Associate Design Director, Innovation on an unannounced game. The description goes into more detail:</p><blockquote>As the Design Director of Innovation, you will be the vision holder and owner of key strategic innovations on an upcoming open-world shooter game. You stay current with the latest developments in both the indie and AAA space. David Bowie is quoted as saying “Go a little bit out of your depth. And when you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting” – the idea of innovating in the deep end excites you, balanced with a pragmatic desire to turn dreams into reality that players can get their hands on and enjoy.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That blurb confirms Blizzard’s plan to release an open-world shooter, but what is it? In September, it emerged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">Blizzard was reportedly making a third attempt at developing a StarCraft shooter</a>, with former Far Cry executive producer Dan Hay, who joined Blizzard in 2022, leading the charge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news came from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier while speaking to IGN’s Podcast Unlocked, below, about his new book, Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment. Hay’s StarCraft shooter is mentioned in the book, and IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey asked Schreier if it’s likely to actually come out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“If it’s not canceled!” Schreier replied. “This is Blizzard after all. Their history with StarCraft shooters is not good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes, that is a project that as far as I know is in development, or at least as of the time that I wrote this book was in development. They are working on a StarCraft shooter, StarCraft is not dead at Blizzard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The goal of the book isn’t to get a bunch of scoops about upcoming things. That wasn’t the purpose of this book at all, it was very much to tell a story and focus on stuff that had happened. But this felt like such an interesting and useful nugget to include because it really just shows you that Blizzard cannot quit StarCraft shooters.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was a reference to Blizzard’s infamous attempt to release a StarCraft shooter in the past as part of a bid to expand the StarCraft franchise beyond its real-time strategy origins. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starcraft-ghost"><u>StarCraft Ghost</u></a>, announced in 2002, was going to be a tactical-action console game in which you played as a deadly Ghost operative in the employ of the Dominion, but it was canceled in 2006 after a series of delays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A second attempt to make a StarCraft shooter, codenamed Ares, was canceled in 2019 so Blizzard could focus on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv"><u>Diablo 4</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2"><u>Overwatch 2</u></a>. Ares was reportedly “like Battlefield in the StarCraft universe,” but, like Ghost, fell by the wayside.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hay joined Ubisoft in 2011 to work on Far Cry 3, then became executive producer for the Far Cry brand, shipping Far Cry Blood Dragon, Far Cry 4, and Far Cry Primal. Hay was creative director and executive producer on Far Cry 5 and executive director for Far Cry New Dawn and Far Cry 6 before joining Blizzard in 2022 as GM/VP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things are slowly ramping up for StarCraft. Blizzard recently released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starcraft-remastered-and-starcraft-2-campaign-collection-confirmed-for-game-pass"><u>StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection on Game Pass</u></a>, and announced a StarCraft crossover with Warcraft card game Hearthstone. It looks like Blizzard is gearing up for something even bigger, though. Like, open-world bigger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
