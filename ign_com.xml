The PlayStation reference, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-and-website-still-lists-release-date-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-with-no-mention-of-pc">the trailer notice confirming the footage was entirely captured on PS5</a>, has some wondering whether Sony has signed a co-marketing deal with Rockstar for the promotion of GTA 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GTA series was once inexorably linked to PlayStation, and Rockstar and Sony have done deals like this before. GTA 6, which is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time, would certainly be an aggressive marketing move from Sony, but you can imagine itâ€™s hoping GTA 6 sells the PS5 Pro in huge numbers in time for the May 2026 release date. Assuming we donâ€™t see a PC release at the same time as console, PS5 Pro will be the most powerful platform for what is expected to be the best-selling game of all time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, fans are having fun with this PlayStation nod in the GTA 6 trailer, with some joking that itâ€™s an early look at the PS6.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="fr" dir="ltr">Rockstar Games leak la PS6 dans le second trailer de GTA VI. ðŸ‘½ <a href="https://t.co/liBCpDFJQX" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/liBCpDFJQX</a></p>â€” PXL (@MisterPXL) <a href="https://twitter.com/MisterPXL/status/1919760323231219787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"GTA 6 playable within GTA 6 before GTA 6," joked redditor WillyPepper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are wondering if previous GTA games will be playable within GTA 6 in a nod to Rockstar's past, perhaps as one of the many mini-games.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyclades-legendary-edition-board-game-review.1182390/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyclades-legendary-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">While the myths of ancient Greece bubble through the substrate of many board games â€“ take <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horrified-greek-monsters-board-game-review"><u>Horrified: Greek Monsters</u></a>, for example â€“ there are surprisingly few that place them front and center. Narrow the frame to the way many people think about the age, one of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games"><u>conquest, bloodshed and warfare</u></a>, and there are even fewer. Which might partly explain the success of 2009s Cyclades, a clever marriage of myth, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">wargame</a> and more subtle strategic mechanisms. Now itâ€™s back in a spanking new edition with some fun tweaks from its original expansions.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box?">What's in the Box</h2></p><div catalogid="61832a28-9027-4b8e-8ae8-991e3325cb30" id="219281"><div id="219281" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cyclades</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aficionados of the original Cyclades might recall its big, oblong box, but this new Legendary Edition comes in a standard-sized square package thatâ€™s crammed with goodies. Thereâ€™s no longer a central map board, which has been replaced by board modules that you can rearrange to make different maps of different sizes, depending on the player count. You can even flip them over for a more advanced map variant. The large board to track gods, monsters and heroes still remains. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are punch-out cardboard strips to represent the gods, while the heroes and monsters get a deck of cards each, plus cardboard standees for those that move around the map. Other punch-out tokens include various buildings and upgrades for the map, plus a horde of cardboard coins. Most of this gets tucked away neatly in a treasure-chest like box insert with a flip-up lid, a smart extra design feature to help you organize and pack away the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player gets a screen, a pile of cardboard control tokens, and a mix of wooden army and navy pieces all in their chosen color. There are six to choose from, rather than the original five, plus a seventh set of gray pieces that represent mercenaries, another new inclusion in this edition. These are nicely cut, but nothing to write home about. If you want to make your game pop even more on the table, there are plastic miniature upgrades available separately for the troops and the monsters, plus metal coins to chink satisfyingly in your hand.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays </h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cyclades-4-1746542932748.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Cyclades was an early example of a design trying to weave together the chaotic combat that characterized American gaming with the more refined sensibilities found in Germany. You start each round with that more genteel aspect, bidding in an auction for the favor of one of the available gods, which will determine your available actions for the rest of the turn. Some gods are face down, so that there are only as many available as the number of players, meaning someone has to take the weakest â€“ and cheapest â€“ god, Apollo. Each round one of the face-down gods and one of the face-up gods gets flipped, so all of them get cycled through.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not all the gods are created equal. The war god, Ares, allows you to recruit or move troops, for example, while wise Athena allows you to build universities and recruit philosophers, neither of which have any immediate effect but can, in time, contribute toward victory. To up the ante, the higher bid slots begin to jump in increments of two, then five, while players will still need to consider holding resources to pay for their actions, most of which also cost money. Finally thereâ€™s Apollo who, while free, does very little, allowing you merely to up the income from two of your provinces.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cyclades-2-1746542932748.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this means competition in the bidding can be intense, depending on the board situation, with winning or losing a particular god having a huge impact on the game state. Itâ€™s a fraught, exciting auction when thereâ€™s a lot riding on a turn, with various other considerations feeding into the bids. Sometimes itâ€™s worth trying to outbid an opponent just to keep yourself safe from a land or sea attack. Sometimes itâ€™s worth leaving yourself short-changed in terms of paying for actions just to corner a particular deity. Itâ€™s a dynamic phase, with plenty of interaction.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Winning or losing a particular god has a huge impact on the game state.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Winning requires you to control three metropolis pieces. You can gain these by swapping four different basic buildings, each of which is granted by a different god, or by cashing in four of Athenaâ€™s philosophers. One of the other gods, Hera, allows you to recruit heroes, powerful on-board pieces with special powers that can also be sacrificed for a metropolis. Mighty Ajax, for instance, counts as two armies and can be exchanged for a metropolis if you control seven land spaces. Which brings us neatly onto the last way to gain one: take it off another player via military conquest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warfare in Cyclades is short and brutal. In a contested land or sea space you tot up the units on each side together with the value of a dice roll with the loser removing a piece. Repeat until only one side remains. While the dice only goes up to three, this can still be a surprisingly swingy affair. Resources, however, keep a cap on the violence. Each player only has eight army and navy pieces and, of course, winning the bid for Ares is the main way to gain and move troops, all of which limits how many campaigns you can conduct.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cyclades-3-1746542932748.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In this edition, however, there are sneaky ways round these restrictions. Hera not only allows you to gain heroes but also mercenary troops, meaning you can expand on your paltry tally of eight. And all the gods allow you to make heroic moves, which essentially means you can move and fight with any army that includes a hero. This gives the game a surprising amount of maneuverability, clashing not only over valuable buildings but spaces that provide income, and makes heroes particularly valuable pieces to risk in a fight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also means turns that feature Hera or Ares can feel heavily weighted in terms of tilting the game state. And if everyone wants a piece of the action, that can very much be the case. Cyclades, however, is a game about taking the rough with the smooth. You can prosper without violence by taking cheaper bids on weaker gods and building up your infrastructure. But everyone around the table has to be okay with a game where your attempt to play economically can potentially be undermined by a burst of conflict. Itâ€™s all about knowing when to change tack, balancing the time to strike out with the time to shepherd resources, but having war and peace so close to one another in the same package can sometimes feel jarring.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Warfare in Cyclades is short and brutal.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Either approach can really benefit from mythological creatures, which you can purchase with any god other than Apollo, but more peaceable players are more likely to be able to afford them. Theyâ€™re pretty powerful and so work as an effective balance against big bids on warlike gods. Most are one-shot effects, like the Satyr who lets you steal a philosopher from another player, or the Harpy, who destroys an army. Others, however, get a piece on the board which you can keep and move from turn to turn if youâ€™re willing to sacrifice priestesses, gained by winning the auction for Zeus. These include horrors like the kraken, who simply wipes out all fleets in whatever space it enters. Pushing these beasts around the map is enormous fun, so long as you can afford the priestesses to do so.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cyclades-6-1746542932748.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAbZeo?object_uuid=f8d258c7-2fd1-487b-965f-8b85510654fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DXQF894V" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgbn8?object_uuid=f8d258c7-2fd1-487b-965f-8b85510654fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Atomic Empire</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Oy8G?object_uuid=f8d258c7-2fd1-487b-965f-8b85510654fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Hachette</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QObKNn?object_uuid=f8d258c7-2fd1-487b-965f-8b85510654fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Kickstarter</a></li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 6, 2025 4:10 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Cyclades is a rare game that succeeds in making both a peace and war viable approaches to victory. Indeed, to really prosper youâ€™ll likely have to do both and learn when one is more appropriate for the other. This is, in turn, also its greatest fault. Wargamers may feel frustrated by its economic elements, while less aggressive gamers may find its bloodshed and trash talk unfair and unbalanced. But for those willing to stand astride both camps, this is a rare pleasure, built to cater for broader sensibilities, and this new edition is a step up in terms of both presentation and content.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-is-getting-two-new-classes-with-nintendo-switch-2-tarnished-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring is headed for the Nintendo Switch 2 with its Tarnished Edition, and it looks like FromSoftware's massive adventure will have a few new bonuses in tow, including new classes and appearances for Torrent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported on by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/41423" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Famitsu</a>, an event called "FROMSOFTWARE GAMES EVENT Spring 2025" was held in Tokyo on May 6. The presentation revealed some new details about what's coming to Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, including two new character classes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two classes are, as <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/17375-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-will-add-2-new-classes-among-others" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">translated by RPG Site</a>, the "Knight of Ides" and "Heavy Armored Knight." Not many details seem to have been revealed outside a name and a look. Those two sets will reportedly be two of the four new armors in the Tarnished Edition, with the other two available to obtain in-game. More new weapons and skills were also teased.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who care for their steed Torrent, the spirit horse is also getting three new appearances. While this content will be part of Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, which also contains the Shadow of the Erdtree content, FromSoftware has also said this content will come to other platforms via the Tarnished Pack DLC. Per RPG Site, FromSoftware said this DLC pack would be available at a low price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some new classes are an interesting addition, though it makes sense as players will largely be starting new files on Switch 2 and might want to shake things up. Getting a little bit of new content right away might be appealing to those who have already played quite a bit of Elden Ring on other platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring has reached a significant number of people, as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-tops-30-million-sales-worldwide-news-in-brief" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring has officially cleared 30 million sales worldwide</a>. It's an absolutely titanic achievement, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that number climb higher as it hits the Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No release date has been set yet for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition on the Switch 2, or for when the Tarnished Pack DLC will arrive, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nintendo-switc-2">other than sometime in 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
