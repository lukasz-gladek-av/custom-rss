And up until very recently, I’d argue that under his watch, the brand really did put players first, even if Xbox has continued to lose market share to PlayStation. As a reminder: Phil immediately <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/13/microsoft-reveals-xbox-one-without-kinect"><u>unbundled</u></a> the Kinect from the Xbox One, removing the $100 albatross weighing the console down. His first big initiative as boss was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/15/e3-2015-xbox-one-backward-compatibility-update-enables-360-xbla?_gl=1*quxw10*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTg1ODYxMjY3LjE3NTkyODE1MzY.*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTkyODE1MzYkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTkyODE1MzYkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>championing backwards compatibility</u></a>, which is inarguably a huge success. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-fps-boost-far-cry-4-watch-dogs-2-sniper-elite-4-ufc-4"><u>FPS Boost</u></a> on Xbox Series later made many of those old games run even better. He dragged Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/02/sonys-stubborn-stance-on-cross-play-is-embarrassing"><u>kicking and screaming</u></a> into normalizing cross-play. The Xbox One X <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/08/xbox-one-x-review"><u>one-upped the PS4 Pro</u></a> by offering true, native 4K. And Xbox gaming has undeniably become more inclusive in the Phil Spencer Era thanks to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-gaming-accessibility-advancements-controllers-ui"><u>Xbox Adaptive Controller</u></a> as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-accessibility-is-the-future-of-gaming"><u>laudable ASL features</u></a> in multiple first-party games. Finally, there’s Xbox Game Pass, whose mystery economics continue to make it controversial amongst both gamers and developers alike, but has nevertheless been a tremendous value for subscribers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until now, at least. On IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/xbox-unlocked">Unlocked podcast</a>, I (far too) often make reference to that Simpsons gif where Sideshow Bob keeps <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/the-simpsons-sideshow-bob-RSOUOj8H9A3Xq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>stepping on the rakes</u></a> he’s surrounded by. And the reason I do that is because Xbox always seems to find a way to ruin any momentum it builds up, typically through no fault of anyone but itself. Take the month of October, for instance. Microsoft is shipping not one or two but <em>three </em>really exciting new games in the next 30 days: the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-first-hands-on-impressions-its-faster-and-bloodier-than-ever"><u>very</u></a>-<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-the-final-preview"><u>awesome</u></a>-so-far Ninja Gaiden 4, which revives the beloved fast-action franchise after a dormant decade; Double Fine’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/double-fines-next-game-keeper-has-you-controlling-a-walking-lighthouse-driven-by-a-goofy-bird"><u>promising</u></a> Keeper, the studio’s next project after its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2021-winners-revealed"><u>Game Awards Game of the Year-nominated</u></a> Psychonauts 2; and ever-reliable Obsidian Entertainment’s RPG/shooter sequel The Outer Worlds 2, which we’ve loved every time we’ve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-the-first-preview-ign-first"><u>seen</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-first-hour-has-layers-and-layers-of-role-playing-opportunities"><u>played</u></a> it. That’s a potentially huge month for Xbox – particularly when so many Xbox fans remember how it wasn’t long ago when we’d be lucky to get three ultra-promising first-party releases in an entire <em>year</em>, let alone a single month.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All three will drop onto Xbox Game Pass on day one – but this is the part where Xbox starts stepping on all those rakes. Effective immediately, you’ll need to pay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-rises-to-30-a-month-microsoft-adds-more-day-one-games-and-throws-in-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-to-help-justify-the-cost?_gl=1*16yxkxu*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTYzNzk0MjM4My4xNzU5MzM0NzE3*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTkzMzQ3MTYkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTkzMzQ3MTYkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>a whopping 50% more</u></a> for that privilege. Microsoft has raised Game Pass prices for the third year in a row, with the give-me-all-the-day-one-releases tier now setting players back $30 per month. Fourteen months ago, by the way, Game Pass Ultimate was $17. That’s how high and how fast the price has risen. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fourteen months ago, Game Pass Ultimate was $17. Now it's $30. That’s how high and how fast the price has risen.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fairness to Microsoft, the company has added more to Ultimate: Ubisoft+ Classics, Fortnite Crew, and higher-resolution cloud gaming. It’s also worth mentioning that multiple likely Game of the Year candidates hit Game Pass Ultimate on day one this year: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight: Silksong, and Blue Prince. But we all know that the biggest appeal of Game Pass are those day-one benefits for Xbox-published games, and this price increase feels directly targeted at that. (For the record, PC Game Pass is going from $12 to $16.49 per month.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes immediately on the heels of the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-in-the-usagain"><u>jacking up Xbox console prices</u></a> for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raises-the-price-of-all-xbox-series-consoles-xbox-games-confirmed-to-hit-80-this-holiday"><u>second time</u></a> in the past four months, with the top-end Xbox Series X now carrying an eye-watering price tag of $800. But that $800 almost sounds like a damn bargain next to the much-hyped ROG Xbox Ally X handheld gaming PC, which weighs in at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-and-rog-xbox-ally-price-finally-revealed-microsoft-goes-for-1000-for-most-powerful-version-amid-tariff-uncertainty"><u>NINE-HUNDRED AND NINETY-NINE U.S. DOLLARS</u></a>. Sure, there’s a less powerful, more affordable version for $599, but nobody knows if that one’s worth a damn, because Microsoft has only ever let media and influencers get their hands on the more powerful Ally X. Hopefully it proves useful, as the Series S has for the non-hardcore gamer part of the market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heck, the only thing the Xbox folks haven’t raised prices on are first-party games. Oh, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-is-microsofts-first-confirmed-80-game"><u>they tried</u></a> with The Outer Worlds 2, to be clear – and they inevitably will next year when Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, Forza Horizon 6, etc. drop – but the Xbox community wasn’t having any of that, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers"><u>Microsoft relented</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I realize we live in crazy times, and that Sony and Nintendo are not exactly blameless here either after each of them raised prices on their own aging hardware in the past year (with Nintendo also aggressively raising software prices for the Switch 2 generation as well). Blame the Trump tariffs if you want to (heck, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-in-the-usagain"><u>Microsoft does</u></a>), but I’m sorry: at the end of the day, the buck stops with Microsoft. This is a company with a market cap of nearly $4 <em>trillion</em>, who has done layoff after layoff, after spending upwards of $80 billion on studio and publisher acquisitions. And it’s fair to wonder if those naysayers who question the sustainability of Game Pass and its business model are being proven right with this latest, deepest round of price hikes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We’ve reached a sad point where gaming is becoming less accessible to new players rather than more.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s worse is that, in the bigger picture, we’ve reached a sad point where gaming is becoming less accessible to new players rather than more. Historically, console prices go down and the size and quality of the game library goes up over the course of a generation, leading to more units sold and a healthier ecosystem for everyone inside it. And while again, the blame for the absence of that this generation does not rest squarely on Microsoft’s shoulders, the actions of Team Xbox are of a company that isn’t showing a lot of empathy towards its customers as the cost of groceries, gas, and other bare essentials keeps going up. Again, these larger economic issues aren’t Microsoft’s fault, and it has to contend with rising development costs too, but they are choosing profit over players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As such, while I recognize that this Xbox console generation isn’t over yet, it’s almost certainly going to be remembered first and foremost for Microsoft’s greed: two hardware price increases (and counting), three Xbox Game Pass price increases (and counting), one software price increase (so far), and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff"><u>tens of thousands of layoffs</u></a> as well as multiple studio closures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s kind of a monkey’s paw situation, really: all Xbox gamers have wanted since the start of the catastrophic Xbox One generation was a steady supply of great first-party games. Well, in 2025 we’re finally getting that – and as I’ve already mentioned, 2026 is shaping up to be a banger too – but it’s coming at the cost of, well…practically everything else. But it’s not our fault. Instead, Microsoft’s greed is to blame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

Drawing inspiration from the ARPG greats like Diablo, Path of Exile, and Grim Dawn while packaging everything in a highly replayable roguelike formula, Gell Clock provides a great middle ground for people who want to experience the power fantasy of an ARPG without having to grind for hundreds of hours every season. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/hell-clock/news/hell-clock-1-1-crafting-system-preview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Patch 1.1, the Clockmaker’s Tools,</u></a> is Hell Clock’s largest update yet. This patch brings crafting to Hell Clock, allowing you to modify the affixes on your Relics, craft powerful new Imbuements and corrupt Relics (the ultimate risk and reward).</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/01/img-1-clockmakers-tools-1759338712408.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><ul data-cy="list"><li>Tool of Tinkering randomizes 1 primary or secondary affix on the Relic.

Take a look at IGN's post on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hell-clock-update-11-detailed">Hell Clock 1.1 Update</a> for more information.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/01/img-2-beginners-guide-1759338858483.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Maxroll Hell Clock Beginner's Guide</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Maxroll’s comprehensive <a href="https://maxroll.gg/hell-clock/getting-started/hell-clock-beginners-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Hell Clock Beginner's Guide</u></a> gets into the details of Hell Clock's core systems and mechanics with links to more detailed guides where you can learn more. Start by exploring the campaign, progressing through each act, and challenging bosses. Next, learn more about the game's progression and metaprogression systems. These include Skills, Blessings, Gear, Passives, Relics, and Constellations, all of which combine to make a variety of builds. Then learn about what awaits you in the endgame with Abyss, Oblivion, and Ascension.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/01/img-3-getting-started-1759339001410.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Getting Started in Hell Clock</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After getting started with the Beginner's Guide, continue your journey with Maxroll’s new player resources. First up, the <a href="https://maxroll.gg/hell-clock/getting-started/hell-clock-campaign-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Campaign Guide</u></a> has information on all of the Survival Encounters and Bosses you find when progressing through Hell Clock's 3 Act story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Note:</strong> As part of the endgame,<span tabindex="-1" role="button">Tap to Reveal</span></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Skills</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Skills are the core of your build in Hell Clock. Some Skills, like Split Shot, are easy to spam and often act as your primary damage. Others, such as Spectral Knives, have a longer cooldown and often take a secondary role. As you progress through the Acts and defeat bosses, you can access new skills (via the Skill Book), but you must spend 100 Soul Stones to unlock them.

Of course, like with all road maps the content and delivery date are subject to change. The next major patch is Movement 2.0, which will allow you to use all of your skills while moving. This is going to be particularly impactful for channeled skills like Repeaters. In addition the patch will bring a new character animation system and all 52 Constellations. The plan is to release this in November 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After that the next major update is the Cursed War, slated for Q1 of 2026.
