            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The founder, director, producer, and writer behind indie title <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallen"><u>Fallen</u></a> has responded to claims its reveal trailer was built using generative AI, confirming that it was a "tone pitch" with AI "placeholders [that] briefly escaped the context [they were] meant to live in."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the Fallen reveal teaser debuted on IGN, commenters were quick to critique it, with one writing: "Woof. Any way to unreveal it?" and another saying: "can't wait to not touch this with a 10-foot pole."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Are game companies even aware of how controversial using AI art is?" asked someone else in the comments. "Why can't [they] just read the room."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can watch the trailer yourself below:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, creator Brooke Burgess has clarified that while there are AI "placeholders" in the trailer, the gameplay, environments, cinematics, and combat is "real, in-engine UE5.4 work" and "all writing is mine (no LLMs), all audio is bespoke, VO is from my colleague Kasper Michaels, and all creative support [and] implementation was done in close collaboration with my lead."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think most of the confusion boils down to context," Burgess told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallen-gen-ai-real-in-engine-ue54-work/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TheGamer</u></a>. "What ended up being shared as an 'official trailer' was actually our early dev 'tone pitch,' i.e., a work-in-progress UE5 teaser designed for funding discussions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are [AI-generated] placeholders in there, specifically some 2D test assets used to explore mood and presentation (for example, how 'lost souls' and fallen angels in the game might react when spoken to and judged, along with [work-in-progress] HUD elements). That material was never intended as final content, nor as a statement on how the shipped game would be made."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a separate interview, Burgess told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fallen-creator-brooke-burgess-on-the-struggle-to-get-game-funding-above-1-million" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesIndustry.biz</u></a> last week that he was not "waving the flag of AI by any stretch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm not going to sell my soul and be like, 'Yeah, I'll do it by myself, let me prompt this whole game into existence'," Burgess said. "No, I want to work with really talented people and make something cool. But if integrating it in a way that doesn't affect creativity, but helps to save a little bit of money and gets the game out there to people, and gives us a chance to make something cool and memorable, and then make something else after that — it's something I have to factor in."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also revealed that "every" prospective publisher has asked how he intends to use AI to "save money."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every publisher I've talked to has brought up: 'So, have you thought about how AI might be able to save money on this?'" he added. "Almost all of them. They want to know that you're thinking about it, that you understand the potential."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallen is an "epic dark fantasy action adventure game" featuring an avenging angel sent to the depths of Hell for one purpose — "to judge every demon, lost soul, and fallen angel, and bring an end to the cycle of suffering once and for all!" We don't have a release date or even a release windows at this time, but it is expected to come to both PC and consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Opinion on the use of AI in games continues to divide studios and their fans, with some vehemently against its use, while others claim it's an inevitable part of the future. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-co-founder-and-former-gta-writer-dan-houser-says-ai-is-like-when-we-fed-cows-with-cows-and-got-mad-cow-disease"><u>Rockstar co-founder and former Grand Theft Auto writer Dan Houser recently likened AI to mad cow disease</u></a>, but the CEO of Genvid — the company behind choose-your-own-adventure interactive series like Silent Hill Ascension — has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gen-z-loves-ai-slop-former-square-enix-exec-claims-a-lot-of-ai-sentiment-is-driven-by-emotion-rather-than-logic"><u>claimed "consumers generally do not care" about generative AI in games, and stated that: "Gen Z loves AI slop."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA CEO Andrew Wilson has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>said AI is "the very core of our business,"</u></a> and Square Enix recently implemented mass layoffs and reorganized, saying it needed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan"><u>be "aggressive in applying AI</u></a>." Dead Space creator Glen Schofield also recently detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered"><u>his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in game development</u></a>, and former God of War dev Meghan Morgan Juinio said: "... if we don’t embrace [AI], <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short"><u>I think we’re selling ourselves short</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark Studios has said players who spawn late don’t realize they “economically profit way more” than players who don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/that-really-sucks-arc-raiders-lead-responds-to-complaints-about-late-spawns-says-late-joiners-are-important-and-profit-way-more-but-embark-knows-its-annoying-to-have-no-time-for-objectives/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, design lead Virgil Watkins discussed the extraction shooter’s divisive late spawn system, which can see players join games with around 20 minutes left to go. The feeling from some is that this can be a frustrating experience because it gives late joiners less time to complete objectives, and there isn’t as much loot around. But Watkins suggested the data tells a different story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We 100% acknowledge the whole thing of, 'Man, I came in to do that trial and now I clearly don't have enough time to do that, and that sucks, so I'm just going to leave,' or whatever. That aspect is definitely not great,” Watkins admitted.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"But similar to the perception of free kits versus what they do, the perception around late joining and what it affords you has been quite interesting. Players are like, 'The loot's all gone,' or whatever else. But players who late join economically profit way more than people who aren't. The session, when they are fresh, does eventually get quieter, and very often they come across the remnants of fights or can maybe take out bigger drones or hit high-ticket areas more readily than other players. So that's been a very interesting thing to look at."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what is the goal behind the late join system? According to Watkins, it helps mitigate deserted raids. Indeed, Embark distributes loot in such a way so “there should be plenty of stuff for players to do” even if they join late.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be interesting to see if Watkins’ explanation here turns sentiment on late spawns around. Since Arc Raiders’ explosive launch, its late spawn system has come under fire from some who feel it needs to be overhauled. There’s frustration on both sides, with those who have to face late spawns having been in a game from the start also expressing concern.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's crazy that my team can clear a section of Stella Montis, place traps near the popular entrances, and start looting... only to have a full team of three, heavy shield, volcano running players spawn 50 FEET AWAY from us in a random room in the corner of the area... spawning basically on top of us, at 15 MINUTES REMAINING,” said one fan last month. “There is no counter, there is no chance of winning, they bypassed our traps as they spawned in the room next to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The ONLY players who should be spawning in five minutes into the raid or later are FREE LOADOUTS. Tarkov got that system down with the player Scavs, and it works very well. The initial spawn should be player loadouts only, then free loadouts come in at 25, 20, and 15 minutes remaining. Does that sound reasonable?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not crazy right? I've spawned literally on top of players who were looting and have gotten extremely unfair free kills because of it. Even reworking the spawning mechanic wont fix it, as you shouldn't have to worry about a random full geared 3-man at 15 minutes remaining after 5 minutes of silence after your team wiped out 12 players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Spawning in a 20 with gear sucks. Most of the PVP is gone, half the loot is already extracted. It sucks for everyone else too, they are low on meds, shields are nearly broken, and now 3-9 completely fresh, geared players have arrived at unexpected locations you just cleared.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-update-targets-infamous-stella-montis-glitch-but-some-say-rats-are-still-in-the-walls">Embark released a new patch for Arc Raiders</a> that stamped out some infamous out-of-bounds exploits – but players said "rats" still live in the walls of Stella Montis.
