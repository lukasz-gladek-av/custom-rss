            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">30 years ago, LEGO made its tentative first step beyond physical toys with the launch of Fun to Build, a Japanese-only game for the largely forgotten Sega Pico console. Three decades later, the mighty LEGO brand's video game ambitions are now a diverse empire all of its own, a set of digital experiences designed to cater to diverse and tastes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for good reason — because as anyone who follows video games knows, the industry's growth has also come alongside massive change, including an ongoing shift in how players access and own games — and a generational difference in why they're so important.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For many, the idea of a LEGO video game is something still synonymous with the prolific output of TT Games, the British development studio behind dozens of licensed titles featuring blockbuster franchises like Star Wars, Batman, and Harry Potter. But the LEGO brand now adorns numerous other experiences from other established creators, such as the recent Annapurna-published LEGO Voyagers, or the Nintendo-like LEGO Party. And then there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-fortnite-odyssey">LEGO Fortnite</a> — but more on that in a moment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to the bosses of LEGO's sprawling gaming portfolio, the company's new SVP of LEGO Game, Fredrik Löving, and its veteran Head of Product, Kari Vinther Nielsen, its clear the company knows the world of video games has already changed — and will continue to do so, as a younger generation raised on the likes of Minecraft, Roblox and Fortnite — LEGO's key audience demographic — seeks connected social experiences on a wider range of platforms. At the same time, however, the brand knows it must still cater to more traditional gamers as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Really understanding today's kids is just always the most important thing," Löving says. "There's been a big shift in gaming and we all know it, we have all seen it. Games mean something different for the generation growing up today than it did for me. When I grew up on my Amiga 500, I was escaping into a world, I was escaping into a screen and I was playing these games with a very set objective. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The primary objective today for kids growing up is to find an activity to do in a social space together with their friends. Secondarily, it's whatever the activity actually is around it." It's an observation that rings especially true following the huge spike in players this summer for games such as Grow a Garden and Steal the Brainrot, experiences that helped smash engagement records on Roblox — a social gaming platform that LEGO has so far steered clear of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The gamers are very fundamentally different," Löving continues. So, where does that leave LEGO?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">We Build LEGO Star Wars Gingerbread AT-AT</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was very lucky to work on LEGO Worlds," Nielsen recalls, a LEGO-y sandbox game that let players build intricate models using digital blocks. While successful enough, it was a product of its time — and despite the LEGO branding, it never seemed to trouble the already-dominant Minecraft, the game it was frequently most compared to. Still, its ambitions were clear. "That for me was a testament of what the physical brick was in a digital space," Nielsen continues. "We had fans creating models, creating worlds, creating stories, and I think that's really the power of digital play where you can create and share in different ways versus what you can in the physical world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After working at LEGO for over a decade, Nielsen said the conversations she had working on the idea for Worlds remain "the same stories and the same things we talk about" today. "We need to mix IPs, we need to figure out what's the digital version of the physical expression. What's the real true game version of that? I don't think the conversations have changed a lot," she continued. "It's more about actually adapting to how kids play today and being open-minded about how you diversify play, how you become inclusive so that you make the right type of play for kids in the world they live in. I think that's where we've moved a lot through the last couple of years actually.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Kids really use video games as a way to stay social and a place where can they meet up with their friends," Nielsen continues, echoing Löving's earlier words. "Of course we want to show up in safe and positive ways, but I think that just speaks to the type of games and the type of play we really need to serve as the LEGO brand. It's not about only having one version that fits for gamers, it's about having a diverse portfolio, for different play needs and different moments."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an approach that LEGO has demonstrated over the past few months, launching the Mario Party-esque LEGO Party to foster cross-generational multiplayer, the same month as indie puzzle platformer LEGO Voyagers. "LEGO Party, that's really where I want to play with my friends or with my family," Nielsen notes. "LEGO Voyagers meanwhile, was a test of my relationship, I'm not going to lie. There was a little bit of 'go away, this is me playing now.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's LEGO Fortnite, which continues to evolve week by week. Its hard to gauge the current level of its overall success versus expectations, especially when comparing it to something like Grow a Garden's viral popularity. But its most substantial offering, LEGO Fortnite Odyssey, remains an evergreen hit and will soon receive its next big update (which fans expect will add characters from the hugely popular Ninjago franchise). Role-playing sim option LEGO Brick Life, meanwhile, enjoys a smaller audience, though is currently hosting a big The Simpsons takeover. And a core attraction for LEGO here remains the ability for players to build and make their own mini-games — something which should only become easier to do and more advanced in potential over time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">LEGO Fortnite</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"My daughter loves the universe, the characters, the stories, the narrative," Nielsen says of LEGO Fortnite's modes. "We're starting to really grow and expand the opportunity for creators to make their favorite LEGO game, to tell their stories through gaming. It's still early days actually in that space," she continues. "It's not that we haven't had digital building or digital creation in our portfolio for the past 30 years, but the world around it has changed, as has the platforms and the pace of creation. When Fred joined, we had this sort of [joke] like, 'You've been used to making a game and it takes five years, I can do what you do and do that in four hours instead.'" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While that may not be true — yet — of something that looks as polished as TT Games' upcoming LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, some of LEGO's earlier output could certainly be recreated in Fortnite today, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-island">LEGO Island</a>, the brand's second video game (and its first real digital hit). "It's just a different reality of making experiences and testing new things and trying them out in a way faster engine with the right partner, with the right creators," Nielsen says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And going back to what I mentioned around really understanding gamers of today," Löving adds. "Co-creation, agency, all the things that you just mentioned. They are becoming very quickly, if not already, table stakes for a lot of experiences out there, especially the big platforms."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that said, LEGO's more traditional gaming experiences are also not fully going away — as next year's arival of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight proves. It was one of this year's biggest and best-received gaming reveals, and was recently shown to a hugely positive reception during Gamescom 2025. For LEGO, experiences like it is set to provide also remain a cruical part of its brand offering. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I passed down Star Wars to my son through a Lego game, Skywalker saga," Löving said. "That is a lot for a dad, to actually have that experience together with your son — not just playing together but passing down a fandom, enabled through the fact that it's a LEGO game. Even before I joined the company, I was just inspired to see, 'how do we even dial that up? How can we do that and really make it intergenerational play?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our brand stands for a lot of things and I think in some moments you're really diving in and you're immersing yourself in like a six-hour session," Nielsen affirms. "I play legacy board games, I know it's going to take a long time. I'm invested, and it's even better if I can actually play along or couch co-op with some of my friends or family members. That's fantastic and I think that's what TT Games does so well."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Cosmetics</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As LEGO enters its fourth decade in the digital space, the company clearly has ambitions that range beyond simple, static plastic. Ever since it dipped its toe into the world of simple robotics with MindStorms, through to its much more recently interactivitiy melded into LEGO Super Mario bricks, its clear the company is keen to experiment with what's possible with play. LEGO Dimensions, the brand's experiment in the toys-to-life category, was another example of that — and with its focus on IP mashups and adventure, could be seen as a precursor to LEGO Fortnite today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the day, though, Nielsen says it's all about finding the right kind of play for the right audience. "Sometimes there's a time for a game and then you can almost take that game and bring it into the now — or to the future with different flavors and twists," she says. "It's no different than what is our LEGO version of Darth Vader or Batman. I think there's something generational to it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Sylux will save you some time.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a long wait, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is finally coming to Switch 1 and Switch 2 on December 4. Nintendo recently revealed exactly what each of its Metroid Prime amiibo figures will allow you to do in the game — ranging from customizing Samus’s new ride to letting you unlock a secret movie without having to 100% the in-game collectables.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is releasing three new amiibo figures for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond — namely Samus Aran herself, Samus riding the Vi-O-La motorbike, and bounty hunter antagonist Sylux. According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/hardware/amiibo/game/bgw5a_2/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announcement</u></a> on Nintendo’s official Japanese website, the three Metroid Prime 4 amiibos will let you do different things with the game — with Sylux’s greatly lowering the threshold for what you need to do to unlock a secret movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Basically, the Sylux amiibo will allow players to view a special movie straight after beating the game’s main story. The movie will apparently be an edited-together cutscene of fragmented clips featuring the bounty hunter that play during your journey through Metroid Prime 4: Beyond’s story. It seems that watching the special movie will likely help players further understand Sylux’s motivations. Sylux has always been a bit of a mysterious antagonist and hopefully Metroid Prime 4 will shed more light on Sylux’s backstory and his apparent hatred of the Galactic Federation and Samus. As an added bonus, Sylux will say a random line of his dialogue each time you touch his amiibo to your Switch console.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t fancy forking out the money for the Sylux amiibo ($29.99) or would much rather put in the hard work yourself, then the special movie can also be unlocked by achieving a 100% scan rate and finding every single item in the game (so get ready to have guides and checklists on hand).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Metroid Prime 4 Samus and Vi-O-La amiibo features the tough protagonist astride her brand-new, high-tech motorbike, Vi-O-La. Making its debut in Metroid Prime 4, Vi-O-La will allow Samus to speedily travel around the vast planet of Viewros. Therefore it comes as no surprise that the amiibo gives you several Vi-O-La related benefits. The Samus and Vi-O-La amiibo lets you quickly replenish your bike’s boost energy once per day, as well as allowing you to change the motorbike’s color. Touching the amiibo will tell you the distance you have travelled on the Vi-O-La.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Metroid Prime 4 Samus amiibo lets you do a couple of things. Once a day, you can activate a handy shield that will not only restore Samus’s life but also blocks up to 99 damage. As an added bonus, you can use the Samus amiibo to change the music when riding the Vi-O-La across Sol Valley, Viewros’ vast desert. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/28/81ygnbuotrl-ac-sl1500-1764345325988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo Sylux for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you happen to have any older Metroid-related amiibo lying around, you can also use these with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Although not as exciting as Sylux’s movie unlock, the following Super Smash Bros. amiibo will play a random sound from Metroid Prime 4 when touched: Samus, Zero Suit Samus, Dark Samus, and Ridley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Metroid Prime got a remake in 2023, Metroid Prime 4 is the first new numbered entry in the Prime series of Metroid FPS’s since Metroid Prime 3: Corruption on the Wii back in 2016. Players will step into the boots of Samus Aran — this time responding to a distress call from the Galactic Federation, which will see her explore the mysterious and unknown planet of Viewros.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt’s PC game storefront GOG is getting behind indie game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/horses">Horses</a> after Valve banned it from Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses is an indie first-person horror game with live-action sequences set in a horse farm. Over the course of 14 days, it "welcomes you into encounters that test your obedience, complicity, and restraint." The player experiences "the farm's unspeakable horrors through daily unique interactions," as they must "withstand 14 days of spiraling dread as the reality of the farm unfolds."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As IGN reported this week, Horses is currently preparing to launch on December 2 on the Epic Games Store, GOG, Itch.io, and the Humble Store, but not on Steam because Valve has banned the game from release on its platform.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">IGN’s original report for the details of the situation</a>, which Italian developer Santa Ragione (Saturnalia, Wheels of Aurelia, MirrorMoon EP) has said leaves it with a “high risk” of closure, such is the PC gaming market dominance enjoyed by Steam. Valve has released a statement of its own, confirming its decision not to release Horses on Steam is "final.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We reviewed the game back in 2023,” Valve said. “At that time, the developer indicated with their release date in Steamworks that they planned to release a few months later. Based on content in the store page, we told the developer we would need to review the build itself. This happens sometimes if content on the store page causes concern that the game itself might not fall within our guidelines. After our team played through the build and reviewed the content, we gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with our onboarding rules and guidelines. A short while later the developer asked us to reconsider the review, and our internal content review team discussed that extensively and communicated to the developer our final decision that we were not going to ship the game on Steam."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, GOG has released a statement saying it is “proud” to give Horses a home on its platform, pushing pre-orders live, showcasing the game on its homepage, and alerting press and its followers across social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re proud to give Horses a home on GOG, giving players another way to enjoy the game,” GOG said. “We’ve always believed that players should be able to choose the experiences that speak to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To support the Santa Ragione studio in this difficult time, we’ve decided to launch pre-orders on Horses today — grab yours and celebrate their creativity!”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve still hasn’t explained why it refused to reconsider its position on Horses even after the developer tweaked the game. Speaking to IGN, Pietro Righi Riva of Santa Ragione urged game developers to stand up together to demand transparency from Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know developers are understandably scared of voicing their complaints about Steam, but I hope we can collectively ask for better conditions to make our work more viable and more creatively free," he said. "The current landscape is one where very few actors control the distribution of almost all games that are produced, and that should mean they are responsible not just for the commercial sustainability of the industry, but also for the growth of games as an artistic medium."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve watched the latest episode of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/south-park">South Park</a>, you might have noticed a surprise appearance from one of the hottest video games on earth: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios’ extraction shooter is one of the most-played video games on PC and console right now, with an impressive 4 million copies sold so far. At one point, it hit over 700,000 concurrent players across all platforms — an impressive achievement indeed for a new IP at a time when so many refuse to be prized away from established live-service behemoths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, among Arc Raiders’ many fans is someone behind the making of South Park. In the latest Season 28 episode broadcast this week, called "Turkey Trot,” Cartman finds Tolkien Black playing Arc Raiders on Xbox. The game appears in multiple scenes, one of which shows gameplay footage on a TV.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/28/sp-main-1764341295124.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Arc Raiders makes a surprise appearance in the latest episode of South Par.

On Monday South Park inquired if a character could play ARC Raiders in an upcoming episode, on Tuesday we provided footage, and on Wednesday we were in S28’s “Turkey Trot” episode. Like Tolkien, I guess a lot of us just can’t put down ARC Raiders. Happy Thanksgiving! 🦃🍁</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s… really close to the wire! But it should come as no surprise to South Park fans who know a little about how its creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, put the show together.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, Parker and Stone create each episode week-by-week, which makes for a chaotic production but topical shows. But they switched to a biweekly schedule for Season 27, with the elongated production time allowing the pair more room to work on each episode. Season 27 had enjoyed big ratings and sparked much debate, but it also suffered an erratic release schedule. The first two episodes arrived on the standard weekly schedule, but then the series switched to a biweekly schedule before the delayed fifth episode, which ended up going down as the series finale, aired three weeks later on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Comedy Central had delayed the Season 27 ender just hours before it was due to air, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-one-pulled-the-episode-no-one-censored-us-and-you-know-wed-say-so-if-true-south-park-co-creator-matt-stone-insists-this-weeks-delayed-episode-is-gonna-be-great"><u>with Parker and Stone insisting the blame lay at their door</u></a>. “Apparently when you do everything at the last minute sometimes you don’t get it done,” the pair told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/south-park-delays-episode-1236522027/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a>. “This one’s on us. We didn’t get it done in time. Thanks to Comedy Central and South Park fans for being so understanding. Tune in next week!” As far as we at IGN are aware, Parker and Stone have missed the scheduled release of South Park just once before, due to a power outage, but never for not getting an episode done in time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">South Park's Most Topical Episodes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-park-creators-talk-season-27-premiere-after-skewering-trump-in-hotly-anticipated-comic-con-panel-sdcc-2025"><u>during their San Diego Comic-Con 2025 panel</u></a>, which took place the day after the Season 27 opener aired, Parker said the pair were unsure what the next episode would be, revealing the decision was “super stressful.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, South Park has a history of featuring video games, perhaps most famously World of Warcraft. Indeed, Blizzard's MMORPG was the focus of the episode, Make Love, Not Warcraft, at a time when it was one of the hottest video games on earth. Other games featured on the show include Valve's Counter-Strike, Rock Band, and Call of Duty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only one episode of South Park Season 28 remains, to be broadcast on December 10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.
