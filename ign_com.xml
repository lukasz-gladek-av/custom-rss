            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve gone hands-on with Nioh 3 on three separate occasions at this point: The first was with the limited-time demo which was all about me just getting my bearings back and remembering how to play Nioh after five or so years away. The second was a preview event that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-looks-set-to-level-up-from-nioh-1-and-2-ign-first">part of our IGN First coverage</a>, where I was able to dig deeper into the new Ninja Mode and talk about some of the evolutions made in the Nioh formula. For this third, and presumably final time ahead of release, I told myself, “I’m just gonna have fun with it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, when my time began, I adjusted my build to my liking, asked the Team Ninja Community Lead – who appropriately goes by “Master,” – to teach me all of the sick tech that he knew, and I was off to the races to go up against the biggest challenge I’d faced thus far pre-release: A Crucible. It’s a new type of level that features extra tough enemies that chunk bits of your max life every time they hit you until you hit them back. Suffice it to say, if my goal was to have fun, well then, mission accomplished.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo didn’t begin in the Crucible, so I was able to work my way up to meet its challenge by first making my way through a warped Red Light District that had seemingly been transformed and twisted with evil Yokai power. Team Ninja was very generous with our builds, giving me a healthy collection of high-level gear with any weapon type of my choosing. Wanting to try something new, I decided on going with the Caestus as my main Samurai weapon and the single katana for my Ninja loadout.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s just something so incredibly cathartic about draining an enemy’s stamina, and then when you go in for the execution it's just aggressive blunt force trauma on a demon’s face with a level of bloodsplatter that could rival a Mortal Kombat brutality.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I immediately fell in love with the caestus. There’s just something so incredibly cathartic about draining an enemy’s stamina, and then when you go in for the execution it's just aggressive blunt force trauma on a demon’s face with a level of bloodsplatter that could rival a Mortal Kombat brutality. Not only that, but I also had a skill that allowed me to sit there and channel all of my stamina into a single Falcon Punch-like strike that would just obliterate whatever enemy happened to be standing in front of me. The bone-crunching sound effects and the usual Team Ninja animation smoothness only enhanced the satisfaction.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other side of the coin was the single katana in Ninja Mode, and if you’re a Ninja Gaiden fan, this is probably going to be the one you’re going to want to check out. The big star of the weapon in my eyes was a move called the Swallow Slash, and if you <em>are</em> a big Ninja Gaiden fan, you probably already know what that’s going to look like. It’s a super fast dashing attack that goes through enemies, and can even be upgraded to allow you to quickly move back and forth multiple times through the same enemy, just like Ryu’s Flying Swallow. It’s a bit riskier in a game with limited stamina and treacherous terrain that could lead to instant death if one were to Swallow Slash themselves off a cliff, but it is nonetheless an incredibly satisfying technique and a great way to start off a fight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Red Light District itself was classic Nioh level design: Lots of barred-off paths that funnel you through largely linear design, with a handful of optional forks that lead to some extra loot, with a healthy dose of traps and enemy ambushes lying around every corner. Side note: Team Ninja President Fumihiko Yasuda sat down to watch me play for a bit and got a kick out of how slowly and carefully I entered each room, and even more so when even despite all of my caution, I’d still fall for one of the many traps laid throughout the level. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The boss of the level was Takasugi Shinsaku, a Samurai armed with a Guardian Spirit, a gun, and a sword – and he made liberal use of all three. Like most human-sized Nioh 3 boss fights, it was a tense and fast-paced battle that finds that sweet spot of being just predictable enough to be able to identify patterns, with enough variation in those patterns to make the act of identifying them satisfyingly challenging. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Entering the Crucible takes you to a hellish landscape where Yokai are all buffed to deal increased damage.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After defeating Shinsaku, the next area was one of the new open-field levels that I talked about in my last preview. This time, though, we were allowed to challenge the Crucible, which is basically the ultimate challenge of each open field in Nioh 3. Entering the Crucible takes you to a hellish landscape where Yokai are all buffed to deal increased damage. In addition to that, if damage is taken while inside a Crucible, the player will be inflicted with Life Corrosion, which will temporarily reduce their max health until they’re able to deal damage or defeat enemies. Dying is another way to remove the effects of Life Corrosion, but obviously, not ideal. On the plus side, while inside a Crucible, you’ll be able to use your Living Artifact transformation more frequently, since the Amrita Gauge fills faster. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The main impression of the Crucible that I got to play through was basically that it was like another standard linear Nioh level, only meaner. Hugely damaging spike traps were everywhere, lightning fast spinning blade demons made running across certain paths feel like trying to weave through traffic on a busy street, and powerful foes waited in ambush in precarious areas where one errant dodge could lead to you falling to your death. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like every other time I’ve gotten to play Nioh 3, after my time was up, I was left wanting more. Nioh 3 is shaping up to be my favorite of the series to date, not only through its substantial improvements to combat thanks to the split of Samurai and Ninja Modes, but also with the massive addition of the open-field levels – each of which will include its own separate Crucible. It’s a challenge I eagerly anticipate taking on with my own personal build and progression, and one that I won’t have to wait terribly long for, as Nioh 3 releases on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on February 6, 2026.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is rushing to remove user-made designs shared within <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> that feature fan-favorite character Chef Kawasaki dressed in a micro bikini.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders allows players to create and customize their own in-game rides using basic shapes and stickers, something that has quickly led to all manner of user creativity — and several designs that feature the beloved chef in beach attire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chef Kawasaki has been a fan-favorite among the Kirby community for years, and there's a running joke that, underneath his apron, Chef Kawasaki is otherwise naked. Alternatively, fans have suggested, the character could just about be hiding a micro bikini underneath the straps of his cooking attire — something now depicted in mounds of fanart that we will not embed on this website.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">エアライダーのオレマシン市場にあるコックカワサキのマイクロビキニ柄、すぐ消されるだろうって皆思ってるからか値上がりも早くておもろい 初日の朝にしては高いだろ <a href="https://t.co/DjMbKGcO91" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/DjMbKGcO91</a></p>— モリソバ (@Sobatake397) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sobatake397/status/1991283379707556153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Is Nintendo a fan of all this? Seemingly not. As if to make its position clear, Nintendo has now removed several Chef Kawasaki micro bikini designs from Kirby Air Riders, as they began topping the game's list of most popular fan-made rides. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chef-kawasaki-micro-bikini-ride-deleted-from-kirby-air-riders-machine-market-immediately-replaced-by-succubus-chef-kawasaki/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a> reports that two widely-downloaded Chef Kawasaki micro bikini riders have already been made unavailable by Nintendo, while a third — with a slightly larger bikini and succubus wings — rises in popularity and looks set to test Nintendo's limits for what it will allow.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time that Nintendo has acted to shut down the spread of Chef Kawasaki bikini artwork. In 2022, it swiftly stopped the proliferation of a fanmade card game, Chef Kawasaki’s Microbikini Karuta, which featured numerous fan-drawn images of an eyebrow-raising nature. (The game's creators had also begun selling the game for profit — another big Nintendo no-no.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest game from Super Smash Bros. series boss Masahiro Sakurai, Kirby Air Riders launched this week exclusively for Switch 2. A spin-off of the Kirby series where players race around circuit-based tracks on glider-like machines, it is a long-awaited sequel to 2003's Kirby Air Ride on GameCube. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Kirby Air Riders' unconventional controls can get in its own way sometimes, but they don't stop it from being a fun, frantic action racing game with an almost unreal amount of stuff to do," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review">Kirby Air Riders review</a>, awarding the game 8/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Publisher says Tencent deal closure still "imminent."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has celebrated a fresh set of financial results that it says has been driven by a "strong performance" for its Assassin's Creed franchise. But while there's an update on sales figures for 2023's Mirage, there's no new figure for how this year's Shadows has sold. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The French publisher's latest earnings report, published this morning, covers the company's performance over the first half of the current year: April through September. Last week, Ubisoft delayed the publication of these results at the last minute, prompting speculation that something had gone wrong with the company's big Tencent deal — though there's no suggestion of that today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has framed the results in a positive light, with net bookings for the past quarter "above expectations" and up 39% year-on-year. "The outperformance was driven by stronger-than-expected partnerships," Ubisoft noted, "and was supported by a robust back-catalog, both highlighting the strength of the Group's brands."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One back catalogue game seemingly doing very well is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, the series' return to a smaller, city-based adventure that launched a couple of years ago. Today, Ubisoft announced a new 10 million sales milestone for the title, and said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-mirages-saudi-backed-valley-of-memory-expansion-looks-a-generous-free-side-quest-though-not-one-many-fans-would-have-asked-for">its recent Saudi Arabia-funded free update</a> had received "very positive" feedback from fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But on the sales performance of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, the franchise's blockbuster feudal Japan entry launched in March, Ubisoft was less clear. Without providing a new sales total, Ubisoft simply said the game had "benefited" from the launch of its New Game+ mode and recent Claws of Awaji expansion, which seems obvious. The company then pointed to the game's upcoming Switch 2 launch as an oppurtunity for it to "reach a broader audience." Back in July, Ubisoft said Shadows had surpassed 5 million players, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-suffers-mixed-results-as-assassins-creed-shadows-hits-5-million-players-while-rainbow-six-siege-x-struggles">that its performance had been in line with expectations</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of Assassin's Creed, Ubisoft noted that Rainbow Six Siege's cheating issues were continuing to temporarily impact "activity and player spending versus expectations," following the game's previous move to an essentially free-to-play model.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft still expects to finalize its $1.16 billion deal with Chinese conglomerate Tencent in the near future, company boss Yves Guillemot said, noting that "all conditions precedent have been satisfied." The transaction will secure funding for Vantage Studios, Ubisoft's new self-contained subsidiary in charge of its biggest brands, including Assassin's Creed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Guillemot revealed that more of these companies, termed Creative Houses, will be detailed in January — a point at which the Tencent deal should presumably be sorted. After this, the future shape of the company should become clear, following years of internal turmoil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These Creative Houses will be autonomous, efficient, focused and accountable business units, each with its own leadership, creative vision and strategic roadmap," Guillemot concluded. "This Group-wide transformation reflects our ambition to renew how we create and operate in order to deliver great games for our players and lasting value for our partners and shareholders."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
