This is because Final Fantasy Remake itself only adapted the opening few hours of the original game, up to the point where the party leaves Midgar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth expanded the scope significantly, however, introducing the open world and thus covering myriad locations such as Costa del Sol, the Golden Saucer, and many more, including some new ones.</p><div id="best-mainline-final-fantasy-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3><h3>Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It brought the overall story up to the end of Disc 1 of the original Final Fantasy 7, which closes in both games with what's arguably the most iconic moment in video game history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part 3 will pick up immediately after this, though very little is known about it so far. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-in-development">Development began in June 2022</a> but Square Enix hasn't said when it will end, only vaguely noting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027">it hopes to release Part 3 by 2027</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Something it has said, however, is that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-we-will-not-cheat-with-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-airship">it "will not cheat" when it comes to the Highwind airship</a>. This allowed the party to quickly move around the map in the original game but, now in the world of fast travel, many fans wondered how the iconic ship could be implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will not cheat with the airship system [in Part 3] but take the challenge head on so it can freely fly all over the game map," Hamaguchi said last November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

To my amazement was this spectral horse with no name.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have played thousands of hours of the original Oblivion — and have already sunken over a hundred hours into the Remaster — yet this is the first I have ever seen this horse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t know if it’s something new that’s been added, or if I’ve just missed out on it before and never knew.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TaricIsNotASupport then called on the community to help them work out what had happened here, which sparked something of a ghost hunt online, with players searching through the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages website</a> for any word of a spectral mount in the original Oblivion. So far, nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could it be a mod? TaricIsNotASupport followed up their post to say they are playing on PlayStation 5, where mods are unavailable. TaricIsNotASupport also posted a clip of their character riding the horse. Despite its non-corporeal form, it appears this horse is very much present and correct, and works how any other horse would in Oblivion. “He fast travels and even gets stabled!” TaricIsNotASupport said. “By all accounts it’s now my steed!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are suggesting this ghost horse is the result of a glitch, perhaps caused by a spell gone horribly wrong. Bethesda games are known for their bugs (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-camera-breaks-the-longer-you-play-and-eventually-crashes-when-loading-a-save-call-for-emergency-patch">in fact one is making the camera break the longer you play the game</a>), and maybe this ghost horse is another to add to the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Very weird, the wiki says there's only 2 unique horses, Shadowmere and unicorns,” ClaymoreBeatz commented. “And there's no horse mods that I can see that do this so I highly doubt your [sic] lying about not being on PC, this is probably some sort of glitch that the new Remastered has or glitched magical effect. Armored horses names change to Armored horse I think so maybe it's an Armored horse that got hit by a spell and now its name and spell effect is glitched.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are wondering whether the developers at Bethesda and Virtuos might have added this ghost horse to the game as a spooky secret for players to discover in Oblivion Remastered. This seems less likely, although it is a fun thought because if it's true, then what other secrets might be hidden within the ramaster?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of players who want to work out how to replicate the steed so they can have a ghost horse for themselves.

TaricIsNotASupport has pledged to continue their adventure with Spookmane by their side. Perhaps this is a one-off, perhaps it’s a secret, perhaps it’s a bug. Either way, Spookmane has captured the attention — and maybe even a few hearts — of the Oblivion community and its fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This creature might be my favourite new friend I’ve made,” TaricIsNotASupport said. “Spookmane, you’re glorious and I love you.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology.
