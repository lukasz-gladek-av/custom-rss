They also suggest Ubisoft broke California's state law around gift cards, which are not allowed to expire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gamers also provided images that depict the activation code for the racer clearly shows that it does not expire until 2099, which they believe implies "that [The Crew] would remain playable during this time and long thereafter."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ubisoft does not agree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Plaintiffs allege that they purchased physical copies of The Crew under the belief that they were obtaining unfettered access to the game in perpetuity. Plaintiffs also take issue with the fact that Ubisoft did not offer to create an 'offline, single-player option of the Game, otherwise known as a 'patch' when it shut down The Crew’s servers in March 2024," Ubisoft's lawyers wrote. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The [essence] of the plaintiffs’ complaint is that Ubisoft allegedly misled purchasers of its video game The Crew into believing they were purchasing unfettered ownership rights in the game, rather than a limited license to access the game. But the reality is that consumers received the benefit of their bargain and were explicitly notified, at the time of purchase, that they were purchasing a license."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The response further adds that the Xbox and PlayStation packaging contain a "clear and conspicuous notice — in all capital letters — that Ubisoft may cancel access to one or more specific online features upon a 30-day prior notice."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has now filed a motion to dismiss the case. If that fails and the lawsuit does proceed, the two plaintiffs have demanded a jury trial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Storefronts including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-now-warns-customers-theyre-buying-a-license-not-a-game-before-they-continue-to-payment">Steam now include an up-front warning to customers that they’re buying a license, not a game</a>.
