            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop’s The Big Summer Warhammer Preview Show 2025 offered a tantalising look at the tabletop wargaming company's upcoming slate, and we’ve rounded up everything revealed to help you catch up in case you missed the livestream.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were announcements for Warhammer 40,000, Warhammer Age of Sigmar, Kill Team, Warhammer: The Horus Heresy, Legions Imperialis, Warhammer Underworlds, and even a surprise Space Marine 2 reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This live report is now concluded.</em></p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Leagues of Votann</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Proceedings kicked of with a reveal for The Leagues of Votann (Warhammer 40,000's take on space dwarves). It's a huge plastic expansion, the biggest since the faction launched, that includes new troops, new artillery, new heroes and new abominable intelligence. There's a new Combat Patrol (an army starter pack or a set to bulk out an existing force) for The Leagues of Votann, and check out Buri Aegnirssen, a specialist Tyranid hunter, below. Yes, that's a Tyranid Prime on top of his head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Supporting the release is a new Leagues of Votann Codex, packed with lore and new rules.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer: The Old World</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up was a reveal for Warhammer: The Old World. Brand new units are coming to the Tomb Kings of Khemri. There are two new Arcane Journals, the first dubbed The War of Settra's Fury, which was described as "a really cool way of looking at the lore of The Old World," the second called Dawn of the Storm Dragon.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-192127-1752862895173.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to Age of Sigmar, which celebrates its 10-year anniversary, there are two factions from the Grand Alliance of Death on their way with new units, new battletomes and new army rules.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have the Flesh-Eater Courts Death Battletome, alongside a new mini to support: High Falconer Felgryn. Also coming to the Flesh-Eater army is the Charnel Watch. And there's the Death Battletome for the Nighthaunt, packed with lore and "some significant defensive buffs." Check out the wonderfully-named Lord Vitriolic, below:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-193107-1752863496722.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Helsmiths of Hashut</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's a big one: the Chaos Dwarfs faction returns for Age of Sigmar as the Helsmiths of Hashut. This new faction includes the Infernal Cohort with Hashutite Spears, the War Despot, the Dominator Engine, and the Tormentor Bombard war machine. As you'd expect, the set includes a new Battletome.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer: Underworlds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop then revealed the Spitewood Expansion set for Warhammer: Underworlds. Designed as an expansion to the Embergard boxed set, Spitewood contains two brand new warbands, two new Rivals decks, a new double-sided board, and a token board that includes new feature tokens representing deposits of Aqua Ghyranis.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-195458-1752864905965.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Legions Imperialis</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaving Age of Sigmar behind, Games Workshop revealed new tanks for the Horus Heresy game, Legions Imperialis, including the Typhon Heavy Siege Tank Squadron, the Cerberus Heavy Tank Destroyer, and the Mastadon Assault Transport, the latter of which was described as the "30,000 equivalent of a siege tower."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-200120-1752865299831.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Also coming to the 30,000 setting is the MKII Assault Squad and the Journal Tactica: The Forges of Saturn.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-200506-1752865516174.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Black Library</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Scouring is confirmed! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/big-summer-warhammer-preview-adds-black-library-logo-and-now-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-are-hoping-games-workshop-is-finally-ready-to-move-the-narrative-forward">As fans had speculated</a>, The Scouring period of Warhammer 40,000's long history is getting its own novel series, kicking off with Ashes of the Imperium by Chris Wraight. This multi-book, multi-author series is set to reveal what happens to the Imperium and the Traitor Legions after the end of The Horus Heresy. Ashes of the Imperium will be released later in the year.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-200852-1752865809523.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">40K is getting five new Space Marine characters: Vulkan He’stan (Salamanders); Darnath Lysander (Imperial Fists); Aethon Shaan (Raven Guard); Caanok Var (Iron Hands); and Suboden Khan (White Scars). It's worth noting Aethon Shaan is the new Chapter Master of the Raven Guard, replacing Kayvaan Shrike, who's decided to step back from the top job and operate from the shadows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a series of Combat Patrols coming to accompany the release of the characters for the Imperial Fists, White Scars, Iron Hands, Raven Guard, and Salamanders.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-201450-1752866098139.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop announced the first ever officially licensed, wearable Space Marine helmet.

Tomb World sees Kill Team "return to the Close Quarters gameplay pioneered in Kill Team: Into the Dark, this time with an all-new Necron-themed killzone complete with shimmering portals, teleportation pads, and regenerating walls."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Tomb World Dossier book contains background lore for the two kill teams and the Tomb World of Somneft they’re fighting over, "setting up a decisive showdown between Kill Team Vaskovian and Amhetra’s Cryptoretinue."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's it!
