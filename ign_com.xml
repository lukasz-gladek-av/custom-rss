A newly spotted disclaimer has fans worrying some games, or at least one game, won't support Nintendo's cloud save functionality as they'd hope.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the last day or so, users have been noticing that Nintendo's pages for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s Switch 2 edition carries the following disclaimer: "Please note: this software does not support the Nintendo Switch Online paid membership’s Save Data Cloud backup feature."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2-editions-of-the-legend-of-zelda-botw-totk-do-not-support-cloud-saves-saves-can-still-be-transferred-however.1166340/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>, the page for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Switch 2 Edition</a> also apparently carried this disclaimer at one point, as did <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Party-Jamboree-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Jamboree-TV-2785806.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though it's since disappeared from those pages, the Tears of the Kingdom still has the disclaimer as of this writing. The Japanese page though, per <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-edition-zelda-games-wont-support-cloud-saves-to-backup-your-data" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> via machine translation, does not carry the same disclaimer; only the US and EU pages seem to be showing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to Nintendo for clarification on the matter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this holds true, this could create some confusing scenarios for players. Nintendo's cloud save option for NSO members is handy, for one. It makes carrying games across systems, or juggling storage space for games without losing your saved progress, a little less stres-inducing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Actually importing a save file from the original Switch to the Switch 2 Edition of Tears of the Kingdom does seem to still work. The Nintendo page noted an additional save slot for the Switch 2 Edition, where one can start a brand-new journey or "continue a previous one with your existing save data." Nintendo does note that save data created in the second save data slot cannot be trasnferred to the Nintendo Switch 1 version of Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a confusing situation that can possibly lead to some stress, as players would likely not want to lose a save file they've dumped many, many hours into when upgrading versions. Hopefully, this gets cleared up soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 Edition does have a few reasons for prospective Switch 2 owners to upgrade, including the Zelda Notes app, which comes packed with helpful guiding content, lore, and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-zelda-ports-will-let-players-repair-equipment-with-the-zelda-notes-app-if-theyre-lucky">some potential equipment repair options</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-charizard-premium-collection-back-in-stock-amazon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This box gives you ten chances to pull something unforgettable.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s be real: I don’t need another <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-tcg-deals">Pokémon card bundle</a>. But the moment I saw the Charizard ex Super Premium Collection on sale, something in my brain short-circuited. My body? Fully ready for yet <em>another</em> unnecessary purchase. And at <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXRm6?object_uuid=d18afbef-ba9c-4fc0-b09c-5dbe79fed3de&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">under $50, this box is stacked</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re getting a foil Charizard ex promo, plus matching Charmander and Charmeleon to complete the fiery trio. There’s even a Charizard display figure (because, of course, there is), and—get this—ten booster packs. Not five. Not six. Ten. That’s ten chances to pull something ridiculous. </p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218886"><div id="218886" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG Charizard ex Super Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The set includes packs from Twilight Masquerade, Stellar Crown, Paradox Rift, Temporal Forces, and Obsidian Flames—some of the most exciting recent drops in the TCG lineup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help you further in your quest for great pulls, here are some of my favorite chase cards from these Pokémon TCG sets. Or, if you're done with chasing singles in boosters and fancy just picking up a couple of single cards instead of splashing out on this deal, I've included some handy offers from TCG Player to make sure you're getting the best price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Twilight Masquerade Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I want Perrin and Hisuian Growlithe purely for the art. GIDORA nailed the emotional bond between a Trainer and her Pokémon, and the way the two illustrations pair up makes pulling just one feel like an incomplete thought. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other end of the spectrum, Dragapult ex is is terrifyingly efficient and might be the best Pokémon ex in the set. Carmine is the real money card here though, continuing the trend of playable, stylish Trainer cards dominating the top of the market. Throw in cozy Eevee vibes and a surprisingly playable Ursaluna, and you’ve got a set with range.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Stellar Crown Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Crown is what happens when nostalgia and artistry shake hands. Squirtle and Bulbasaur show off their bird-watching hobbies in some of the most charming cards I’ve seen in years. Then there’s Terapagos ex, which looks like it belongs in a jewelry store, not a binder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hydrapple and Dachsbun are slightly more niche but still desirable thanks to lush illustrations and just enough playability to make you think twice before selling. I think this set knows what it's doing: hook you with Kanto starters, then keep you around with glittering, high-rarity flex pulls.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Paradox Rift Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Paradox Rift wants to make a statement. Roaring Moon ex is the best pull here, both in power and price, and Groudon isn’t far behind with volcanic drama cranked to eleven. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Valiant and Altaria offer very different flavors of future aesthetic, and somehow they both work. Iron Hands ex might not be pretty, but it’s still a beast in competitive decks. If you're after a set that brings both gorgeous artwork and raw pressure, this is the one to crack.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Temporal Forces Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Temporal Forces is part prehistoric brawl, part retro sci-fi. Raging Bolt ex leads the pack with one of the strongest attacks in Standard, and Iron Crown ex isn’t far behind, fueling Future decks with wild efficiency. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walking Wake ex wins big on artwork alone, thanks to Suicune’s eternal popularity, and Gouging Fire holds its own with surprise jungle-dino energy. Even Iron Leaves ex has sneaky-good utility. I want every single one of these cards for a different reason, which is exactly how a good set should work.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Obsidian Flames Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex is the undisputed king here, with two of the most sought-after variants in the entire block. The Special Illustration Rare version is especially gorgeous, all fire and fury, while the gold Hyper Rare keeps things flashy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninetales and Cleffa bring artistic value, and I think Cleffa might be the most unexpectedly stunning card in the set. Pidgeot ex also deserves a shout for balancing playability with an ultra-stylized take on a Gen I classic. This is one of those sets where almost every big pull earns its spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
