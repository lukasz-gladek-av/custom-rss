            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It'll only cost you some runes.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has been out for about a month at this point, but players are still uncovering little interactions sprinkled throughout the game. One, apparently, lets you circumvent the downsides of dealing with a demonic merchant, for the low, low price of many, many runes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've advanced far enough into Elden Ring Nightreign, you're probably familiar with Libra, the demonic Nightlord who loves to offer a bargain. These offers come with downsides, that players have found are sometimes worth tanking and sometimes not. Libra is an end-of-run Nightlord, but can also appear through a random world event in other expeditions against other Nightlords.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like other events, a purple fog will envelope the area and you'll get a notification, telling you a demon has cursed you. A chunk of your maximum health will also be blocked off, in the upper-left corner. Normally, to clear this, you'll need to head to the spot where the merchant has spawned and pay him, either 15,000 or 35,000 runes depending on the day, to lift the curse.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the curse is lifted, you also get a buff. But as one reddit user has pointed out, paying off the Libra event lets you get a free buff if you interact with him again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For 15k/35k runes, you can get any of the available merchant buffs by talking to Libra again without any of the downsides," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1llkgnd/psa_paying_off_the_libra_raid_lets_you_buy_a_free/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they wrote</a>. "Eventual greatness activates instantly, the flask doesn't remove levels when you drink it. Feel free to kill the demon on day 2 if you're prepared enough, but ONLY AFTER you pay off the curse and get the free buff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Normally, these buffs offer a trade-off. YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0g9dW41wP8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garden of Eyes</a> catalogued all the possible buffs and side-effects, which range from extra flasks to stat boosts, at the price of some immediate cost to your person. Maybe a little less maximum health, or a timed stat debuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this particular event, though, it looks like you can get the possible pay-off without the recursive consequences, making the Faustian bargain just a bargain. Sure, it costs either 15,000 or 35,000 runes depending on the day. But some of those buffs? They might be worth the cost, and if you're already paying to fix your health bar, why not get a little more?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's really, <em>really </em>important to note that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1llkgnd/comment/n01t5ev/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this only applies to the specific instance</a> where Libra spawns and curses your squad. If you find Libra hanging out somewhere in the world, <em>sans </em>curse, you won't be able to spend the 15k or 35k runes, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1llkgnd/comment/n01pg32/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thus won't get the follow-up freebie</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, you won't be able to pull this off if you attack and fight the merchant, obviously. So maybe hope that your teammates are on the same page as you, when it comes to dealing with the devil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's a fairly specific buff, any advantage helps when facing down some of the more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-latest-patch-shadowdropped-its-first-enhanced-boss">terrifying Nightlords</a> of Elden Ring Nightreign.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"You could expect that we'll be applying some of our learnings from World of Assassination to Bond."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak reckons the key to his studio's survival in an increasingly volatile games industry is down the pan… literally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a candid interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/how-hitman-absolutions-wasteful-toilets" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Game Business</u></a>, Abrak confirmed IO's upcoming Bond game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light"><u>007 First Light</u></a>, will benefit from Hitman's model of keeping fans engaged while keeping development costs sustainable, as the studio acquired "tons of experience now from World of Assassination, and tons of experience on how to extend a single-player experience by giving desirable free content to players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was the executive producer on [2012’s] Hitman Absolution, and I swore never to do more new toilets," he explained. "We were just doing new everything. It was just a throwaway. When we were doing the initial foundation on Hitman 2016, we built it in a way where we would do smart reuse.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Without being too precise, Hitman 2016… let's say it was a $100 million game. Hitman 2 was maybe $60 million. Hitman 3 was $20 million. And Hitman 3 was the highest Metacritic. It was 85, 84, and 87 Metacritic," he added. "And it had very unique new locations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Intimating that the studio learned the hard way that Hitman Absolution was a "wasteful production," Abrak now says it "completely changed [the IO team's] thinking."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Building this foundation, the brick system as we call it, where we can make an experience, like [new Hitman mission featuring Mads Mikkelsen] very quickly and efficiently," he added. "This was a really [important] part of us creating sustainable AAA production. I'm not going to sit here and say we are doing everything right. We'll keep on trying to improve and be less wasteful, but still super ambitious."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there is, by Abrak's own admission, "a bigger investment into Bond," the director is confident that "longevity" will be built into production. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">007 First Light screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"If we were to look at sequel at one point, who knows? At IO, we have a really, really good way of trying to be efficient. That's extremely important to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The first objective with 007 First light is to come out with the best possible, most impactful journey for gamers. Again, without giving too much detail, you could expect that we'll be applying some of our learnings from World of Assassination to Bond." I'll certainly be counting the number of toilets we see…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive's James Bond game was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-developer-announces-new-bond-game-project-007"><u>first announced back in 2020</u></a> as Project 007. From the off, IO said that it was developing a fresh James Bond origin story and a wholly original piece of work, rather than anything that followed the events of any particular film. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't until June 2025's PlayStation State of Play broadcast that we got our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-reveals-new-young-james-bond-with-the-walking-deads-lennie-james-set-to-co-star">first proper look at 007 First Light</a>. Set to launch in 2026, 007 First Light's incarnation of James Bond was involved in a childhood tragedy that left him an orphan at the age of 11, after which he spent the rest of his childhood in various British boarding schools. We later see Bond as a young recruit in the Royal Navy, from which he is recruited by MI6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak has said he hoped 007 First Light would be the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy"><u>start of a new trilogy of games</u></a>, though, unfortunately, the studio's beloved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-franchise-on-hiatus-as-io-interactive-focuses-on-james-bond-game"><u>Hitman franchise is on hiatus</u></a> while IO works on this game.

It's not <em>totally</em> abandoned, of course. IO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>just announced that a co-op mode is in the works</u></a> for the games, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-world-of-assassination-elusive-target-sees-mads-mikkelsen-reprise-iconic-casino-royale-role"><u>Mads Mikkelsen will reprise his iconic Casino Royale role as an Elusive Target</u></a>.

Well, one player who found a rare weapon and decided to find out has gone viral for building their blade up into the ultimate Nightlord-slaying machine — only to see it also then ultimately tumble back down to nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this centers on Japanese YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mintius" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mintius</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/elden-ring-nightreign-player-pushes-attack-damage-to-very-limit-reaches-godhood-for-a-moment-before-glitching-out-and-becoming-completely-defenseless/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton Media</a>), who acquired the Marais Executioner Sword, a weapon that raises attack power upon defeating enemies — but usually only by a certain amount. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that Nightreign usually has time limits, thanks to its encroaching storm, this sword's power wouldn't normally have the chance to snowball <em>too </em>far out of control, despite being a strong weapon. But Mintius managed to get the right combination of enemy and encounter spawns to scale it as far as it can go, and then even further.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per Automaton's translation, Mintius hunted mobs in the Wormface encounter for "about an hour" with the Marais Executioner Sword, to see what would happen. Their attack power hit a damage cap at 9,999 after defeating 725 enemies, with the last damage value he saw as 63,375. After defeating the 727th enemy, though, Mintius was "suddenly unable to deal any damage at all," and got killed.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">「マレー家の執行剣」で1時間ほどミミズ顔の雑魚を狩り続けて検証<br>727体の敵を撃破して攻撃力は9999で余裕のカンスト<br>最後にステータスから確認したマレー家の執行剣の表示攻撃力は63375<br>725体目を撃破したところで、突如として全ての敵へ一切ダメージを与えられない状態になり死亡した <a href="https://t.co/q95neZfdu3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/q95neZfdu3</a></p>— 負けミン mintius (@amabamamabam1) <a href="https://twitter.com/amabamamabam1/status/1937574056943030323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The going theory is that Mintius hit an "overflow," and suddenly went from hitting the damage ceiling to scraping the damage floor. Much like the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nuclear-gandhi-meme-civilization/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet tall-tale about Gandhi in Civilization</a>, hitting the upper-limit may have caused Mintius to wrap back around to the lower.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mintius is apparently going to continue testing the Marais Executioner Sword, to see what kind of limits and bounds exist on it, as well as the incredible damage potential behind it. They apparently want to try doing a plunging attack on a Flame Chariot, just to see what kind of damage numbers it can put up. It will probably get wild.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the average Elden Ring Nightreign player, maybe take this as a sign to not get <em>too </em>greedy in farming up that Marais Executioner Sword when you find it. Or at least, don't spend an hour doing so. It certainly seems like a good weapon, but it looks like there's some hubris to be found in trying to take it to its highest heights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-player-takes-a-damage-stacking-weapon-to-its-highest-heights-before-it-all-comes-crashing-down]]></content:encoded>
