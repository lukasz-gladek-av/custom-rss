There's no doubt player numbers will continue to climb, especially as we move into the weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By <a href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/PlayStation+Publishing+LLC/?sort=peak_desc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>comparison</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/ghost-of-tsushima/tsushima"><u>Ghost of Tsushima</u></a> topped out at 77,154 players, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war"><u>God of War</u></a> peaked at 73,529, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-remastered"><u>Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</u></a> sports a peak of 66,436 players. In fact, the only Sony-published game to have a higher concurrent record than Stellar Blade is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a>, which is, of course, a multiplayer game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">PC-specific features include AI upscaling via Nvidia DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 3, an unlocked framerate, Japanese and Chinese voiceover, ultrawide display support, higher resolution environment textures, and DualSense support for haptic feedback and trigger effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PC version was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-devs-closely-discussing-mysterious-pc-region-lock-issue-with-sony"><u>originally region locked in 100+ countries</u></a>, but is now available in <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1928543205097705548" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>"over 250 regions."</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-director-cant-wait-to-see-our-pc-mods"><u>And yes, there are mods</u></a>. Dozens and dozens have popped up, with modders making all kinds of tweaks and buffs since the demo dropped a few weeks ago.

The Sony-published action game launched to a positive response back in April 2024, with players saying its gameplay mixed elements of NieR: Automata and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review"><u>IGN's Stellar Blade review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: "Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
