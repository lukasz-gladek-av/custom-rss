Among these, the latest Yakuza game – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> – is down to only $25.

Goro Majima wakes up on an island without his memories, and before long, he's the head of his very own crew of pirates. It's got the usual Yakuza beat 'em up gameplay, but Pirate Yakuza gets naval combat too, letting players command a pirate ship and attack others on the high seas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've never played a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/yakuza">Yakuza game</a>, you can start with Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii if you wish. While the stories are all interconnected, each one stands on its own, too. Some events may not hit the same if you jump around, though, so <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-games-in-order">we recommend playing in order</a>, if possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the next Yakuza game is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-bring-much-needed-combat-and-visual-upgrades">much-needed remake of Yakuza 3</a>, Pirate Yakuza will still be a key piece of the story for the next mainline entry. As such, if you're aiming to catch up on the series anytime soon, this is a game you likely will need to play to be prepared for what's to come.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Amazing Black Friday Video Game Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.
