But, we highly encourage you to slow down before making any big purchases at full price, as there's always an opportunity to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-deals-2024">save a Pokédollar or two</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of top Pokémon TCG discounts to consider today so take a gander at what we've picked out as the best of the best. TL;DR, the Amazon "Holiday Exclusive" <a href="https://zdcs.link/9g34rG?object_uuid=e13f64c2-62d2-44f3-877b-eeb86a7f26d4&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paradox Fury Premium Collection</a> has dropped to its lowest price ever and will arrive before Christmas.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Best Pokémon TCG Deals Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite in the sale is undoubtedly the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9g34rG?object_uuid=e13f64c2-62d2-44f3-877b-eeb86a7f26d4&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paradox Fury Premium Collection</a>, hitting an all-time low price at Amazon (according to <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D6D6BJJ1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camelcamelcamel</a>). It's exclusive to the retailer, and at a handy new price, $49.77, compared to its original listing for $67.99, it's the perfect gift to the Pokemon trainer in your life (or for yourself!).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, it's hard to not mention the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMvky4?object_uuid=e13f64c2-62d2-44f3-877b-eeb86a7f26d4&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grand Adventure Collection</a>, which hasn't been discounted but is now back in stock at Target for a limited time.
