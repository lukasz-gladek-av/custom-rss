Patch 01.003.000 is out now across PC and PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a number of teases from developer Arrowhead, Helldivers 2 has unleashed a new invasion push from the Illuminate alien faction. This brings with it new enemies, as detailed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, including the Stingray (jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky, targeting Helldivers and lining up devastating strafing runs), and the Crescent Overseer, which has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover. There’s also the Fleshmob, which is described as a “failed” Illuminate experiment: “a Frankenstein’s monster of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Attention, Helldivers: This is a Galactic Emergency.</p><p>The true Illuminate invasion has begun. In a sudden and completely unprovoked offensive manoeuvre, the full Illuminate fleet is emerging from the Meridia Singularity. Nothing is safe - not even the Heart of Democracy itself. <a href="https://t.co/2hgtK6akMb" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2hgtK6akMb</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1922215852037783771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead teased “sightings of other, even larger ships, though details remain unclear on their abilities.” So perhaps there will be more for players to discover once they jump into the game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/54507366342-1ca82333da-h-1747129689963.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Helldivers 2 now has weapon customization and progression. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Helldivers 2 now has weapon customization and progression for the first time. Now, most primary weapons have levels that are achievable by completing missions, which then in turn unlock new attachments obtainable through Requisition. In addition to attachments, players can also unlock patterns for their weapons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Whether it's tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazines for ammo capacity, muzzles to optimize weapon performance characteristics or adjusting under-barrel attachments for the handling you want, you're in command of how your weaponry performs on the battlefield. This level of individual attunement is sure to make your favorite primary best in its class.</blockquote><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/hd2-1747129737498.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead has also unlocked and deployed a stash of patterns for the FRV themed on the Viper Commandos, Freedom's Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds. This backlog of patterns unlock on May 15, with the launch of the Masters of Ceremony Warbond.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/086ad5db38d420a0982fd909484ab56747c929ac-1747130320086.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, the Superstore has been changed so items you want are always available, as opposed to players having to wait for items to come back into rotation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside new features, patch 01.003.000 brings with it an extensive balance pass, with changes to spread, drag, sway, melee weapons stamina cost, shrapnel spawning, and fire damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

As you’d expect, the internet captured the trailer, which we expect will be released officially soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Complete Edition includes the base game and all the DLC released so far for both PS5 and PC. The news comes over a year after Stellar Blade’s successful April 2024 launch on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade has all the features you’d expect on PC, including AI upscaling via Nvidia DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 3, an unlocked framerate, Japanese and Chinese voiceover, ultrawide display support, higher resolution environment textures, and DualSense support for haptic feedback and trigger effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the trailer reveals a new boss battle vs Mann, Leader of the Sentinels, and 25 new costumes, which we presume will also be made available on PS5. Players have also noticed that, at the end of the trailer, Eve lets go of a memory stick — a sequence that isn't in the base game. Some are now speculating Stellar Blade is set for a new ending or maybe even DLC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/qua2wq8-1747125726116.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The trailer reveals the Stellar Blade Complete Edition, coming to PC and PS5.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade was a big hit for Korean developer Shift Up, bringing in $43 million in royalties in its last financial year. It expects the PC version to outsell the PS5 version, which sold more than 1 million copies in two months. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-shift-up-considering-a-sequel"><u>Shift Up has said it's considering making another game in the franchise</u></a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stellar Blade sees players take on the role of Eve as she battles against unknown invaders to reclaim Earth in fast paced action role-playing game combat. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review"><u>It earned a 7/10 in IGN's review</u></a> and proved popular otherwise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-exclusive-stellar-blade-sells-1-million-copies"><u>quickly selling a million copies</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre," we said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
