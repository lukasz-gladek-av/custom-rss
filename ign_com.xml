In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/508445806184891583" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>, Firaxis said it is “the first in a series of upcoming patches” intended to address feedback from advanced access. The patch notes in full are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that Firaxis has temporarily disabled crossplay multiplayer "to expedite" updates to the PC version. This means the developer will sometimes deploy patches to PC at a different "cadence" than on consoles, and indeed that includes patch 1.0.1. This will have no impact on console players attempting cross-platform play with other console players, nor on PC-to-PC multiplayer, Firaxis clarified.</p><div id="best-civ-7-leaders" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for tips to help you take over the world?
