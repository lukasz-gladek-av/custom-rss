"That attention has also made me realize how many people are worried about this issue. However, our decision to go multiplatform with the FF7 Remake series will not in any way lower the quality of the third installment. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our development structure simply doesn't work that way to begin with... I suppose I'll just have to keep saying it," he said, laughing. He also stressed that because of the growing popularity of gaming on PC both in Japan and beyond, the game has been built with PC "as the foundation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While PC gaming is gradually expanding in Japan, overseas growth has been even more rapid," Hamaguchi added. "The market has broadened tremendously across both consoles and PC. The FF7 Remake series has sold very well on platforms like Steam and the Epic Games Store, so we develop assets with the broad PC market in mind. In fact, our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When FFVII Rebirth launched, there was talk about how the PC version looked better than the PS5 version, and our philosophy will not change for the third instalment," he concluded. "As our fundamental principle, we do not design assets to meet the lowest baseline. Instead, we create them for high-end environments first."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Gold Saucer Date (1997 vs. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth)</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Hamaguchi teased that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-director-issues-update-on-part-3-progress-and-reveals-clouds-iconic-buster-sword-was-almost-resized-to-make-it-more-realistic"><u>"core game experience is almost complete,"</u></a> and while he "really want[s] everyone to play it as soon as possible," the team has now moved on to "refining and polishing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>'s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-card-game-queens-blood-will-be-enhanced-for-ff7-remake-part-3"><u>Queen's Blood card game is making a “powered-up” comeback</u></a> for the final chapter in Square Enix’s remake trilogy.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/will-sonys-spider-man-games-come-to-xbox-not-likely-insomniac-says</link>
            <guid>1437154</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Could an Xbox version of Insomniac’s Spider-Man games eventually be released, given parent company Sony’s recent softening on multiplatform not just on PC, but with the likes of Helldivers 2 and Marathon coming to Microsoft’s console? Based on a comment from Insomniac itself, Xbox owners shouldn’t hold their breath.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A fan replied to a tweet from Insomniac celebrating Valentine’s Day to ask about the possibility of Spider-Man swinging onto Xbox, and <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2022752405444505766" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the developer’s response</a> was pretty clear: “Not likely.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, you might say that’s obvious. But, as the replies have pointed out, once upon a time Insomniac ruled out Marvel's Spider-Man ever coming to PC, and it ended up making the jump from PlayStation exclusivity to personal computers.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">it will never appear on Xbox or PC. It's a permanent PS4 exclusive publisher by Sony Interactive Entertainment</p>— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/879913482845511681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 28, 2017</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, nearly nine years after that tweet, Sony not only publishes games on PC, but on Xbox and Nintendo Switch. Arrowhead’s record-breaking Helldivers 2, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-officially-getting-halo-odst-content-but-its-first-legendary-warbond-is-going-to-cost-you">launched on Xbox Series X and S complete with a Halo crossover</a>. And Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is coming out on Xbox as well as PC and PlayStation. The times have changed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spider-Man, though, does feel like it would be crossing a thicker line to get to Xbox, and Insomniac’s tweet suggests that to be the case. In the shorter term, Insomniac’s Marvel’s Wolverine is due out later this year — exclusively on PlayStation 5. Meanwhile, Insomniac fans expect another Spider-Man game eventually, a continuation of the story as set out in 2023’s Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which launched on PC in January last year. (Last year, Yuri Lowenthal suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-3-actor-says-peter-parker-wont-be-relegated-to-the-couch">Marvel’s Spider-Man 3 will see Peter Parker doing his Spider-Man thing</a> despite what the ending of Spider-Man 2 suggests.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Spider-Man Games</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s approach contrasts with that of Microsoft, which has fully embraced multiplatform for pretty much all its first-party video games. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-set-in-japan-launches-2026"><u>When Microsoft finally announced Playground’s Forza Horizon 6</u></a> and confirmed it would launch on PlayStation 5 <em>after </em>Xbox and PC, it came as a surprise. Nowadays, Xbox Game Studios is one of the most prolific and successful publishers on PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-idea-of-locking-it-to-one-store-or-one-device-is-antiquated-for-most-people-xbox-president-says-microsoft-is-seeing-players-evolve-way-past-big-blockbuster-exclusive-games">Microsoft said the idea of a video game exclusive locked to a single storefront had become “antiquated for most people,”</a> but Sony still refuses to launch its big single-player games on anything other than PlayStation day-one (the latest example of this is Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei). Multiplayer games, however do tend to launch on PC at the same time. Guerrilla’s recently announced co-op action game Horizon Hunters Gathering is set for PS5 and PC. Marathon’s day-one multiplatform launch is something of an outlier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

In this new sale, an unknown buyer placed the winning bid of $13 million to secure the card, with the further $3.49 million added in auction fees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why has it sold for such a huge amount? Well, at a base level, the Pikachu Illustrator is one of the rarest Pokémon cards out there, and its eyebrow-raising PSA 10 grading makes it truly unique and technically flawless. But Paul himself has done a lot to personally try and raise the card's value — and very successfully so. Minus the auction fees, Paul likely stands to make more than $7 million in profit.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/16/maxresdefault-1-1771237895791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Logan Paul and the $16.49 million card.

A brief, bizarre drama involving OnlyFans content creator Emmie Bunni — including a phantom $10.2 million bid and an AI photo of her holding the card — prompted a claim by Paul that her actions had put off further interest. Last week, the influencer-wrestler also got involved in the controversy surrounding Super Bowl LX half time show artist Bad Bunny, and at loggerheads on the issue with his brother Jake Paul. Just days later, the auction reached its climax with a flurry of late bids.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And in general, there's the fact that Pokémon cards have rarely been hotter. This auction has been well-timed, in the run-up to Pokémon's big 30th anniversary celebrations.
