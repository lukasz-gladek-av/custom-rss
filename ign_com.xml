The Roblox farming simulator first launched back in March and has seen rapid success thanks to various updates and events since then. The overwhelming interest in this Roblox game has shown no signs of slowing down, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/Chris_P._Bacon_Cooking_Event_Quests_and_Rewards">latest  cooking-themed event</a> has only fueled it further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that the game has entered further into the mainstream, we're already starting to see unofficial merch become available. A third-party seller on Amazon called VatanFari has a variety of Grow a Garden plushies for sale based on the pets from the game. The product pages for these plushies claim to be "drawing inspiration" from the Grow a Garden universe.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grow a Garden Plushies at Amazon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a ton of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/All_Pets,_Pet_Eggs,_Abilities,_and_Traits#All_Pets_and_Their_Abilities_in_Grow_a_Garden">pets available in Grow a Garden</a>, but only a select few are available in plushie form so far. There's the more traditional animals like a Chicken and a Racoon as well as rarer options such as the Disco Bee. Despite the lack of choices, however, the Chicken Zombie that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden/How_to_Get_Chicken_Jockey_in_Grow_a_Garden_-_Chicken_Zombie_Pet">part of a limited-time giveaway</a> is included here as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of the Grow a Garden-inspired plushies are available in a 10-inch size and cost around $18. The exception is the Chicken Zombie one that sits at 12-inches thanks to the little jockey. It's also quite a bit more expensive at $30. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as I can tell, there isn't any "official" merch yet available for Grow a Garden. For now third-party sellers on sites like Amazon or Etsy appear to be ramping up offerings as the latest Roblox sensation continues to take root.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Is VatanFari a trustworthy seller?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the dangers of buying from third-party sellers on Amazon is that the products <em>might</em> not end up being of the highest quality. That being said, VatanFari appears to have a decent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rainbow-Monkey-Preferred-Birthdays-Purple/dp/B0BL3LHV3V/?th=1#averageCustomerReviewsAnchor" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">track record of reviews on some of its other offerings</a>. And plushies are a pretty low-risk item to order from Amazon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">More than four years after it's release, Guilty Gear Strive is still going strong, with perhaps its most prolific DLC character yet, Lucy from Cyberpunk, releasing on August 21 as the final part of Character Pass 4. But that's not the only exciting thing going on in the world of Guilty Gear. During the finals of Strive at Evo, there was a trailer announcing a mysterious new chapter called Guilty Gear Strive 2.00, with two silhouhettes of characters that clearly indicate that longtime favorites Robo-Ky and Jam Kuradoberi are going to be making their way into Strive's ever growing roster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To get some details on Strive's future, I caught up with Ken Miyauchi at the show so I could pick his brain on all of these points and more. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>[Editor's Note: This interview has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So at finals for EVO 2025, you guys revealed Guilty Gear Strive 2.00. Can you tell us a little bit about what's going to be in that version? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ken Miyauchi, Producer on Guilty Gear Strive: </strong>Yes, we just announced a teaser trailer of something showing the version 2.00. We are not really particularly explaining what's in 2.00, but there's a reason behind why we show the number 2.00. We want to provide new, more exciting content toward Guilty Gear Strive and I'm expecting to show more details in the near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>We also saw two silhouettes of characters that are going to be coming to Guilty Gear Strive 2.00. It seems like it's going to be Jam and Robo-Ky. Can you talk a little bit about those two characters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So yeah, we are showing that we are still working on developing more additional characters. Of course, Lucy is coming out in August 21st, but we are still continuing developing more character updates and those are going to be the two characters that we are currently working on. So please stay tuned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell us about Lucy and what her play style is going to be? Obviously she uses strings from Cyberpunk, but can you give us a little taste of what she is going to be like in Strive?</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Yeah, I think people are watching the trailers and trying to find out what she's doing and one of the biggest core mechanics that a lot of players might be very excited to see is her Quickhack move, which is really directly inspired from the Cyberpunk 2077 game mechanic. So we made it visually look very like the Cyberpunk 2077 Quickhack. And she has very, very unique moves that go along with that Quickhack. So the way she fights is going to be very unique, even compared to the entire Guilty Gear Strive cast. So yeah, I hope everyone enjoys her when she's out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Another thing that's coming to Guilty Gear Strive is going to be the ranked mode. What can you tell us about how the ranked mode will be in Guilty Gear Strive and how it's going to be different from the regular tower format?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So yeah, I explained this in our own website column, Developer's Backyard. So if you want to find out more details about the rules of how you earn points and how you get ranks and what kind of variety of ranks you have, <a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2550/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>you can check that out</u></a>. And so it's pretty much a regular standard rank match system that we've been also doing, and I think all other fighting games were also doing. We have battle points that you climb up together whenever you win a match and depending on your battle points, you will have higher ranks, and you get to the top, which is the rank called Vanquisher. You'll get into a rating match, almost like a master rank kind of, a rating match. So people who are playing really competitively can keep grinding to compete in the rating ranking and try to aim to the top of the ranking. And there is of course rewards to it. So I hope everyone who plays regularly will enjoy playing this mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Ranked Match we also have several features that people would be excited. I mean, I hope they appreciate is that we also have the Wi-Fi indicator and also if there's a bad ping match-up goals, you will be able to vote a no contest. So those kinds of features will also be included. So I hope you find out how you can use those features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So you're also looking to make adjustments to things like RISC, Wild Assault, and I believe Guard Crush is another thing. Can you tell us a little bit about specifically what kind of changes you're looking to make about those mechanics?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So yeah, we also announced that we are working on the battle balance patch and that's also coming out along with the Lucy character update. And so we are kind of trying to see the game balance and trying to incorporate a lot of player's feedback regarding how Guilty Gear Strive is currently playing. And we think there needs to be some tone downs on several, how do I say… the game mechanics, general game mechanics, the tools that everyone has access to. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We think there needs to be some tone downs on several game mechanics, or tools that everyone has access to. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And so there are lots of toning downs, but at the same time we also want to focus on the character uniqueness and making sure that characters can play how they would like to be played. And I think we had a lot of feedback from players that the current version of Guilty Gear Strive is in favor of those characters who have more access to those game mechanics. So not too much relying into the game mechanics and that's the direction of how we are balancing out for this patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So Arc System Works recently announced Marvel Tokon, and I think a lot of people are wondering, is there anyone from the Strive team that moved over to Marvel Tokon, or what is Strive's relationship with that game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Well, I wish I can say anything about Marvel Tokon, but unfortunately I don't have a right to, and I honestly don't know much about Marvel Tokon because that's really a high-end secure project that's also internally in Arc System Works.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So no knowledge of Strive developers working on Marvel Tokon then?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Well, we do have, it's a small company, so we do have a chat or discussion going on between teams. But yeah, that's everything that I can say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fair enough. So with each new update of Guilty Gear Strive, it feels like you're kind of going down a list and just kind of knocking off different features from 3v3 to now ranked mode. Are there any other kind of features that you want to add to Strive that are still on the list?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So we have a lot of things that we would like to do, which is also something that a lot of players has been asking for and I can't share any details about it for now, but I'm hoping if I will be able to show that off in the next version of 2.00.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you ever see Guilty Gear changing direction from being a fighting game series or even just a spin-off to do something other than fighting games? Obviously Guilty Gear 2: Overture was an action adventure. Is there any kind of future for Guilty Gear that's not a 2D fighter, do you think?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Well, I don't have any projected plan or anything that I can share for now, but as a producer I'm always interested to expand Guilty Gear as an IP to open to different genres so that people who are not fighting games would also get into the IP. So yeah, if I have a chance I would like to try on some different kind of genre. But yeah, I don't have anything to share right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

And while it's normal to have a few bugs any time new content comes out, 11.2 seems to be riddled with weirder problems than usual...including a goofy bug that's turning some players' banks German.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj43f4/bank_update_my_stuff_is_fine_but_it_is_now/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">German bug in particular</a> has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mixnow/so_are_anyone_elses_bank_tabs_in_german_as_well/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mivyy8/eu_all_my_bank_tabs_have_german_description_text/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several players</a> on English clients, not on EU servers. It's not game-breaking by any stretch - just odd. It changes the player's bank tabs to German language. Everything else is unaffected. Funnily enough, some players in other countries and languages are reporting the same bug, but with different languages, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj43f4/comment/n784o0j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this German player who says their tabs are in French</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj43f4/comment/n7898w2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this person</a> playing on the English client from Poland who has French tabs, while their wife's are German.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not the only bug players are facing, though. I've experienced several myself <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1miwt6p/new_patch_bugged_quests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just questing in the new zone, K'aresh</a>, with quests not completing, disappearing from the questlog mysteriously, and certain interactable objects needing the game fully reloaded in order to be used. I also experienced a lot of disconnects last night, and I'm not the only one. Some people are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj68lh/bug_new_zone_has_bricked_2_of_my_characters_from/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">having trouble logging in at all</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are running into weirder bugs. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1miot5x/man_inflation_is_absolutely_hitting_everyone/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This person reports</a> that the game is trying to charge them 500,000 gold just to visit the Darkmoon Faire, which is...a <em>little </em>high. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1miuf7h/i_have_found_a_bug_with_bags_and_bank_storage_i/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another person found a bug</a> (which admittedly may be related to a downloaded mod) where their bags have somehow been increased to hold 98 items apiece - far more than any bag currently in the game actually allows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the moment, it's difficult to say if Ghosts of K'aresh is exceptionally buggy compared to other patch releases, or if it just feels bad in the moment because we're all eager to play as much as possible as fast as possible. Most likely, all of these issues will be fixed within a few days, or at minimum by next Tuesday's weekly game update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in the meantime, if you want to use your bank, you might need to brush up on your German.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting games to watch at Evo 2025 was Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-fury-pros-dramatic-reaction-to-losing-at-evo-2025-goes-viral-but-it-was-actually-10-years-in-the-making">From KojiKOG's memeworthy and dramatic reaction to his loss in top 8</a>, to the incredible grand finals betwen Go1 and ET, and all of the exciting moments in between. It was a great reminder of how much fun the game can be. While I wasn't able to talk to anyone from SNK at the actual show itself, Producer Yasuyuki Oda and Animator Masami Obari were kind enough to answer several questions of mine via email relating to the release of Ken in City of the Wolves and a few other topics that I felt would be of great interest to fans of SNK and fighting games in general.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the biggest surprises to me once I got my hands on with Ken is how similar to his SF6 counterpart he is, despite this being a completely different game. Can you talk a little bit about some of the challenges involving taking a beloved character from one series and making them fit under a whole new set of rules and mechanics?</strong><br>
<strong>Yasayuki Oda, Lead Producer on Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves:</strong> The biggest initial concern for us was finding how to bring Ken into the Fatal Fury gameplay system and world without compromising his identity as a character. Our development team has so many people that are passionate about the Street Fighter franchise, and I think their love and dedication to the series really shined through in all the little details we worked on for Ken. We slowly worked out over time how to incorporate Ken’s fast speed and flashy flame-based attacks into the system of City of the Wolves, constantly asking ourselves “What was missing?”, “What could we improve on?”, “What were Ken’s strengths and where could we leverage that?” After much repeated trial and error, this version of Ken finally took form. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ken is a character that’s always been very strong in Street Fighter 6, thanks to being able to convert most regular hits on block to a Jinrai Kick that forces some risky decision making on defense, a plus on block gap closer in his heavy dragonlash kick, on top of just having really good neutral buttons and a balanced tool kit. Were you ever concerned that some of these elements might make him a bit too strong in Fatal Fury?</strong><br>
<strong>Oda</strong>: As you said, bringing Ken over the same way he is in Street Fighter 6 would undoubtedly make him a strong character in City of the Wolves. Of course, we had to make careful adjustments as we adapted him to the game. Integrating mechanics like Braking and REV Accel were challenging, but I think we were able to highlight what makes Ken special while also giving fans a chance to experience a different playstyle within the systems of City of the Wolves. We’re looking forward to seeing what fans think and how they engage with this version of Ken. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>With Terry and Mai appearing in Street Fighter 6, and now Ken, and later Chun-Li coming to Fatal Fury, do you have any interest in working together with Capcom once again for another entry in the Capcom vs SNK series? Or is that a far off dream?</strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p><strong>That would be something, wouldn't it?</strong></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> That would be something, wouldn’t it? However, there is nothing I can talk about at this moment. We are always happy to receive questions like this because it shows how enthusiastic the fans are for another Capcom vs. SNK. It’s a great source of motivation for us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How do you feel overall about guest characters in fighting games? Do you think it’s a healthy trend for the genre, and do you think we might see more in future SNK games, or even in future updates of Fatal Fury?</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> I think it’s a great trend. Of course, it is important to respect the story and world of other games, but the introduction of guest characters has great potential for the future of fighting games to create new “chemical reactions.” That is to say, it can lead to unexpected outcomes and birth something new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for City of the Wolves, there are still characters we need to bring back before we start thinking about more guest characters. Please rest assured that we are putting all of our focus on that right now. Even after Mr. Big releases, there are still many new characters and new aspects of the game we are working on, so please look forward to them!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know she’s still a bit of a ways off, and we’ve got Joe coming first, but can you share any details about Chun-Li’s appearance in Fatal Fury? Will it be similar to the approach of Ken, in that you’re looking to her iteration in Street Fighter 6 as a primary source of inspiration?</strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We have a few surprises and finer details we're planning to add. We're looking to make this version of Chun-Li a culmination of her past iterations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> We are using her SF6 version as a base, but since many of our staff are fans of the entire Street Fighter series, we have a few surprises and finer details we’re planning to add. We’re looking to make this version of Chun-Li, like Ken, a culmination of all her past iterations, so please look forward to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>For Obari-san, what was it like getting to create the animations for such an iconic character that’s outside of the world of SNK, like Ken. Were there any kinds of signature touches you felt like you were able to add, or did you try to keep things as close to the source as possible? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Masami Obari, Animator on Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves:</strong> First of all, I would like to say that it was a great honor to work on this project. I am extremely grateful to Capcom for this opportunity. As for the original elements, I would say the most work went into designing these characters in my style. I’d like to call it Bari-Ken! (Haha). It was extremely fun to draw Ken within the style and animation of the Fatal Fury anime.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are there any dream crossovers that you’d like to work on, either within the realm of fighting games or outside of it? </strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p><strong>I would be extremely happy to see a collaboration with a real pro wrestler. </strong></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obari</strong>: I’m a huge pro wrestling fan, so I would be extremely happy to see a collaboration with a real pro wrestler. In terms of fighting games, I would be excited to see a crossover with Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer, a game I was originally in charge of the story and character design!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And finally, canonically, who do you think would win in a fight between Ken and Terry?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obari:</strong> To be honest with you, I think Terry would win. I think they are evenly matched in terms of strength, but Terry is carrying a lot on his shoulders, and his will is strong because of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, as a director of the anime, I would prefer not to decide and have the two work together to fight a common enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

Over 500 vendors filled the hall and a slew of new releases made their debut. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After four days of glorious dice rolling and cube pushing, 10 board games have emerged as the most compelling and unique titles I saw on offer. Most of these will be available in general retail shortly, and many are already open to preorder. This list is organized alphabetically.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't have time to read blurbs? These are them. If you do have time for blurbs, though, read on, because we have lots of info about why each one deserves a spot on this list.</p><p id="age-of-galaxy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Age of Galaxy">Age of Galaxy</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226507"><div id="226507" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Age of Galaxy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a difficult task cramming a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/genre/4x-strategy"><u>4X space conquest</u></a> into a small box, but this intriguing card game from Portal Games does just that. Each player controls an interstellar alliance of three unique factions drawn from a pool of 40 distinct options. This creates an asymmetric suite of abilities that informs and influences strategy. Utilizing a selection of multi-use cards, players explore new systems, settle planets, research advanced technologies, and build shiny galactic cruisers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While quick and sharp, the main focus is on executing tough decisions on how to use cards for either long-term benefits or short-term bursts. The inclusion of a solo mode is also a very nice addition that extends the life of the game. </p></div><p id="ace-of-spades"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Ace of Spades">Ace of Spades</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226508"><div id="226508" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ace of Spades</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games"><u>Solo gaming</u></a> is not a new concept, but it’s certainly exploded in recent years. Ace of Spades is the latest noteworthy title in this category, allowing a lone player to utilize a hand of cards to battle progressively tougher bosses. On the surface, it looks a lot like the tabletop version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>, but a closer gander reveals an interesting card game brimming with identity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wild setting helps as you head to Sweet Haven, Arizona seeking vengeance upon a vile necromancer. This leads to a cemetery where you are confronted by horrific denizens of hell intent on claiming your soul. Best of all, if you get tired of facing these terrors alone, you can call in a partner and play the game in two-player <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> mode. This works surprisingly well, even if the core engine feels more comfortable as a solo endeavor. This is a heavy-metal charged experience with distorted riffs and a thick tracklist of content.</p></div><p id="dying-message-card-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dying Message Card Game">Dying Message Card Game</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226506"><div id="226506" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dying Message Card Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the oddball entry of the list, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party game</a> for a collection of people where one is ruthlessly murdered and the others attempt to solve the crime. The twist here is that the victim tries to form clues from a randomly dealt allotment of cards. These contain symbols and characters of various types, requiring some creative thinking from the murdered participant. You’re given a few minutes to arrange the clue cards how you’d like, using them in conjunction with several suspect cards placed off to the side. The idea is that in the last moments of life, you’ve done what you can to leave a message for those who find you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After arranging the murder scene, the victim sprawls out on the table capturing their final position at time of death. The ensuing discussion as people try, often in vain, to tease out the meaning of the scene and decipher the clues can be riotous and engaging. Ultimately, the group guesses the murderer and either succeeds or fails. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a quirky design that absolutely requires the right set of people. Acquire the wrong crowd or a misaligned mood and it runs the risk of firing blanks. However, with some performative buy-in and a deductive attitude, Dying Message will hit its mark and result in a tabletop game that is wholly unique. </p></div><p id="high-tide"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="High Tide">High Tide</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226509"><div id="226509" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>High Tide</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Cozy games are all the rage right now. These are designs that present a relaxed experience which is more focused on meditative play and chill vibes over brutish competition. High Tide is the latest to break out in this category, selling out at Gen Con due to its stellar aesthetic and intriguing play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a small game, easily portable and completely unassuming. But it boasts a surprising amount of depth. Tiles are arranged randomly in a grid and players take turns stacking pieces upon ones that are higher. You may only move your own or neutral tiles, however. It teases out just the right level of strategic thought without tipping over into a cerebral grind. High Tide is a neat, novel work that stood out among the swathe of new games.</p></div><p id="lightning-train"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lightning Train">Lightning Train</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226510"><div id="226510" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lightning Train</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of the buzz surrounding Lightning Train is the pedigree of designer Paul Dennen. His previous work, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review"><u>Dune Imperium</u></a>, is a modern classic that has caught on like wildfire in the gaming community. This new release uses a similar concept of bag building as players add various resources to their bag in a strategic bid for developing their company. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal is to open train stations and railroad lines across North America, facilitating the delivery of goods to cities in need. The interesting detail is that players can share each other's infrastructure, sending cargo along another participant’s route. Both receive benefits from this cooperation, birthing a more nuanced and fuzzy strategic space. Unlike most games in the train category, Lightning Train is a more approachable design that slots in as a step up from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions">Ticket to Ride</a>.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-f"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the F">The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226511"><div id="226511" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pandemic-board-game-buying-guide"><u>Pandemic</u></a> has dozens of spinoff games at this point, and The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship appears to be just another iteration on Matt Leacock’s modern classic. That is not the case. This new design does contain some faint indicators of that previous game’s DNA, but it’s so much more than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a rich adventure game where players cooperate to take the One Ring to Mount Doom while evading the attention of Sauron. It’s part tower defense, with players recruiting Free World troops to battle invading Orcs and Southrons, and it’s part stealth thriller as Frodo must constantly sneak past armies and Nazgul. This is a tense affair, and it’s far more detailed and thematic than expected. In fact, it barely feels like a Pandemic property at all, which may take some people by surprise. Regardless, this is perhaps the most exciting game I played at Gen Con this year, and I’m enraptured by it.</p></div><p id="nature"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Nature">Nature</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226512"><div id="226512" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nature</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/91jYRn?object_uuid=fb854556-6e2a-4fc7-b3cb-9e9864335368&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0725LRH1W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Evolution</u></a>, the board game that captures the pressures of a dynamic ecosystem and how this influences species, has been wildly successful over the past 10 years of its life. It’s spawned numerous expansions and spinoffs, and may have just found its final state with Nature. This latest version of the system is pared down to a straightforward and approachable core game that retains the interesting card play of its predecessor. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the elements have been simplified, and it’s easier than ever to introduce this game to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">beginners</a> and non-hobbyist of any age. The magic resides in the game’s module system. Multiple add-ons exist that can be inserted to layer on sub-systems for flight, dinosaurs, and environments. This slightly increases the complexity, while boosting the strategic potential. A huge boon is that it changes up the feel of each session, and allows North Star Games to expand this properly infinitely. Nature is poised to have the longest legs of any game in the Evolution line.</p></div><p id="star-wars-battle-of-hoth"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Star Wars: Battle of Hoth">Star Wars: Battle of Hoth</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226513"><div id="226513" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: Battle of Hoth</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle of Hoth was the most talked about game heading into Gen Con. This was for good reason, as it puts a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">Star Wars board game</a> spin on the popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/27/days-of-wonder-announces-memoir-44-online"><u>Memoir 44 series</u></a> of games. Players take on the role of either the contingent of Imperial AT-ATs and snowtroopers, or the Rebel soldiers holding the line in order to protect the planet’s shield generator. Each takes turns playing cards from their hand to activate one portion of the battlefield, choosing from a selection of units occupying that flank. This restriction of the card system is a hallmark of the Memoir series, forcing tough decisions with only a modicum of rules overhead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">wargame</a> of sorts, it’s also a very streamlined and rules-light design. It’s a dramatic game, full of dice rolling and big moments where units are scattered and lines are broken. The Star Wars backdrop only helps.</p></div><p id="spooktacular"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Spooktacular">Spooktacular</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226514"><div id="226514" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Spooktacular</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the 1986 Spooktacular horror film festival, a freak accident occurs involving a lightning strike and a little bit of mystery. This results in dozens of monsters spanning the length of cinematic history being released from their fictional bonds. Now they are free to terrorize the festival goers and wreak havoc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This dynamite concept is realized through a highly asymmetric yet still smartly restrained system. Players take on the roles of movie monsters animated from the screen, competing to scare and devour guests. Each of the 20 included monsters is unique, featuring its own suite of abilities and cards. Yet, this is not an overstuffed game and the core processes are direct and sensible. The concoction here is magnificent, and this monster mash is full of delight and terror.</p></div><p id="vantage"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Vantage">Vantage</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226515"><div id="226515" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vantage</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vantage-board-game-review"><u>review of Vantage</u></a>, I declared it as possibly being the top game of 2025. It seems the crowds of Gen Con agreed, as this game was everywhere. This is a fully cooperative adventure where players crash land on an uncharted planet and must navigate its many mysteries in order to fulfill a collective mission. While this was clearly designed in the tradition of modern narrative adventure games, it goes about things its own way, massively improving on the pre-existing approach. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, it’s not a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign game</a>. Each individual session has a complete arc, which makes it far more approachable for most groups. It also does away with narrow objectives requiring players head to specific locations. Instead, many of the missions may be fulfilled in numerous ways. This highlights the game’s focus on creativity and freedom, allowing you to wander and explore whatever catches your eye. Finally, the mysteries of the world are special and worthy of the effort required. This is a fantastic game, and it was the closest thing to a singular standout title of the convention. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Charlie Theel is a tabletop games freelancer.
