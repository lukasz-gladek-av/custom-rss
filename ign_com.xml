            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-issues-update-on-rares-long-in-development-everwild<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We can give those teams time…"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">What happened to Rare’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a>? It’s been over five years since the game was announced back during Microsoft’s X019 presentation. Repeated no-shows during Xbox showcases and rumors of reboots have caused some to wonder whether Everwild had fallen by the wayside. Not so, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XboxEra</a>, Spencer listed Everwild as one of the games yet to come out that he was excited for, adding he’d recently visited UK studio Rare, which runs live service pirate adventure game Sea of Thieves, to get a look at Everwild and the progress the developers were making. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, State of Decay is just one of the franchises I love back from the original one, so that one stays on the board. I do think the work that Double Fine’s doing and how Tim [Schafer] kind of solicits feedback from the team. And the other one, I’ll say because I was recently out at Rare. It’s nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they’re making.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer said Microsoft had been able to give the developers of those games (State of Decay, the next game from Double Fine, and Everwild) time while still having a packed schedule of releases (bolstered, obviously, by the acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can give those teams time,” Spencer said. “And next week I’m going to be up in Vancouver with the Coalition [Gears of War developer] — and how fun is that?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Everwild, it’s faced concern over the years after the aforementioned reboot rumor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everwild-reboot-matt-booty-comments">which Microsoft has denied</a>, and the exit of creative director Simon Woodroffe in 2020. Rare filled the director's chair with veteran designer Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Pinata, and Sea of Thieves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what is Everwilds? Reports have indicated it’s a third-person adventure game with god game elements, but given how long it’s been in development, that may have changed. The last Everwilds trailer, released in July 2020, carried the following description: “Everwild is a brand new IP from Rare. A unique and unforgettable experience await in a natural and magical world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has a long list of in-development games, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot">Perfect Dark reboot</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name">the next Halo</a>, and Playground's new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-fable-reboot-shown-off-with-new-trailer-and-a-2025-release-window-xbox-games-showcase-2024">Fable</a> game. Meanwhile, Bethesda is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, and Activision is of course working on this year's Call of Duty. In the shorter term, id Software's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> launches in May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Mass Effect 2 in particular is often cited as one of the greatest action role-playing games ever made, and Wall’s soundtrack, which includes the rousing ‘Suicide Mission,’ is considered a series high-point by fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Wall failed to return for 2012’s Mass Effect 3, which came as a shock to fans. Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/14/the-making-of-mass-effect-2-music-soundtrack" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, Wall discussed why, pointing to a falling out with then Mass Effect development chief Casey Hudson.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Casey was not particularly happy with me at the end,” Wall said. “But I’m so proud of that score. It got nominated for a Bafta, and it did really well … [even if] it didn’t go as well as Casey wanted.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Guardian suggested a “creative tension” between Wall and Hudson, but Wall remained vague. “Fallouts like that happen, it’s just part of the deal,” he added. “It’s one of the few times in my career that’s happened, and it was a tough time, but it is what it is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wall did, however, go into a bit more detail on the challenges he and BioWare faced getting Mass Effect 2 out the door and Suicide Mission into the finished product, which may provide some insight into Wall and Hudson’s relationship at the end of the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was the biggest mind-f***ing thing I’ve ever done in my entire life,” Wall said. “And there was no one available to walk me through it, because they were all freaking out trying to finish the game. I handed it in, and they had to do a lot of massaging on their end in order to get it to work, but they did it... and the result is still one of the best ending sequences to a game that I’ve ever played. It was worth all that effort.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Mass Effect 2, Wall went on to make music for Call of Duty games, most recently composing the soundtrack for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>. BioWare, meanwhile, is currently working on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">next Mass Effect game</a> following the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. BioWare is yet to announce the composer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

In recent years, when Ubisoft has found the going particularly tough, Rainbow Six Siege has helped prop up those financial reports. Now, there's even more pressure on Siege X, given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-investors-grill-ceo-cfo-on-potential-tencent-sale-delays-and-financial-woes">Ubisoft's high-profile troubles</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">10 years is a long time for any video game to remain relevant and financially stable, and so it makes sense that Ubisoft would want to refresh Rainbow Six Siege with a headline-grabbing evolution. Ubisoft will announce more on March 13 at the Siege X Showcase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Then I worked in advertisement, but both of those industries were very established and didn't offer me much choice for creative risk taking. As a designer, I was very lucky to find a brand new industry that could use my skills. At this time, the video game industry did not have clearly define positions and an artist could create entire worlds. So I joined the gaming industry relatively early: my first game was Redneck Rampage, a crazy funny experience in which I was able to create a big part of the art &amp; world, before moving to more "serious" projects.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Antonov based the Orwellian City 17 on his childhood city of Sofia, mixing elements from Belgrade and St. Petersburg. “I wanted to capture this specific atmosphere of Eastern and Northern Europe,” Antonov said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most recently, Antonov appeared in <a href="https://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve’s 20th anniversary documentary for Half-Life 2</a>, where he discussed the inspiration behind his work on the project and its visual design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Half-Life 2: 20th Anniversary Documentary</em></a><em> / Valve.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
