We’ve got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-cards-best-sellers"><u>full rundown of the most popular purchases</u></a>, but with Icetill Explorer, Quantum Riddler, Cosmogrand Zenith and more, there are plenty of great options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why the lack of buzz? In two, hyphenated words: Spider-Man. In pushing to build hype for its first full Marvel set, Wizards of the Coast started showcasing cards from the Universes Beyond: Marvel’s Spider-Man set in July 2025 at San Diego Comic-Con.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It makes sense to show them off there, sure, but Edge of Eternities launched on August 1. Not only did Spider-Man’s card reveals trample all over those from Edge of Eternities, but Wizards couldn’t stop talking about the set even after Edge of Eternities arrived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This writer bought a Play Booster box for Spider-Man instead of Edge of Eternities, and let me tell you - this deal might be the best way to fix that mistake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Magic: The Gathering, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-where-to-buy-2026"><u>our rundown of the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set preorders</u></a>, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-precon-decks-in-stock-best-price-preview"><u>the new Lorwyn Eclipsed Commander Decks</u></a> you can pick up right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

Separately, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a> has reported that the project is indeed still alive today, as the dust settles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On reddit, Beyond Good &amp; Evil's long-suffering fans have reacted to the sequel's survival by calling it "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1qj77ye/ubisoft_just_canceled_six_games_and_delayed_seven/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miraculous</a>", "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1qjenil/its_insane/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insane</a>" and simply "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1qjs15h/too_big_to_fail_ubisoft_is_in_too_deep_with/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too big to fail</a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's insane this game is still in production and survived," dan_in_his_own_way wrote. "Don't get me wrong, I want to play it but the cancelation of the Price of Persia remake hit really hard. A project that would arguably cost them less and require less resources than Beyond Good &amp; Evil." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Beyond Good and Evil 2 will survive World War 3," quipped Travguard. "But it still won't be out by the armistice," added meathappening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One fan, 33Sharpies, pointed to the likely financial implications of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 ever being canceled, at which point Ubisoft would have to write down the cost of its gargantuan development. While the project is still alive, however, it can still be listed as an ongoing asset. (Insider Gaming has reported that the project has been valued internally as having now cost over $500 million, though that figure is unverified.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Beyond Good and Evil 2 Concept Art</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is believed to have originally begun early development in 2007, with series creator and Rayman mastermind Michel Ancel and his Ubisoft Montpellier team on board. Over the coming decade, development was mostly paused while Montpellier worked on other projects, but Ubisoft re-announced the game with fanfare in 2017 and showed off an in-engine concept featuring space flight and designs to feature multiple solar systems and planets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, however, development struggled — and the project was further impacted by Ancel's departure from Ubisoft and the sad death of its subsequent creative lead Emil Morel. But the last couple of years have seen work coalesce once more, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-has-a-new-narrative-link-to-beyond-good-evil-2">the sequel's characters given intriguing cameos in the new Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</a>, while a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beyond-good-and-evil-2-gets-new-creative-director">new creative director</a> — former DICE and King veteran Fawzi Mesmar — has come on board to steady the ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 still lacks any word of a release date — and may well have been one of the titles Ubisoft delayed to receive further polish yesterday. As of now, however, it remains alive — however improbable that may seem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

"This patch is deploying some important updates to suppressed weapons, allowing Helldivers to eliminate threats with reduced detection and tighter tactical control.

Use it wisely, Helldivers!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead suggests Commando missions — which send you "deep behind enemy lines where the normal reliance on air superiority is no longer an option" — are a good place to start with these new tools, teasing "reinforcements have to be deployed in advance and destroyer support is a risky business with limited time."
