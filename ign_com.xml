            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-one-photo-on-linkedin-has-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-fans-excited<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 real-time strategy series Dawn of War has been dormant ever since Relic Entertainment ended support for its failed 2017 effort, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii">Dawn of War 3</a>. Still, the first two games remain much-loved by fans, who have wondered ever since whether a Dawn of War 4 or maybe even remakes of either Dawn of War 1 or 2 might be in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, after a single photo was published to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominik-dolenec-57153146_emonacapital-activity-7302358433092030464-x6t8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAJnrdMBkTuB_VYNNnFKqq9kwmzjliqcGN0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, Dawn of War fans have hope that something new in the series is finally on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let‚Äôs start with Relic Entertainment itself, which recently gained independence from prior owner Sega via investment from Emona Capital. Emona managing partner Dominik Dolenec published a selfie to LinkedIn showing him standing outside Games Workshop‚Äôs Nottingham headquarters and the mecca that is Warhammer World. Yes, that‚Äôs a statue of a Space Marine in the background. It‚Äôs awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The foreground is more interesting, however. Dolenec is wearing a Relic Entertainment T-shirt for his trip to Games Workshop, and so it can be reasonably assumed that he‚Äôs in town representing the developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúGreat visit to Games Workshop PLC in Nottingham,‚Äù Dolenec said. ‚ÄúMany thanks to Owen Rees for sharing the Warhammer magic with us! Looking forward to deepening our partnership in years to come. üí™üéÆ‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Owen Rees is Group Head of Licensing at Games Workshop. He‚Äôs worked on a number of Warhammer video games, and leads the licensing of video games and consumer products for all Warhammer products. It‚Äôs also worth noting those emojis at the end of Dolenec‚Äôs comment. This very much reads like a video game business meeting.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can imagine the speculation. Dawn of War 4 is top of the wishlist, it seems, but perhaps remakes of Dawn of War 1 and / or 2 are on the cards instead. Let‚Äôs be optimistic and suggest a brand new game and remakes are all in the works. Why not?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here‚Äôs what we know: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game">Games Workshop is on the hunt for the next big Warhammer video game hit</a> after the hugely successful, 5 million-selling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> changed everything for developer Saber Interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, reporting results for the first half of its financial year ending December 1, 2024, Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree hailed the success of Space Marine 2, which contributed significant royalty revenue to the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, licensing revenue from royalty income increased in the period by a whopping ¬£18 million (approx. $21.9 million) to ¬£30.1 million (approx. $36.7 million). Earned income, which is the key figure here, was ¬£26.1 million (approx. $31.8 million), up from ¬£5.9 million (approx. $7.2 million), an increase Games Workshop said was mainly from Space Marine 2. 98% of Games Workshop‚Äôs total licensing revenue came from PC and console games (Space Marine 2 launched on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A win all round, then, but Rountree also expressed a degree of caution on potential future video game success, admitting hits like Space Marine 2 are few and far between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here‚Äôs the statement:</p><blockquote>During the period, our licensing partners launched two new video games; Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, a third person shooter for PC and console and Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, a combat racing game. Established games continue to contribute, alongside royalty income earned following the success of Space Marine 2. We recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, where could this big Warhammer video game hit come from? It seems inevitable that Saber Interactive will get the chance to continue the Space Marine story with Space Marine 3, and indeed has said it has ideas for a third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 has never been bigger. Amazon‚Äôs Space Marine 2 animation, released as part of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/secret-level">Secret Level</a> anthology series, went down well with fans. And there‚Äôs huge excitement about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years">the Henry Cavill-fronted Warhammer 40,000 projects in the works for Amazon</a>, although they're years away. Creative Assembly is reportedly working on a Warhammer 40,000 Total War game (finally!), although it is apparently years away. Could a revival of Dawn of War scratch that strategy itch in the meantime?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
