            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A higher threadcount, you might say.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been lots of excitement over the presence of a Hollow Knight: Silksong game demo on the show floor at Gamescom this year, in both the Xbox and Nintendo booths. And by all accounts, the demo seems pretty great. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-we-played-it-gamescom-2025">own previewer said</a> it's "a piece of playable art that is as fun to wield as it is to watch." But some Silksong superfans hoping for new story, new bosses, or new content to reveal themselves in this demo might be a little disappointed, because the Gamescom demo is the same demo from six years ago at E3 2019. But shinier.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We first noticed this when reading through our previews of the demo from today alongside our preview from 2019. It's more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/21/hollow-knight-silksong-feels-wildly-different-and-incredibly-familiar-e3-2019">discernable when looking at 2019's video footage</a>, but both demos cover the same two areas - the early game Moss Grotto, and the later Deep Docks. They cover the same encounters and bosses as well. We've been able to comb over some other footage posted by other individuals from Gamescom and yup, looks like an updated version of the same demo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, that's not necessarily a bad thing. If anything, it shows how far the game has come in six years. Looking at similar clips from both demos, and there are very clear signs of polish. Lighting and backgrounds have been adjusted, platforms have been moved around slightly. Fans have even spotted the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1mvp03b/a_piece_of_dialogue_between_hornet_and_lace_was/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teensiest, tiniest dialogue change</a> between the two demos. It's also not surprising that neither area has undergone massive content changes in six years. If these two levels were ready for prime time in 2019, they were likely the closest to "done" at the time that Team Cherry had ready, and thus wouldn't need developers to spend years tweaking them infinitely. And for what it's worth, this is also the first time we've seen the game on both an Xbox Series console, and the Nintendo Switch 2, as the E3 2019 demo was only on Nintendo Switch 1.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The only real disappointment to be had here is that we're not actually seeing any new content after such a long wait - no new bosses or enemies or characters or stories. So anyone looking to scour this new demo for clues as to what Silksong will be when it finally releases is probably not going to come up with much that we don't already know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, that probably won't be necessary either. Team Cherry has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-teases-special-announcement-later-this-week">announced an announcement</a> of some sort for tomorrow, and after a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-boy-geoff-keighley-is-teasing-hollow-knight-silksong-for-gamescom-opening-night-live">rash</a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-shows-up-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-with-almost-30-seconds-of-new-gameplay-as-a-treat">teases</a> around Gamescom and the demo finally re-emerging after a six year cocoon, it seems likely that a release date is imminent. (Silk)soon, we won't need to scour tidbits of footage for a crumb of new Silksong info. We'll just be able to, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-the-story-behind-the-insanely-long-wait-clown-meme">finally, play the long-anticipated </a>sequel to Hollow Knight for ourselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Halloween was revealed at the Future Games Show during gamescom 2025 with a debut trailer and a raft of game details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IllFonic, the asymmetrical horror specialist behind the likes of Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game, Friday the 13th: The Game, and Predator Hunting Grounds, is developing Halloween and will handle publishing with Gun Media. It’s based on the iconic 1978 movie, and is due out at some point in 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike IllFonic’s previous horror games, Halloween has a single-player mode. John Carpenter was involved, as was Compass International Pictures, which produced the original film.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Step into the chilling world of John Carpenter’s genre-defining film, now transformed into a suspenseful one-versus-many stealth horror experience. Put on the iconic mask to become the ultimate slasher, Michael Myers, stalking and executing the citizens of Haddonfield one by one, or striving to thwart Michael Myers’ plans as Civilians determined to save the unaware townsfolk before it’s too late. </blockquote><blockquote>Stick to the shadows as Civilians, seeking out Haddonfield residents to warn them and searching for a way to contact the authorities. As Michael Myers, give them a reason to fear the dark and cut the phone lines to prevent the police from ruining his favorite holiday. Whether playing solo in story mode, against bots offline, or facing others in online multiplayer, each mode rewards stealth, strategy, and skillful play.</blockquote><blockquote>Staying true to the original film, IllFonic masterfully recreates the eerie atmosphere of Haddonfield across multiple maps and authentic locations. With a haunting ambience and score inspired by the legendary movie, Halloween brings the terror home in a new experience that will keep both old and new generations looking over their shoulders.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of the announcement, IGN had the chance to interview Chief Creative Officer Jared Gerritzen and Design Director Jordan Mathewson to find out everything you need to know about Halloween.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: People know IllFonic for their multiplayer horror games. Why was having a single-player mode for Halloween important for you?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jared Gerritzen:</strong> It's definitely because of the games that we've done. This is our fifth runaround with a multiplayer only game. But in the past, in my previous jobs, anytime that a multiplayer-only game gets released, especially if it has a very strong fan base — it is just a fact that some people don't play multiplayer games. And we've learned that in the past. In Ghostbusters we added the ability to play by yourself and better AI. Hardcore Ghostbusters fans were able to come in and play the game and get a great experience, and then they got the skills, and then they saw that multiplayer button and then they came in. And it's really cool because I now know people that were like, I came in for Ghostbusters, but now I'm a multiplayer fan, and now I'm playing multiplayer games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because I do think that in this day and age we are getting these massively cool and exciting IPs, but if there isn't a multiplayer experience and if there isn't a single-player experience, I do think that people don't get those itches scratched. And so year after year, each one of our IllFonic games, it's an iterative process where we look at the last project and we try to do better. And so with this, it was very important, especially with it being Halloween, that we brought in an experience for people that don't play hardcore multiplayer games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asymmetrical multiplayer games can be a little bit more hardcore too. And the stress of being the killer versus a bunch of bullies can be pretty daunting. And so we really wanted to make a way that people can play a single-player game, get a bit of a story, get deeper into the universe. And so it was very, very important. And that's why we've not only ramped up our development team, really put in some major effort on getting some really awesome AI engineers, but also bringing on Pollard to help out with their skills and their abilities. So I think it's going to be a really cool experience just to have that total package finally of a popular IP.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halloween Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How will the single-player mode actually work? You mentioned story. How extensive will that be?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jared Gerritzen:</strong> Well, so we can't really talk that much about that because that's definitely a different phase. But we are working with John. We are working with Malek [Akkad, President of Compass International Pictures]. We've got some really great writers that we're working with to bring this world to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will crisscross the film a lot. When we take an IP, we really, really have to be a fan of it. We turn down IPs more than we chase IPs. We know this film like the back of our hands. And so there's a lot of things that I think that if you have never seen the film, you'll get this great experience, but if you have seen the film, you'll see those really cool moments that you've seen for decades. If you're a fan that just knows who Michael Myers is and you've seen a couple of the newer films, that'll be cool. But I think that it'll be fun for people to be able to really connect to the OG film.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You’ve decided to focus on the original film. Why was that important for you, and how involved has John Carpenter been in the process?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jared Gerritzen:</strong> Listen, I have definitely said we need to make sure John's happy multiple times! John Carpenter's put out genuinely some of my favorite films, like my top five films. He's put out such amazing films that just us getting to work with him, like with Predator or being able to work with Dan Aykroyd and Ivan Reitman with Ghostbusters, we're used to that. We're used to people like, this is their baby, this is their thing. We're playing in their sandbox. But I do genuinely feel that we leave making some really cool stuff that they're very happy about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Malek, this is his birthright. His father was the one that produced this. He has been working on and with Halloween since he was a child. And so him and John are really the arbiters where when we come up with a crazy idea, we have to come and present it and we have to explain it and most likely give them a couple of days to unpack it, and then come back and get more of those questions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the way that I see it is, by working with those guys and proving to those guys what we're doing is right, I think that that should mean that anyone who's a fan should also be happy with what we're doing. Because with a video game, we have to add systems, we have to add gameplay, we have to make sense of a scene that in the film you're like, okay, that's a cool scene. But in the game, you don't cut the camera, you don't have a way to just go like, okay, other location cut. We're trying to explain these things, and I genuinely feel some of the systems that we're going to talk about when we start going more heavy with the gameplay, I think that people will definitely go like, oh wow, that explains some major components in the franchise. And when we've presented it, people have been very happy with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And honestly, something that we'll talk about in the future, I'm extremely happy we figured it out, because it’s changed the way that you look at Michael Myers. It's been very cool. It's always stressful coming and saying, ‘Hey, here's this wild idea.’ Honestly, the way that they see us is as a bunch of kids. 1978, I was two. Jordan was still floating around. I'm the person that says, ‘Okay, in the seventies we did this, phones had cables connected to the wall.’ And so it has been one of those really weird things where by choosing that era, it's so far away, and technology has gone so far, that it's like playing — I don't want to say it's as bad as a Red Dead — but it's definitely like playing something that a lot of kids won't understand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jordan Mathewson:</strong> It is the purest form of Halloween. It is the starting of that entire concept, and it's been wonderful not only to go towards that period piece mentality of making a unique seventies American town that we see in the movie itself. And the reason it resonates and kind of clicks into that horrific element is it’s such a calm and normal, unassuming town that you wouldn't expect there to be this mass killer on the loose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it gave us a really good, grounded foundation to lay down everything that we wanted to in the play space on top of it being in that era. It gives us just a lot of good things to work off of that keep it very focused into what Halloween is as a whole. It's been really fun going down that path and focusing on that movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You can’t just make a phone call outside to help save you! Were there any moments during development when you had to explain to younger staff how things worked back then?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jordan Mathewson:</strong> One that's pretty tame is getting ahold of the police back then. We have 911 now, which is the understanding of how you get ahold of emergency, but it's not quite the same back then. It wasn't developed like that. So we have to do a lot of technological understanding syncs to make sure everyone is very well aware of what existed back then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do some research just how that technology would flow into the Illinois section of the country. The idea of landlines, phone cords, that kind of thing. The way that you dial, it's not always buttons, sometimes it's the rotary. So it's very much a fun conversation, and we're always exploring back and forth the different things. And then from there it's like, how do we make this a gameplay mechanic? Because that can be fun if we're thinking about trying to set it in place and not making it a hassle and actually making it a mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Does Halloween have a canon? Does that factor into what you’re doing? Do you have to obey any rules?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jared Gerritzen:</strong> Yeah! There's a lot of rules that are set that we don't talk about, that have been there since the beginning. But there's a lot of elements where we really try to use the film as the canon. We're pulling from as many frames as we can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's definitely contention points and caveat points that we have to go like, well, the gameplay. So it's not one-to-one, but it's pretty much like, these are elements, these are the factors that we have to pull in. But really it is about Michael's Halloween night, like him going out. You're not stalking Laurie in the day, and you're not doing boring stuff. You're going to that, okay, this is what he was doing when it wasn't about him. And so those are the big things that we're really trying to push.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's very difficult, but we have done this a lot in the past. And honestly, the great part is when we have to push out that wall and break out of the box.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/20/portrait-myers-1755687588920.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Have you had any fun situations where someone has had to point out that it would actually be like this at this point? Who are the custodians of the Halloween lore?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jared Gerritzen:</strong> Yeah! Malek and Ryan [Freimann, Trancas Films] are absolutely… they've been very diligent. They've been really great, and it's added the authenticity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mask is probably the best. We had to capture the mask in the highest possible fidelity. Looking at original molds, looking at original masks, they're degraded. It's not like someone put it in and made it exactly the same, but the turnaround on making just Mike's mask has been, I mean, that’s probably the greatest thing to go like, okay, where did you guys spend a lot of effort? And that was the key thing, because when you get the screenshots of the renders… there's been a lot of Michael Myers' out there and a lot of other games, and they've been made by top top artists, but it was part of like, okay, we're doing all of these other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We put a laser beam on that mask, and every wrinkle, every crack, finding out exactly how it happened, talking to them like, ‘Hey, in this shot, it's like this and this shot, it's like that.’ And it's like, well, yeah, because he took the mask off in between and when he pulled it down, it kind of folded a little bit differently or the hair's a little bit different. So that's been the thing that we've really kind of cut our teeth with them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like I said, we're in their sandbox so we have to adhere to it, but they've been very understanding and very flexible for what we need to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
