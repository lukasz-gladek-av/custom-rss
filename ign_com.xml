            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-the-first-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a space as crowded as the soulslike genre, it can be difficult to stand out, but after two hours with the uber-difficult Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, it seems the folks at Leenzee Games may be onto something. Taking place in a magical reimagining of dynastic China, you play a pirate warrior who has some serious moves, making use of intricate and deadly spells, an arsenal of weapons with potent movesets, and an upgrade tree that’s much more involved than your typical action-adventure game. This makes for an adventure where, more often than not, I felt like the scary badass the rest of the world should be afraid of, rather than the other way around. Of course, the upper limit on just how much I could make myself feel like an overpowered Dynasty Warriors character was my own skill level and understanding of Wuchang’s extremely complex systems, which I could only dive so deep with during my limited demo. But what I’ve seen so far has me quite optimistic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main way Wuchang: Fallen Feathers seems to differentiate itself from its peers is that here, instead of a few basic sword moves, a handful of meager spells and abilities, and a tiny health bar, you’re given a pretty extensive toolkit of formidable tools to play with. Each weapon allows you to unleash unique flurries of attacks that send you soaring into the air, darting across the map, and performing insane feats of dexterity that are far beyond what’s possible in most soulslikes. It got to the point where I felt like the area boss stomping my enemies flat, rather than a scared, cautious adventurer facing incredible odds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That feeling of superiority might have something to do with how those abilities are acquired: by harvesting them from fallen enemies. That’s right! Every defeated foe is more than just a handful of upgrade materials. You actually get to learn their moves and put them to use against future opponents, eventually turning you into a deadly reflection of everyone you’ve bested in battle, and in my time with it I already began to feel like a power-stealing badass in short order. And this was just the opening areas of the adventure too – I can only imagine how wild things get later on when you’re squaring off against more powerful opponents and presumably unlocking even more insane abilities.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I can only imagine how wild things get later on when you’re squaring off against more powerful opponents and presumably unlocking even more insane abilities.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t get me wrong: there were still plenty of instances where my eagerness or lack of awareness got me absolutely smashed to pieces, but I also felt like I had way more options for cutting the enemy down to size. For example, one move I was given while wielding a giant ax let me leap straight into the air to ludicrous anime-level heights, then smash down on my opponent, stomping them flat and leaving a minion-shaped impression in the earth. Another weapon, fast moving dual blades, gave me the ability to fire off a bunch of small, sticky explosives every time I dodged, which then exploded doing a small amount of damage, but more importantly, interrupting enemy movement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These abilities and weapon combos, combined with spells that let me do things like fire off a deadly disc of fire, allowed me to play much more aggressively than I’m accustomed to, and it’s clear there’s just a whole lot more to learn with Wuchang in general. I didn’t have nearly enough time to fully wrap my mind around the various skill trees, ability customization options that let me alter how my weapons functioned, and spellcasting system, but it’s clear this borrows quite a bit from RPGs and will need to be thought through if you want to max out your levels of badassery. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That will be pretty helpful to do too, because of the two bosses I took on in Wuchang, one of them was extremely aggressive and equally beefed up with fancy movesets. It took me quite a few tries to learn her quick, convoluted attack patterns, and master the timing for parrying her attacks, especially in the second half of the fight when each swipe of her blade sent out massive gusts of wind that knocked my on my butt and did way more damage than I thought the wind was capable of. Eventually, though, I stood triumphant against her devilish tricks. Rather than a feeble goon hopelessly outmatched by an enemy clearly above my power level, Wuchang’s boss fights made me feel a lot more like a peer locked in a duel with strong weapons and destructive abilities to see who was more worthy of success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s one part I didn’t get a completely strong read on, it’s Wuchang’s story, which centers on a disease spreading throughout the lands that drives people mad and makes them sprout feathers. I didn’t see enough to say whether or not this is likely to go the distance, but I will say I’ve lost count of the number of soulslikes in the past few years that have leaned on that incredibly tired trope. I get that having a disease that turns people into monsters offers a pretty easy reason to make everything in the world want to kill you, which is very helpful in this kind of game, but man am I ever tired of seeing it. I’d really like to see Wuchang break free from some of the story cliches in the same way it seems to be switching things up when it comes to combat style.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I get that having a disease that turns people into monsters offers a pretty easy reason to make everything in the world want to kill you, which is very helpful in this kind of game, but man am I ever tired of seeing it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also worth noting just how visually impressive Wuchang is, which is by no means the norm for the genre. Even if I was dying half a dozen times to the same boss or lost among a sea of disgusting, mutated enemies, I was at least able to content myself with how downright gorgeous everything looked, ruined and deeply troubling as the world was. That said, I did notice somewhat long load times after each humiliating defeat that respawned me back at a checkpoint, and I have to wonder how much of that hang time is owed to the world and characters looking so dang good. In fairness, there’s very little chance this thing’s been optimized enough to be representative of the final product, but since I was playing on a PC that seemed fairly powerful, it’s definitely something I’m going to want to keep an eye on as I check out future builds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With only a short exploration area and two boss fights to contend with, I only caught a small glimpse at Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, but I already feel pretty good about its chances at being more than just another soulslike to add to the ridiculously overflowing pile. The movesets are intricate and interesting, the RPG mechanics seem deep and offer a lot of freedom (even if I can’t claim to understand some of them fully), and the boss fights gave me a serious run for my money that’s rare these days. All that’s already got me pretty excited to play more.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Across Twitter/X, Bluesky, Reddit, and other social platforms, Tomodachi Life lovers are having the time of their lives, and making the memes to prove it. Here's just a small sample of the many, many, MANY celebrations to make your day:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">TOMODACHI LIFE SEQUEL ARE YOU KIDDING ME <a href="https://t.co/Zj6wFyRfxo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Zj6wFyRfxo</a></p>— Wind Waker Switch 2 Daily (@WindWakerDaily) <a href="https://twitter.com/WindWakerDaily/status/1905267552869060671?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I hope whoever made the Tomodachi Life summoning circle is living their best life right now <a href="https://t.co/9sCHgADL0o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/9sCHgADL0o</a></p>— sephi (@SephiGoat) <a href="https://twitter.com/SephiGoat/status/1905269369719914837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Even better are some of the Reddit threads posted <em>before</em> the Direct, suggesting it was foolish to hope for a new Tomodachi Life, and now filled with replies joyfully eating crow about it:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">it’s time <a href="https://t.co/fBlRKW31zG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/fBlRKW31zG</a> <a href="https://t.co/aD0lfOzl47" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aD0lfOzl47</a></p>— M1das (@M1das_OW2) <a href="https://twitter.com/M1das_OW2/status/1904940990718501256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations as well to this very, very specific Twitter account that's been keeping the fires burning for Tomodachi Life for years now:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">OH MY FUCKING GOD</p>— Number of days without Tomodachi Life 2 (@Tomodachi2count) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tomodachi2count/status/1905274570711478758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">One segment of the community is especially excited by what they see as a tease of a long-awaited feature in Tomodachi Life: same-sex relationships. Way, way back in 2014, Nintendo issued a formal apology to fans of the game for not including same-sex relationships, saying that it was "not possible" to change the game's design so drastically after launch by implementing them in a patch. However, Nintendo also said, "We pledge that if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream's trailer today, there was a brief encounter between two women that some fans are interpreting as a tease that Nintendo is about to fulfill its promise to fans.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>“We apologize for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in Tomodachi Life. if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series…design a game-play experience …that is more inclusive…”</p><p>Then does that team these two are hinting at,,,y’know😳 <a href="https://t.co/FZP35A1ids" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/FZP35A1ids</a></p></div>— Senpai (@_CSenpai_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_CSenpai_/status/1905271126202216575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">NINTENDO ARE THEY GAY????

With its dedicated and autonomous leadership team, it will focus on transforming these three brands into unique ecosystems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are committed to building a sharper, more focused organization-one where talented teams will take our brands to the next level, accelerate the growth of emerging franchises, and lead innovation in next generation technologies and services, all with the goal of delivering enriching, memorable games that exceed players' expectations, and create superior value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what does the deal mean in reality? This new subsidiary includes the teams developing the Rainbow Six, Assassin’s Creed, and Far Cry franchises based in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia, as well as Ubisoft’s back-catalog and any new games currently under development or to be developed. So, it sounds like existing projects are safe, and there is no word yet on more layoffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The transaction is expected to complete by the end of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Developing...</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/patapon-12-replay-brings-classic-playstation-games-to-pc-and-nintendo-switch-this-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cult-classic rhythm strategy bundle <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/patapon-1-2-replay">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a> is bringing two beloved PSP games to PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5 (PS5) July 11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two-pack remaster was revealed during today’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OqoRxXUjGA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 2025 Nintendo Direct</a> alongside gameplay and its summer launch plan. It’s a move that finally allows two hidden-gem PlayStation games from the mid-2000s to stomp onto non-PlayStation platforms for the first time while updating them for PS5 players, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Having lived in the desolate frontier for years, the Patapon tribe was driven from their home by the Zigoton army,” an official description from new publisher Bandai Namco said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This drove them to become fierce warrior spirits that can only be commanded by the beat of the war drum, played by the Mighty One (the player). Their wait has finally come to an end as the drums of war are heard once again by the Almighty’s return to guide the Patapon tribe through their adventures to fight against challenging enemies and return them to their homeland.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Patapon 1+2 Replay seems to come with a few upgrades not seen in the 2017 PS4 remasters. Bandai Namco specifically lists upgraded graphics as one of the more noticeable additions, though returning Almighty will also notice added Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulty modes, as well as timing adjustment and constant command display options. While Patapon 1+2 Replay aims to bring the classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/patapon">2007</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/patapon-2">2008</a> titles to players better than ever, there’s no sign of the PSP’s 2011 title, Patapon 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patapon may not be one of PlayStation’s more recognizable franchises, but it’s still a name that has been associated with the brand for nearly 20 years. It’s unclear why or how it’s leaping other platforms now or if the series will continue to blossom with any new entries in the future. There’s also been no mention of a potential Xbox version, so it’s best to expect Patapon 1+2 Replay on PC, Switch, and PS5 to be where things end for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on today’s news, you can catch up with everything else revealed during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/everybodys-golf-hot-shots-tees-off-a-new-entry-with-a-new-developer-later-this-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's got both serious and wacky golf.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Golfers will have good reason to get back on the green this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/everybodys-golf-hot-shots">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a> adds another entry to the long-running golf series for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This particular franchise has historically gone by two names. While called Everybody's Golf in many regions, the series was Hot Shots Golf in North America for a while, until 2017's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/everybodys-golf">Everybody's Golf</a> reunited the franchise name. This latest entry, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, looks to mark as much by combining the two names into one unified, new entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's an interesting twist in the details, though. Digimon Survive studio HYDE is making this, under the Bandai Namco umbrella, in a partnership with Sony Interactive Entertainment. Traditionally, this has been a Sony-published series, and developer Clap Hanz was working on the series. Clap Haz released its own self-titled game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-20-years-making-playstation-golf-games-clap-hanz-wants-a-new-challenge">Clap Hanz Golf</a>, back in 2021.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it looks like you can expect the usual blend of classic golf and some of the wackier options. Characters have their expressive celebrations, and several game modes offer strange, surprising mix-ups to your usual round of golf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will also be local couch co-op and online multiplayer, which is good news for those who, like me, grew up passing a controller around playing Hot Shots Golf. The announcement debuted during today's Nintendo Switch Direct, and I could see Everybody's Golf Hot Shots working pretty well as a couch co-op Switch game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No date's been set yet, but Everybody's Golf Hot Shots will be heading to PS5, Switch, and PC sometime this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">head over to our recap of today's Nintendo Direct for March 2025</a> if you're looking for other announcements. Alongside some new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-reveals-samus-new-psychic-abilities-on-the-planet-viewros">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> footage and several remasters and sequels, we also got to see a new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-card-update-ahead-of-switch-2-launch">Virtual Game Card feature</a> that's coming to Nintendo's handheld ahead of the Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
