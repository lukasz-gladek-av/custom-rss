And, thanks to tariffs, these now cost slightly more at launch than Nintendo originally announced.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has previously faced criticism for not including Switch 2 Welcome Tour with the console itself. An experience designed as an introduction to Nintendo's new hardware and essentially act as an interactive instruction manual, Welcome Tour would have been a perfect fit to be packed-in with the console — just as Wii Sports was with the Wii.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-backlash-against-10-nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-heats-up-reggie-fils-aim-tweets-the-story-of-wii-sports-pack-in-from-ign-interview-and-everyone-knows-the-point-hes-trying-to-make">Even former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé has got stuck into the debate</a>, highlighting the Wii Sports situation from his tenure in charge. At the time, Fils-Aimé disagreed with Nintendo's Japanese bosses who said Wii Sports should have been sold separately (as it still was in Japan). But Fils-Aimé got his way for the U.S. and European markets, and Wii Sports went on to become one of the most successful games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Everyone has to decide if it's worth their $10 to learn about the Switch 2 cartridge slot and watch an HDR fireworks display, and the whole conversation surrounding Welcome Tour has suffered because of Nintendo's irritating decision to charge for it," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-so-is-it-worth-10">IGN wrote earlier this week</a>. It'll be interesting to see whether the added costs further impact customer purchases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, IGN reported on the issue of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-screen-punctures-ruin-launch-day-for-fans-due-to-store-receipts-stapled-into-consoles-box">damaged Switch 2 consoles due to retailers puncturing the console's thin boxes with staples</a>. If you're buying a console (with or without Welcome Tour), it's something to be aware of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Ubisoft gave its Call of duty rival just four months before confirming it would discontinue support. <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Almost half the team lost their jobs</u></a> as Ubisoft made a swath of cuts across its San Francisco and Osaka studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Producer Mark Rubin, who led development fo the game having previously worked on the Call of Duty series at Activision, called it a "sad day" in a lengthy statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1930403826378649786" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter</u></a> earlier today. After thanking his co-workers for making a "really fun and terrific game," he announced he's decided to "leave the industry" for good.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In case everyone doesn’t know, the team behind XDefiant was all let go at the end of last year and I know many people have moved on to other studios, which is great, and I hope that for all of those still looking, that they find something quickly," Rubin wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As for me, I’ve decided to leave the industry and spend more time with my family so unfortunately you won’t be hearing about me making another game. I do care passionately about the shooter space and hope that someone else can pick up the flag that I was trying to carry and make games again that care about the players, treat them with respect and listen to what they have to say."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rubin said the team made "remarkable" progress despite "very little marketing," claiming that despite a lack of advertising, XDefiant "still had the fastest acquisition of players in the first few weeks for a Ubisoft title" just from word-of-mouth promotion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But unfortunately, with little to no marketing, especially after launch, we weren’t acquiring new players after the initial launch," he added, before claiming Ubisoft's in-house game engine "wasn't designed for what [XDefiant] was doing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had other issues, though, as well that we tried to be transparent about. For one we had crippling tech debt using an engine that wasn’t designed for what we were doing, and we didn’t have the engineering resources to ever correct that. I do personally think that in-house engines are not the valuable investment that they used to be, and they are often doomed to fall behind big engines like Unreal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This tech debt included the dreaded netcode issues that we could just not solve given the architecture we were dealing with," he added. "And so, for many players with solid network connections (in both speed and consistent reliability) the game played well but if your connection had even the smallest amount of inconsistency the engine just couldn’t handle it and you would have a bad experience. Normally, you should be able to weather those bad moments on your network. But this was a major issue with XDefiant."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">XDefiant Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rubin also lamented the lack of resources to make content. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Another issue we had was having the right resources to make content for the game. What we saw at Season 3 wasn’t even enough content in my mind for launch. There were some really cool features coming later in Season 4 or even 5 that would have completed the game in a way that I felt it should have been for launch. I can say everyone’s (devs, HQ leadership, etc.) heart was in the right place, but we just didn’t have the gas to go the distance for a free-to-play game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-dev-says-we-have-done-very-little-marketing-so-yes-our-numbers-are-down-denies-support-could-end-after-season-4-if-player-count-doesnt-improve"><u>Ubisoft insisted it wasn't shutting XDefiant down</u></a>, then announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled"><u>shutting XDefiant down just a few weeks later</u></a>.
