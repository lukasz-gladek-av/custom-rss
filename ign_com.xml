            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering just had its most financially successful year yet, Hasbro has announced. And it's largely thanks to its collaborations with other brands, via its Universes Beyond and Secret Lair releases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its earnings call today, Hasbro revealed that MTG revenue was up 59% year-over-year, in no small part thanks to the Avatar: The Last Airbender set last year, which is now the third highest-selling set in Magic history after Final Fantasy and Lord of the Rings. Other Universes Beyond sets, as well as Secret Lair, also had a hand in the success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That 59% is a huge increase, and one that is responsible for Hasbro's overall numbers looking good. The company overall was up 14% year-over-year, almost entirely driven by 45% growth in the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment (Monopoly Go! also helped a little). Its other segments, Consumer Products and Entertainment, both saw declines of 4% each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The revenue-raising capabilities of Universes Beyond and Secret Lair are a helpful look for Hasbro's C-suite, which has found itself the target of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lawsuit-claims-hasbro-misled-investors-regarding-sales-of-controversial-magic-the-gathering-anniversary-set">shareholder lawsuit on the very subject recently</a>. The lawsuit alleges that Hasbro has mismanaged Magic: The Gathering by overprinting sets of cards, specifically Universes Beyond and Secret Lair, thereby devaluing existing cards. The complaint itself contains some pretty sharp accusations that the company's top brass have been holding such sets in reserve to deploy whenever the rest of the company is struggling.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Avatar: The Last Airbender x Magic: The Gathering - Tea Time at the Jasmine Dragon Scene Box</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Hasbro has stated that such claims have "no merit," and has recently moved to dismiss a similar lawsuit with very similar accusations filed in 2024 by the West Palm Beach Firefighters' Pension Fund and City of Miami General Employees &amp; Sanitation Employees' Retirement Trust, on the basis that the complaint has been amended so significantly since it was originally filed that it is no longer related to the original issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro reached out to share the following updated statement on these lawsuits as pertains to its earnings today:</p><blockquote>As we shared when you covered the matter in January, these claims have no merit. Our strategic plan for Magic was implemented, and the results underscore the strength of that strategy. As further reflected in our earnings results released this morning, Magic: The Gathering just completed its most successful year ever.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering's next set will be a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-next-precon-deck-is-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-themed-and-its-already-discounted-just-a-few-weeks-from-launch">Universes Beyond set for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, complete with commander deck, and will release on March 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It’s already made back the cost of its roughly seven-year development, blew past internal sales expectations, and is currently approaching the highest peak concurrent player count of Isaac itself – and it only launched today at 6am PT.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So far this is beating expectations by quite a lot,” developer Tyler Glaiel tells IGN, saying it likely took less than three hours for development costs to be fully recouped. “Its a bigger launch than any of the Isaac expansions already, and its only been a few hours.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His partner Edmund McMillen, best known for games like Isaac and Super Meat Boy, put just how wide of a gap that is into a perspective: “I think the highest sales day for any game of mine, release-wise, was [The Binding of Isaac:] Rebirth, and it sold 40,000 units I think day one.” By comparison, McMillen says Mewgenics sold around 152,000 copies in its first five-and-a-half hours. “Isn't that kind of insane?”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewgenics is also sitting at more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/686060/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>63,000 concurrent players</u></a> on Steam at time of writing, creeping steadily towards Rebirth’s all-time peak of 70,701. “We knew the game was good and would do good,” Glaiel says, “but Isaac is *HUGE* so we thought it was unlikely to beat that.” There are also almost 85k people watching it on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/mewgenics" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Twitch</u></a> – one of which is McMillen himself, who says he’s enjoying watching <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/northernlion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Northernlion</u></a> be so immediately good at it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The critical reception for Mewgenics has been glowing as well, currently sitting at an 89 on sites like <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mewgenics/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Metacritic</u></a> and 96% positive user reviews on Steam (with roughly 1,700 in at the moment). IGN’s own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-review"><u>Mewgenics review</u></a> gave it a 9/10, saying it’s “a fantastic tactical RPG that's good for more than a hundred hours of roguelike runs. Just when you think you have it figured out it'll throw something completely unexpected and hilariously gross at you – and probably a catchy new original song, too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Associate Reviews Director.
