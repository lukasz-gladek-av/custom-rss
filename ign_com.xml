            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A former veteran Bethesda developer has said the studio may end up with “hateful comments” even if <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> ends up just being as good as Skyrim, which he considers to be one of the top 10 games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2026/01/nate-purkeypile-world-builder-skyrim-fallout-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esports Insider</a>, former Bethesda lead artist Nate Purkeypile, who worked at Bethesda Game Studios from 2007 before leaving in 2021, agreed with the assertion that the development teams behind The Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout are in a “no-win situation” because of the expectation fans have placed upon both games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes, and that definitely factored into me leaving because Skyrim being one of the top 10 games of all-time, how do you beat that?” Purkeypile, who founded solo indie dev Just Purkey Games after leaving Bethesda, replied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If they do, great! And I hope it’s a great game, but even if it’s just as good as Skyrim was, you’ll still get so many people throwing out hateful comments. I’m sure there will be more death threats again. All of that stuff. It’s really unfortunate that that’s the way things have gone.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In January last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement became as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced</u></a>. Skyrim was released on November 11, 2011, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-elder-scrolls-vi-announced-at-bethesda-press-conference"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 was revealed on June 10, 2018</u></a> — 2,403 days afterwards. It is now seven-and-a-half years since the announcement, and we’re no closer, it seems, to the release of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the six-year anniversary of The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement arrived in June 2024, even Bethesda chief Todd <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>Howard paused to say, "oh wow, that has been a while."</u></a> The Elder Scrolls 6 is at least in production, with Bethesda confirming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-officially-in-early-development-but-dont-expect-to-hear-about-it-soon"><u>it had entered "early development" in August 2023</u></a> and "early builds" were available in March 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, amid increasing pressure from fans for some information on the game, Howard said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 wouldn’t be out for some time yet</u></a>. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GQ magazine</u></a> to celebrate the release of Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, Howard said The Elder Scrolls 6 is “still a long way off,” adding: “I’m preaching patience. I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, speaking to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Informer</a>, studio design director Emil Pagliarulo pointed to GTA 6’s high-profile delays as the “smartest thing they could do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What do fans really want?” he asked. “Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn’t meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know? That’s what I think people are going to want. So, we’re going to take our time and as long as it needs to be great.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purkeypile said he assumed Bethesda announced The Elder Scrolls 6 so early because the studio was announcing Starfield at a time when it had already been so long since Skyrim came out, so “we needed to make sure people were not just pissed at us.” He continued: “it’s a very expensive way to do that, though. Those trailers are not cheap.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purkeypile added that Bethesda’s experience with the divisive Starfield shows it’s happy to delay games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would imagine that they will take a while to deliver it because there’s so much pressure behind that title, and I think it’s been proven with Starfield that they’re finally okay, actually delaying stuff,” he said. “That was not really the case early on. On Skyrim, it was like, ‘It’s coming out on 11/11/11’ and we were like, what?! Oh boy, no pressure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think there is less economic pressure to just get Elder Scrolls 6 out on a date, but there is more economic pressure to actually make sure it’s good, and I think that’s a good thing. That’s healthy so long as they’re also honest with the team about that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the GQ article, Howard once again admitted that it had taken too long to get The Elder Scrolls 6 out the door, but did tease a The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered-style shadowdrop — without confirming anything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do like to have a break between them, where it isn’t like a ‘plus one’ sequel,” Howard said of making The Elder Scrolls games again. “I think it’s also good for an audience to have a break — The Elder Scrolls has been too long, let’s be clear. But we wanted to do something new with Starfield. We needed a creative reset.” Bethesda is currently playtesting The Elder Scrolls 6, Howard revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like to just announce stuff and release it,” Howard continued. “My perfect version — and I’m not saying this is going to happen — is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear.” The Oblivion Remastered shadowdrop was “a test run,” Howard teased. “It worked out well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year it was confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-will-feature-a-memorial-character-for-a-much-missed-fan-following-85000-donation-to-make-a-wish"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 will include a character designed in memory of a much-missed fan</u></a> after a remarkable charity campaign that raised more than $85,000 for Make-A-Wish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

It adds the Abyss cosmetic set along with some fixes and balancing changes to the Trigger ‘Nade and Kettle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These key nerfs to the Kettle and Trigger ‘Nade address some of the biggest complaints from Arc Raiders players in recent weeks. On the Kettle, Embark said it had reduced fire rate from 600 to 450. “The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favors using third-party software,” Embark said in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/527616545148373537" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And on the Trigger ‘Nade, Embark admitted it had come to dominate PvP encounters, and “players favour picking it over all our other grenades.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This nerf aims to make it less usable as a “trigger-in-air” grenade, while keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb. Damage falloff has been rebalanced to concentrate the damage closer to the center of the explosion, and deal less damage farther away. The delay between triggering the grenade and it detonating has been increased from 0.7s to 1.5s, giving players more time to react, and making it harder to time the detonation in air.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the update fixes a key card exploit that allows players to keep room keys after using them, and lighting has been lowered in some areas on Stella Montis Night Raid, making flashlights and listening more relevant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Extraction shooter Arc Raiders is one of the biggest games around, selling over 12 million copies since its launch at the end of October. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-keeps-on-going-as-it-tops-124-million-copies-sold-gifts-all-players-a-gilded-pickaxe">Embark just announced a free gift to all players to celebrate</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, we’ve got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-is-like-a-whole-new-world-arc-raiders-players-are-using-aggression-based-matchmaking-to-retire-from-pvp">ongoing coverage of its ‘aggression-based matchmaking,’</a> as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/whoever-has-the-better-pc-wins-arc-raiders-players-second-guess-cheating-allegations-after-discovering-link-between-aim-assist-and-fps">the current debate about aim assist</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arc Raiders update 1.11.0 patch notes:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Kettle<ul data-cy="list"><li>Dev note: Reduced fire rate from 600 to 450.

Resident Evil Requiem's director Koshi Nakanishi has previously suggested this gun will be important — perhaps we'll soon learn more of its signficance, and why it seems to pass from Leon to Grace during the game's events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty more fans want to know, too. How action-y will Leon's sequences feel? Will any other classic characters make an appearance?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> community believes high framerates and aim assist may be to blame for some suspicious gameplay clips after players accused streamer Nick ‘Nickmercs’ Kolcheff of cheating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans took a magnifying glass to the controversial controller accessibility feature after Reddit users took aim at a questionable gameplay video from the streamer last week. The post, which comes in at just 11 seconds long and accrued 2.4K comments on the social media platform, sees Nickmercs using a Renegade rifle (and an Xbox controller) to shoot down two Arc drones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the kind of clip many wouldn’t bat an eye at in passing, but a closer look reveals almost robotic precision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is super sketchy,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q8lli8/comment/nyog0px/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user commented</u></a> shortly after the post was published, “controller does have aim assist on ARC but it’s <em>not</em> like this.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah that’s not aim assist,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q8lli8/comment/nyoj1ey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user added</u></a> at the time. “I mean that’s just blatantly a cheat engine. The way it locks onto a rotor and then he has to move it off the Arc entirely to get it to lock onto the back rotor instead is sus as f**k.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video’s showcase of inhuman, snappy aiming quickly convinced a crowd of users the streamer must be using cheats to boost his performance for his audience. Upon closer inspection, however, it looks like Nickmercs’ may only have Arc Raiders and developer Embark Studios’ built-in aim assist feature to thank.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While no one was able to exactly reproduce the streamer’s mechanical control on console without a cheat tool, PC players had a little more luck. Just hours after fans caught wind of the cheating allegations, Reddit user roartex89 published <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q8qv2l/how_aim_assist_looks_on_controller_on_pc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a video</u></a> showcasing what seemed to be a drastic difference in aim assist sensitivity on PC vs. console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further investigation from users like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q9f78z/arc_raiders_pc_aim_assist_is_tied_to_fps_value/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Razukee</u></a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q9h37k/aim_assist_is_significantly_stronger_with_higher/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>awhaling</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qay5iu/aim_assist_is_broken_and_does_not_work_as_intended/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ttvimShinyatheninja</u></a> seemed to find the culprit behind magnetic aiming wasn’t exactly platform choice but frames per second (FPS) values. PCs able to achieve higher framerates seem to be able to use aim assist to snap between targets with ease, while those on the lower end may see little to no benefit from the feature. So, for example, a popular streamer with a high-end PC reaching as much as 240fps would be able to use aim assist to snap to targets with more ease than a player on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X | S, where Arc Raiders is capped at 60fps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This basically [makes] aim assist pay to win,” ttvimShinyatheninja said in their post. “Whoever has the better PC wins. Everyone else is at a huge disadvantage and this [needs] to get fixed asap.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nickmercs, who went on to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2668063841?t=00h25m54s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>deny the cheating allegations</u></a> during a January 12 livestream, seems to have been let off the hook, as the Arc Raiders community shifts its focus from one potential cheater to a wider discussion about aim assist. Embark is now being looked to for answers, with players taking to the company’s official channels across Reddit, X/Twitter, Discord, and more to ask for clarity or, ideally, a proper fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without comment from the studio, a section of the community questioning whether it's fair for console players to be matched against PC players has emerged. From cheating allegations to general confusion about how and why aim assist works, these fans now want to spread the word that crossplay should be turned off for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Until resolved console players should not be playing with PC players to preserve a fair environment if one side can do something another isn't capable of," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qay5iu/comment/nz6l3l9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user commented</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"PC already have superior inputs with [mouse and keyboard] and now they also have better aim assist?" another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qay5iu/comment/nz6npph/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a>. "Yeah not a chance I'm ticking that crossplay box on Xbox."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The streamer happened to find himself in the crosshairs of a gaming community that had just spent recent weeks pleading for Embark to crack down on what many felt was a cheating epidemic. As nefarious fans took advantage of exploits to illegitimately gain the upper hand on other Raiders, the studio finally stepped in, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters"><u>promising to clean up lobbies as January rolls on</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S on October 30, 2025. It’s steadily marching through its third month in players’ hands, with Embark currently working to address feedback with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-looking-into-balance-updates-for-trigger-nade-stitcher-and-more-after-holiday-delays"><u>updates that should arrive sooner rather than later</u></a>.
