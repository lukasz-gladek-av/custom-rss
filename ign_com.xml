            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-november-patch-notes-detail-spawn-logic-fixes-and-assault-rifle-balance-updates<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">More changes promised to arrive before November 14.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Treyarch and Raven Software have published yet another Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 update, this time targeting a few of the game’s more annoying elements, such as the flashbang screen effect, the Recon Combat Specialty, and the spawn system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The November 4 update is only the developer’s latest patch seeking to iron out the experience. Although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record"><u>players quickly took to this year’s Call of Duty</u></a> when its release date arrived a few weeks back, many have made it clear that there are more than a few kinks left to deal with. Today’s update is one of the beefiest yet, as it tackles common issues and more while promising to provide even more specific fixes in the future.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/wccfcallofdutyblackops63-1724866203623.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Update Address Flashbang and Spawn Complaints</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One tool that players of every skill level can’t seem to stand is the flashbang, which has been called out for the lengthy affect it has on players’ screens. On smaller maps like Nuketown, of which there are a few of in Black Ops 6, the flashbang leaves Operators unable to see their screen for long portions of each match. Post update, players will notice that the duration of the effect has been reduced by 20%. Whether it calms complaints remains to be seen, but it’s clear Treyarch is at least listening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other common talking points the team sought to address with today’s patch include the spawn system and Recon Combat Specialty. The former is often a point of contention in any Call of Duty entry, so it should be nice to hear that spawn logic has been tuned across “several” Multiplayer maps in Black Ops 6.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Our number one goal is to always provide the safest spawn that we can across all maps and game modes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Spawn tuning will be an ongoing process of taking in data, reviewing gameplay and making measured adjustments in the live environment," a developer note says. "Our number one goal is to always provide the safest spawn that we can across all maps and game modes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recon, meanwhile, has left many concerned thanks to its ability to allow players to see through walls for a short time after respawning. The Perk combination bonus has now had its duration reduced from 2 seconds to 1.5, with Treyarch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-nerf-a-perk-so-overpowered-some-call-it-a-wallhack"><u>promising to reduce it even further</u></a> ahead of Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the highlights for those looking for a less frustrating Multiplayer experience, but a number of weapon balance adjustments found their way into the November 4 Black Ops 6 update, too. Assault rifles like the XM4 and Model L received nerfs to their long-range damage, while more than a few SMGs had their range buffed. Most of the new Black Ops 6 patch focuses on tweaking Multiplayer, but Zombies players will notice that GobbleGum names should now properly update when players switch between tier tabs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s update follows <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-november-1-patch-fixes-troublesome-black-screen-glitch-and-other-issues"><u>a November 1 patch</u></a> that squashed a number of bugs and exploits across the Multiplayer and Zombies modes. Although today’s fix fleshes out the experience even more, the team will surely polish the FPS further in the coming days and weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched October 25 and will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-gets-nuketown-this-week-as-activision-reveals-season-1-plans"><u>begin its first season of content on November 14</u></a>. For more on, you can read our reviews for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review"><u>Campaign</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review"><u>Multiplayer</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-review"><u>Zombies</u></a> modes. We gave Multiplayer an 8/10, saying, “Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 plays it safe but is otherwise exactly what Call of Duty multiplayer should be: fast, fun, and a little on the ridiculous side.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For everything else revealed in today’s patch, you can see the list of all the changes below. Specific weapon adjustments can be found on the patch notes page <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/10/bo6-preseason-patch-notes#nov4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>here</u></a>, and make sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/Best_Guns_Ranked_(Launch_Meta)">ranking of the best guns</a> as well would <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/Black_Ops_6_Zombies_Guide">Black Ops 6 Zombies Guide</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 November 4, 2024 Patch Notes</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>GLOBAL</strong></h3><strong>Stability </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improved stability when interacting with the Message of the Day. </li><li>Improved stability when sending voice communications. </li></ul><strong>Progression </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Completion display will now properly appear when completing Prestige Challenges in both Multiplayer and Zombies. </li></ul><strong>Operators </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where Bailey wasn’t holding an intended Pistol in the Operator selection menu. </li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>MULTIPLAYER</strong></h3><strong>Maps </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nuketown<ul data-cy="list"><li>Nuketown is now available in Private Matches.  </li></ul></li></ul><strong>Modes </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where players were spawned in when joining a session in progress instead of spectating before selecting a Loadout.

For ARs, we are pulling in minimum damage ranges and lessening the impact of headshots at close range. SMGs are receiving damage range increases to improve their mid-range effectiveness.</p>Shotguns <p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, we fixed an issue with shotgun Slugs, but we are still working on an additional issue causing this attachment to perform better in hip fire than intended. Slugs are meant to offer an alternate playstyle for shotguns that trades close quarters effectiveness for improved range and precision. We are removing the ability for Slugs to one-hit kill to the body for now and will be revisiting the overall tuning of this attachment in an upcoming update.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Marine SP <ul data-cy="list"><li>Slug attachment Max Damage reduced from 106 to 92. </li></ul></li><li>ASG-89 <ul data-cy="list"><li>Slug attachment Max Damage reduced from 106 to 92. </li></ul></li></ul>Perks <ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Recon Combat Specialty </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced duration that enemies are highlighted after respawning to 1.5 seconds from 2 seconds.
