            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tinybuild-announces-second-annual-showcase-for-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">New game reveals and demos with no fluff in less than 30 minutes.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">TinyBuild Connect is back this year to showcase a bunch of games that are on the way from tinyBuild, the publisher behind titles like Potion Craft, Graveyard Keeper, and Streets of Rogue. And once again, it’ll be a show focused on world premieres and exclusive new trailers with no talking heads or any other fluff. Just games.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>TinyBuild Connect Date, Time, and How to Watch</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The full event will be livestreamed on Tuesday, May 27 starting at 1:00 p.m. Eastern / 12:00 p.m. Central / 10:00 a.m. Pacific. For our friends across the pond, that’s 7:00 p.m. CET. It’ll start promptly at those times and will jump right into the games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/"><u>IGN.com</u></a> (our homepage)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ign/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Facebook</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ign/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Twitter</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ign" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Twitch</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ign?lang=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s TikTok</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw?themeRefresh=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s YouTube</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not able to catch the show live, you’ll be able to watch the whole thing on our YouTube page after it finishes. Just like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMre7n_HPao" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>last year’s show</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What to Expect from tinyBuild Connect 2025</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This will be a dense show, with lots of reveals and announcements packed into less than 30 minutes. There will be a mix of premieres of previously unannounced games, new info about announced games, and updates for released titles, highlighted by upcoming titles Hello Neighbor 3, Ferocious, and Kingmakers. You can expect a new look at gameplay for both HN3 and Ferocious, while Kingmakers is getting a Steam Early Access release date announcement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Neighbor 3 was announced last year and is the latest entry in the adventure sandbox thriller series. You’ll return to the town of Raven Brooks, this time as a stranger with no ties to the town. Raven Brooks functions as a real-time sandbox simulation, where every player’s decision is the right one. It’s populated by residents who act based on their personalities, relationships, desires, and goals. The game is currently in the playtesting phase, so now seems like the right time for an update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ferocious made a strong impression during last year’s Games Baked in Germany showcase with its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ferocious-official-mecha-trailer-games-baked-in-germany-showcase"><u>cinematic trailer</u></a>. Developed by Omyog, a small German team with veterans from the film and AAA game industries, the game is a survival-focused, narrative-driven FPS set on a remote island filled with dinosaurs and hostile mercenaries. Among the team is the former Level Design Director of Far Cry 3, Narrative Director of Far Cry 4, and Campaign Creative Director of Star Wars Battlefront II, so it’s safe to say it’s an experienced team.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/20/tb-connect-2025-final-artwork-1747758278474.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingmakers was revealed last year too, and it took the IGN audience by storm. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingmakers-combines-back-to-the-future-with-army-of-darkness-and-its-blowing-up-right-now-ign-next"><u>featured it on IGN Next</u></a> because its trailer was a surprise hit, getting more than 11 million views across our social channels. Like Ferocious, it resonated thanks to its unique premise. Kingmakers is a mix of third-person shooter and RTS set in medieval Europe. You might be thinking, “How could a shooter be set in medieval times?” Well, you’re a time traveler who’s been sent to the past with modern weapons to alter the course of history. TinyBuild has confirmed that they’ll be announcing the game’s release date in Steam’s Early Access, so you can look forward to that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those are some of the games you can expect to get updates, but there will be plenty more announcements and updates we can’t see coming. Tune in on May 27 to see all of it.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, developer Arrowhead Studios brought the fight to Super Earth, as the Illuminate are touching down on the Helldivers' home turf. Everyone is joining in the fight, from the player-led Helldivers to some fresh reinforcements in the SEAF.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Short for Super Earth Armed Force, the SEAF soldiers are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-finally-brings-the-illuminate-invasion-to-the-streets-of-super-earth">populating battles taking place on Super Earth</a>, helping the Helldivers hold out against the oncoming Illuminate forces. These troops can be ordered around using several commands, and will assist the Helldivers in defending the home of Managed Democracy. In turn, Helldivers 2 players already love their new NPC helpers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As seen in the new trailer for the Heart of Democracy update, SEAF soldiers are subject to roughly the same dire circumstances and thin survival odds as the Helldivers. Today's trailer has more than a few shots of SEAF soldiers getting absolutely routed by the invasion forces.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the new SEAF pals are garnering both the sympathy and adoration of Helldivers, provoking the need to defend their newfound backup. Refrains of "PROTECT THE LIL UNS," a Warhammer 40K: Darktide reference, are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1kr4o3b/comment/mtapr7k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already picking up steam</a> in the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Aah look at them, they are so cute," wrote <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1kr0ftf/seaf_reacts_to_se_salute_this_is_beautiful/mt9mhhk/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one r/Helldivers user</a>, responding to the SEAF soldiers' reactions to the Super Earth salute. "Protect them at all cost helldiver."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others draw comparisons to the Clone Troopers from Star Wars, especially the NPC allies you'd see in the classic campaigns of games like Star War: Battlefront. "Fired an EAT into a harvesters leg that was attacking a squad and one yelled out 'Glad the helldiver's on our side!'" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1kr4o3b/comment/mtakaer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one user noted</a>, as it reminded them of the lines you'd hear in Star Wars: Battlefront calling out similar actions. "Now we just need overseers with wrist rockets."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1kr2dmk/guyshear_me_out/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">come up with new ways the SEAF could help</a> the Helldivers in the future, as hopes seem high for the SEAF soldiers to leave Super Earth and venture with the Helldivers into other dangerous hotspots via stratagems. Honestly, having an NPC pal around to push those bunker buttons <em>would </em>be useful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, the Helldivers will absolutely need the help on Super Earth, as the new update seems quite chaotic. It's the culmination of a long series of events, stretching back to a really bad bug hive and a black hole, and it's been really fascinating to see it all come together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not too long ago, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-ceo-says-youll-sht-your-pants-over-whats-coming-down-the-pipe">Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani declared</a> Helldivers 2 players would "shit [their] pants" when they found out what was coming down the pipe. You don't need to give me any unnecessary information, but I do feel like the scope of this update is living up to expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2's Heart of Democracy update, and the Illuminate invasion of Super Earth, is currently underway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
