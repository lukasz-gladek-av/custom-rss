When Oblivion launched for PC and Xbox 360 more than 19 years ago, it was clear Tandilwe could use some speech training of her own. One of her voice lines is a recording of what has long been assumed to be mistakenly included audio of actress Linda Kenyon taking another stab at a line.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Begging Bethesda to keep this voice acting flub in Oblivion Remastered <a href="https://t.co/rzGymRMchw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rzGymRMchw</a></p>— TheNCSmaster (@TheNCSmaster) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNCSmaster/status/1914371675132506375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As players began their trek through a revitalized Cyrodiil yesterday, many were on the hunt to see just how faithful the ground-up remaster truly was. While so many environments, character models, and items have been given a fresh coat of paint, others have been happy to find that many of the blemishes that made 2006 Oblivion so special remain intact. Tandilwe’s infamous (and hilarious) blooper is one moment fans have been <a href="https://x.com/ManyATrueNerd/status/1915072065222124017" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overjoyed to see return</a>.
