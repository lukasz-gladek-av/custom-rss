This will introduce a variety of updates to the Overworld that will make biomes "feel more immersive and alive," such as new variants for cows, pigs, and chickens, and new ambient features and sounds (glittering firefly bush, falling leaves, and whispers of sand). Spring to Life launches on March 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second game drop of the year doesn't have a name just yet, but we do know what it will include. There's a new block called the Dried Ghast that can be rehydrated to form a new mob variant called a Ghastling (baby ghast, essentially), which in turn can become the new Happy Ghast mob variant. The Ghast harness is used to fly the Happy Ghast, which can carry up to four players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's big update was a major visual upgrade for Minecraft called 'Vibrant Visuals,' "the first step in expressing our developers’ vision for a visual upgrade that will transform the way our players experience Minecraft," Mojang said. Vibrant Visuals does not impact Minecraft gameplay in any way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-upgrade-the-start-of-a-new-graphical-journey">IGN's separate article on the Vibrant Visuals upgrade</a> to find out more, and IGN's visuals comparison video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Mojang shared a new clip for the upcoming A Minecraft Movie and announced a movie-themed in-game live event that kicks off on March 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got plenty more from Mojang based on our trip to its offices in Sweden, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mojang-rules-out-minecraft-2-do-you-think-were-going-to-have-an-earth-2">why the developer won't make a Minecraft 2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-its-the-best-deal-in-the-world">won't make Minecraft free-to-play</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mojang-wont-use-generative-ai-minecraft-is-about-creativity-and-creating">won't use generative AI to develop the game</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Minecraft Live 2025 — everything announced:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mojang Studios announced the name, launch date, and features of the first game drop of the year, as well as upcoming features in the second game drop of the year.</li><li>The first game drop of the year is called “Spring to Life,” and introduces a variety of updates to the Overworld that will make biomes feel more immersive and alive.</li><li>Spring to Life adds warm and cold variants of some of Minecraft's classic mobs, new ambient features like the glittering firefly bush, falling leaves, and whispers of sand, and more reasons to explore </li><li>The second game drop of the year includes the new Dried Ghast block, the new Ghastling and Happy Ghast mob variants, and the Ghast harness.</li><li>The Dried Ghast is a little big smaller than a regular block and has cute little tentacles and a grumpy face.</li><li>If you pick up the Dried Ghast from the Nether and put it in water, eventually it will become a much happier Ghastling.</li><li>The Ghastling floats around the Overworld like a little balloon.
