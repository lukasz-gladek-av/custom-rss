Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokemon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-june-30">Crown Zenith cards are rising in value</a>, with key VSTAR Secret Rares like Giratina and Dialga seeing double-digit gains, driven by strong demand and the set’s transition into “legacy” status as the Sword and Shield era ends. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Magic: The Gathering Sealed Products</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're seeing TCG Player destory Amazon pricing on sealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-magic-the-gathering-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-june-30">Magic: The Gathering</a> product at the moment too. This is great for us, but perhaps Amazon should use their weight to look after their customers with predatory over MRSP pricing?

There's every chance Amazon will get more stock allocation before release, but if you don't want to miss out on launch, I'd highly reccomend securing preorders with a reputable seller on TCG Player. If this set is anything like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-most-expensive-surge-foils">MTG: Final Fantasy</a>, launch day stock is going to be none existent.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Preorder MTG: Edge Of Eternities</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preorder-guide">MTG: Edge of Eternities preorders</a> are the exception to the rule in this weeks MTG deals round-up. Amazon comes in cheaper on most preorders, with TCG Player taking the cheapest spot on the Play Booster Box and Commander Deck bundles.

The developers would have explored the angles of CPU and GPU load, as well as memory usage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No reason was given for the cancellation, but speculation has swirled around whether this is related to harassment the developers have faced over Monster Hunter Wilds. The PC version of Wilds, specifically, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-mixed-steam-user-review-rating-capcom-issues-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-troubleshooting-guide">garnered criticism since launch</a>, prompting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-director-commits-to-addressing-stability-issues-with-pc-improvements-coming-in-title-update-1">commitments to improvements and updates</a> from the team at Capcom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the release of Title Update 2, planned adjustments were hoped to have fixed the problem. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-takes-aim-at-performance-woes-but-opinions-vary-on-whether-it-worked">Results seemed varied</a>, however, and Capcom released a statement addressing several major bugs and issues <a href="https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1941110323005857917" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Twitter/X</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this, though, Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/support/faq/information_info2025_0266919.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also put out a statement on its official site</a>, responding to what sounds like a more extreme degree of feedback. Per Automaton, Capcom said its staff have faced harassment through social media and customer support channels, including targeted threats against individuals. The company reportedly warned that it will take legal action in severe cases of harassment against employees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So while no official reason was given for the lecture's cancellation, the alignment of these events certainly suggests that concerns over harassment played a role. And it should go without saying that critique and feedback are worthwhile, but these extremes do worse than nothing, and certainly won't assist in tuning Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Wilds itself, Title Update 2 recently went live, and players do seem to be enjoying the addition of several new hunts, especially <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-next-update-adds-the-long-awaited-lagiacrus">the bout with Lagiacrus</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-cancels-lecture-on-monster-hunter-wilds-optimization-amid-harassment-concerns]]></content:encoded>
