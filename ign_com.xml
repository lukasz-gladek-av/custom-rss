            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Code Vein getting a sequel, as announced at Summer Game Fest earlier this year, was a pleasant surprise. The original was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/26/code-vein-review"><u>good</u></a>! It was one of those games that necessarily didn’t blow people away, but was fun popcorn for action-RPG fans who like deep character creators, over-the-top plots, and far more weapons and customization choices than any person can reasonably keep track of. But good or not, loads of excellent games in this genre never resurface after their initial debut, so Bandai Namco being willing to return to its twist on vampires and take another crack at perfecting the pitch is some seriously good news. Sure, the developer has disavowed any plot connections to the original, which has some fans worried. But I just got 45 minutes of hands-off time with Code Vein 2, and came out feeling confident that direct sequel or no, this follow-up feels like a far more fully realized vision of the fast-paced, flashy action RPG that Code Vein 1 was always striving to be.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dress to Impress</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I did get a very, very brief stint of hands-on time with Code Vein 2, in that Bandai Namco let me mess around in the c haracter creator before they took over. No huge surprises here, but if you liked the robustness of Code Vein 1’s character creator and can spend hours tweaking eyebrow shapes, I’ve got good news for you. You can choose from preset designs, of course, for folks who don’t want to sit on this screen all day, but you can also adjust minute details like teeth and ear shapes if that’s more your bag. I had a lot of fun picking out a really big, silly hat for my character to wear. One of my favorite elements of the creator is the ability to select an outfit, and then turn on and off certain pieces of it. Love a cute dress but hate the weird garter it makes you wear with it? Just turn it off! </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once I had settled on a cute hat and hairstyle, I handed the controller back over to the devs, and sat back to watch what they had to show me. The mission they elected to demonstrate was one where the player is sent off with a partner (a buddy) named Josée to restore power to a city area. They selected the quest area from a large overworld map and traveled there instantly, though they arrived not in a closed dungeon but in a large, lovely, ruined city with multiple dungeons available to them just by running (or driving a motorcycle) around. I got to watch some gameplay both from an optional dungeon near where we landed, and from the actual objective dungeon itself, a substation where the hero might be able to get the city’s power running again.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Define “Open”</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One big question I had going into this preview was whether Code Vein 2 was open world, or open zone, or something else. After chatting with the team, asking about the issue several times, and watching the demo, I’m still not 100% sure how to answer this. The team says it’s not open world, but also kept saying Code Vein 2 had “one single overworld” and that traveling is “a bit more open” than in Code Vein 1. There does seem to be a lot of interconnectivity – I watched the he=ro zoom around the outdoor area on a motorcycle (with Josée adorably sitting cross-legged on the back) and covering some meaningful distance without running into artificial walls, but it’s possible there were some much further along. Director Hiroshi Yoshimura also told me that the overworld is “significantly” bigger, while the dungeon sizes are roughly the same as Code Vein 1. Make of all that what you will for now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When I asked about the world, director Yoshimura repeatedly pointed out that the focus was less on exploration and more on the various character companions you’ll meet in Code Vein 2. You’ll be traveling to points in the world specifically for missions tied to these characters that will let you get to know them better. Much of Code Vein 2 does indeed seem to be centered around these buddies, or partners as they’re now called, even more so than the first game since the sequel won’t feature co-op.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Friend Circle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In my preview, I got a decent look at some of the partner dynamics between the main character and Josée. Josée’s got a big ol’ sword she swings around, slow but powerful, and at different points I saw her light it on fire for both close-up and long-range attacks. Without actually playing myself it’s hard to say whether or not the AI has improved from Code Vein 1 (where it could be a bit finicky or, at times, suicidal). Though, if you hate dealing with AI partners at all, they can assist you in Code Vein 2 via “assimilation” – effectively removing them from the battlefield, but giving yourself significant stat boosts and powerful new abilities to compensate. One other feature I did appreciate was the ability of partners to revive you when you fall in battle, and vice versa if your partners fall, wisely on a cooldown so it can’t be spammed for immortality. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From what I could see, Code Vein veterans will be perfectly happy with the sequel’s bursting larder of combat abilities and character customization. Code Vein 2 wants you to get really comfortable cycling through different types of skills, and boy, you better keep track of all those Proper Nouns. But here’s the jist: you’ll attack with your weapon to start building up bleeds on an enemy, then use your equipped auxiliary “Jail” weapon to gain a resource called Ichor. Ichor can then be spent on far more powerful abilities, such as “bequeathed formae”, special, powerful weapons like a huge bow and arrow or a powerful shield. Or, you can activate your Jails for huge finisher moves, like swinging an enormous scythe or briefly gaining big, vampiric wings.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Code Vein 2, like its predecessor, seems to benefit from just trying stuff out and seeing what’s fun and effective.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t mean to spend this whole preview lamenting that this was a hands-off demo, but man, I wish I could have gotten ahold of a controller just to muck around in the menus! Code Vein 2, like its predecessor, seems to benefit from just trying stuff out and seeing what’s fun and effective, and even with just the options I saw in the demo I feel like I could waste a lot of time wildly flailing around with different combinations until I was happy with my particular expression of it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">When This Baby Hits 88mph… </h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I unfortunately didn’t get a chance to see anything from one of Code Vein 2’s most intriguing key features: time travel. It takes place in a present day where a horrible calamity has taken place in the past, and you and your companions are given the ability to travel back in time and change history. Though you’re strongly urged not to meddle with the past, obviously, you do anyway. I’m told you’re allowed to freely travel between past and present most of the time (occasionally you’ll be locked out of doing so), and things you do in the past can influence what’s going on in the present, even to the point of making it impossible to return to the present. But I wasn’t able to see any of that in action during my preview, so it’s hard for me to say how extensive or interesting this element actually is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One other, somewhat fangirly note - hey, I love Go Shiina’s music? Shiina returns as composer for Code Vein 2 after working on Code Vein 1, and he’s also composed for my two favorite Tales games (don’t laugh at me for this): Tales of Legendia and Tales of Zestiria. His excellence was on full display both in my preview and in the story trailer I watched ahead of time, with soaring strings and chaotic vocals backing Code Vein 2’s intense battles. Sign me up for another banger Shiina soundtrack, thanks!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Bandai Namco has confirmed that Code Vein 2 is a complete departure from the story and universe of the first game, it’s familiar enough in gameplay and style that I came away feeling pretty happy with the direction. I’ve seen fans calling it a “soft reboot” and I think that’s an accurate summation: it’s true to the philosophy of Code Vein without being beholden to its lore Wiki. Nothing I’ve seen has shocked me so far, but I don’t think it needs to: everything good about Code Vein 1 is here, just bigger, shinier, and slash-slash-slashier. Now just let me tinker around in the character creator for just a few more minutes…</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/code-vein-2-preview-new-moon-same-blood]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has revealed Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, the first seasonal mini-event for the game, an invincible boss, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bounty Packs are paid DLC that bring new “bite-sized-yet-flavourful” narrative content to Borderlands 4. In Bounty Pack 1, due out November 20, players team up with Rush and “show the Timekeeper's Minister of Culture the true meaning of Mercenary Day, a jolly time for gift-giving and gunslinging with friends and family.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bounty Pack 1 also includes a Vault Card with new rewards that players will earn through gameplay, with 24 cosmetic items to unlock and four pieces of rerollable gear. The rerollable gear can be earned as many times as players like, so it can be an opportunity to obtain a roll with stats that perfectly suit a specific build, Gearbox said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Rush, the affable leader of the Outbounders, is feeling homesick and nostalgic for the holidays he's cherished in years past. By his calculations, it's about to be Mercenary Day, a jolly time for gift-giving and gunslinging with friends and family, and he'd like to bring that same festive cheer to the people of Kairos. But his hopes for holiday merriment stand in direct opposition to Screw, the Timekeeper's Minister of Culture who's charged with keeping celebrations as bland and homogenous as possible. Across a series of all-new Main Missions, you'll show Screw the true meaning of Mercenary Day by any means necessary, and maybe score some new Legendary loot in the process.</blockquote><h2 data-cy="title2">Here's the full breakdown of the Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1 Vault Card loot:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 rerollable weapons</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Heads usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Skins usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>5 Weapon Skins</li><li>5 Vehicle Skins</li><li>4 ECHO-4 Drone Skins</li><li>2 ECHO-4 Attachments</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Bounty Pack 1 also features a few extras to find:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 New Digirunner Vehicle (available shortly after starting the first Main Mission)</li><li>1 Vault Hunter Style usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe (available after beating the boss and completing the Bounty Pack's final Main Mission)</li><li>1 ECHO-4 Drone Skin (available after beating the boss and completing the Bounty Pack's final Main Mission)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">To access Gearbox has revealed Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, the first seasonal mini-event for the game, an invincible boss, and more., you need to have either bought the Borderlands 4 Deluxe or Super Deluxe Edition (both include the Bounty Pack Bundle), or bought the Bounty Pack Bundle that includes Bounty Pack 1, or bought Bounty Pack 1 individually.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/bl4-bountypack1-1760358945640.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day contents.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Gearbox revealed Borderlands 4’s free seasonal mini-event, Horrors of Kairos. This limited-time event celebrates Halloween from October 23 to November 6. Players will encounter a terrifying new weather effect of blood rain when fighting world bosses, and killing them has a chance to earn you new Legendary loot, Gearbox said. Seasonal cosmetics will be offered through SHiFT codes, too.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>"Murmur" Legendary Tediore Assault Rifle: Executes weakened enemies with guaranteed crits on targets under 35% health</li><li>"Skully" Legendary Order Grenade: This death-dealing grenade fires out projectiles as it seeks out the nearest target</li></ul><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/bl4-horrors-of-kairos-1760358970845.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Horrors of Kairos LTE.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, there’s a free endgame update in the form of Bloomreaper the Invincible. This is the first of the endgame Invincible Bosses coming to Borderlands 4 as free DLC, and is due at some point in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The "Invincible" moniker is a throwback to the raid bosses of Borderlands 2, so these aren't literally unkillable enemies, Gearbox explained, but players' skills “will be tested by the massive health pools, extremely lethal attack damage, and new modifiers of these all-new bosses.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The December update also adds a new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode level for an added layer of difficulty.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/bl4-bloomreaper-1760358988278.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Bloomreaper the Invincible.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-think-he-and-i-have-a-lot-in-common-borderlands-4-developers-used-first-person-footage-of-randy-pitchford-throwing-cards-to-help-animate-the-games-first-dlc-vault-hunter">Gearbox revealed Borderlands 4’s first of two new Vault Hunters coming to the game as part of the paid Story Pack DLCs</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> chief Randy Pitchford has said that if other developers better understood why gamers love making decisions about loot, Gearbox would have “good competitors.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford was speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0m7sd7y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC Radio 5 Live</a> to discuss the release of Borderlands 4 and Gearbox’s journey alongside the series’ success. The outspoken developer said that even though the Borderlands franchise will break through 100 million units sold with Borderlands 4 (publisher 2K Games has yet to announce a sales figure), he insisted “we suck!” because that 100 million is but a drop in the ocean that is the total number of potential gamers globally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our mission is to entertain the world,” Pitchford said. “Which means we suck! Because there are billions of people in the world. We got a lot of work to do. Borderlands, with 4, we’re gonna cross probably 100 million units sold, with Borderlands 4, of the franchise. That’s awesome compared to a lot of things. But it kinda sucks if your goal is to entertain the world. So I feel like we’re just getting started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’ve been working on Borderlands for over 20 years now. And it feels like we’re starting to get pretty good at it. It feels like we’re starting to figure it out. I feel like we’ve probed a lot of the end points. But I don’t think we’re anywhere near the end of a journey.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/gettyimages-2165642737-1760354699644.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Randy Pitchford has thoughts about the looter shooter genre. Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images for Lionsgate.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford then entered into a rather philosophical debate about why people love looter shooters like Borderlands so much. This is a game that revolves around the hunt for better loot — in the case of Borderlands 4 billions of potential weapons are available — and players fuss over whether to equip something new that’s just dropped or stick with what they already have, even if it’s inferior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a constant loop in the Borderlands games, which are packed with enemies, crates, chests, and even toilets that spit out loot. Perhaps to a greater extent than any other looter shooter, loot is everywhere in Borderlands, and the player is constantly having to pause to wonder, is that item that just dropped worth my time?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, the answer is no. But sometimes the answer is yes. Either way, as you play Borderlands and fuss over the minutiae of your build, you're always asking yourself whether this item or that item will help make the numbers go up within your playstyle. Farming for these items is all part of the loot hunt and, for so many millions of fans, the whole reason to play Borderlands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Coincidentally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-want-to-know-what-sort-of-odds-i-am-trying-to-beat-when-i-am-grinding-a-game-150-hours-and-over-3000-boss-kills-later-a-superfan-has-worked-out-borderlands-4s-disappointingly-low-drop-rate">IGN recently interviewed a Borderlands 4 player who spent 150 hours on over 3,000 boss kills to find out the game’s true drop rate</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands games are tuned to present these sorts of loot conundrums “by design,” Pitchford explained, before saying he expected the franchise to have more imitators by now because of how addictive this loop is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’re poking at some fundamentals, which is part of why I think Borderlands as a game has worked, and does work, and why it’s a very delicate design that I think is one of the reasons why there haven’t really been many successful imitators since we first showed how a shooter looter could work with the original game,” Pitchford said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands doesn’t have the looter shooter genre to itself, of course. Perhaps its most high-profile rival is Bungie’s Destiny, although that Sony-owned franchise has seen better days. Other examples include People Can Fly’s Outriders (no sequel in sight), and Ubisoft’s The Division (The Division 3 is in the works). If we’re stretching the definition of looter shooter, we might include games like Warframe, Remnant 2, or The First Descendant. Rocksteady’s disastrous Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is perhaps the most high-profile of looter shooter failures. Certainly, Borderlands and its various entries dominate the space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it all comes down to nailing the “gratifying” decision around loot in Borderlands. It is something, Pitchford said, humans love to do because it scratches an itch in our brains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That decision, that choice about, do I keep what I have or do I try the new thing? That is a very compelling, fundamental, both need and skill that our brains have, to make choices like that,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve reduced it down to this simple moment with this interface in this system. It’s a gratifying loop. It’s a gratifying decision. Our brains need to do it, and our brains like doing it. And we’re better off when we do it. The more we exercise that muscle, not just in the video game but literally in life — this is what separates our species from a lot of others, and how we developed language and how we developed all kinds of high levels of consciousness and cognition that allow us to analyse the world. Most of what our prefrontal cortex is for — why that adaptation exists and what it’s used for — is that skill, or versions of it. We’ve reduced it down into this design. And yes — the is the thing I’m looking at better than the thing I’ve got, and managing the cognition between the objective, almost scientific analysis of that choice, versus the emotional impact on that choice, and having those at odds with each other frequently, is very interesting, and dare I say it addictive.”</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford continued: “We don’t do it because it’s addictive. We do it because it’s stimulating and because we kind of need that. Part of why games exist are to… yeah. we can live a fantasy that we might not be able to have in the real world, and we can explore themes and ideas in a safe place that we can’t explore in the real world, but we also can, because it’s an interactive simulation, we can test our thinking and our decision making and put our brain to work in really interesting ways that we kind of need and want.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the puzzlement that other developers haven’t taken Borderlands on at its own game, and the associated suggestion that Gearbox’s rivals aren’t thinking about the looter shooter on the same level as the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If other game designers that were trying to get in on the action, so to speak, understood that, we’d have more competitors, or we’d have good competitors,” he said. “But we haven’t so far. It’s weird. The kinds of people that just want to go after it, they’re not thinking about it on that level. They’re just putting into motion something because of market analysis. It’s not a designer’s or creator’s drive that’s doing it. It’s either a business drive or a wishing to be something that you’re not kind of drive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s so weird. I fully expected after the first game came out that everyone would be hip to exactly what you mentioned, and we’d immediately see lots of other games imitating and aping, and we’d be dead, because we can’t compete with a lot of other folks, especially back then. We were the scrappy underdogs.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certainly, the critical reception to Borderlands 4 suggests Gearbox has once again successfully presented a looter shooter that ticks all the right boxes. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-review">Borderlands 4 review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Borderlands 4 gives the series the massive kick in the pants it has needed, with a fantastic open world and greatly improved combat, even if bugs and invisible walls can sometimes throw off that groove.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Borderlands 4.

Yes, I know people don’t like Universes Beyond, and for the most part I’m right there with you - but I couldn’t resist this time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Why I Preordered The Turtle Power Precon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I can’t remember the last time a set came with a single Commander precon. In 2025 alone we’ve had sets with no precons (Spider-Man, Avatar), sets with two (Aetherdrift, Edge of Eternities), a set with four (Final Fantasy) and a set with five (Tarkir Dragonstorm).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wizards is seemingly easing off the Commander decks as this year winds down, but as a big fan of the format I’m thrilled we’re getting just one for the TMNT set since I fully expected I’d need to pick my favorite turtle and buy one of four. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also very curious to see how it plays, because the Partner mechanic isn’t one we see all that often. I’d also say we don’t see a great number of five-color preconstructed decks, but we’re literally getting one in Lorwyn Eclipsed, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All four turtles, plus Splinter? That’s an easy pickup - and Amazon’s preorder price guarantee might mean that it drops lower than the $64.45 I’ve committed to pay already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for other UK preorders going live, there’s plenty to choose from. <a href="https://zdcs.link/akw7yY?object_uuid=aae1ee22-12ce-48a3-8516-500aaa8ddc20&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Play Boosters are going for £5.99 a pop</u></a>, with a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVEDyN?object_uuid=aae1ee22-12ce-48a3-8516-500aaa8ddc20&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>booster box sitting at £174.99</u></a>, while a <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEJVrG?object_uuid=aae1ee22-12ce-48a3-8516-500aaa8ddc20&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>booster bundle is £60.99</u></a> and includes 9 Play Boosters and extras like a promo card and deck box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of writing, there are no Collector Booster Packs or Boxes up for sale, but you can find one of the sought-after packs in the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YMdyx?object_uuid=aae1ee22-12ce-48a3-8516-500aaa8ddc20&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Draft Night box for £114.99</u></a>. We’re still waiting on the new Pizza Bundle to show up in the UK, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBD108?object_uuid=aae1ee22-12ce-48a3-8516-500aaa8ddc20&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Also new this time is the Turtle Team-Up</u></a>, which is a 2-4 player co-op game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> gives its revenge-seeking protagonist Atsu a wide range of traditional Japanese weapons to wield, including bows, swords and spears. Last week, however, a Japanese-speaking user on X questioned whether it was realistic or even possible for Atsu to draw a very long sword from her back, prompting a flood of video comments from traditional Japanese martial arts practitioners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Ghost of Yotei, you’ll pick up the Odachi (literally ‘big sword’) in The Way of the Odachi quest (check out our walkthrough <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/ghost-of-yotei/The_Way_of_the_Odachi_Walkthrough"><u>here</u></a>). It is a useful addition to Atsu’s arsenal, especially when facing off against larger enemies (brutes). It allows her to block heavy attacks and then push back against the opponent, opening them up for a devastating slice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As she already has two swords at her hip, Atsu opts to sheath the Odachi on her back, however X user ikazombie questioned how on earth you’d pull this off without dislocating something. Upon slowing the clip down, they realised that you could theoretically draw and sheath it from over your left shoulder, but seemed unconvinced about how this would be accomplished in real life.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">大太刀、あんなデカい刀を背負ってどうやって抜刀すんねん関節外れるぞと思ってたんだけど、予想外のモーションで ” 理 論 上 は ” 問題なく抜刀/納刀できてたの笑う<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GhostofYotei?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GhostofYotei</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AA%E3%83%96%E3%83%A8%E3%82%A6%E3%83%86%E3%82%A4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ゴーストオブヨウテイ</a> <a href="https://t.co/j31VjGpgDk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/j31VjGpgDk</a></p>— ジェット・リョー (@ikazombie) <a href="https://twitter.com/ikazombie/status/1974771283360645536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese martial arts practitioners commented with videos. User Harima_mekkai (a member of the Tenshinryu school) decided to try out Atsu’s way of wearing and drawing an Odachi. She posted a video of herself successfully unsheathing a 1m long sword weighing 1.5kg from over her left shoulder. This shows that the drawing part of Atsu's Odachi technique is actually doable, albeit it takes effort and training to pull it off that smoothly.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— まーこ　11月29日生誕祭🎂 (@harima_mekkai) <a href="https://twitter.com/harima_mekkai/status/1975527448180891946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Another user by the name of Lornplum replied with a video of himself drawing and sheathing a back-mounted sword and described the way Atsu deals with the length by holding the blade as she draws it as a "brilliant touch of realism." </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">刀身持って長さを稼ぐやり方としては絶妙なリアリティ<br>現実でやるならこういうかんじ<a href="https://t.co/X3PqwBcMOq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/X3PqwBcMOq</a></p>— lornplum (@lornplum) <a href="https://twitter.com/lornplum/status/1974791334272921826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch did get members of the Tenshinryu school to do motion capture for the sword fights and stances in Ghost of Yotei. Tenshinryu is a traditional Japanese martial art which dates from the 1600s and covers the art of a wide variety of weapons, including spears, swords and chain sickles. PlayStation Japan recently posted a side-by-side video of Ghost of Yotei footage and Tenshinryu members enacting the fight scene.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— プレイステーション公式 (@PlayStation_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation_jp/status/1976269162147422445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">However, there is still a bit of video game coolness trumping realism here. The clips of real-life pros show them moving the sheath up and over their shoulder more (or even <a href="https://x.com/lornplum/status/1974797905312813146" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>around their body</u></a>) to make it easier to draw and sheath the weapon. This is especially apparent when sheathing the sword. It seems that the amount of movement in Atsu’s Odaichi sheathing was reduced, likely to make whipping out and holstering the weapon smoother and more responsive for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Lornplum <a href="https://x.com/lornplum/status/1975554349884690691" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented </u></a>on Harima_Mekkai’s demonstration of drawing a Odaichi Atsu-style: “As you can see, with some effort anyone can manage to draw it, however sheathing it (like Atsu does) is pretty much impossible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While they look cool in games, it goes without saying that having a sword on your back in real life makes it much more awkward to access than if it was at your hip. Last year, a Link cosplayer found it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masahiro-sakurai-helps-zelda-cosplayer-struggling-to-unsheathe-links-sword-by-explaining-how-it-works-in-smash-bros"><u>impossible to unsheath their back-mounted sword</u></a> Breath of the Wild-style. However, they received a bit of unexpected advice from none other than Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai, who explained that they made Link’s sword skills a little more realistic for Smash Bros. Ultimate by having him move the scabbard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review">Ghost of Yotei review</a> returned an 8/10.
