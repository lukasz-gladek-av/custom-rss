            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"When it was working, it was magical."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout studio Bethesda Softworks has been through a lot in the last few decades, and former marketing boss Pete Hines was there to see it through almost all of its changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hines touched on how Bethesda became a gaming giant during a recent interview with <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DBLTAP</u></a>. In addition to providing his perspective on the company’s early days, he took the time to recount how some of its biggest victories and hardest falls helped shape it into what it is today.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When it was working, it was magical.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hines started with Bethesda in October 1999, seeing it through everything from the launch of The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind in 2002, to Skyrim in 2011, to Fallout 76 in 2018. He also remained as a key figure at the gaming publisher throughout Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media, which was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-zenimax-acquisition-officially-complete-bethesda-now-a-part-of-xbox"><u>completed in 2021</u></a>, before going on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesdas-pete-hines-announces-retirement"><u>announce his retirement in 2023</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hines brought his time at Bethesda to an end after 24 years. However, it seems it was the quieter moments working with ZeniMax founder and CEO Robert Altman, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-a-altman-zenimax-founder-and-ceo-dies"><u>passed away in 2021</u></a>, that he remembers most fondly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was Robert Altman's company, and we were his employees, no question,” Hines said. “But he treated us more like family, and we found a culture that really fit us. When it was working, it was magical. We were a small, private company. It's way easier to stay out of scrutiny when you're not having to put your earnings reports out for the whole world.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda, which now serves under the titan that is Microsoft, encompasses a variety of different game studios. This includes its development arm, Bethesda Game Studios, Doom developer id Software, Deathloop developer Arkane Studios, Wolfenstein studio MachineGames, and The Elder Scrolls Online studio ZeniMax Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamers have turned to the company for everything from giant, trend-setting RPGs to laser-focused first-person shooters, but in 2024, the Bethesda umbrella shrunk. Just three years after Microsoft completed its acquisition, the Xbox company announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shock-and-anger-as-xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-more"><u>shutting down Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush studio Tango Gameworks</u></a> (Tango was later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/krafton-says-it-didnt-buy-tango-gameworks-from-microsoft-for-profit-we-dont-think-hi-fi-rush-2-is-going-to-make-us-money"><u>acquired by Krafton</u></a>).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's just no question that the company is not the same.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has gone through major shifts both before and after the Microsoft acquisition. For better or worse, Hines says there’s no denying the company he started at in 1999 has changed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's just no question that the company is not the same,” he added. “It has been radically changed and altered from the company that we built. It is what it is. Things change. Things move on, but at its height, it was really a special thing to be a part of.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in the interview with Hines, the former Bethesda executive touched on how he <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pete-hines-comments-on-the-confusion-surrounding-how-bethesda-named-prey-2017-dont-even-get-me-started?_cache=pass"><u>fought to change the name of Arkane’s Prey</u></a>, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bethesda-exec-says-gaming-subscription-services-worth-jack-s-without-proper-support-for-game-developers"><u>his thoughts on gaming subscription services like Game Pass</u></a>. He also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-76-pete-hines-remembers-probably-the-dumbest-thing-he-did-at-bethesda"><u>remembered the controversy surrounding Fallout 76</u></a> and how it led to “probably the dumbest thing” he ever did at Bethesda.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can read about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-microsoft-game-studios"><u>how Bethesda became the first Microsoft game studio to fully unionize</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> publisher Paradox is now offering PlayStation Store pre-order refunds as it makes “big changes” after a backlash to its decision to lock clans behind DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The furore began with the confirmation that Bloodlines 2 would feature four clans: Brujah; Tremere; Banu Haqim; and Ventrue. While this selection provides four different starting options for how you build your protagonist, it’s a more limited offering compared to the cult classic original Bloodlines, which featured seven clans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer The Chinese Room added a further two clans to Bloodlines 2 (Lasombra and Toreador), but these were only available as part of the Shadows and Silk add-on pack, which costs $21.99 as DLC, or included as part of the $89.99 Premium Edition. The standard edition costs $59.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This DLC is available from day one, which has created the impression that the “full” roster has been carved up, with only those paying extra getting the complete launch experience. As you’d expect, fans were quick to express their dissatisfaction.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At gamescom 2025, a representative for publisher Paradox told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-two-clans-locked-behind-dlc-because-of-business"><u>the decision was a “business” informed choice</u></a>, prompting further outcry. Then, last month, a post on Discord from Paradox suggested a significant change would be coming ahead of launch, and now the publisher has gone one step further by issuing PlayStation Store pre-order refunds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hi,” <a href="https://x.com/VtM_Bloodlines/status/1964016313958838399" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on social media on the official Bloodlines 2 account began</a>. “We’re making adjustments and will share the details on Sept 17. Big changes take time, and we want to do this right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“PS Store pre-orders will be refunded on Sept 8. You’ll be able to pre-order again before launch on Oct 21.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thanks for your patience; we’ll share more soon!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now wondering whether Paradox will include Lasombra and Toreador by default and not as DLC at base game price. Certainly, the sentiment online is that’s the expectation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Honestly nothing short of fully including them at base game price will turn me around on this,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bringdownthesky.bsky.social/post/3ly47xynyyk2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said one social media user</a> in response to the announcement. “Otherwise I'm skipping.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The only way to salvage this and regain trust with the community is to sell the base game as-is with all clans available and rather sell DLC with new side stories and cosmetics on the side or just add the cosmetics/side stories as part of a higher tier eg deluxe edition/premium edition, as that won't mess with the main story/narrative etc,” <a href="https://x.com/SplashbangOW/status/1964040019204809157" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said another</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some expressed thanks for the reaction to the backlash. “I'm very excited and hopeful to see what you came up with for the two clans locked behind DLC issue,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kixieboo.bsky.social/post/3ly4xxtqfbc2g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said one fan</a>. “I'd like to thank you for listening to community feedback and working to fix the issue. I'm sure refunding store pre-orders was not an easy decision.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 has suffered a difficult development and a number of high-profile delays, but it is a crucial release for Paradox. The publisher will be keen to give it the best chance possible to succeed, and backtracking on its DLC plans may be the only viable option at this stage.

Eight players build teams and fight to be the last person standing, with their units automatically battling after being placed strategically on the game board between rounds. Riot describes TFT as “the world’s largest PC strategy game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TFT is traditionally a PvP game, but Ao Shin’s Ascent, due out September 24, is its first-ever progression-focused PvE mode. Players take on escalating PvE battles and bosses, with roguelite progression that grants permanent power in the mode’s Journey Track.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>⛰️Get ready to climb! ⛰️<br>Ao Shin’s Ascent is a timerless PvE mode with permanent power progression &amp; the all-new Guide mechanic.</p><p>Climb the mountain, save corrupted Little Legends, and push to the summit! </p><p>Launches Sept 24 for a limited time. <a href="https://t.co/489UvyRvO3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/489UvyRvO3</a></p></div>— Teamfight Tactics (@TFT) <a href="https://twitter.com/TFT/status/1964331517833781697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official info, from developer Riot Games:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>SUMMIT THE MOUNTAIN:</strong> Climb the mountain while strengthening your board, arming yourself with powerful Augments, and preparing for an ultra-powerful Boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>CRAFT YOUR PATH AND CHALLENGE:</strong> Select your difficulty, your Guide, the Boss you’ll fight, and more to make every run feel and play differently! </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>KEY MECHANIC; GUIDES:</strong> The odds aren’t stacked in your favor at the start — recruiting a selection of unlockable Guides can help turn the tides by giving you access to novel strategies and power! Take Zoe for random loot, or grab a bundle-exclusive Guide like Battle Queen Gwen to access powerful Items from various TFT sets!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>PROGRESS TO THE SUMMIT WIN OR LOSE:</strong> Make progress on your climb win or lose, via the Journey Track. The more runs you take on, the stronger you get!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>UNLOCK GUIDES AND POWER WITH THE FREE JOURNEY TRACK:</strong> Unlock Guides, and power through the Journey Track. Clear the summit with at least 12 Guides to claim a free Ao Shin’s Ascent Portal reward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>PURCHASE BUNDLES:</strong> The Ao Shin’s Ascent Guide Pack (575 RP) comes with an emote and both Bundle-exclusive Guides: Truth Dragon Yasuo and Battle Queen Gwen. And the Ao Shin’s Ascent Mega Bundle (2780 RP) comes with that Emote, both Guides, Legendary Little Legend: Awakened Ao Shin, the Little Legend Sol Harbinger Ao Shin, and the second K.O.

This progression-based mode is our most ambitious PvE experiment yet, building on the strong global player engagement we’ve seen with Set 15, K.O. Coliseum. It marks a major step toward giving TFT players more ways to play, more ways to test themselves, and more reasons to return for the next climb.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s a comment from Michael “Skip” Scipione, Senior Game Designer for Teamfight Tactics: “With Ao Shin’s Ascent, we wanted to push TFT forward with bold new mechanics that expand on its core gameplay. Bosses evolve with shifting modifiers, and the new progression system means each run builds toward the next, letting players experiment with different approaches against an ever-changing challenge. It’s a way to expand TFT’s core mechanics while giving players new stories to create with every climb.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teamfight Tactics: Ao Shin’s Ascent launches on September 24 at 10am Pacific Time, shortly after the release of patch 15.5. The mode will be available until the end of patch 15.6 on October 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Director Tetsuya Nomura has heard the cries for updates on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a>, and he’s happy to report that development is “progressing really smoothly.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a largely inconsequential but still welcome update for two of Square Enix’s most anticipated games that arrived during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeOWfNAuVUk&amp;t=6796s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the recent Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis second anniversary broadcast</u></a>. As reported on and translated by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-three-and-kingdom-hearts-iv-development-progressing-smoothly-tetsuya-nomura-confirms" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gematsu</u></a>, Nomura took the opportunity to address waves of comments from fans hoping to see the team make an announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Apparently, [co-director Motomu] Toriyama mentioned in an interview that something might be released around the second anniversary [of <em>Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis</em>],” Nomura said when addressing comments specifically related to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series. “So that’s probably where those expectations are coming from. Right, so things are progressing really smoothly. I can’t really say more — if I suddenly went, ‘Well, actually...,’ everyone would be really surprised! [Laughs.]”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nomura goes as far as to say that the “release timing has already been decided” but stops short of clarifying when exactly Square Enix will share more. For now, he asks fans to be patient, adding that work on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 is “moving forward according to that schedule.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG fans have been on the hunt for news about the next entry in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series since its last installment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>, launched in early 2024. We know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-in-development"><u>development started as early as June 2022</u></a>, with Square Enix saying last year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027"><u>its goal is to see it launch by 2027</u></a>. Excitement for the third and final chapter in the trilogy grew even more when the team revealed that it had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix"><u>completed its story earlier this year</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Development for Kingdom Hearts 4, meanwhile, is progressing in a similarly positive direction, though Nomura says even less about when any further updates may arrive on this front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And this has also come up in the comments here and there,” Nomura added, “but <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em> is likewise steadily moving forward according to schedule, so please look forward to it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Hearts 4 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-and-kingdom-hearts-missing-link-announced-at-the-series-20th-anniversary-event"><u>announced in 2022</u></a>, and updates have been distressingly few and far between since. It wasn’t until May 2025, not even four months ago, that Square Enix was willing to share a substantial update, and even then, all fans had to hold onto was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-finally-breaks-silence-on-kingdom-hearts-4-shares-screenshots-says-its-dedicated-to-making-this-an-experience-that-lives-up-to-your-expectations"><u>a handful of new screenshots</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a short message from the team</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Hearts 4 Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts," Square Enix said at the time. “We are equally excited and can’t wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no telling when exactly we can expect to hear any additional updates on Kingdom Hearts 4 or Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3.
