            <title><![CDATA[5 New Details in The Last of Us Season 2 Release Date Teaser]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/5-new-details-in-the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-teaser</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-new-details-in-the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-teaser.1076016/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/5-new-details-in-the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-teaser<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A brand new look at The Last of Us Season Two and the video game scenes seen in the latest trailer.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warning: Spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 follow</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">HBO has just given us a brand new look at The Last of Us Season 2, which will be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-teases-an-april-2025-return-for-the-hbo-series">arriving on our television screens in April of this year</a>. It’s only a short teaser, clocking in at just under a minute, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any shots, scenes, and characters that are worth taking a closer look at. From a grief-ridden hospital corridor to an anger-harbouring, red-drenched hospital corridor, we’ve got you covered (as well as some other non-corridor-related details).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you missed it, we already did a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-two-game-references-and-new-theories-from-the-trailer">full in-depth breakdown of the first Season Two trailer</a> back in 2024, so you can read more about some of our theories about how the show might deviate from The Last of Us Part 2 game there. And we even had a go at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-predicting-season-2">predicting how this upcoming HBO season will play out</a> if you’re in the mood for pure (educated) guesswork. But stay here if you want to check out the five new details, as well as comparisons between the show and Naughty Dog’s original game that we’ve picked out from the brand-new trailer.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Last of Us Season 2 Cast: Who's New and Coming Back to the HBO Show?</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Abby’s Hospital Corridor</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/1-1736254769934.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the teaser opens we get our first glimpse at the aftermath of The Last of Us’ most pivotal scene. An abandoned hallway, bathed by a flashing red light, is soundtracked by an alarm sound that will no doubt send shivers down the spine of anyone who has played the game. Chronologically, this takes place moments after Joel’s fateful decision to rescue Ellie from the Fireflies at the end of season one. We see a panicked Abby – portrayed here by Kaitlyn Dever – walk down the corridor leading to the operating theater of St Louis’ fictional St Mary’s Hospital. In that room, she’ll find the body of her dad, the surgeon whom Joel murdered to save Ellie. It’s the action that sets the wheel in motion for Part 2’s and (we assume) Season 2’s story of spiraling revenge and violence.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Ellie’s Hospital Corridor</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/2-1736254801696.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of revenge and violence, that is exactly what is taking place in this scene just before the trailer ends, which shows Bella Ramsey’s Ellie bathed in red light in a corridor at Lakehill Seattle Hospital. This is almost certainly a replication of the moment in The Last of Us Part 2 when, having cornered one of Abby’s accomplices, Nora, Ellie proceeds to unleash what can only be described as a ferocious assault on her pleading victim. It’s a real turning point for Ellie in the game’s story as we really see for the first time how unstable she has become, and the uncomfortable lengths she’ll go in search of vengeance. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Sickle Sneak Peek</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/3-1736254830311.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Last of Us Part 2 is consistently incredibly violent, even by its predecessor’s standards, and 20 seconds into the teaser we get our first look at a bladed sickle weapon, which presumably belongs to one of the Seraphites. Also known as Scars, this cult-like faction from the game favors more workman-like weaponry such as hammers, machetes, bows, and, in this case, sickles. This may seem like a really tenuous detail, but this specific tool of destruction (or harvesting if that’s more your speed) plays a key role late in The Last of Us Part 2’s story. In a brutal showdown with a pickaxe-wielding Seraphite heavy, Abby achieves bloody victory with a Sickle, tearing apart the Seraphite’s face in a sequence that’s frequently harrowing. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. A Better Look at Isaac</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/4-1736254874896.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">At the 21 second mark we get a lovely close-up of Jeffrey Wright, who plays Isaac Dixon, the leader of the Washington Liberation Front; a paramilitary organisation that Abby works with.  Following in the footsteps of Season 1 actor Merle Dandridge (who played Marlene), Wright actually reprises his role from the game, where he provided voice and motion-capture for Dixon in The Last of Us Part 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A complicated character consumed by conflict (as many in this story are), Dixon doesn’t get a ton of screen time in the game. Here’s hoping we get a bit more of him in the show, as well as more of that fetching beard and knitwear combo.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. The Last Dance</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/5-1736254930006.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, at 24 seconds in, we get a look at one of the most memorable scenes from across both The Last of Us games – the Jackson dance. Dina, played in the HBO show by Alien Romulus’ Isabela Merced, can be seen embracing Ellie in a scene that will spark their romance. It’s a real warm moment of tenderness amongst the cold hopelessness that the rest of the story projects, which is likely why it endures as such a memorable moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be interesting to see if the chronology of events is being played around with here. In The Last of Us Part Two, the dance occurs right at the end of the story in flashback form, but we already know that Season 2 of the show is not going to reach that far into the timeline. The fact that we’re seeing it here in the trailer suggests that Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin might be tweaking the order we see these scenes, perhaps to help cement the emotional stakes of Ellie’s journey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We won’t have to wait long to see what changes, if any, have been made to The Last of Us Part Two’s story, though, with Season 2 of the show only a few months away now. What are you most excited to see in the upcoming episodes? Let us know in the comments below.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/virtua-fighter-fans-hope-the-new-game-comes-close-to-matching-this-incredible-in-engine-concept-video<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega has released what it calls a “pre-development concept video” for Virtua Fighter 6, but made clear it does not reflect how the upcoming fighting game will look and play when it eventually comes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video, below, shown during Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote speech at CES 2025, features incredibly realistic and fluid animations for a fighting game. We see an Akira mirror match with the kind of combat usually reserved for a martial arts movie.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rekindling memories of Sony’s infamous Killzone 2 reveal E3 2005 trailer, this Virtual Fighter video is a concept only, although it is “in-engine.” The animations on display are beyond what we’ve seen from fighting game gameplay in other titles, and the speed and fluidity of the movement is a step beyond normal fighting game gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega, though, made clear that what we’re seeing here should not be considered Virtua Fighter 6 gameplay, stressing: “Please note that this is a concept video created before development began. The actual gameplay and characters may differ from what is shown.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Virtua Fighter fans are excited by the return of the legendary series and the prospect that its visuals may approach the level we’re seeing in this concept video. “If they somehow manage to get the animations to look even remotely close to this in the final game, that'd be insane,” said one fan. “Regardless, I'm excited.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter 6 is in development at Yakuza / Like a Dragon studio Ryo Ga Gotoku and is without a release window or target platforms. Virtua Fighter hasn’t seen a mainline release in years, leaving mini-game appearances in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s Yakuza games and the 2021 release of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown to tide fans over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter, which includes characters such as Akira Yuki, Pai Chan, and Wolf Hawkfield, is on the hardcore end of the fighting game spectrum, with slower-paced gameplay that challenges players to master its mechanics in order to enjoy success. Virtua Fighter 5, which first released in 2006, is considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
