Recently, Amazon's been offering some great discounts on a variety of options to help you stock up your library this January for a little less than usual. Among some of the games on sale right now is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> for PS5 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QPx3MD?object_uuid=1cc99e98-64c5-4d89-93be-1f57a3552d72&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D47WTKPM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it here at Amazon</a>), which has dropped back to its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D47WTKPM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest price so far</a> of $34.99 at the retailer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Assassin’s Creed Shadows (PS5) for $34.99</h2><div catalogid="160be1b0-9cc7-4c95-b743-858848ce966d" id="234293"><div id="234293" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Assassin’s Creed Shadows - Limited Edition (Amazon Exclusive), PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This makes for a huge 50% discount from its usual list price of $69.99, which is an excellent offer to make a move on. This limited edition Amazon Exclusive copy also comes with the Sekiryu Character Pack, which gets you a gear and weapon set for Naoe, the Sekiryu Beast​, and a Dragon Tooth trinket alongside the base game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We think it's a game well worth picking up, too. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review">review</a> gave it an 8/10 score, with writer Jarrett Green saying it, "takes a flashing blade to the series’ established norms, trimming them to a more precise form in lieu of chopping them down outright."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The review continues on to say that, "Combat is aggressive and requires more intentional parrying and skill management than in the past, and exploring the gorgeous provinces of Sengoku-period Japan is encouraged thanks to the revamped map that deemphasizes collecting icons and checking off lists." Not to mention, "Naoe and Yasuke are well-realized and memorable protagonists, even though most of the story they drive follows pretty predictable paths."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it's been on your radar, now is a great time to grab it while Amazon still has it on sale. Looking for even more options that are discounted right now? Amazon's also offering deals on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-delightful-astro-bot-for-ps5-is-back-to-its-best-price-at-amazon-and-walmart">Astro Bot</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-slashes-50-off-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-as-a-little-new-years-treat">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. And outside of Amazon, you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-dropped-to-just-40-in-the-new-year-sales">save on Battlefield 6 right now at Walmart, too</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 8, 2026 2:55 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-for-ps5-is-back-to-its-lowest-price-yet-at-amazon]]></content:encoded>
