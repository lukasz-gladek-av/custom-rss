It's just for Xbox players, but at $20 off, it's still a wonderful offer and one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-cyber-monday-best-deals-2024">best Xbox Cyber Monday deals</a> right now. The action RPG is also down to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOD5YD?object_uuid=0d3b23af-501a-4b9d-a757-f6c2029255a5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$62.99 for those on PS5</a>, which is a minor discount in comparison, but still worth mentioning in case you still want to pick up the game. </p><div catalogid="b4b32288-5d7b-492c-a1a6-4f0529c42d26" id="212785"><div id="212785" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">9/10 review of the game, Leana Hafer</a> said: "Dragon Age: The Veilguard refreshes and reinvigorates a storied series that stumbled through its middle years, and leaves no doubt that it deserves its place in the RPG pantheon. The next Mass Effect is going to have a very tough act to follow, which is not something I ever imagined I'd be saying before I got swept away on this adventure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Enjoyable action combat, a fantastic cast of allies with sweeping story arcs all their own, top-notch cinematics, and moving, nuanced character writing are the wings on which this triumphant dragon soars, pulling out all the stops in a whirlwind tour of Northern Thedas and capping it with a terrific finale that’s built on memorably tough choices and consequences. If we never get another Dragon Age, at least it got to go out on a high note."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Xbox Cyber Monday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyber Monday has unleashed some of the best Xbox video game deals, offering massive savings on fan favorites and fresh releases. Another standout alongside Dragon Age? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a> for just under $50 as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve curated the top picks to make your shopping easier, but if you’re up for a treasure hunt, head over to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-cyber-monday-best-deals-2024">Amazon</a> and explore their sprawling lineup of Xbox deals. From blockbusters to hidden gems, there’s something for every gamer waiting to be scooped up.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Cyber Monday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, Black Friday was the in-store shopping frenzy, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">Cyber Monday focused on online deals</a>. While those lines have blurred, Cyber Monday remains the top event for online-focused retailers like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Even traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart roll out exclusive online-only offers. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-best-cyber-monday-deals-2024">Switch</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-playstation-cyber-monday-deals-2024">PS5 deals</a> are also now live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the same deals from Black Friday normally return for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday 2024</a>, including some that sold out or expired. Retailers often stagger their inventory, reserving stock for each major sale event. This means Cyber Monday will bring back popular deals alongside brand-new, never-before-seen offers. But, most importantly, Cyber Monday is the final day of the Black Friday, November, sale season, with all the deals going with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/on-the-gta-6-trailers-1-year-anniversary-fans-are-debating-youtube-playlist-updates-and-batting-away-misleading-ai-generated-images<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">To the moon and back. The dark side.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As if the GTA 6 community didn’t already have enough to contend with, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect">images of the moon leading fans towards dead ends</a>, now they’re pinning their hopes on an innocuous YouTube playlist update that may or may not be debunked, and are even having to contend with AI-generated images designed to hoodwink fans into thinking they’re leaked screenshots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps it was always going to descend into madness, given we’re now amid the one-year anniversary of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-rockstar-officially-unveils-first-trailer-early-after-leak">GTA 6’s record-breaking Trailer 1</a> and developer Rockstar has yet to follow it up with any new information or assets. Fans are left having to pick over what they think might be clues as to when Trailer 2 will finally drop, and there’s hardly anything to go on. So, when Rockstar’s official YouTube channel gets a playlist update this close to the one-year anniversary of GTA 6 Trailer 1, fans predictably struggled to cope.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But! This YouTube playlist update appears to be little more than a part of regular updates, at least that’s what some are saying. Stand down! Or, maybe, just lean forward on the edge of your seat. Forgive the double negative, but this doesn’t mean Rockstar won’t reveal GTA 6 Trailer 2, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, moderators of the 1.1 million member strong GTA 6 subreddit (can you imagine how many members it’ll have when the game eventually comes out?!) are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1h3zcr6/here_are_some_more_fan_made_ai_images_inspired_by/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">removing AI-generated images of GTA 6</a> that are doing the rounds, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1h4djwj/it_would_be_really_funny_if_someone_leaked_an/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">misleading some into thinking they’re official screenshots</a> when in fact they’re yet more AI slop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No AI generated fake and misleading content,” declares the sub rules. “Fake ‘leaks’ and misleading AI generated content will be removed, but quality AI generated fanart is encouraged. AI generated content will be removed at the moderators discretion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Incredibly, fans are returning to GTA 6 Trailer 1 to unearth new… information, if you can call it that. For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1h4iwyh/fact_there_are_152_feet_shown_in_the_trailer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one person counted how many feet are shown in the trailer</a> (152, if you were wondering). Another went to the trouble of coming up with a formula to work out exactly how many holes are in Lucia’s cell door net.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It <em>is</em> remarkable that Rockstar has gone nearly a year without following up GTA 6 Trailer 1 with any new information at all. With GTA 6's fall 2025 release window on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S still on the cards, according to Take-Two, you’d expect Rockstar to pipe up sooner rather than later. Perhaps this week!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, the boss of Take-Two's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1h3zd88/fact_there_are_exactly_1707_holes_in_lucias_cell/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vran_n / reddit</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
