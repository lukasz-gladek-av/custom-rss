And, you know, that scoundrel fantasy of Kay mixing with the pirate fantasy of Hondo, it just kind of makes sense, right?" Rechner told IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And we also knew that Kay would be kind of coming into her own, learning what it means to be a leader, and then having someone like Hondo as a mentor - or is he? - we thought it led to really interesting things."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The DLC adds a new adventure to the main game featuring the Rokana Raiders crime gang, the Miyuki Trade League who can supply Kay with upgrades for her Trailblazer ship, and a new blaster capability called Shock. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Outlaws is also getting a Nintendo Switch 2 release on September 4, but Rechner refused to spill details on whether the new platform would bring any new features to the game, but did say that there was more information to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In terms of a specific feature set, that's something that we will get into later. So we'll have more stuff to talk about later."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the Switch 2's features that the game could take advantage of are controllers that can be used as a mouse and a new GameChat capability. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar. She loves horror, horror movies, horror games, and French Bulldogs.

In fact, he said Nintendo's support of third-party publishers this time around was better than it has been in the past:</p><blockquote>"We're launching four titles with Nintendo Switch 2, and that's I think a bigger array of releases than we've ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform. Historically, being a third party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo has been very forthcoming in addressing that. And we're stepping up too, because we have great optimism for the platform. In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis, we obviously want to be where the consumers are. But we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalog opportunities as well."</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Take-Two is bringing Civilization 7 (June 5, launch day), the NBA 2K and WWE 2K series (unclear which games, or when), and Borderlands 4 (September 12). Those admittedly aren't surprising inclusions, as Take-Two was already publishing all four franchises on the Nintendo Switch. But Zelnick's quote does make it sound like the door could be open in the future to other releases, especially from Take-Two's back catalog. GTA 6 probably won't make the cut, but perhaps GTA V, one of these days?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke directly to Zelnick ahead of the investor call about the company's quarter, including discussion of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-development-began-in-earnest-in-2020-following-the-massive-success-of-red-dead-redemption-2-take-two-says">GTA 6's development timeline,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations">Zelnick's thoughts</a> on the game's recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">delay to next year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-labyrinths-weird-metroidvania-take-on-pac-manactually-works</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadow-labyrinth%E2%80%99s-weird-metroidvania-take-on-pac-man%E2%80%A6actually-works.1190724/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-labyrinths-weird-metroidvania-take-on-pac-manactually-works<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As an ancient gamer (now 32), I’ve had plenty of experience playing Pac-Man. During my pre-teen years, many of my summer days were spent losing quarters to my local arcade, attempting to reach the mythical "split-screen level." As a devoted fan of the franchise, I admittedly had reservations going into my PAX East preview of Bandai Namco’s new, unconventional take on the series, Shadow Labyrinth. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On paper, Shadow Labyrinth should not work. Pac-Man as a dark sci-fi metroidvania where he turns into a giant mech and shoots lasers out of his mouth sounds like bad gaming Wattpad fiction. Yet, that is exactly what it is…and Puck, Man, it was glorious. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shadow Labyrinth Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story takes place shortly after the events of the Prime Video animated short, Secret Level, as the protagonist, the dark and brooding Swordsman No. 8, wakes up surrounded by monsters and aliens. He soon meets a mysterious figure known as Puck, a yellow circular creature who looks like he enjoys eating pellets, fruit, and blue ghosts. After a brief introduction, the duo vows to work together by combining their unique abilities of strength and mobility in the hopes that they can navigate the treacherous world and survive the darkness that awaits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That darkness comes in many shapes and sizes, as the setting features a handful of different biomes, each with distinct personalities, backdrops, and characteristics. No two mazes in this 2D adventure will have the same layout, and enemy designs and types will change depending on the region that is being explored. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My preview started by placing me in an underground tech biome filled with various melee, flying, and ranged enemy types that could only exist underground, like bat-creatures and angry hedgehogs. Gameplay was straightforward and intuitive enough initially. Combat and dodging reminded me a lot of the original Castlevania titles, and its platforming elements are akin to a love child of Ori and the Blind Forest and Celeste, thanks to Puck’s ability to grapple onto spots, adding extra layers of maneuverability. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story takes place shortly after the events of the Prime Video animated short, Secret Wars.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Combining the grapple with aerial attacks makes for interesting gameplay against enemies, especially when challenge rooms come into play. Like many other Metroidvanias, Shadow Labyrinth has rooms that will seal off once entered, requiring the Swordsman to defeat each combatant inside to unlock the room. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enemies spawn in from all over the room, attempting to overwhelm with quantity and variety, making for a bullet-sponge-like environment. I frantically grappled to avoid ground foe charges while dodging flying enemies simultaneously, failing to do so multiple times, and needing to respawn. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After getting the hang of their patterns and placements, I grappled up and used melee attacks to chain movements in the air, then slammed my sword down from above on the enemies below, making for an immensely satisfying victory. While I only experienced two challenge rooms in this particular build, I was impressed with how difficult but rewarding each room was. But despite how much I enjoyed this, the true beauty of Shadow Labyrinth’s platforming and combat comes to light when Puck becomes the controllable character. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The platforming element of controlling Puck is both clever and nostalgic, as the Swordsman will morph into him and ride waves of electricity to help them move around areas otherwise blocked by environmental hazards or inaccessible heights. While riding the wave, you’ll move identically to the old Pac-Man games, but with an added twist. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Puck is still limited to moving left, right, up, or down on the violet electricity line, but he is no longer limited to a lined grid and can also stop, aim, and jump. While this might sound simple, it adds a new layer to movement and combat. Some challenge rooms even feature these lines, which can be used to execute sword attacks, creating an entirely new approach to beating each room’s combat puzzle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite instance of this occurred halfway through the preview during the Kaiju boss battle (yes, you read that right). The fight is similar to a challenge room in the sense that it blocks off any retreat, but this time it is a one-on-one fight, as the boss is much bigger than Swordsman No. 8. To combat the size difference, Swordsman No. 8 can use Puck’s ability to ride up the wall to not only get a height advantage and deal extra damage to the enemy’s horn weak spot, but also avoid massive laser attacks that would otherwise kill them both. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it turns out, the boss isn’t the only one wielding a laser, which leads to my other favorite, absurd moment in this preview: Puck can turn into a giant mecha named Gaia. Yes, this is a Metroidvania Pac-Man game where you can control a Gundam and fight Kaiju. Again, this should not work, but it does so marvelously, resulting in an epic crescendo to a fever dream of a boss battle and transformation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even after the boss battle ended, there was still plenty to explore in Shadow Labyrinth. The first thing I unlocked afterward was a pared-down version of Gaia’s laser ability, which the Swordsman can use by holding down the charge button. Not only is this move great for dispelling large groups of foes blocking an area, but it can also be thrown into attacks in locations like the challenge rooms to make for some delightful combo kills. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shadow Labyrinth Game Awards Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the new power move, I also unlocked a new location featuring another strangely familiar-looking set of enemies that would begin to float through the level toward me until they touched the ground. At first, I was confused about how to beat them, as hitting them with a sword wasn’t working. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t until I started listening to the music and sound effects and remembering why the enemies’ movements looked so familiar that a lightbulb went off: these are the Pooka from Dig Dug. Just like the 1982 classic arcade title, the only way to destroy Pooka is to stun and inflate it when they are materialized. After experimenting, it turns out that using Puck’s grapple ability on them to knock them out and then using it again to inflate them is the only way to kill them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is just one of the many references to Bandai Namco’s library of beloved arcade games, as the story and setting of Shadow Labyrinth are set to include plenty of references and modernized takes on a handful of other iconic games. While there was no hint or mention of which one it would be, the developers teased that the war-torn world of Shadow Labyrinth itself will be a major reveal as the narrative progresses.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story and setting of Shadow Labyrinth are set to include plenty of references and modernized takes on a handful of other iconic games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you had told me back then that one day someone would make a Metroidvania version of everyone’s favorite Puck Man, I’d probably think you’re insane. After playing Shadow Labyrinth at PAX East 2025, that statement is probably still true, but I’m right there beside you, enjoying the insanity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it is the fluidity of Puck’s grappling hook and wall traversal combined with Swordsman No. 8’s raw power and durability, or the fact that Pac-Man can turn into a mech that shoots lasers out of its mouth, everything about this Metroidvania is absurdly fun. The game features something for everyone here, as the platforming, combat, and puzzles each stand out on their own as enjoyable experiences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I implore you to suspend your disbelief about how this bizarre concept can even work, and at least give Shadow Labyrinth a try when it is released, as this insane creative bet by Bandai looks like it might actually pay off.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

He told me he felt “really good about it.” Three months later, perhaps to no-one’s surprise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">GTA 6 was delayed to May 26, 2026</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What changed in those few months? That’s what I asked Zelnick in a new interview to coincide with Take-Two’s just-published financial results. He said that as GTA 6 got closer to launch, the need for more polish “became clear.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As we get closer to completion of a title that’s seeking perfection, the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear,” Zelnick said. “In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6’s delay outside Take-Two’s current financial year into the next is a blow for the company’s numbers in the short term, but Zelnick told me he still feels really good about what he has coming up, including Gearbox’s Borderlands 4, Hangar 13’s Mafia: The Old Country, and of course new games in its NBA 2K and WWE 2K franchises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I feel really good about how Fiscal 26 looks sitting here today,” he said. “And while of course, delays pain me — how could they not? — the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Jason Duval Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, the obvious next question is a repeat of what I asked Zelnick back in February: how confident are you that Rockstar will hit May 26, 2026? This time around, Zelnick sounded even more certain:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think historically when we set a specific date, generally speaking, we've been very good about reaching it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That, to me, is saying GTA 6 won't be delayed without actually saying it. Never say never, of course, but now GTA 6 has an actual release date, it would be a pretty big shock if it slipped again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of GTA 6 Trailer 2 and Rockstar's accompanying info-dump has sparked all sorts of speculation about what to expect from what is sure to be the biggest video game of all time. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-some-grand-theft-auto-fans-think-liberty-city-is-a-secret-location-in-gta-6"><u>Some GTA fans even think Liberty City may end up in GTA 6 either at launch or as post-launch DLC</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, we’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2"><u>all the details we’ve discovered so far</u></a>, a roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-70-brand-new-screenshots-reveal-the-characters-and-places-of-leonida"><u>70 brand new screenshots</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-look-even-better-on-ps5-pro-experts-give-their-verdict"><u>the expert opinion on how GTA 6 will look on PS5 Pro</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Yet for all its popularity and success there are times when every player and dungeon master has thought: isn’t it all a bit too much work? Wouldn’t it be nice if we could have all the fun exploration, and exciting combat, and satisfying looting and levelling up without having to put in quite so much effort into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-dungeons-and-dragons">world-building and rules</a> overhead?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well the answer is yes: play a board game instead.

There’s no DM to run the game: you pull tiles at random as you explore the dungeon and monsters behave according to simple, yet varied, AI routines printed on their cards. But there’s still a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">narrative campaign</a>, divided into individual scenarios, with secrets to uncover, monsters to kill, and treasures to loot. Dungeons of the Mad Mage is the most recent set, but there’s a range of these and they’re all a blast to play.</p></div><p id="heroquest-game-system"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="HeroQuest Game System">HeroQuest Game System</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220835"><div id="220835" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>HeroQuest Game System</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although one of the fun things about D&amp;D board games is often the fact that you don’t need someone to take the DM’s role, having someone to narrate the experience and control the bad guys can make the experience richer for all involved. And if you do want to retain that role, this modern reprint of 1989 classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heroquest-buying-guide">HeroQuest</a> has you covered. Mechanically it’s almost exactly the same, with one player controlling the evil wizard and his minions, while the others are heroes, exploring a series of dungeons on their quest to gain experience and treasure and end the evil once and for all. As a bonus it’s also pretty simple, making a great choice for a parent to play with their kids (also see our picks for more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board games</a>).</p></div><p id="clank-legacy-acquisitions-incorpor"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Clank!

It has both the branding of the hugely popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons podcast Acquisitions Incorporated and the legacy structure meaning the game is a campaign that changes the components physically as you progress, ensuring your copy, and your adventures with it, are wholly unique. The game itself marries the exciting, chaotic deck construction and adventure of the original with a more considered, characterful narrative framework, full of surprises and humor.

While this isn’t exactly how the role-playing game tends to run, every player has had a full-on party-on-party clash at least once in their gaming career, and the game thoughtfully includes treasure chests to loot and characters to level to make it feel more authentic. Plus, the tabletop translation of the well-loved 5th edition rules is really engaging and tactically challenging.</p></div><p id="descent-legends-of-the-dark"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Descent: Legends of the Dark">Descent: Legends of the Dark</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220838"><div id="220838" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Descent: Legends of the Dark</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are an increasing number of modern adventure titles that farm the task of running the game out to an app, leaving players free to enjoy the mysteries and advance their characters through the campaign. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/descent-legends-of-the-dark-review">Descent: Legends of the Dark</a> is perhaps the most advanced in every respect. The app is very comprehensive, revealing dungeons, controlling monsters, narrating downtime and even tracking your resources to feed into an item construction feature. The physical components meanwhile, are outstanding, with a fully 3D cardboard dungeon and superbly detailed miniatures bringing the adventure to life on your tabletop. </p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-journeys-in-m"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in M">The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220839"><div id="220839" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-Earth</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dungeons &amp; Dragons is well known to have counted Tolkien's epic novel amongst its inspirations. So a board game that includes both overland and dungeon adventures alongside combat and character advancement certainly counts as a parallel. Fortunately there’s a lot more to enjoy under the hood: this is another app-driven affair, letting the players focus on the fun, while also taking the time to challenge the group with puzzles and riddles that simply wouldn’t be possible in purely physical production. Set in the time between The Hobbit and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-books-reading-order">The Lord of the Rings books</a>, it allows players to create a little slice of Middle-earth that is all their own.</p></div><p id="tiny-epic-dungeons"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tiny Epic Dungeons">Tiny Epic Dungeons</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220840"><div id="220840" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tiny Epic Dungeons</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that unites all the picks so far – aside from their similarity to D&amp;D – is an eye-watering price-point. If you want a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon crawl</a> on the cheap, look no further than this cute entry in the popular Tiny Epic series, which consistently succeeds in shrinking big themes down into small boxes. A band of heroes ventures into a unique dungeon in an attempt to level up enough to challenge the boss, but they’re up against a tough timer as their torch burns down. With a snappy playtime and a novel combat system that gives you the chance to mitigate bad results, it really feels like a huge dungeon unfolds from this very modest box. </p></div><p id="gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220841"><div id="220841" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You might have heard of Gloomhaven and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frosthaven-board-game-review">Frosthaven</a>, two of the – literally – biggest and most acclaimed board games around. What powers their popularity is the beguiling mix of adventure narrative, challenging tactics and novel mechanics, with each class given a unique deck of cards from which you have to mix and match two of your actions each turn. They’re both RPG-length campaigns in their own right but they have a little sibling, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</a>, which gives you all that mechanical goodness at a fraction of the cost and with a much more manageable campaign. Plus it’s a prequel, so if it gives you a taste for the longer fare you can jump right in and continue the story.</p></div><p id="legacy-of-dragonholt"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Legacy of Dragonholt">Legacy of Dragonholt</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220842"><div id="220842" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Legacy of Dragonholt</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re likely familiar with the concept of choose-your-own-adventure books, where you read a paragraph of text and make choices at the end about which numbered paragraph to flip to next, thereby telling your own version of the story. Legacy of Dragonholt expands that concept multifold and makes it multiplayer, creating a hugely detailed campaign with a dizzying number of options and branch points. Add in an activation token system that lets everyone have their place in decision making as well as some strategic nuance over what skills and abilities to deploy and you’ve got the ultimate text adventure to enjoy with friends, although it also works as a good <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> for that classic old-school feel.</p></div><p id="betrayal-at-baldurs-gate"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate">Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220847"><div id="220847" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Betrayal at Baldur’s Gate</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s a little different from the fantasy quest fare that dominates the rest of the list, but it still evokes the feeling of a certain kind of D&amp;D session and it has the Forgotten Realms branding, so it’s a close fit. Your team of heroes starts out working together to explore the cursed city of Baldur’s Gate by flipping tiles and looting items but, at some point, a haunt will begin. This is revealed from a narrative book which will give you the win conditions for your game and often pits one player as a traitor, working against the others. It’s an exciting setup with tons of variety that often boils down to a thrilling conclusion of heroism trying to win out against the encroaching darkness.</p></div><p id="dd-bedlam-in-neverwinter"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="D&amp;D: Bedlam in Neverwinter">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Bedlam in Neverwinter</h2></p><div catalogid="6fd2e572-0802-41e5-85f1-74a15203935c" id="220848"><div id="220848" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Bedlam in Neverwinter</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another off-the-wall pick that focuses on the puzzle aspects of dungeoneering over the adventure, this is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-escape-room-board-games">escape-room style board game</a> which sees you having to figure out a variety of traps, tricks and riddles as you investigate a mystery in the iconic Icewind Dale setting. It’s aimed at all ages, and is only playable once, after which you can trade or sell it, but it’s got a unique spin on the genre which mixes in some simplistic exploration, role-playing opportunities and combat mechanics for that real <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-board-games">tabletop RPG</a> flavor, and the unfolding narrative builds toward an epic conclusion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance writer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.
