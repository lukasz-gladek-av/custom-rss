The company said the patch’s early April release date, set to arrive a little over a month after the game itself, "will give hunters enough time to prepare for the new content, and challenges, that await them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Title Update 1 adds a new level of challenge: “Prepare your gear, and resolve, hunters!” Capcom said. “TU1 will bring with it a monster of formidable strength at a level above Tempered!” Meanwhile, a new challenging monster will be added with Title Update 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Title Update 1 also adds an endgame place to gather. “A new place to meet, communicate, have meals together and more with other hunters will be added to Monster Hunter Wilds in TU1!” Capcom said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This area will be available to hunters who have completed the main story, so get hunting and be ready!”</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Early reaction to the news that Title Update 1 will add a place for endgame players to gather has been mixed, with some welcoming the addition, others wondering why it’s not in the game at launch. It sounds very much like a Gathering Hub from previous Monster Hunter games, but as some have pointed out, it’s interesting that Capcom has chosen not to call it that here. While other players can turn up in your camp, Monster Hunter Wilds lacks a true social hub, so hopefully whatever this is will fill the void.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom released a few images showcasing this new place to gather:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Capcom issued a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-mixed-steam-user-review-rating-capcom-issues-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-troubleshooting-guide">Monster Hunter Wilds troubleshooting guide</a> amid ‘mixed’ Steam user reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Things_Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Doesn%27t_Tell_You_-_Tips">what Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you</a>, and a guide to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">all 14 weapon types</a> in the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pok-stop-pokmon-go-players-launch-campaign-after-sale-report-stokes-monetization-fear<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Niantic’s augmented reality video game phenomenon, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, may soon find itself under new ownership — and some fans are already working to keep it from reaching this next stage in its evolution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Long-time players of The Pokémon Company’s trend-setting mobile experience were sent into a frenzy last week when a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg</u></a> report suggested that Niantic was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-developer-niantic-reportedly-in-talks-to-sell-video-game-business-to-saudi-owned-company-behind-stumble-guys"><u>in talks to sell its video game efforts to Saudi-owned company Scopely</u></a> for around $3.5 billion. It’s a deal that could involve the trade of titles such as Monster Hunter Now, Pikmin Bloom, and, yes, Pokémon Go, with an announcement reportedly expected to arrive soon. There’s been no word on how significantly a leadership change could impact in-game mechanics and microtransactions... yet.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">With Scopely in the picture, this is what we’re looking at. There goes my desire to play pogo. 😬🤬 <a href="https://t.co/UKYLFV7VKX" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/UKYLFV7VKX</a></p>— AmyWiedy (@Amy_Wiedy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Amy_Wiedy/status/1892380485940085226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Scopely oversees a fleet of notable mobile experiences that range from board game offshoots like Scrabble Go and Monopoly Go! to games like Stumble Guys and Marvel Strike Force. The one element scaring Pokémon Go players more than anything else is the microtransaction practices these titles are notorious for. With the real-life-adventure spinoff continuing to play a crucial part in players’ lives nine years after its release, thousands of fans are concerned that things could take a turn for the worse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They will still probably release Mewtwo X and Y, except you have to pay $100 just for a chance to get them,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/1ist4yc/comment/mdki28l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user theorized</u></a>. “If everyone here knew what they did to Marvel Strike Force, we'd all panic. They will absolutely drive this game into the ground.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Looking for an Everstone</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Fear of Scopely ownership stems more from the aggression behind these monetization tactics rather than the tactics themselves, and it’s this same fear that drove Reddit user and long-time Pokémon Go fan Tetrylene to take action. As rumors of Niantic’s interest in a sale gained momentum, he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1itre34/write_to_the_pok%C3%A9mon_company_if_youre_concerned/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>published a post</u></a> in hopes of organizing a campaign for other Pokémon Go-ers to respectfully let The Pokémon Company know that, regardless of ownership, there are certain changes they won’t stand for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But here’s the thing: we must try and exert some leverage,” Tetrylene’s post says. “By reaching out to (The Pokémon Company) we can express our concerns and emphasize the importance of maintaining some semblance of [the] game’s current ethos. They’ve invested heavily in the Pokémon brand and are likely to be receptive to feedback that could impact its reputation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That post, now more than one week old, generated 1.4K upvotes with hundreds of comments from like-minded fans. Tetrylene tells us his initiative began with a desire to bring the community’s concerns front and center. There’s no telling if the message will actually reach The Pokémon Company in a meaningful way, but he says the discussion his post has brought to the table was well worth the effort.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is all very defensive, but part of me hopes that there's a chance that the new owners want to capitalise on the incredible potential of the game rather than bleed it dry.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the same vein that loot boxes have all but been turned into a toxic monetisation option for the industry, I hope that our pushback sends a signal that there is absolutely a limit to how much a player base will put up with,” Tetrylene explained. “This is all very defensive, but part of me hopes that there's a chance that the new owners want to capitalise on the incredible potential of the game rather than bleed it dry. The door is wide open to both possibilities; I hope we can try and guide them towards the former rather than the latter.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any one of the other millions of Pokémon fans, Tetrylene holds a few Pokémon close to his heart — his favorite is a tie between Groudon and Metagross. When he says “Gen 3 for life,” he means it. He tells us Pokémon Go has been his go-to hobby for two-and-a-half years, adding that the mobile game has also served as an excuse to meet up with friends at least once a week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s blossomed into an activity that sees Tetrylene co-leading an active group of nearly 70 players. It’s led to trips to new cities — and new friends. While much of the world moved on from Pokémon Go when the honeymoon phase eventually wore off, a dedicated group of trainers continues to routinely connect with others, show off their Pokémon collection, and battle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Type Advantage</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">No two players enjoy Pokémon Go in the same way, though. For every casual Pokémon Go fan there is one who has spent thousands of dollars on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit user and a self-proclaimed Pokémon Go big-spender known as a “whale,” NextLevelEvolution, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/1iu3ccv/open_letter_to_scopely_from_a_pokemon_go_whale/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>penned an open letter to Scopely</u></a> amid rumors of Niantic’s potential sale. It stops short of being a call-to-action but does come with the warning that a more aggressive monetization strategy would likely “break trust with the user base” and “alter the game enough that it would no longer be considered a true Pokémon-franchise experience” by fans.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I hope the spirit of this game is not lost to make another quick buck.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“For me, Pokémon is extremely nostalgic. And I believe Pokémon Go is in a pretty good place right now and on a generally upward trajectory for the first time in several years,” NextLevelEvolution told IGN. “At their best, Pokémon games are about adventure and discovery. When Pokémon Go first came out, the idea that I could be a Pokémon trainer in the real world was enough to get me and millions of others hooked. I hope the spirit of this game is not lost to make another quick buck.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They say they’re aware of other whales who have spent “many thousands of dollars” per year, and “none of them are excited about the possibility of Scopely purchasing Pokémon Go.” For now, NextLevelEvolution isn’t optimistic that a community-driven movement to bar aggressive monetization tactics will gain enough momentum to make a difference, but they’re at least willing to vote with their wallet if worse comes to worst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m not particularly hopeful that this will have any effect,” they explained. “But I can tell you that if I have to pay to get rid of ads in the game, then they will lose me as a customer entirely and many other whales I know as well.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Stay Aware of Your Surroundings</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s debate surrounding the current state of Pokémon Go and if existence under the Scopely banner would actually result in a worse experience. Regardless of how the game has been or will be monetized, Niantic has spent nine years molding it into something that is both beloved and messy. Tetrylene has a laundry list of tweaks he’d like to see implemented that includes the ability to skip certain animations, an NPC to trade with, new points of interest, fleshed-out in-game communication options, and more thoughtful placement for raids.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The general consensus is that Pokémon Go needs some upkeep, but its most devoted fans still see the experience as a once-in-a-lifetime hobby that is as exciting as it is fragile. For them, it’s hard to look at how Scopely has monetized other titles and not see it as a threat to a fun pastime and the tool millions use to stay connected.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’ve got mixed feelings with the news that pokémon go is being sold to scopely for $3.5 billion</p><p>it could revive the game, or we could see ourselves watching 10 second ads after spinning a pokéstop</p><p>I shit on niantic as much as the next guy but lowkey kinda worried <a href="https://t.co/MOgMx3tdpk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/MOgMx3tdpk</a></p></div>— PoGOCentral (@pogo_central) <a href="https://twitter.com/pogo_central/status/1892050096637780357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Tetrylene hopes the momentum continues but has at least been “pleasantly surprised” by how the community has responded to their call to action. He says pulling players together in this way has resulted in some already reaching out to The Pokémon Company to make a difference. Without confirmation that Niantic is actually looking to sell, Pokémon Go remains as something Tetrylene calls “the ultimate social hobby.” What it might look like in the coming years remains a mystery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There will never be another game like Pokémon Go,” the community organizer told us in one final message to The Pokémon Company. “There is no other game that can truly claim to be social in the way that this one is. There may never be another game — of any genre — that fosters a global community on this scale, even after nearly a decade. There still is no other mobile game that lets you stumble through an unfamiliar place and quickly find new friends for life.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “The prospect of losing all of this to a cold investment firm that doesn't care for any of that truly saddens me. Does the journey really end here? It doesn’t have to. Pokémon GO still has so much left to give. Let it soar.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted The Pokémon Company and Niantic for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

It is the first Capcom game to hit 1 million concurrents on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next in its sights is Valve's MOBA, Dota 2, which has an all-time peak concurrent count of 1,295,114. It seems likely Monster Hunter Wilds will overtake it this weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is currently the second most-played game on Steam behind only Valve's own Counter-Strike 2, with an incredible 1,076,024 concurrents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has enjoyed a huge launch, with nearly 1 million concurrent players on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom’s action adventure game launched on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and quickly became the eighth most-played game on Steam of all-time with an incredible 987,482 concurrent users.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put it into context, that’s ahead of the all-time peaks of best-sellers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>. It’s already outstripped its predecessor on Steam, where 2018's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter World</a> enjoyed a peak concurrent figure of 334,684.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s worth noting that Monster Hunter Wilds’ actual peak concurrent figure will be much higher, given neither Sony nor Microsoft report player numbers.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is how high can that Steam concurrent figure go as Monster Hunter Wilds heads into its first weekend on sale and beyond. It seems likely it will crack the 1 million concurrents mark later today, overtaking <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> in the process. Could 2 million be possible?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Capcom is yet to announce a sales figure for Monster Hunter Wilds, all signs point to a hugely successful release. (Monster Hunter World topped 25 million sales in six years to cement its position as Capcom's best-selling title ever.) However, the game has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, with some reporting performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Monster Hunter Wilds review</a> returned an 8/10.
