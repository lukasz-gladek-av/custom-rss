The sequel game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, is set to arrive in June and the franchise’s star, actor Norman Reedus, recently teased some of the game — as well as a key tidbit about the future film adaptation — in an interview with IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If it was an option, yeah, for sure,” Reedus revealed when asked if he would consider playing himself in a future film version of the game which was announced to be in the works from Michael Sarnoski and A24 last month. “I don’t know what’s happening with it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-spoiler-amano-matsuda<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Popular commanders are getting classic Amano art reprints.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">pre-orders</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mtg-final-fantasy-starter-kit-preorder-where-to-buy-in-stock-amazon">sell out</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-commander-decks-are-packed-with-fun-surprising-references">tons of references are revealed</a>, Magic: The Gathering's upcoming crossover with Final Fantasy is shaping up to be its biggest ever. Today, we get to add to that fun with six cards that are available in the upcoming set: three featuring classic concept art by Yoshitaka Amano, and three with more recent art by Toshitaka Matsuda.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the gallery below to see all six cards</strong>, and read on to learn where to find them yourself:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering x Final Fantasy - 6 Through the Ages Cards</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cards we are revealing today are part of the "Through the Ages" bonus sheet that is within the larger main set. That means they are all reprints of existing cards reskinned with concept art and characters from different Final Fantasy games - so while there are no brand new or mechanically unique cards here like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-your-first-look-at-over-a-dozen-new-cards-from-magic-the-gatherings-upcoming-final-fantasy-set">the ones that have been shown off recently</a> or those in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">the Commander decks we previously revealed</a>, they do have art that stretches back all the way to the very first game in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the cards in the main set, Through the Ages cards do not become legal in Magic's Standard format (though they still are if the existing card was already legal there, of course), essentially just making them alternate art versions of those cards. That said, they can be found in both the fancier Collector Boosters as well as one in every three of the regular Play Boosters that are used for Limited events like Draft and Sealed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means if you plan to play a lot of this set either at your local game store or digitally on something like Magic: The Gathering Arena, you are likely to see these cards in action quite frequently. Five of the six cards here are Rares, which means they won't show up as often, but Thrum of the Vestige is notably an Uncommon. That's a reskin for one of Magic's most ubiquitous cards, Lightning Bolt, and I wouldn't be surprised if this particular printing has quite the impact on the set.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warrior of Light reprinting of Jodah, the Unifier is also certain to be a popular one - Jodah is a powerful and common Commander, and the art used here is Amano's from the Japanese boxart of the original Final Fantasy. Similarly, Amano's iconic art for Final Fantasy 4's Cecil Harvey has been repurposed for one of Magic's strongest partner commanders, Tymna the Weaver, which has only ever been reprinted once before this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cards launch physically as part of the larger Final Fantasy set on June 13, with the digital versions going live on MTG Arena and MTGO on June 10. And if you are a Final Fantasy fan who isn't into Magic yet, there is still reason to be excited, as FF7 Remake series director Tetsuya Nomura said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-reason-why-sephiroth-has-a-different-design-in-the-magic-the-gathering-set-but-director-tetsuya-nomura-cant-share-more-sparking-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-speculation">the design of Sephiroth on one card is different for some cryptic reason</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

A mere vessel without a soul. Someone like Matt Sloan (voice of Darth Vader in various video games and shows) carries more sentiment to this role than an AI ever could. Not to mention that Generative-AI is quite harmful to the environment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As long as we don't have a way of finding renewable energy or a way to minimize harming our future generations, I can't see any 'fun' behind this," they added. "Sure, Darth may comment on sweaty players or comment on his hatred for sand, but is that worth [it] in [the] long-term? Is this small addition really needed to enhance our experience in the bigger sacrifice of polluting our world?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nothing in this world is certain, except death, taxes, and the internet making AI racist," added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1ko0lla/comment/msmm0eq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another</u></a>, while one simply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1ko0lla/comment/msmofg9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "Leave it to the internet to take a cool thing and ruin it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is probably a timely opportunity to remind parents that players under 13 or their country’s age of digital consent, whichever is higher, will need their parent or guardian’s permission to talk with Darth Vader. You can approve or deny Darth's shenanigans by heading to Epic Games' parental controls and selecting “allow voice and written communication with AI Features."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

It's unclear if the port will release digitally-only or be sold as a physical edition, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We considered Red Dead Redemption 2 a "masterpiece" when it released in 2018, awarding it a 10/10. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review"><u>IGN's Red Dead Redemption 2 review</u></a> said: "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open-world ode to the outlaw era."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps red Dead Redemption 2 coming to Switch 2 wouldn't come as a huge surprise. In a Q&amp;A with investors following Take-Two's most recent financial results, CEO Strauss Zelnick answered a question about the publisher's support of the Switch 2 by saying he felt "great optimism" for Nintendo's new platform. In fact, he said Nintendo's support of third-party publishers this time around was better than it had been in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're launching four titles with Nintendo Switch 2, and that's I think a bigger array of releases than we've ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform," he said. "Historically, being a third-party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo has been very forthcoming in addressing that. And we're stepping up too, because we have great optimism for the platform. In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis, we obviously want to be where the consumers are. But we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalog opportunities as well."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Take-Two is bringing Civilization 7 (June 5, launch day), the NBA 2K and WWE 2K series (unclear which games, or when), and Borderlands 4 (September 12). Those admittedly aren't surprising inclusions, as Take-Two was already publishing all four franchises on the Nintendo Switch. But Zelnick's quote does make it sound like the door could be open in the future to other releases, especially from Take-Two's back catalog. GTA 6 probably won't make the cut, but perhaps GTA V or red Dead Redemption 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

Earn enough, and you could even end up buying some free cards from this gorgeous set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, while the above are incredibly pretty, several of the singles from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-commander-decks-are-packed-with-fun-surprising-references">Final Fantasy MTG sets</a> can be quite expensive (like with any TCG), especially with several borderless or Surge Foil cards skyrocketing towards $600.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if the expense of buying these pricey options are putting you off, after grabbing the incredibly affordable FF MTG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mtg-final-fantasy-starter-kit-preorder-where-to-buy-in-stock-amazon">starter kit</a> for $20, try grabbing one of my handpicked, top 10 MTG cards from the Final Fantasy set, and earn some extra credit to complete your collection by the time the set launches on June 13. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Traveling Chocobo</h2><div id="220920" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="bb6f76ab-0591-47bd-ac44-2bd2418c7022"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Traveling Chocobo 210</h3></p></div><div catalogid="bb6f76ab-0591-47bd-ac44-2bd2418c7022" id="220921"><div id="220921" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Traveling Chocobo 406</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you’re unable to grab one of the very rare <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/final-fantasy-x-magic-the-gathering-official-limited-gold-chocobo-teaser">limited edition gold version</a> of the Traveling Chocobo, even the standard Creature is worth buying. That’s due to the awesome ability to look and play lands and Bird spells from the top of your library. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Vivi Ornitier</h2></div><div catalogid="37faa0e2-014c-4f36-8a63-42c4d9428082" id="220922"><div id="220922" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vivi Ornitier, 248</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from just saying “because it’s Vivi”, this Magic: The Gathering version of the iconic mage brings a lot of fun chaos to the game by being able to cast spells and deal damage quickly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Summon: Shiva</h2></div><div id="220923" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="56d92c9c-3ac7-4372-8146-57b80c5f7a96"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Summon: Shiva 78</h3></p></div><div catalogid="56d92c9c-3ac7-4372-8146-57b80c5f7a96" id="220924"><div id="220924" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Summon: Shiva 362</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Both a creature and saga, which is one of the interesting elements of the set. This comes with stun counter capabilities, and being able to draw more cards from chapter III, which make it a essential for Blue decks,</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tidus, Yuna's Guardian</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Tidus may not come with any HA HA HAs, but this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">Commander card version</a> of the Final Fantasy X protagonist is another great addition for Magic: The Gathering collectors — thanks to his handy counter-based capabilities.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cloud, Ex-Solider</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Providing lots of draw power whenever Cloud attacks, this is arguably the best Cloud card in the set. That's since you can make use of the extra generated Treasure Tokens to make equipping to your other creatures far easier — making it great for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-commander-decks-are-packed-with-fun-surprising-references">Commander decks</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Jumbo Cactuar</h2></div><div id="220933" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="d9acf9e0-2dee-4bc5-9927-0fac3a8fab60"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Jumbo Cactuar 191</h3></p></div><div catalogid="d9acf9e0-2dee-4bc5-9927-0fac3a8fab60" id="220934"><div id="220934" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Jumbo Cactuar 343</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Get ready to execute fun combos with this prickly 1/7 customer. Jumbo Cactuar's for trolling your opponents, just like it does in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy VIII</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cecil, Dark Knight</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">An interesting legendary human knight who, when you meet the life total requirement to untap it, you can transform it into Cecil, Redeemed Paladin — which has a handy ability to give your other attacking creatures indestructible. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kefka, Court Mage </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with its jaw-dropping artwork in the 0322 borderless version, Kefka comes with an interesting ability to dismantle your opponent’s hand whilst building up your own with additional draws. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sazh’s Chocobo</h2></div><div catalogid="26c301a6-b89c-463c-90ef-2c017d987015" id="220968"><div id="220968" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sazh's Chocobo 200</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Both an adorable and reliable card that gives you a very impressive +1/+1 counter when a land you control enters. It may not be the best card in the set, but the 1 mana cost almost makes it a must.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Y ’shtola, Night’s Blessed</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A powerful commander card, Y’shtola has some great flexibility to fit into a variety of decks that make this cat warlock a must-buy. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is TCGPlayer?</h2></div><div catalogid="06768200-0c92-4384-ac59-796eda0f5488" id="218511"><div id="218511" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TCG Player</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think TCGPlayer is the smartest place to spend money if you know what cards you're chasing. Instead of rolling the dice on booster packs, you can just go buy the singles you want, or even check out other regions sets like with Pokémon TCG's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-glory-of-team-rocket-single-prices-crashed-japanese">Japanese Glory of Team Rocket</a> set that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-preview">Destined Rivals</a> is drawing from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also where I go to <strong>check actual card values</strong> instead of relying on whatever price Amazon randomly assigns. There are deals to be had, you just have to be willing to search a bit. It’s TCG eBay, but cleaner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.
