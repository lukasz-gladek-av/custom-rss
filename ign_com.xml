            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Keanu Reeves would love to play Johnny Silverhand again, but how can he given the events of Cyberpunk 2077? It turns out Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith has worked out a way to make it make sense, and has told the much-loved actor: “contact me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, speaking with IGN while promoting his movie Good Fortune, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">Keanu Reeves said that he wanted to be part of the sequel to CD Projekt's 2020 game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Absolutely. I’d love to play Johnny Silverhand again," Reeves said when asked if he’d be interested in revisiting his legendary rockstar terrorist character in Cyberpunk 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reeves's love-affair with the Cyberpunk community began with his viral "you're breathtaking" moment at E3 2019. Reeves, on-stage to announce the release date of Cyberpunk 2077, was interrupted by a fan who shouted out "you're breathtaking!" Reeves' response was to double-down with his own "you're breathtaking... you're all breathtaking!" Cue wholesome memes across the internet forever more. You can see the iconic gamer moment in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, could Reeves actually play Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2 even if he wanted to? In other words, could Johnny Silverhand return in the sequel, given the events of Cyberpunk 2077?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077 follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While many players believe Cyberpunk 2077 provided a suitable ending for Johnny and V's story, depending on which ending of the game CD Projekt makes canon for Cyberpunk 2, the door may be left open for Reeves' return. Could Johnny return in cameo form perhaps, having downloaded himself into someone or something else? Canon ending dependent, could V end up becoming Johnny Silverhand in mind and body for Cyberpunk 2? Perhaps we could see Johnny as part of a flashback to events before Cyberpunk 2077, as Cyberpunk 2077 had?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">A History of Keanu Reeves in Video Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like Mike Pondsmith has been thinking about this ever since Reeves’ interview with IGN. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc?si=Ta51TFmBnop3th3L" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CD Projekt livestream to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Cyberpunk 2077</a>, Mike Pondsmith said, matter of factly: “Not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again. I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pondsmith, understandably, did not reveal what those “ways” were, but as we’ve mentioned, there are plenty of theories fans have come up with to make it make sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reeves isn’t the only big Hollywood name to appear in Cyberpunk 2077. Idris Elba starred in the successful expansion, Phantom Liberty, which Pondsmith was delighted by. Indeed, he revealed he worried that CD Projekt might get sued because his character, looked so much like Elba, before it was revealed it actually was Elba playing the role.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"'So let me get this straight,'" Pondsmith recalled of his reaction to the news. "'You got Keanu Reeves, and then you turn around and get Idris Elba. What's next? Scarlett Johansson?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Scarlett, you know, I have roles for you. You can do anything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlett Johansson in Cyberpunk 2? That remains to be seen. But Pondsmith has been chatty about the hotly anticipated sequel in the past. In May, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-has-night-city-and-another-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-mike-pondsmith-teases"><u>Pondsmith teased some previously unknown details</u></a> when he was asked about the scope of his involvement with Cyberpunk 2 (then known as Project Orion) at the Digital Dragons 2025 conference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pondsmith admitted he wasn’t as involved this time around, but said he does review scripts and had been to CD Projekt to check out the ongoing work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Last week I was wandering around talking to different departments, and seeing what they had, ‘Oh look, this is the new cyberware, what do you think?’ ‘Oh yeah, that’s pretty good, that works here.’"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the morsel on the sequel: that it features a brand new city in addition to the Night City we know from Cyberpunk 2077. Pondsmith described this new city as “like Chicago gone wrong.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion, because there’s another city we visit — I’m not telling you any more than that but there’s another city we visit. And Night City is still there. But I remember looking at it and going, yeah I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work. And it doesn’t feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, ‘Yeah, I can see this working.'”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/03/gettyimages-1154859517-1762173368424.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Could Keanu Reeves reprise his role as Johnny Silverhand for Cyberpunk 2?

It may well be a take on future Chicago, but that isn’t confirmed based on these comments. There is also some debate about whether Cyberpunk 2 will expand upon the Night City that’s in Cyberpunk 2077 or feature a new version, and the extent to which it is playable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like we'll have to wait some time to find out. CD Projekt is of course focusing on The Witcher 4, and CD Projekt co-CEO Michał Nowakowski has suggested Cyberpunk 2 won’t be out until at least 2030.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"It wouldn't really have worked in the same way elsewhere."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Rockstar boss Dan Houser has explained why the Grand Theft Auto series won’t leave the United States in terms of its setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=udC7HKm43mCRmXtt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Lex Fridman podcast</a>, Rockstar co-founder and former lead writer Houser said that — GTA London apart — Grand Theft Auto remained firmly rooted in the United States because it leans so heavily on Americana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We made a little thing in London 26 years ago — GTA London — for the top-down for PS1. That was pretty cute and fun, as the first mission pack ever for PlayStation 1. I think for a full GTA game, we always decided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP, it would be really hard to make it work in London or anywhere else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You know, you needed guns, you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective. But that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't really have worked in the same way elsewhere.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a trend that’s set to continue with next year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>, which is set in the fictional U.S. state of Leonida (a reimagining of Florida). And based on the two GTA 6 trailers we've seen so far, that parody of American culture is once again front and center.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an interesting time, then, to wonder if GTA might hop on a plane and venture abroad at some point in the future. But it feels unlikely, not just based on Houser’s comments, but based on the GTA brand — built up over decades at this point — and what the public expects from it. Indeed, such is GTA’s relationship with America over the course of its many video games, that a University of Tennessee history professor will teach a GTA college history class early in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-got-a-gta-college-history-class-before-gta-6">Professor Tore Olsson recently told IGN</a>: “Video games are great at conjuring fictional worlds, but they also impact players’ thinking about real-world times and places. And just as Red Dead Redemption 2 has shaped folks’ perception of the nineteenth-century American West or Ghost of Tsushima has informed their vision of feudal Japan, millions of people around the globe imagine contemporary America through the lens of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Just think of how many GTA veterans have recognized landmarks in Los Angeles and New York thanks to their hours in Los Santos and Liberty City!”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Houser’s position on GTA is similar to that of the creators of post-apocalyptic role-playing game series Fallout, which has also remained in the United States. Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-explains-why-bethesda-plans-to-keep-fallout-set-in-the-us">Bethesda development chief Todd Howard ruled out leaving the U.S. behind for a future Fallout video game</a>, saying he’s a big fan of the “Americana naivete” that informs so much of Fallout’s tone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the wait for GTA 6 goes on, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026"><u>May 26, 2026</u></a> the current release date. We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2"><u>all the details we’ve discovered so far</u></a>, a roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-70-brand-new-screenshots-reveal-the-characters-and-places-of-leonida"><u>70 brand new screenshots</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-look-even-better-on-ps5-pro-experts-give-their-verdict"><u>the expert opinion on how GTA 6 will look on PS5 Pro</u></a>. As for how much will Grand Theft Auto 6 cost? Amid the speculation, new research has suggested that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-gta-6-cost-new-research-claims-100-price-point-would-actually-leave-money-on-the-table"><u>a $100 price point would actually earn Rockstar less money than if went for the “sweet spot” of $70</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
