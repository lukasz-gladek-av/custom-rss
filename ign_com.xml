            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-keeps-its-fans-in-the-loop-with-overwatch-2-stadium-summer-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard Entertainment has unveiled its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2"><u>Overwatch 2</u></a> Stadium roadmap for 2025, teasing some of the heroes and features it plans to add in Season 17, Season 18, Season 19, and beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind the pioneering hero shooter dived into the details of its new mode’s past, present, and future with <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24198087/directors-take-past-present-and-future-of-stadium" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Director’s Take blog post</a> from game director Aaron Keller. It comes with a surprise summer roadmap now that the mode has been available for a little longer than a week, while also clarifying how the mode got its start and how it’s performed so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Stadium Gets 7 New Heroes This Summer</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stadium rollout will press forward when new Damage hero Freja joins its limited roster with a mid-season patch for Season 16, but it’s Season 17 in June that will really kick things up a notch. Junkrat, Sigma, and Zenyatta will be added to the strategic multiplayer mode’s list of playable heroes at this time, bringing along the Esperança Push map and Samoa Control map with them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard will also use this time to further flesh out how Stadium works by adding in things like Unranked Crossplay, new all-star rewards, custom games, additional example builds, and an option to save and share builds. It’s unclear if all heroes and features will arrive at the start of Season 17 or if they will be released throughout the season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 18 sends in Overwatch’s gorilla icon, Winston, as a playable character, with Sojourn and Brigitte set to join, too. Route 66 and London maps will also join the pool at this time, as will a Payload Race game mode, which comes with two new maps, a Stadium trials feature, and, finally, the freedom to Endorse your teammates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard’s transparency regarding Stadium’s development comes with the assurance that “multiple new heroes,” both from Overwatch 2’s existing roster and characters that have yet to be revealed, will be added to the mode every season. For Season 19 and beyond, a new China map is on the way, with a Draft Mode feature, consumables, item system tweaks, and more also in the works.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/01/ow2-2025-stadium-roadmap-1920x1080-sa04-1746118213808.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Overwatch 2 Stadium summer 2025 roadmap. Image courtesy of Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How has Stadium Performed so Far?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Overwatch 2 team also shared Stadium stats that reveal how players have decided to spend their time with Blizzard’s new mode. It’s currently “eclipsing” Quick Play and Competitive, making it Overwatch 2’s most played mode with 2.3 million matches played across 7.8 million hours during launch week alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It secures the lengthy game mode’s stats at more than double what was seen with Overwatch Classic’s launch week. Other interesting stats crown Lucio as both the hero with the highest win rate and the lowest pick rate, while players have managed to spend 900 billion Stadium Cash when choosing 206 million items for their builds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keller’s Director’s Take touches on a few important details related to the development of Stadium, too. One important note saw the game director confirming the mode has been in development before Overwatch 2 launched. Though the team has touched on this timeline in the past, his comment should help squash prevailing fan theories that Stadium was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-dev-blizzard-welcomes-marvel-rivals-competition-says-its-never-faced-another-game-so-similar-to-the-one-weve-created"><u>born out of Blizzard’s desire to compete with Marvel Rivals</u></a>, which launched December 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keller says Blizzard will keep up the communication going forward, promising to release more insight into Stadium next week with an additional Director’s take. Meanwhile, he also confirms that, while Stadium has entered the discussion as a massively popular addition to Overwatch 2, Blizzard remains committed to maintaining other core experiences such as standard Quick Play and Competitive options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Before signing off, I'd like to reiterate the team’s commitment to the Core modes of Overwatch," Keller clarified. "We’re still pouring as much time, energy and passion into these as we always have. Stadium isn't competing for those resources: it’s giving us more opportunities to deliver Overwatch in a new, exciting way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We can't wait for you to see what's coming there, especially Season 18. It's going to be a banger! Have fun with Stadium and, as always, let’s make a great game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 brought Stadium to players when Season 16 launched last week. It’s part of Blizzard’s ongoing initiative to reinvigorate its player base, which began with an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode"><u>all-encompassing Spotlight presentation</u></a> in February. It’s led to the return of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-overwatch-fans-are-thrilled-loot-boxes-are-coming-back-some-not-so-much"><u>loot boxes</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-becoming-the-worst-user-reviewed-game-ever-on-steam-overwatch-2s-recent-reviews-jump-to-mixed"><u>an improved Steam rating</u></a> as players celebrate <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-years-of-struggle-blizzard-has-found-itself-in-uncharted-territory-overwatch-players-are-having-fun-again"><u>what some feel is the best Overwatch experience fans have seen in years</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for more udpates, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/overwatch-2/Overwatch_2_Stadium_Details">our guide to learn more about how Stadium works</a>.

This  909 piece set costs $99.99 and release August 1st, 2025. This set is an intricate recreation of the Batmobile from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/02/batman-forever-review">1995 film Batman Forever</a>, starring Val Kilmer as Batman/ Bruce Wayne, Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face, and Jim Carrey famously (infamously?) as the Riddler. </p><p id="batman-forever-batmobile"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Batman Forever Batmobile">Preorder the LEGO Batman Forever Batmobile</h2></p><div catalogid="8b6a1fc4-a111-4510-9d37-c281936bebb3" id="219980"><div id="219980" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Batman Forever Batmobile</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The set itself is a faithful to-scale model of the on-screen Batmobile, complete with the blue neon lights and rims and other features. The sleek shape and design is very reminscent of the time, making this the perfect shelf filler for fans of the Schumacher/ Burton-era Batman films. It also includes a Batman Forever display stand for the new Batsuit mini-figure. Interestingly, there isn't a a new Riddler or Two-Face mini-figure to go along with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-lego-batman-sets">Batman LEGO set</a> is only the latest Batmobile to join the lineup. The previous version of the iconic car that LEGO released was based on the classic 1966 TV series and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-lego-batman-classic-tv-series-batmobile">came out back in October 2024</a>. That particular Batmobile set cost $149 and has yet to go down in price, so $100 for the latest set seems like a pretty good price comparatively.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More LEGO Batman sets available now</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're on the hunt for more upcoming LEGO sets, make sure to browse our guide of all of the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-lego-sets-may-2025">LEGO options releasing in May 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
