It means that for now at least, GTA 6 is still on track for its previously announced release window and has not been delayed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN ahead of the release of its financial report, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that while "there's always a risk of slippage," the company "feel really good about it [fall 2025]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Zelnick responded when IGN asked how confident he was that Rockstar will hit fall 2025 for GTA 6. "So we feel really good about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked for an update on how development on GTA 6 is going, Zelnick kept his cards close to his chest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally," he said. "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organization is super excited."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GTA 6 release date is one of the hottest topics in all of entertainment, with rival publishers waiting with bated breath for Rockstar to make its announcement. Earlier this week, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-boss-willing-to-move-battlefield-release-date-to-account-for-nuanced-year-relative-to-competition-cough-gta-6-cough">he was willing to delay the new Battlefield</a> out of the next fiscal year depending on the release timing of its competitors’ games, a thinly veiled nod to the behemoth that is GTA 6.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While its release window remains firm, GTA 6's much-wanted Trailer 2 has yet to materialize. We're now over a year since Trailer 1's release, a gap that has caused plenty of feverish fan speculation. While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, Zelnick's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking generally about Rockstar, Take-Two said Grand Theft Auto 5 has now sold-in an incredible 210 million units worldwide. GTA Online had a “strong” quarter, led by the Agents of Sabotage update. GTA+ memberships increased 10% year-over-year in the quarter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2, meanwhile, has sold-in more than 70 million copies. Take-Two noted it is currently seeing its highest level of concurrent players on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two has a busy 2025, with the just-released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> from Firaxis, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pga-tour-2k25">PGA Tour 2K25</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> in the summer, GTA 6 in the fall, and Gearbox’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> before year-end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are exceedingly optimistic about the commercial potential of our titles and believe that they will have a transformative effect on our business – and our industry – over the long term,” Take-Two said, before adding it remains “highly confident” it will achieve “sequential increases in, and record levels of, net bookings in fiscal 2026 and 2027.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
