This month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/immortals-of-aveum">Immortals of Aveum</a> headlines the bundle, with seven other games like Total War: Pharoah Dynasties, Fabledom, and more included. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars to grab these games individually, you can get all eight games for just $11.99 at Humble Bundle for this month only.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Humble Choice Games for February 2025</h2><div catalogid="0687e5ea-609a-4b6c-9fb6-791577e0cc24" id="214728"><div id="214728" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Humble Choice - February 2025</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Immortals of Aveum</li><li>Trepang2</li><li>Total War: Pharoah Dynasties</li><li>Fabledom</li><li>Griftlands</li><li>Tales &amp; Tactics</li><li>Naheulbeuk's Dungeon Master</li><li>My Little Universe</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Each month, Humble Choice curates a selection of games for members to redeem. These games are sent as Steam codes, which are yours to keep forever. You can even send them to a friend if you already have the game or want to gift one! For February, Immortals of Aveum is well worth the price of this package alone, receiving <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/immortals-of-aveum-review">an 8/10 in our review</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Immortals of Aveum is an impressively confident first-person shooter that successfully trades muzzles and magazines for mages and magic. Its fast-paced, spellcasting combat is both satisfying to master and spectacular to look at, and it features a lengthy and hearty campaign packed with secrets to keep us going well after the story has wrapped. As someone who desperately hopes that unapologetically single-player shooters will live forever, these Immortals have done a great job of making sure they’re definitely not dead yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these games, you can also score up to 20% off select games on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Store</a>. The longer that you have an active subscription, the more rewards you can unlock. 5% of each Humble Choice purchase also supports a charity that rotates monthly, with February's supporting United Negro College Fund, an organization that works to increase the total annual number of African American college graduates. Don't miss out on this month's Humble Choice selection!</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Feb 4, 2025 10:15 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-piece-online-mini-update-patch-notes-reveal-balance-adjustments-and-new-turtleback-cave-island<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Long-running anime-inspired pirate adventure <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-piece-online-roblox"><u>Grand Piece Online</u></a> is kicking off February with a mini update that adds in the Turtleback Cave island, Kira fruit, and more for Roblox players to enjoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Grand Quest Games published patch notes for <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/1730877806/DIAMOND-Grand-Piece-Online" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the relatively smaller content update</a>, revealing a handful of treasures to keep adventurers entertained while they wait for the next major release. While that does mean there are only a few tangible additions, such as that new island and fruit, the team made sure to include a solid group of balance adjustments to help keep its swashbuckling Roblox experience smooth across the board.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/04/grand-piece-online-mini-update-1738634012107.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Piece Online February mini update adds new island, fruit, and balance changes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can find Turtleback Cave north of Rose Kingdom in the Second Sea. Those who make the trek will find a new boss: Juzo the Diamondback. Defeating the enemy rewards players with the Turtleback Armor and Turtleback Helmet, with kills also including a 5% chance to drop the Kira fruit and a lower chance to drop a Mythical Fruit Chest. There’s also a new player list that shows crew and player names, as well as a list of crew adjustments, which include five new crew shop items, eight total crew shop slots, and the option to purchase current and out-of-rotation battle pass outfits from the crew shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for those Grand Piece Online balance tweaks, players will find that Arena Storm has been removed in favor of a new countdown system. The change will see winners determined by damage dealt and stocks remaining at the end of the countdown. There have also been adjustments to Tori, Pteranodon, Buddha, Venom, Yuki, Gold, Zushi, and many more, as Grand Quest Games aims to level the playing field.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Piece Online launched all the way back in 2018, and although the patch does fall under the “mini update” category, it shows the team is still going strong as it sails into 2025. The last notable update brought Water and Travel changes on January 17, so while there is no date regarding when players can expect to see the next update run aground, we likely won’t have to wait too long for more news. Until then, you can see our list of all active Grand Piece Online codes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-piece-online-codes">here</a> and the full mini-update patch notes below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grand Piece Online February Mini Update Patch Notes</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">New Content:</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Island:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Turtleback Cave</p><p data-cy="paragraph">  - Located in the Second Sea, north of Rose Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">  - New Boss: Juzo the Diamondback</p><p data-cy="paragraph">	- Drops: Turtleback Armor &amp; Turtleback Helmet</p><p data-cy="paragraph">	- 5% chance to drop the Kira Fruit</p><p data-cy="paragraph">	- Very low chance to drop a Mythical Fruit Chest</p><p data-cy="paragraph">	- Respawns every 15 minutes after dying</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Fruit:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Kira (Diamond) has been added as a new Epic Fruit</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Player List:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- A new player list has been added, which now displays crews and player display names</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crew Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Added 5 new items to the crew shop</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Increased crew shop slots from 4 to 8</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Increased mythical chance in the crew shop</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Old and current Battle Pass outfits are now obtainable from the crew shop</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Balance Patch:</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Arena Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Arena Storm has been removed in favor of a Countdown System</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- At the end of the countdown, the winner is determined based on:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">  - Damage dealt and stocks remaining</p><p data-cy="paragraph">  - Each stock remaining counts as 10k damage</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tori Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode (Arena/BR) requirement changed to 100%</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode bar now drains 2x faster in Arena/BR</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Phoenix Pyreapple is now cancellable in base form if you get stunned</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Triple Talon Kick no longer locks the player in place</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Burn damage removed from M1s</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Slight scaling increase on M1s</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pteranodon Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Increased movement speed when out of combat</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Slower flight speed when in combat</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode (Arena/BR) requirement changed to 100%</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode bar now drains 2x faster in Arena/BR</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Hitbox increased to a size ratio similar to Tori</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Buddha Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode (Arena/BR) requirement changed to 100%</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode bar now drains 2x faster in Arena/BR</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Spine Breaker endlag increased by 20%</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Venom Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode (Arena/BR) requirement changed to 100%</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Full Form Mode bar now drains 2x faster in Arena/BR</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Venom Aura is now cancellable on perfect block</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Yuki Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Fixed: Snow Gust not working on Factory Core</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gold Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Removed knockback from Golden Touch</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zushi Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Gravity Dominance startup increased by 15%</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Meteor Strike startup reduced by 20%</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mochi V2 Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Increased movement speed for Spiked Donut Roll when out of combat</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Increased knockback on Spiked Donut Roll hit</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Snowcap Scepter Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Scepter Snowball now fires 3 projectiles before going on cooldown</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Inferno Rocket Blade Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Explosive Field startup reduced by 30%</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Slightly increased stun on Explosive Field</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Abyssal Karate Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- Diving Tides cooldown increased from 16 to 19 seconds</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>3 Sword Style Adjustments:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- M1 scaling reduced by 30%</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-vangaurds-update-35-adds-starting-questline-and-boss-rush-multiplayer-support<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/anime-vanguards-roblox">Anime Vanguards</a> update 3.5 is here with four new units, multiplayer functionality for boss rush, a starting questline, and a collection of bug and quality-of-life adjustments for Roblox players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Kitawari unveiled everything in its <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/16146832113/UPDATE-3-5-Anime-Vanguards" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fate Boss Event</a> patch notes, pulling back the curtain with even more changes following the arrival of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-vanguards-winter-update-30-brings-lobby-revamp-and-new-portals-game-mode"><u>update 3.0</u></a> late last month. Topping the list of new content are four units – Sokora, Saber, Lilia, and Isdead – which can be found across different in-game challenges. There’s also a Saber boss event, which comes with its own rewards, including two Secret units, trait rerolls, gold and gems, and more that you’ll have to log in to see for yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Boss Rush overhaul includes multiplayer functionality for Roblox players looking to take on challenging tasks with friends, as well as normal and elite difficulty modes, tournament support, and boss event cycle changes. The Anime Vanguards Sand Village map has also gotten a full-on facelift that gives it a new design and enhanced visuals, and Worldlines have been reset, with additional resets coming every .5 update. Another new feature is one Kitawari says it added to address fan feedback: a starting player questline.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/03/anime-vanguards-update-3-5-1738623209703.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Anime Vanguards update 3.5 brings more fundamental changes alongside bug fixes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve acknowledged how overwhelming the early game may be for our new players,” Kitawari said. “To help with this, all new players will be greeted with a uniquely created questline which will guide them through the various elements of the game, and reward them with a Mythic Vogita Super upon quest end to start their journey in Anime Vanguards! We intend to create a great experience for all, and will continue looking into the various ways we can improve the gameplay for<strong> </strong>new as well as<strong> </strong>returning players alike in future updates.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime Vanguards update 3.5 brings plenty to keep players fighting off waves of enemies, but it’s only Kitawari’s latest content delivery. Last month, the team rolled out update 3.0, which focused on more winter-themed goodies to enjoy but also introduced a brand-new lobby and the Portals game mode. These changes and more are here to bolster the Roblox experience around the one-year anniversary of its original launch in January 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s currently no word regarding when Anime Vanguards update 4.0 will arrive, but at this rate, players may only have to wait a few weeks to learn more. For everything else on Kitawari’s anime tower defense game, you can see all active codes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-vanguards-codes"><u>here</u></a>. Finally, you can see the full update 3.5 patch notes, below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Anime Vanguards Update 3.5 Patch Notes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fate Boss Event</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Features</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! 4 NEW UNITS!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This update is coming out with <strong>4</strong> new units! These units will be found in:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>New Boss Rush</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">·         Sokora, Sokora (Angra Mainyu)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>New Secret Evolution</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">·         Saber (Alternate), Saber (Black Tyrant)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>New Mythic Banner Unit</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">·         Lilia, Lilia And Berserker</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>New Worldlines Floor 50 Reward</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">·         Isdead, Isdead (Romantic)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Saber (Alternate) Boss Event</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Sokora and the formidable Tyrant Saber (Alternate) have appeared! Dark Sokora plans to fuse with the malevolent Angra Mainyu; do you have what it takes to stop them?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss Rush Rewards Include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 New Secret Units</li><li>Trait Rerolls</li><li>Gold &amp; Gems</li><li>… and more!</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How to Obtain Saber (Alternate)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can obtain Saber (Alternate) by placing a Saber (King Of Knights) unit next to the A.W.E Boss that remains stationary at enemy spawn. The A.W.E Boss will spawn at Wave 15, and Wave 25, staying for 5 waves each time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon Unit Placement or Boss Spawn, all Saber (King Of Knights) units within range will become “corrupted” and transform into Saber (A.W.E.), with the interaction having a small chance of dropping the Saber (Alternate) unit, up to a maximum of 3 tries per match (up to 6 while using the Saber Servant Mechanic).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Servants Mechanic</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bring forth a fabled figure of choice to assist you in battle - each Servant offers unique mechanics, so be sure to read their ability descriptions with care, some may be better suited for your team than others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>Unlocking Servants</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The powerful Berserker Servant is available for free, while the others must be purchased using the servant’s corresponding unit’s evolution item. Once acquired, they are permanently available for use in battle. Choose carefully, or acquire them all and unleash their power!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>Command Seal Activation</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can Activate or Empower your chosen Servant’s mechanic up to 3 times by pressing the red Command Seal button near the inventory. Use them wisely to turn the tide of battle!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Boss Rush Overhaul</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve made several changes to make playing boss rushes much more fun and meaningful! These include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Multiplayer Functionality</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re now able to play Boss Rush with your friends, or alternatively use Public Matchmaking to join other players from across the world!</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Normal &amp; Elite Difficulty</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">We have split Boss Rushes into two separate difficulties, “Normal” which is a <strong>CO-OP</strong> gamemode that does not have access to tournaments, as well as an “Elite” <strong>Solo</strong> gamemode for those of you looking for a challenge, and to gain access to the Elite Tournament.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Elite Tournament</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re now able to participate in the Boss Rush Tournaments which will reset alongside the boss rush cycle. Aim to clear the Event in the least time possible, and compete against other players in your local bracket!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be careful when the bosses spawn–the waves automatically and immediately skip whenever the boss is alive!</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Boss Event Cycle Changes</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with boss events cycling, your <strong>boss event currency </strong>of that cycle<strong> </strong>and <strong>boss event stock </strong>will now also <strong>reset</strong>! We will most likely include evolution items and other important items to the legacy shop, making your legacy tokens more valuable and immune to cycle resets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Public Matchmaking</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re now able to find matches with players to play your favorite game modes regardless of what server they are on through our brand new Public Lobbies system! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To join others, simply press the “Public Lobbies” button within the “fractures” UI and select any of the player hosted matches there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To host your own match, press the “Create Match” button instead, and then press the “Find Match” button within the stage you have selected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Worldlines Reset</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">All players have been reset to Floor 1, and Soburo is no longer obtainable.<br> However, all the corresponding floor rewards have now returned, with <strong>Isdead </strong>replacing Soburo as the <strong>new Floor 50 reward</strong>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously announced in the Discord server, Worldlines will reset every X.5 update, with the next reset planned for Update 4.5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Sand Village Remake</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sand village remake has finally arrived, featuring entirely brand new designs and enhanced visuals! As one of the last remaining original maps from release, this overhaul finally brings it up to the standard of our latest maps. We hope you enjoy exploring the new and improved Sand Village map as much as we do!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">- <strong>NEW! Starting Player Questline</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve acknowledged how overwhelming the early game may be for our new players. To help with this, all new players will be greeted with a uniquely created questline which will guide them through the various elements of the game, and reward them with a Mythic Vogita Super upon quest end to start their journey in Anime Vanguards!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We intend to create a great experience for all, and will continue looking into the various ways we can improve the gameplay for<strong> new </strong>as well as<strong> returning </strong>players alike in future updates.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Changes &amp; QoL</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Added a visual timer when a unit gets stunned</strong></li><li>Added Visual Indicators for Enemy Spawn &amp; Friendly Base/End Of Path during the voting phase</li><li>Worldlines Leaderboard incorrectly had the same rewards as tournaments, this has now been fixed to match the other global leaderboards</li><li>An <strong>In-Game Elemental Reactions table</strong> has been added, making figuring out what each reaction does easier than ever!
