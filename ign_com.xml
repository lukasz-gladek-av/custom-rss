            <title><![CDATA[Wildgate Review in Progress]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It only took one match of Wildgate to see the potential in its spacefaring PvPvE mayhem. Now, after just over 20 hours of playtime, I’m also noticing where there is still room for it to build on that compelling concept. The intensely cooperative chaos of managing a spacecraft, delving into PvE dungeons for loot, and fending off rival crews makes for complex and exciting contests of teamwork and communication. Unfortunately, that level of coordination doesn’t always lead to great outcomes when matchmaking with random crewmates, where silent players or, worse yet, insanely toxic personalities can make for a bad time. But when a matchmade crew manages to come together, or you bring your own friends to the party, Wildgate’s simple but solid gunplay and multifaceted ship-to-ship combat give <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-review-2020"><u>Sea of Thieves</u></a> a run for its money. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wildgate is a unique multiplayer sci-fi shooter that sends five teams of four players out into the most dangerous section of the galaxy, called the Reach, to battle it out for loot and glory. Their ultimate goal is to find the all-important Artifact hidden somewhere in space and escape with it out of the Wildgate, but since there’s the little issue of only being one to go around, a clash of crews in tumultuous FPS combat is all but inevitable. To improve your chances of survival (and search for the Artifact along the way), you’ll want to hurriedly touch down to enter as many of the small PvE dungeons as possible, killing enemies and solving simple puzzles to claim whatever loot they’re hiding. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Upgrading your spacecraft with better shields, weapons, defensive measures, and stat improvements (like improved turning speed) can make all the difference when an enemy vessel nears and all hell breaks loose, which make for Wildgate’s tensest moments. If you’re able to find and escape with the Artifact, or simply murder all the enemy crews before they’re able to extract it themselves, then victory is yours, and in matches that can run over 40 minutes each, the taste of triumph is one of the sweetest there is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no story to be found in Wildgate, or at least not one outside of little snippets you can read from a menu between matches, but the world definitely has a distinct and endearing personality to it. That could be in the baddies you run into like raiders and alien life forms who look like booger people, or the playable characters, called Prospectors, who span from a big dog-looking alien to an aquatic creature in a mecha fishbowl. Each Prospector has their own interesting set of traits and abilities they can use to contribute to the team’s success (or demise). Ion, the four-armed alien can use his brawn to damage the hulls of ships just by smacking them with his fists, while Venture the robot serves as a great starter character since they don’t require oxygen to survive, regenerate health faster, and get warned when enemies are behind them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve had a lot of fun trying each one out to see which suits my playstyle, with my favorite being Mophs the winged, bird-like humanoid that can turn invisible, which is absolutely invaluable when boarding enemy ships to perform subterfuge. But as is the case with lots of stuff in Wildgate, the biggest issue is simply a scarcity of options, because it doesn’t take long at all to unlock and try each of them out. Seeing the same handful of familiar characters aboard each ship just feels a bit underwhelming in an endless galaxy of possibilities.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It could have some real legs with updates, but I already feel like I’ve seen just about everything right now.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though matches have been a lot of fun to play repeatedly the past few days, with only one game mode, seven characters, four models of starship, and a handful of weapons to use, it all feels a tad thin at the moment. If developer Moonshot Games comes out the (wild)gate swinging with regular updates that introduce new weapons, enemies, characters, and ships in the fashion of something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a>, then I can definitely see Wildgate having some real legs. But, at the moment, it feels like just a taste of what will hopefully be a game with a lot more variety down the road, and I already feel like I’ve seen just about everything that can happen across the matches I’ve played so far. There’s still a ton of fun to be found in getting better at winning, and knowing what I know now about the types of dungeons to be found and loot to be claimed has made me a lot more strategic with how I play, but I stopped being surprised by things I saw out in the Reach pretty quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve got plenty more of Wildgate to play before my final review – I didn’t even talk about ship-to-ship combat yet, for example, since I’m still in the process of trying all of the different vessels out – but so far it’s been a lot of fun to play with friends marred by much less fun matches when on matchmade teams (the amount of slurs I heard shouted over the proximity voice chat on day one was frankly startling). I’m hopeful the Moonshot will be quick to add new content, because there’s the makings of a great live-service game here, and I’m eager to dive back in.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite 4-Player FPS Games</h3></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/wildgate-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Amazon has more video game TV series adaptations on the way.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon MGM Studios is working with MachineGames to create a Wolfenstein TV series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details come <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from <u>Variety</u></a>, which states that a show based on the iconic Bethesda Softworks property is in development. Although no specific plot details are ready to be shared, the team behind the Wolfenstein series shared an official logline that makes things nice and simple: “The story of killing Nazis is evergreen.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The foundation for a TV series adaptation based on the classic alternate history video game franchise is about as solid as any fan could hope for. The Leftovers writer and Station Eleven creator Patrick Somerville is currently attached as creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the Wolfenstein show via his chaoticgood.tv banner. Variety adds that Somerville has been a fan of Wolfenstein “since he was a child.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Amazon is re-teaming with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series"><u>Fallout series</u></a> production company Kilter Films for the new project, with Jonathan Nolan, Lisa Joy, and Athena Wickham all on board as executive producers. Keyframe Films’ James Altman, as well as MachineGames’ Jerk Gustafsson, have also joined as executive producers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Wolfenstein works to bring its first-person shooter story to television screens, it’s clear Bethesda and Amazon are more than happy to continue working together. Fallout premiered to acclaim from fans and critics alike when its first season made its debut on Prime Video last year (we gave it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-1-review-amazon-prime-video"><u>a 9/10</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Work on Fallout Season 2 is well underway, too, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-has-wrapped-production-walton-goggins-sheds-his-ghoul-skin-in-delight"><u>production wrapped all the way back in May</u></a>. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-teaser-hits-the-internet-reveals-fresh-look-at-new-vegas"><u>teaser featuring fan-favorite location New Vegas</u></a> then arrived just days later, with the new season <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-premieres-december-2025-renewed-for-season-3"><u>set to arrive this December, and Season 3 also confirmed</u></a> to be on the way.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Dystopian TV Shows of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wolfenstein video game series, meanwhile, traces all the way back to the ‘80s with Castle Wolfenstein, but it wasn’t until 1992’s Wolfenstein 3D that the Nazi-killing video game really came into its own. Numerous entries have arrived in the years since, with its most recent storyline, beginning with Wolfenstein: The New Order in 2014, following the nigh-unkillable William B.J. Blazkowicz. Although it received a sequel, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, in 2017, and two standalone spinoffs in 2019, the series has gone without a mainline entry for a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Amazon, Kilter, Bethesda, and the rest of the team keep their heads down to focus on the Wolfenstein series, you can read about some of the other video game adaptations Amazon has in the works. These include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-has-a-new-showrunner-battlestar-galactica-and-deep-space-nines-ronald-d-moore-takes-the-reins"><u>a show based on God of War</u></a>, as well as other projects that take place in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-is-now-officially-in-development-at-amazon"><u>Mass Effect</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-amazon-studios-henry-cavill"><u>Warhammer 40,000</u></a> universes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
