            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to imagine what first-person shooters would be like today, if they were to exist at all, without the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom">original DOOM</a>, released back on December 10, 1993, for MS-DOS. A lone super soldier, the legendary Doom Guy, fending off the hordes of demons from hell is one of the defining images of PC gaming, and the series continues to shock and amaze fans to this day with every new gory entry. Now, Modiphius Entertainment is bringing DOOM to the tabletop with the upcoming Doom Arena Board Game, now on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPV4PZ?object_uuid=7af612f4-7bea-4eb8-b245-7679ceedf7c9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Kickstarter</u></a>, and I had a chance to get some time with a prototype to see just how well I could rip and tear in my dining room.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/doomboard-1761661236811.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Doom Arena isn't the first cardboard adaptation of the series, this latest rendition is a bloodbath contest between one player controlling Doom Guy and the other controlling the demons. Taking place in – you guessed it, an arena – the two players maneuver their plastic forces around the hexagon grid-based warzone, competing to see who can dish out the most pain. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each point of damage done to an opponent earns you blood, which serves as a victory point.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each point of damage done to an opponent earns you blood, which serves as a victory point. The winner is whoever comes out ahead in two out of the three rounds by earning the most blood, with each round consisting of six turns each for both sides. Between rounds, both Doom Guy and the Demons can upgrade their arsenals. Doom Guy gets new weapons and armor, while the Demons swap out weaker enemies for hartier ones like Pinky, Cacodemons, or the mighty Cyberdemon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom Arena is one of those games that fits great as a filler between some heavier ones during a game day, or when you just want to have some fun while sipping a cold one and munching on some snacks. The gameplay is a slick dice-chucker where the strategy takes a back seat to running in guns blazing and seeing how much pain you unleash, which is very reminiscent of its source material. The only real "strategy" I found myself thinking about is what upgrades I was going to spend my resources on between rounds.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/doomarena-preview-2-1761661236811.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I appreciate the simpler ruleset behind Doom Arena, because you can explain the rules to friends pretty quickly and be rolling dice shortly after. That being said, I wouldn't complain if there were a smidgen more depth to be found. To be fair, the prototype I had access to and a work-in-progress ruleset included only <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player</a> game modes, whereas the final game will be playable with 2-4 players, so it's possible the additional depth I am hoping for will be found in the final rules and other game modes. On the topic of game modes, I will say that having official rules for starting with more upgrades is smart, and makes for a ton of chaotic fun, and I could see some great matches happen by adopting a pick/counter-pick approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The version of Doom Arena that I played featured miniatures showcasing the classic looks of Doom Guy and demons that players of the original game from the '90s will recognize. But those who jumped on the chainsaw wagon in more recent decades will have a version for them, too. Modiphius is producing a mechanically identical version that instead has arenas, models, and weapons pulled from the most recent Doom: The Dark Ages, with Doom Guy replaced by the menacing Doom Slayer and demons including the Mancubus, Imps, Imp Stalkers, Hell and Battle Knights, Pinky Rider, Arachnotron, and Soldiers. And for folks who may be lacking in storage space, Modiphius will also offer a version that replaces the plastic miniatures with acrylic standees, shrinking the box size and lowering the cost.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/doomarena-preview-3-1761661236811.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When I first heard the announcement that Modiphius was designing a new Doom board game, my mind immediately went to images of playing as Doom Guy, exploring corridors, finding keys to unlock doors, that eventually would lead to a fight with a big scary demon. Something more akin to say a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-board-game-buyers-guide">Betrayal at House on the Hill</a>, Cthulu: Death May Die, or Zombicide. I still would love a Doom game like that, but I can't deny that Doom Arena captures the spirit of these games splendidly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a series about killing as many things as fast as possible, and Arena delivers on that premise in an exciting and digestible package. Even playing dice with this WIP build led to tense moments where I had to hold my breath as I rolled my dice, or giant sighs of relief as my demons avoided being brutally dismembered by a chainsaw. I eagerly look forward to seeing what sort of additional elements or add-ons will be available to play around with and what sort of other game modes will ship in the final release that use <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a>. With the Doom Arena Board Game, Modphius looks to deliver a box that fans of both the video games and board games in general can enjoy, and I am counting down the days until I can rev up my chainsaw again and take it to some demons again.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/28/doomarena-preview-5-1761661236812.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom the Arena Board Game’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPV4PZ?object_uuid=7af612f4-7bea-4eb8-b245-7679ceedf7c9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">campaign</a> runs until November 21, 2025 with an expected delivery date of October 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Harry Potter is one of those franchises that has now infiltrated pretty much every medium. There are endless <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-harry-potter-gift-ideas">Harry Potter gifts for every type of fan</a> out there, but if your specific interest is in puzzles, there's some serious variety available to you. Just a quick search for "Harry Potter puzzles" will drown you in options from various brands that can take a while to sort through.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR – These Are the Best Harry Potter Puzzles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As a fan of both Harry Potter and puzzles, I have taken it upon myself to help you find the right Potter puzzle for you. Below I've gathered some of my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">favorite adult jigsaw puzzles</a> with a Harry Potter theme, as well as some great options for kids. I've also included an awesome model kit that makes for an exciting 3D puzzling experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marauder's Map Puzzle</h3><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215775"><div id="215775" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Marauder's Map Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marauder's Map</a> is one of the most recognizable items from Harry Potter lore. From Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, this puzzle looks like the full map from the movie once it's been assembled. The puzzle itself is from The Noble Collection, which is known for making some of the highest quality officially licensed wand and Harry Potter prop replicas. You can see what the fully assembled puzzle looks like below:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwart's Express Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215776"><div id="215776" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwart's Express Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Hogwarts Express puzzle from Buffalo games depicts Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid as they were at the end of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone">The Sorcerer's Stone</a>. The train is set against a beautiful sunset backdrop, and we also see Malfoy sitting on a bench with Goyle at his side. It's a great-looking jigsaw puzzle from one of the most iconic scenes from the first film of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-movies-in-order">Harry Potter movie series</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Herbology Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215777"><div id="215777" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Herbology Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This herbology puzzle is my favorite option on this list. It depicts various ingredients students would find and grow in herbology class. At the center of it all is a mandrake in all its weird root baby glory. The design of this puzzle is reminiscent of the classic drawings you'd find in a vintage botanical identification diagram and makes for a great display piece.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwarts Crest Wooden Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215778"><div id="215778" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwarts Crest Wooden Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Hogwarts Crest puzzle is made up of 201 laser-cut wooden pieces. It depicts the Hogwarts crest, including all four houses, and a vibrant floral design. What makes this puzzle interesting is that it comes with many unique pieces you'll recognize from the books and movies. These pieces include a witch's hat, the Goblet of Fire, and the Deathly Hallows symbol. It's a great puzzle for both kids and adults to put together.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwarts Castle Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215779"><div id="215779" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwarts Castle Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This 3,000-piece Hogwarts Castle puzzle is an excellent option for anyone looking for something more challenging. The image depicts the majority of Hogwarts Castle and grounds, including Hagrid's hut. There are also owls, a phoenix, a hippogriff, and various other small details that make this larger puzzle really fun to piece together. It's made by Ravensburger, which is our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">overall favorite puzzle brand</a> on the market right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like the massive size of this puzzle, you may want to check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">largest puzzles out there</a>. 3,000 pieces is nothing compared some of these.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwarts Express 3D Puzzle Model Kit</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215780"><div id="215780" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwarts Express 3D Puzzle Model Kit</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While not a traditional puzzle, this 3D model kit of the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hogwarts Express</a> belongs on this list because of how cool it is. The kit comes with eight sheets of 181 pieces that you'll need to put togehter. No glue or tools are required to assemble the train, but it may be difficult for young children to piece together. Overall, this is a really different kind of puzzle and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-lego-alternatives">excellent alternative to the LEGO Hogwarts express</a> that is extremely pricey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't mind spending a bit more, there is also a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-lego-book-nook-sets">LEGO Book Nook set</a> for the Hogwarts Express that is worth checking out.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hogwarts Map</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215781"><div id="215781" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hogwarts Map</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The second Ravensburger puzzle I'm featuring on this list also depicts Hogwarts castle and grounds, but in map form. The map itself has a rather whimsical design and features a variety of notable locations including <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogsmeade" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hogsmeade</a> and the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbidden Forest</a>. The puzzle also includes a border featuring small images of various other locations from the story. At 1,500 pieces, it is a bit more challenging that some of the other puzzles on this list, but the end result is worthy of displaying.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Enchanted Car Mini Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215782"><div id="215782" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Enchanted Car Mini Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for a good Harry Potter puzzle for kids, this 100-piece mini puzzle from The New York Puzzle Company is a great option. The image shows Ron and Harry flying in the enchanted car with Hogwarts in the background. This is an iconic point of the story in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/harry-potter-and-the-chamber-of-secrets">The Chamber of Secrets</a>, and the design of this image looks like the original cover artwork from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-books-in-order">Harry Potter books</a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Gryffindor Crest Puzzle</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215783"><div id="215783" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gryffindor Crest Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Every true fan knows which house they belong to. Whether you're in Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff, there is a crest puzzle available from Aquarius. I've featured the Gryffindor design here, but each house is has its own crest and background color. At just 500 pieces, these smaller puzzles are great if you want to spend an afternoon finishing a single image.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Harry Potter Puzzle for Kids</h3></div><div catalogid="3b2bbf1a-9011-47bd-8434-7a3d957ba1d6" id="215784"><div id="215784" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Harry Potter Puzzle for Kids</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The final Ravensburger puzzle I have on this list is specifically meant for kids. Not only is it just 100 extra-large pieces, it features bright colors and recognizable characters that make it fairly easy to put together. The box says it is meant for ages six and older, so it should be simple enough for younger kids to handle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What About Harry Potter LEGO Sets Instead?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Jigsaw puzzles are an excellent choice for any fan of Harry Potter and puzzling, but it isn't the only option available. There are a ton of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-lego-harry-potter-sets">LEGO Harry Potter sets available</a> that depict iconic scenes and characters from across the entire series. These LEGO sets <em>are</em> quite a bit more expensive than the puzzles on this list, but many of them are easier to play with and display than a simple puzzle once put together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jacob Kienlen is a Senior SEO Strategist and Writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Free-to-play hybrid action RPG Duet Night Abyss is out now worldwide on PC, mobile devices, and Epic Games Store featuring a dual narrative with two protagonists, no stamina limits for movement or commissions, and no character or weapon gacha systems. Let’s get into the details of what this game has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duet Night Abyss takes place in the world of Atlasia, where tree-like crystals called Heaventrees were viewed as gifts from the gods and gave rise to a central religion called the Elysian Church. Originally, practically everyone followed this religion, but over time, groups broke off and formed their own factions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play through the story from the perspectives of two protagonists with very different backgrounds, and you can freely choose and deploy each of them across different chapters. You’ll meet people from several of Atlasia’s different factions, and you can unlock many of them as playable characters by using character shards, which can be obtained either by buying the exact number you need for a specific character or by collecting them through gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters are not sorted into tiers or star ratings, all of them are just as viable in combat as the others. There are also no character gacha banners where you have to spend resources and just hope you eventually get what you want. You can identify the character you want, gather the required crystals, and be 100% guaranteed to unlock that character.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-4-1761248741433.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the developers said when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/duet-night-abyss-dev-team-discusses-the-games-narrative-combat-and-latest-updates"><u>we interviewed them in August</u></a>, this was in response to player feedback and was with the goal of making the game more accessible to free-to-play (F2P) players. And as part of the game’s global launch rewards, players can complete events to unlock seven characters for free, giving you the opportunity to build the team you want right from the start. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what characters you want to use in battle, you can equip them with both melee and ranged weapons and swap between them on the fly. Every character has access to every weapon type, so you can freely equip them however you want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Melee weapon options include standard choices like swords, polearms, and greatswords, as well as more unique ones like the whipsword. There are also a variety of ranged options, from a bow and arrow to dual pistols, grenade launchers, and shotguns. And like characters, weapons aren’t locked behind banners and aren’t sorted into different tiers or star ratings. So you can use whichever combination of weapons you want with no optimization lost.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/melee-and-ranged-weapons-1761248804318.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat will pit you against waves of enemies in hack-and-slash action, where you’ll mow down hordes of foes in seconds. The flow of combat stays quick thanks to the fact there are several mobility options with no stamina requirements, so no need to keep your eye on a gauge to see what moves you can use. At any time, you can sprint, use a grappling hook, dodge, jump, double jump, wall jump, or Helix Leap, which in one button press allows you to cover very long distances very quickly.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-6-1761248842756.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can tackle commissions with up to three players in co-op mode, or go solo with two AI companions. There are no stamina restrictions for commissions either, so you’re not limited to only a certain amount of time you can play freely. And you can further customize your fighting style with Demon Wedges, which are versatile add-ons that you can obtain during commissions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Demon Wedges come in three varieties: character, melee weapon, and ranged weapon. They can provide boosts to your health, crit rate, attack speed, and other attributes. These boosts are guaranteed at a set level when you acquire and upgrade them, so you don’t have to keep grinding for the same thing and hoping to get a better version. There’s no randomization involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of stat boosts, Demon Wedges can also change the mechanics of your characters’ attacks and skills, and you can combine these with certain weapon traits to customize your attack pattern. And once you’ve acquired a Demon Wedge, you can use it across as many characters or weapons as you want. So again, no need to farm for additional versions to equip multiple of them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/image-7-1761248877455.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters, weapons, and Demon Wedges can all be obtained through normal gameplay. The game’s monetization model is currently focused only on cosmetics, with a range of character skins, accessories, patterns, dye colors, and weapon skins. Both outfits and weapons can be dyed, allowing for an additional level of customization.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/24/character-skins-1761338540276.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers recently unveiled new skins for the characters Psyche, Rebecca, and the duo Truffle and Filbert. They also revealed Christmas-themed skins and a new sword skin called Tough Love. And as part of the game’s global launch rewards, players can get up to 107 Pristine Hourglass and Prismatic Hourglass just for logging in. These items can be used to draw new skins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duet Night Abyss is available to download now on PC, iOS, and Android.
