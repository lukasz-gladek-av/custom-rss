            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-and-website-still-lists-release-date-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-with-no-mention-of-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-released-rockstar-tells-fans-to-explore-vice-city-and-beyond">the release of Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2</a> and a significant update to its official website, all eyes were on the launch platforms accompanying the new release date of May 26, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the trailer, we see the release date alongside the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, confirming the consoles remain part of GTA 6’s release. Indeed, Trailer 2 was captured on a PS5 (the trailer specifically mentions PS5, as opposed to PS5 Pro).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what does this mean for the inevitable PC launch, or perhaps even a release on the Nintendo Switch 2? Some had wondered, perhaps even hoped, that GTA 6’s push to May 2026 would cause a rethink at Rockstar and parent company Take-Two and spark a simultaneous release on PC. The lack of mention of PC here perhaps suggests otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an omission in keeping with developer Rockstar’s playbook for its previous games, but in 2025 and certainly in 2026 it feels outdated. And, given the increasing importance of the PC for a multiplatform game’s success, is GTA 6’s no-show on PC a missed opportunity or even a mistake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter">IGN put that question to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick in an interview in February</a>, and in his response he teased GTA 6’s <em>eventual</em> release on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away,” Zelnick said of Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. “With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/gta-6-main-1746545044332.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 6 is still set to launch on console only.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar fans have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question of how long PC gamers will have to wait for what could end up being one of the biggest games ever remains. If not May 2026, then when? Fall 2027? Early 2027? A year later, in May 2027?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how big of a missed opportunity could skipping PC for GTA 6’s launch be? Zelnick told IGN that the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40% of overall sales, or even more with certain games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Lucia Caminos Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue,” he said. “Of course, there will be a new console generation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, there’s no Nintendo Switch 2 logo on GTA 6 Trailer 2, which is perhaps expected. While we still don’t know exactly what the Switch 2 is capable of, it is set to get CD Projekt’s Cyberpunk 2077, so there was some hope that GTA 6, which, let’s remember, is still down as coming to the less powerful Xbox Series S, could make its way to Nintendo’s next-gen console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Here's the official blurb, alongside brand new screenshots.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grand Theft Auto VI Characters</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">Jason Duval</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Jason wants an easy life, but things just keep getting harder. Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him. Jason knows how he'd like it to turn out but right now, it's hard to tell.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Jason Duval Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Lucia Caminos</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Lucia’s father taught her to fight as soon as she could walk. Life has been coming at her swinging ever since. Fighting for her family landed her in the Leonida Penitentiary. Sheer luck got her out. Lucia’s learned her lesson — only smart moves from here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than anything, Lucia wants the good life her mom has dreamed of since their days in Liberty City — but instead of half-baked fantasies, Lucia is prepared to take matters into her own hands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh out of prison and ready to change the odds in her favor, Lucia’s committed to her plan — no matter what it takes. A life with Jason could be her way out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Lucia Caminos Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Cal Hampton</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">What if everything on the internet was true? Jason’s friend and a fellow associate of Brian’s, Cal feels safest hanging at home, snooping on Coast Guard comms with a few beers and some private browser tabs open.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The psychopaths are in charge. Get used to it. Cal is at the low tide of America and happy there. Casual paranoia loves company, but his friend Jason has bigger plans.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Cal Hampton Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Boobie Ike</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's all about heart — the Jack of Hearts. Boobie is a local Vice City legend — and acts like it. One of the few to transform his time in the streets into a legitimate empire spanning real estate, a strip club, and a recording studio — Boobie's all smiles until it's time to talk business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Top quality cuts. Boobie might seem like he's just out for himself, but it's his partnership with the young aspiring music mogul Dre'Quan for Only Raw Records that he's most invested in — now they just need a hit.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Boobie Ike Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Dre'Quan Priest</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Only Raw... Records. Dre'Quan was always more of a hustler than a gangster. Even when he was dealing on the streets to make ends meet, breaking into music was the goal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You're with the label now. Now that he's signed the Real Dimez, Dre'Quan's days of booking acts into Boobie's strip club might be numbered as he sets his sights on the Vice City scene.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Dre'Quan Priest Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Real Dimez</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Viral videos. Viral hooks. Bae-Luxe and Roxy aka Real Dimez have been friends since high school — girls with the savvy to turn their time shaking down local dealers into cold, hard cash via spicy rap tracks and a relentless social media presence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One hit away from fame. An early hit single with local rapper DWNPLY took Real Dimez to new heights. Now, after five years and a whole lot of trouble, they’re signed to Only Raw Records, hoping lightning can strike twice.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Real Dimez Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Raul Bautista</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Experience counts. Confidence, charm, and cunning — Raul’s a seasoned bank robber always on the hunt for talent ready to take the risks that bring the biggest rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A professional adapts. Raul's recklessness raises the stakes with every score. Sooner or later, his crew will have to double down or pull their chips from the table.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Raul Bautista Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Brian Heder</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing better than a Mudslide at sunset. Brian's a classic drug runner from the golden age of smuggling in the Keys. Still moving product through his boat yard with his third wife, Lori, Brian's been around long enough to let others do his dirty work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looks like a Leonida beach bum — moves like a great white shark. Brian’s letting Jason live rent-free at one of his properties — so long as he helps with local shakedowns, and stops by for Lori’s sangria once in a while.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Brian Heder Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar also released information and screenshots on the explorable places in the state of Leonida, GTA 6's take on Florida.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grand Theft Auto VI cities, places, and environments</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">Vice City</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything in Excess. We're a long way from the '80s, but Vice City is still the sun and fun capital of America.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The glamour, hustle, and greed of America captured in a single city. Each neighborhood has something to offer, from the pastel art deco hotels and bright white sands of Ocean Beach, to the bustling panaderías of Little Cuba and the bootleg brands of the Tisha-Wocka flea market, out to the VC Port, the cruise ship capital of the world.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Leonida Keys</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gateway to Paradise. The dress code is casual, the bars are loaded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Life in this tropical archipelago isn’t flashy but it’s easy. Get your buzz on and pull up a deck chair but look out — you are right on the doorstep of some of the most beautiful and dangerous waters in all of America.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Leonida Keys Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Grassrivers</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Welcome to the Wetlands. The untamable jewel of Leonida’s crown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You never know what lies beneath the surface of this primordial expanse. The gators may be the most famous attraction, but there are far deadlier predators and weirder discoveries among the mangroves.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Grassrivers Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Port Gellhorn</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Live Hard. This is Leonida’s forgotten coast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cheap motels, shut-down attractions, and empty strip malls won’t bring the tourists back, but there’s a new economy in this once-popular vacation spot. It’s fueled by malt liquor, painkillers, and truck stop energy drinks. Jump on a dirt bike and hold onto your wallet.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Port Gellhorn Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Ambrosia</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping Leonida Sweet. The battle for the health and wealth of Leonida begins here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the heart of Leonida, American industry and old school values still reign supreme — whatever the cost. The Allied Crystal sugar refinery provides the jobs, while the local biker gang provides almost everything else.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Ambrosia Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Mount Kalaga</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Wild, Wild Country. Room to breathe on the state's northern fringes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A national landmark up against the state’s northern border, Mount Kalaga offers prime hunting, fishing, and off-road trails. In the lush surrounding backwoods, hillbilly mystics and paranoid radicals live far from the prying eyes of the government.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Mount Kalaga Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">Rockstar delayed GTA 6 from fall 2025 to May 26, 2026</a>, in a significant push to the world's most anticipated game.
