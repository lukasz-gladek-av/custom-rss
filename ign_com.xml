            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is a looter shooter that revolves around… loot. But what happens when you can’t get your hard-earned Legendary drop because it got trapped out of bounds or behind an invisible wall? Desperate Borderlands 4 players are running into that exact problem and are now pleading with developer Gearbox for a fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played Borderlands 4 you’ll probably know the feeling. It’s the europhoria that comes from a Legendary drop among the confetti-like explosion of loot that erupts from a downed boss. This is something the Borderlands series has always done well, perhaps better, even, than any other looter shooter. When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-chief-randy-pitchford-says-if-more-developers-better-understood-why-gamers-love-making-decisions-about-loot-wed-have-good-competitors">Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford recently said if more developers better understood why gamers love loot, then Borderlands would have “good competitors,”</a> most agreed with him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if that Legendary flies off and lands out of bounds, the frustration is just as intense as the euphoria that proceeded it. Double the intensity if the Legendary spirals away after a particularly difficult boss fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This has been a problem with Borderlands 4 since launch, but it was exacerbated this week with the weekly endgame content reset, which rotated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/The_Oppressor_-_Legendary_Drops_and_Boss_Guide">The Oppressor</a> into this week’s Big Encore boss fight. The problem here is The Oppressor is a flying enemy (flying enemies in shooters are almost always more annoying to fight than any other), which means it darts about the sky, sometimes over areas the player can’t reach. And what happens when you land the killing shot as it’s in the air? The loot flies sometimes lands on a roof, behind an invisible wall just out of reach, or off the map entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are, understandably, infuriated. “Do not waste your Eridium on this week's Big Encore Boss Opressor unless you want to lose loot,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1o96xcp/do_not_waste_your_eridium_on_this_weeks_big/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared redditor PuzzleheadedDust8094</a>. “If you value your Eridium and dislike getting screwed out of your items because Gearbox can't seem to prevent your loot from flying outside of the arena or through walls, you absolutely should avoid fighting this boss UNTIL THEY FIX THIS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have lost so much loot to bosses dropping stuff in places you can't get to because it's a giant death pit or because of bogus invisible walls. This week’s Big Encore boss might just be the biggest offender yet. I've lost (and I wish I was joking) 7 OUT OF 10 Big Encores worth of loot. That's 700 hard earned Eridium down the drain.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/a-lot-to-process-opressor-1760734763948.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Oppressor is one of the most frustrating boss fights in Borderlands 4.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I swear to god if they don't fix The Oppressor loot issues (out of bounds or spread around the entire arena rather than where the boss is) and flying around for a full f***ing minute before you can even hit him, I may lose a bit of faith,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1o95l0m/ive_called_bl4_a_1010_from_day_1_but/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said StretchDizzy7792</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Please QC your Big Encore picks. Two weeks in a row of bosses with issues (loot under floor on last weeks). It takes 15 minutes of farming the boss to realize if there's an issue most people will experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I hope to god they pushed back the patch to add a fix in for this.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Big Encore… 6 kills. 3 Legendary’s out of bounds. 0 Legendary’s in the lost loot box,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1o8wlci/big_encore_6_kills_3_legendarys_out_of_bounds_0/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said S0LWAY</a>. “Horse apples! Absolute horse apples!!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a reference to Borderlands 4’s Lost Loot Machine, which is supposed to be a backup for this very problem by scooping up lost loot and saving it for collection later. But it doesn’t seem to be working properly — at least, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1nhu25h/lost_loot_machine_is_useless/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players believe it isn’t working properly</a> — because it tends to favor low quality loot over rare loot and thus fills up, leaving no room for those prize guns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Lost Loot Machine has to be broken,” said one disgruntled player. “There is no way it's working correctly right now. I've only seen one purple and one blue item in it. The rest has always been white and green.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's supposed to replace gear with higher quality loot once full but it's definitely not doing that,” said another. “I constantly leave behind blue gear and that thing should be littered with blues, but nope.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/GearboxOfficial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@GearboxOfficial</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Borderlands</a> <br>Flies around sporadically with no inertia looking awful, gets stuck on map geometry, upon dying flies out of arena to drop all loot in inaccessible places. Arena is filled with invisible walls for no reason. Did this fight even go though QA? <a href="https://t.co/JFUwmWKqJr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JFUwmWKqJr</a></p>— Bunbun Jackalope 🐰 (@BunbunJackalope) <a href="https://twitter.com/BunbunJackalope/status/1979240476902310325?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Borderlands 4 players are trying to help each other out by suggesting fixes for the problem, although there’s no consensus on what works and no guarantees, either. Some suggest saving and quitting as soon as the Legendary goes out of bounds, and then, upon loading back in, heading straight to the Lost Loot Machine. Maybe you’ll be lucky. Maybe not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week’s hotly anticipated patch — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-borderlands-4-players-brace-themselves-for-the-end-of-the-op-crit-knife-gearbox-developers-explain-why-nerfs-are-needed-even-in-mostly-single-player-games">the one set to nerf “unintended interactions” such as the crit knife</a>, was delayed to early next week. Some are hoping this ‘Day 30 Update’ will also sort out Borderlands 4’s lost Legendaries problem. In the meantime, there’s a new mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/173" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the Borderlands 4 NexusMods page</a>, that some players are finding success with (this is only if you’re playing on PC, of course). It’s called Ground Loot Helpers and lets you teleport all the loot to your character. Now that’s a quality-of-life improvement I can get behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike an invisible wall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Borderlands 4. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dataminer-unearths-evidence-to-suggest-a-much-maligned-borderlands-3-character-was-cut-and-replaced-late-in-development"><u>a Borderlands 4 dataminer unearthed evidence to suggest that one of the most hated characters from Borderlands 3 was cut and replaced relatively late in development</u></a>. 2K Games and Gearbox declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-want-to-know-what-sort-of-odds-i-am-trying-to-beat-when-i-am-grinding-a-game-150-hours-and-over-3000-boss-kills-later-a-superfan-has-worked-out-borderlands-4s-disappointingly-low-drop-rate"><u>IGN recently interviewed a Borderlands 4 player who spent 150 hours on over 3,000 boss kills to find out the game’s true drop rate</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Who's your starter Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Z-A? Wait, wait, let me guess: is it Totodile?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Odds are, I was correct, at least based on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx65Ppq4EA6KKNkicT8VFQJctnWwdt0UUn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll we've conducted surrounding the launch of Z-A yesterday</a>. Our poll's been up for 22 hours and has over 11,000 votes from IGN readers, and it reveals that of the three Z-A starter Pokémon, over half of IGN's audience is picking Totodile over Tepig or Chikorita. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time this piece was written, water-type Totodile had 56% of the vote, with 24% choosing grass-type Chikorita, and only 20%, one-fifth of our readers, picking fire-type Tepig -- and we agree with the winner: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-legends-z-a/Starter_Pokemon_Guide:_The_Best_Starter_to_Pick">Totodile is the best pick, stats-wise, with some caveats we go over in our Pokemon Legends: Z-A Best Starter Guide.</a> <em>Update: At 32K votes, Totodile remains locked at 56%, Chikorita at 25.3%, and Tepig at a tepid 18.7%).</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This might not be a shock to anyone, though, as Totodile has long been a fan-favorite. Just look at the bitey boy! Chikorita and Tepig have historically gone less-loved, and Tepig in particular is an outlier in this trio as both Totodile and Chikorita hail from Johto, while Tepig was a starter in Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, while I personally went with Chikorita (having picked Totodile in Generation 2 every single time and wanting a change-up), I gotta say, Tepig by far has the best final Mega Evolution of the three. All members of this trio get new Mega Evolutions in Z-A, and while I won't spoil them here, Meganium's was rather disappointing and Feraligatr's just looks weird. Emboar though? Looking awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't overthink it though. All three starters are perfectly viable for the entirety of Z-A's campaign, and it's very easy to catch all three Pokémon for your PokeDex once you hit the endgame, so you won't be missing out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can learn more about the starter Pokémon and their evolutions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=backstage_event&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqblZWNkRVX2ZuaVNfeU5BTnFIOE15Q1NaVzNDZ3xBQ3Jtc0tuSjVhT1R4N3Bmbk81UXVYSWd5eElNcGJYd1c2R01KczNzeTlsUlU2c3pGYURvSU5xWWR3QlFadlMwNi1tbWV4aVJKOG1udG9HSkF6LVpuN3ViM3hzU2paQTByVTNyeXZxWFFJOGRnVGsxMGJaZGRxYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Fwikis%2Fpokemon-legends-z-a%2FStarter_Pokemon_Guide%3A_The_Best_Starter_to_Pick" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in our Wiki guide</a> if you're still on the fence.

As gamers new and old now drop into what has become one of the most popular Battlefield games ever, everyone's talking about what kind of player Battlefield 6 should cater to.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Apparently I'm a "Battledad" now cuz I enjoy playing games slower and don't want to always be zooming around.</p><p>It's ok young one, it'll hit you too one day.

So, when the August Battlefield 6 beta revealed mechanics that leaned more into movement shooter territory than the series had ever experienced before, longtime fans – often not-so-lovingly referred to as "battledads" – were quick to ask for changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and BF Studios obliged, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcing</a> that Battlefield 6 movement had been tweaked to “create a more balanced and traditional Battlefield experience,” later that same month. Changes included reduced horizontal speed and a hit to jump momentum that many had used to dance around others. Shooting while jumping or sliding was also nerfed, thus causing a stir amongst newer fans — often called zoomers — who typically favored movement shooters, such as Call of Duty. You can probably see where this is going.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Battlefield 6 developers have removed building momentum and bunny hopping, and yeeting yourself 10-30 feet off ledges and cover.</p><p>DICE has introduced aim penalties when sliding and shooting, jumping and shooting and trying to spam movement.</p><p>Movement community is in shambles. <a href="https://t.co/FDiALnPDxU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/FDiALnPDxU</a> <a href="https://t.co/3szUfUcFzT" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3szUfUcFzT</a></p></div>— Xfactor Gaming - Battlefield 6 (@rivaLxfactor) <a href="https://twitter.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1968726309481128037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Another AAA studio gutting movement to cater to people that play games one hour a week that will never run into people utilizing movement tech anyway,” content creator and X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/Reave/status/1958548537064497348" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>@Reave said at the time</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oh go fly a kite, bro,” content creator and X user <a href="https://x.com/TeioStreams/status/1958699009121689917" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TeioStreams <u>replied</u></a>. “If you want movement in your shooter go play COD.

The fun thing is that you pay for those cards with life instead of mana, hence why that lifelink keyword is handy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up in Spidey’s baddies, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l23MO?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Norman Osborn/Green Goblin</u></a> is a 1/1 that can’t be blocked, triggering Connive and giving him the potential to climb in power. Pay the mana cost, and he turns into Green Goblin, able to cheapen spells from the graveyard that you discarded through Connive. He’s $15 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QdpbNZ?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Anti-Venom, Horrifying Healer</u></a> we’ve already touched on, and he’s now $12 or so. I’m personally planning to pick him up once we get to around the $10 mark I think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, the meme-worthy <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBDglJ?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Imposter Syndrome</u></a> has levelled out at around $10. It lets you create a non-legendary copy of a creature that attacked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, if you wanted to build a five-color Spider-Verse deck, <u>Cosmic Spider-Man</u> is just $10 now. He’s got a ton of keywords that he transfers to other Spider Hero characters, and makes an ideal Commander for anyone looking to drop a ton of them into the same deck</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Climbers This Week</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/crashers-and-climbers-template-2-1760711178228.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Number one on our climbers this week is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRMn51?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mortuary</u></a>, a card that’s 27 years old and basically bounces creatures from your graveyard straight to the top of your library.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s simple enough, and it’s been a few dollars at most. Now, TCGPlayer has it climbing to around $30 thanks to the emergence of Gwenom, Remorseless, which can pay life to cast cards from the top of your library.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, when is a Turtle Ninja not a Ninja Turtle? When it’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwKJn?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Taeko, the Patient Avalanche</u></a>, of course. Nothing to do with the upcoming TMNT set, this card enters tapped and powers up as cards leave the battlefield without dying. It’s reached $15, having been around $5 just a week or two ago. Turtle power, indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aADgqo?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Attunement</u></a> came out in 1998 and works very nicely for turning Norman Osborn into Green Goblin and causing chaos. Did the designers in 1998 ever anticipate that sentence? It’s unlikely, but the card is up to $11 right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a013g5?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Goryo’s Vengeance</u></a> is a nice bit of graveyard recursion that gets you flinging a big nasty from the graveyard back for one last hurrah, all for just two mana. It’s up to $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/av34rx?object_uuid=738dc19d-c127-4416-ae4a-acad309351c8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Entangler</u></a> is a very fun one. It pairs with Anti-Venom, Horrifying Healer (more from him shortly), allowing him to block multiple creatures at once. That’s particularly useful given he ends up negating that damage and powering up with counters in return. After being under a dollar, Entangler is now reaching closer to $10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The world of Fallout is a fictional one, but it deals with some very real and very serious issues, chief among them the threat of nuclear war. Now, the video game series is set for an official exhibition at pretty much the most appropriate place for it on earth: the National Atomic Testing Museum in Las Vegas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‘Civilization, I'll stay right here!’ goes the song by Danny Kaye and The Andrews Sisters, which Fallout fans will be familiar with if they ever turned the radio on while out and about in the wasteland. But a trip to the museum might now be in order, with the limited-time exhibition dubbed “<a href="https://atomicmuseum.vegas/coming-soon-world-of-fallout-exhibit/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World of Fallout</a>” opening November 14, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The National Atomic Testing Museum said the Bethesda-backed exhibition will explore the cultural legacy of atomic history through the lens of the Fallout franchise. The installation will comprise objects associated with the game and the Amazon TV series it inspired. “This compact yet powerful display will highlight the connections between real-world nuclear history and the imaginative storytelling of the video game’s universe,” the museum said in a note to press. What’s more, the museum will have Fallout-inspired Easter eggs throughout its main gallery space.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>First introduced in 1997, the franchise’s expansive lore, including its famed Vaults, Vault Boy mascot, and depiction of a post-apocalyptic Wasteland, has left a lasting imprint on pop culture. The new exhibit will spotlight these elements while drawing parallels to mid-20th century nuclear history, offering visitors an opportunity to experience how atomic culture has inspired art, entertainment and collective imagination. </blockquote><blockquote>Through carefully selected objects and interpretive displays, the exhibit will bridge fact and fiction. Highlights include screen-worn Vault suits and memorabilia alongside graphic panels that explore the recurring elements of the Fallout franchise, along with the key Cold War themes that influenced the world and its lore.</blockquote><blockquote>The collaboration with Bethesda Softworks underscores the National Atomic Testing Museum’s ongoing commitment to present nuclear history through new lenses. By situating gaming lore within the broader context of science and culture, the exhibit is designed to engage both longtime Fallout fans and museum visitors. It also complements the museum’s permanent collection, which chronicles the scientific, military and social history of the Atomic Age.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">“What makes this exhibit one-of-a-kind is that we’re putting iconic Fallout symbols side by side with the history that inspired them,” said Joseph Kent, chief community officer and curator, National Atomic Testing Museum. “It’s a chance for gamers and history buffs alike to see just how closely the two worlds connect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“World of Fallout” is scheduled to be on view at the National Atomic Testing Museum through 2026. And if you’re wondering, the National Atomic Testing Museum is operated and maintained by its parent company, the Nevada Test Site Historical Foundation (NTSHF). It covers nuclear history beginning with the first test at the Nevada Test Site on January 27, 1951.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2: Who's Confirmed to Return and Who's New?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a busy time for Fallout, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walton-goggins-is-set-to-play-the-ghoul-from-the-fallout-tv-show-in-fallout-76-but-how-does-the-character-fit-in-the-fallout-76-timeline">a big update for Fallout 76 coming in December that adds The Ghoul from the Fallout TV show</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-trailer-ties-the-ghouls-origin-story-to-mr-house">Season 2 of the TV in the same month</a>, and the hope from fans that more is set for next year and beyond.
