            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a> will launch with a $59.99 Premium Upgrade Bundle that unlocks four days of early access — albeit at almost the same cost as buying the game again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night, Xbox gave its upcoming Japan-set open world racer a stunning full gameplay reveal during its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2026-everything-announced">Xbox Developer Direct livestream</a>, though didn't go into detail on the game's pricing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it arrives on May 19 for PC and Xbox Series X/S, Forza Horizon 6's Standard Edition will cost $69.99, while its Premium Edition is priced at $119.99. Alternatively — and of note for those planning to play the game via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate — you can purchase that $59.99 Premium Upgrade Bundle, and play starting May 15.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's Premium Edition / Premium Upgrade include other benefits too, of course, though not all of them are available on day one. Effectively, this option lets you pre-order the game's two upcoming, unannounced expansions, as well as the Italian Passion Car Park, which also does not have a release date. You'll also get the Time Attack Car Pack, Car Pass (which adds 30 more cars to your game, one per week), plus VIP Membership and a Welcome Pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This offering is nothing new for the Forza Horizon series, though is $10 more than the $49.99 Premium Upgrade offered for Forza Horizon 5 — an increase that has not gone unnoticed among the franchise's fanbase on social media and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ForzaHorizon/comments/1qkcq7f/why_is_noone_talking_about_the_staggering_price/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pricing is even more remarkable in other territories, too — in the UK, the Premium Upgrade is £59.99, the exact same cost as the game itself. In Australia, the Premium Edition is AU $190, up from AU $150 for the Premium Edition of Forza Horizon 5.</p><span data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="xbox-games-series-tier-list"><p><span><span><span><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></span></span><span></span></span></p></div></span><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah that's absolutely cooked," wrote Aussie Forza fan Pretty_Leather4803 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ForzaHorizon/comments/1qk9xro/190_aud_for_the_premium_edition_of_h6_is_a_joke/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. "$40 more for basically the same content as last time? Microsoft really thinks we're made of money down here. At this point I'm just gonna wait for it to hit Game Pass and skip all the fancy extras."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Inflation is a real thing," countered another fan, BrokenClays, in yet another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ForzaHorizon/comments/1qkggwm/inflation_is_a_real_thing/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> thread. "In November 2021 FH5 Premium was $99.99. Adjusted for inflation, that's $116.58 in December 2025 dollars. They are charging $119.99. In the UK in 2021 FH5 cost £84.99. Adjusted for inflation, it would be £106.58. They are charging £109.99. I know a lot of people are feeling sticker shock, but the price increase is just a hair over inflation. The world we live in is more expensive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, just to cover all bases, there's the Deluxe Edition of the game — which is less deluxe than the Premium Edition. For $99.99, you'll get the base game, Car Pass and Welcome Pack, but not the early access, expansions, or anything else included in the Premium Edition / Upgrade.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best Xbox Games of All Time</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that last year, a report alleged that Microsoft had pushed Xbox studios to deliver a 30% profit margin — much higher than the industry average. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier said</a> that Microsoft’s 30% profit margin goal had led to the gaming division’s huge layoffs, canceled projects, controversial price rises, and multiplatform push.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> said the average profit margin in the video game industry is 17-22%. Over the past six years, Xbox has hit 10-20%. To put that 30% target into more context, Sony's PlayStation division achieved a 16% profit margin in the first quarter of its 2025 financial year. Bloomberg said Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood enforced the new target in fall 2023 — amid Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can find full details about what comes in each edition in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-where-to-buy">Forza Horizon 6 preorder guide</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The Escalation begins now.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Embark Studios has laid out its new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> roadmap, revealing that a new map, Expedition Windows, Arc threats, a new Raider Deck, and more will launch between now and April 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The four-month plan, shared in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post</a> and dubbed Escalation, comes with details about how the company plans to expand its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms">explosive</a> multiplayer extraction shooter with content all the way to spring. It all comes with what Embark teases will be a steady flow of new quests, trials, items, cosmetics, and quality-of-life features, priming Arc Raiders with a content-filled start to its first new year in players’ hands.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/23/arc-raiders-keyart-roadmap-updated-500kb-1769182043700.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Arc Raiders Roadmap for January - April 2026. Image courtesy of Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to icons, which may tease an update’s contents, each month is assigned a title. Despite having just one week left, the same goes for January, which has been labeled Headwinds. The big inclusion players can expect in the coming days is a level 40+ matchmaking option, giving PvE and PvP Raiders more freedom to raid without fear they’re being matched against those of a higher skill level. A new map condition featuring a bird icon and a new player project are also set to arrive before January is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">February (Shrouded Sky) keeps the ball rolling with a wider collection of slightly small – but still consequential – updates. A new map update, Raider Deck, Expedition Window, and player project seem to be par for the course in terms of regular updates for the future, and they’ll be present in February, too. Next month’s more intriguing additions lie in the promise of a new map condition that eerily features what appears to be a wind icon, as well as a new Arc threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">March (Flashpoint) brings another arc threat, player project, and map condition, with everyone’s favorite resource-collection rooster, Scrappy, also set to receive an update as winter comes to an end. It’s April (Riven Tides) that promises the biggest bombshells for eager fans, with Embark delivering a new Arc Raiders map and a new large Arc threat. Only a skull is shown to tease whatever monstrosity will be joining the likes of the Matriarch and Queen, but judging by the umbrella icon and month title, it appears the new location may feature beaches or watery areas that will inevitably be polluted with lost loot and Raider flares.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark has big plans to kick off 2026, with its roadmap from May onward still being kept a secret for now as the studio aims to launch new content every month. A new Arc Raiders map, which will surely come with its own hidden mysteries to uncover, is no doubt the update players will be penciling into their calendars, though it’s unclear when the team will be more willing to show how the new location will fit into its PvPvE formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The increased ARC presence continues to trouble Shani as the Rustbelt grows more overwhelmed," the blog post says, "but no one holds all the pieces. The scale of the impending escalation remains unknown. Venture topside into an increasingly volatile Rustbelt—and make sure you’re prepared for what’s to come."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched October 30, 2025, and delivered its first new map, Stella Montis, in November. That puts a distance of about five months between its launch and the release date of the next new map. It’s unclear if Embark intends to keep with this pace in the months and years ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the studio works to keep the content faucet on following its winter break, the team has also spent recent weeks <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters"><u>playing Whac-A-Mole with Arc Raiders cheaters</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We basically turn down those who have played zero Steam games."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has an interesting way of screening job candidates. The Japanese game studio requires those applying for game designer positions to submit screenshots of their Steam libraries as part of the hiring process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent <a href="https://x.com/urokuta_ja/status/2014593734827246006?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweet</u></a> on X / Twitter, CEO Takuro Mizobe shed some light on how Pocketpair hires new game designer talent (as spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-requires-game-designer-candidates-to-provide-screenshots-of-their-steam-libraries-and-playtime-according-to-ceo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>). Mizobe explained that Pocketpair has prospective game designers submit screenshots of their Steam play history. Furthermore, Mizobe noted that applicants who <em>don’t</em> use Valve’s game platform don’t get considered for interviews: “Those who haven't played anything on Steam don’t pass the document screening stage.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a reason why Pocketpair wants to see what their job applicants are playing though. As Mizobe explained: “in the interview, we question candidates about the top most-played titles in their Steam libraries, for example, we ask them to explain the game mechanics, to say why they think specific mechanics were adopted, and what makes the game stand out against others in the same genre. Pocketpair is recruiting game creators who are true Steam players!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/urokuta_ja/status/2014594862075805927?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>post</u></a>, Mitobe said that while applicants who are prolific console players are also encouraged to submit their Playstation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch play data, Steam is still the priority. “We basically turn down those who have played zero Steam games,” Mitobe explained. “We want our colleagues to be playing indie games that are only available on Steam.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This makes sense considering Pocketpair’s background as an indie developer whose main distribution platform so far has been Steam. The developer’s biggest hit Palworld, as well as its previous game Craftopia, have their main playerbase on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on social media, Pocketpair Head of Publishing and Communications John “Bucky” Buckley <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/2014706549982409060?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>weighed in on</u></a> the CEO’s comments: “So hilariously true. When I first joined, I was grilled if I knew games like Slay the Spire. Pocketpair is a company that truly is built by gamers, and our CEO is very adamant to keep it that way.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld: Palfarm First Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Launching in open access on Steam and Xbox back in January 2024, Palworld skyrocketed in popularity, selling over 8 million copies in just six days and amassing over 25 million players in its first month. It wasn’t long before Pocketpair <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>teamed up with Sony to launch Palworld Entertainment</u></a> with the aim of expanding the new IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair is continuing to build upon Palworld’s success. As well as updates to the game, it is currently developing Palworld: Palfarm, an upcoming online co-op farming sim set in the same universe. In a surprise announcement last week, it revealed that Palworld is also getting its own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/they-really-are-going-the-pokmon-route-palworld-is-getting-an-official-trading-card-game"><u>physical Trading Card game</u></a>, which is set to drop this June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, Palworld is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit between Pocketpair and Nintendo/The Pokemon Company. Since the dispute kicked off in September 2024, there have been numerous developments, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why"><u>Nintendo rewriting a patent mid-lawsuit</u></a>, arguing that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-as-theyre-not-full-games-attempting-to-sway-judge-in-palworld-lawsuit?_gl=1*1e31uc1*_up*MQ..*_ga*Njk4NDIzNjQ2LjE3NjkxNzk5ODk.*_ga_4L6HY9G8XE*czE3NjkxNzk5OTIkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjkxNzk5OTIkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>mods should not count as prior art</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-companys-monster-capture-patent-rejected-may-signal-problems-for-their-palworld-lawsuit"><u>getting their monster-capture patent rejected</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The creator of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-hits-paid-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-with-dmca-strike-after-creator-refused-request-to-make-it-free-for-everyone"><u>the Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod CD Projekt recently hit with a DMCA strike</u></a> has paused his Patreon page and pulled access to all his mods after receiving another strike from a different publisher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luke Ross, creator of the R.E.A.L. VR mods for games such as Elden Ring, Days Gone, and Far Cry, reportedly earns $20,000 a month through Patreon, which acts as a paywall for his work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He ditched work on his Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod following CD Projekt’s DMCA strike, and has now said he received another strike from publisher 505 Games for his VR conversion of 2020 first-person cyberpunk action game Ghostrunner. IGN has asked 505 Games for comment. Ross declined to comment further when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross’ Patreon page now carries a warning, telling potential subscribers that “for the moment there will be no benefits available.” That means that even if you subscribe to his Patreon, you won’t get access to any of the more than 40 mods he has locked behind it. Ross said he’ll keep his Patreon locked down “until the legal situation clears out.” Existing subscriptions will have their access extended for one month without further payments, Ross said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross hit the headlines this month when Jan Rosner, VP, Business Development at CD Projekt Red, <a href="https://x.com/jan_rosner/status/2013219892405604457" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a> to say the company issued its DMCA strike because the Cyberpunk VR was a paid mod, which violates its fan content guidelines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We never allow monetization of our IP without our direct permission and/or an agreement in place,” Rosner said. “We were in touch with Luke last week and informed him that he needs to make it free for everyone (with optional donations) or remove it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are big fans of mods to our games — some of the work out there has been nothing short of amazing, including Luke’s mod for Cyberpunk 2077. We’d be happy to see it return as a free release. However, making a profit from our IP, in any form, always requires permission from CD Projekt Red.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross <a href="https://x.com/LukeRoss_00/status/2013321528679473503" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>responded to Rosner’s tweet</u></a> to take issue with his work being characterized as fan content. Rather, Ross insisted, it is independent software and thus does not infringe on CD Projekt’s IP rights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm sorry but I don't believe you are within your rights in demanding that my software needs to be free,” Ross said. “It is not ‘derivative work’ or ‘fan content’: it supports a large number of games which were built upon different engines, and it contains absolutely zero code or assets from your IP. Saying that it infringes your IP rights is equivalent to maintaining for example that RivaTuner violates game publishers' copyrights because it intercepts the images the game is drawing on screen and it processes them in order to overlay its statistics.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Ross told IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">people were now pirating his Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod to “punish” him for breaking CD Projekt's terms of service</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Over 50 Ghostrunner Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qkavjg/luke_ross_removes_access_to_all_mods/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new post to subscribers</a>, Ross said Patreon automatically complied with 505 Games’ alleged DMCA takedown notice for his Ghostrunner mod.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't blame them,” he continued. “DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they ‘believe’ their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don't like — and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross said his Patreon is now under threat of termination because of repeated DMCA strikes, and must “avoid posting material that will subject your account to further claims of copyright infringement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In light of the above facts, I'm being forced to take immediate action,” Ross explained. “I'm making unavailable all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years, so that there will be no ground for further claims. And since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I'm making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time.”</p><span data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><div id="rank-cd-projekt-reds-games" data-cy="rank-cd-projekt-reds-games"><p><span><span><span><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank CD Projekt Red's Games</h3><h3>Rank CD Projekt Red's Games</h3></span></span><span></span></span></p></div></span><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN had asked Ross if he planned to make the Cyberpunk VR mod free, thus complying with CD Projekt’s terms of service. Responding, Ross said that while he wouldn’t rule out doing so, it would be a lot of work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do not rule out releasing the mod free for everyone,” he said. “But it would take time, because my software supports 40+ games and various completely different engines, which makes creating a version that specifically supports only Cyberpunk 2077 a non-trivial task. Also, the people who have voluntarily given their money to me in order to support my development efforts for the framework might not be happy about seeing the mod being given away all of a sudden to everyone just because I've been bullied into it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross told subscribers that “people on the web are thirsty for blood because back in the GTA 5 and RDR 2 era, an article came out stating that I was raising $20,000 a month.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Is that ‘reasonable’? Assuming that overall the work I poured into making my software support Cyberpunk, turning it into the ‘most immersive gaming experience’ some people had in their lives, amounted to a few months, say $50,000: is that ‘reasonable’ according to the arbitrary criteria of Cyberpunk's publisher? Something tells me it wouldn't be considered reasonable, despite being a tiny fraction of the many millions they would have to invest for porting CP2077 to VR themselves, and despite the fact that the cost was entirely financed by passionate gamers and none of it was incurred by CD Projekt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hopefully we'll find a way together, in the next few weeks. But if we can't, we'll always have the memories of the wonderful times we spent in those beautiful virtual worlds. Oh and by the way: if you have existing copies of the mods that you downloaded here before all this drama, you will of course be able to use them indefinitely and without restrictions, just like people have been doing for years with the RDR2 mod, as long as the games do not get breaking updates from the publishers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
