            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve put over 100 hours into Donkey Kong Bananza since July. I reached 100% completion on my first playthrough, did a zero-banana run on my second, and I’ve been using a third to practice crazy speedrun techniques and push DK’s incredible movement in more extreme ways. Two months after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">giving Bananza a 10 in my original review</a>, I remain in awe of how DK’s frenetic, destructive abilities work masterfully in tandem with the underground’s meticulously-designed breakable environments. Nintendo nailed the relationship between Bananza’s world and its main character, and the new DK Island and Emerald Rush DLC is a really fun excuse to keep experimenting in this playground in a remixed, more frantic way, even if a slight lack of content and a few minor issues keep it from reaching the same inspired heights as the base game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get too far into things, a quick note. Bananza’s DLC is only accessible after clearing the main story, and it acts as somewhat of an extended postgame. I’m not going to outright spoil Bananza here, but if you’re still drilling your way to the planet core and don’t want to know anything about it, you may want to come back to this review once you’ve reached the end credits. That said, you should also do so <em>before </em>you dive too far past them, because the DLC makes some helpful changes to the original endgame grind that you may want to know about. There are two intertwined halves of the DLC to discuss: DK Island is a new level to explore, while Emerald Rush is a roguelite take on Bananza that makes up the majority of the content found in this combined package.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DK Island is a wonderful love letter to Rare’s Donkey Kong Country trilogy and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/25/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>. It’s a nostalgic return to where DK platformers really began, comparable to exploring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/09/26/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>’s Mushroom Kingdom in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review">Super Mario Odyssey</a>’s postgame. It’s overflowing with great references, from obvious ones like DK’s treehouse and King K. Rool’s Gangplank Galleon from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/02/20/donkey-kong-country-review">Donkey Kong Country</a>, to deeper cuts like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/29/donkey-kong-country-2-review">DKC 2</a>’s goal target tucked away in the corner on the ship’s main deck. As a huge fan of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/12/donkey-kong-jungle-beat">Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</a> – the last DK platformer Nintendo developed internally prior to Bananza – my favorite part of DK Island has to be the bongos out at sea. There are so many more references to DK history I don’t want to give away, but if you have any love for this series, you’ll probably get a kick out of discovering all its easter eggs too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, though, there’s actually not that much to do on DK Island. There are no Banandium Gems or fossils to hunt down and no challenge rooms to conquer. Instead, the gold bonus stages found in Bananza’s main layers are all collected here, making DK Island a convenient place to grind for cash. Bananza’s original postgame sees Grumpy Kong demanding tens of thousands of gold pieces to unlock some of the final collectibles and reach 100% completion, and those who have access to DK Island will have a much easier time grinding than I did before the DLC was out. Elsewhere, DK’s old parrot companion Squawks is here, and he will hunt down one of DK Island’s dozens of collectible statues in exchange for Banandium Chips. Shiny replicas of Bananza’s allies, enemies, and Kongs live in galleries across DK Island, adding to its value as a nostalgic DK history museum. In classic Bananza fashion, you can pick them up, turf surf on them, and use them to carve through the island’s central mountain. You’ll need to grind thousands of Banandium Chips to buy them all, but thankfully, those are the main reward of the Emerald Rush mode. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>DK Island is a rush of nostalgia, but there's actually not that much to do.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides DK Island’s role as a rush of 90s nostalgia and a place to store cool trinkets, there’s not much to it, and I wouldn’t recommend buying the DLC if you’re only interested in this component. It’s a little<em> </em>odd that DK Island wasn’t included as a postgame reward in the base game since it’s so comparable to Odyssey’s Mushroom Kingdom, and gating it behind paid DLC feels kind of like a money-hungry move from Nintendo. This is the company that just charged $10 for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>, though, so I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised at this somewhat eyeroll-worthy choice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, Bananza’s DLC does a much better job justifying its $20 price tag in its Emerald Rush mode. Void Kong has found his way to DK Island, and he’s moved on from his obsession with Banandium Gold to set his sights on a new prize: emerald ore… which is the exact same, but green. Void hires DK and Pauline to collect as much emerald ore as possible, and this introduction includes some cute followups and resolutions for Bananza’s main story and characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve seen some online chatter calling Emerald Rush a simple minigame that should have been free, but it’s much more than that: it’s a fully-featured side mode that turns Bananza’s destruction-based platforming into a fun, replayable roguelite. Each run takes place across a series of rounds – ranging from six to 15 depending on the difficulty level selected – where you have 100 seconds to reach a quota of emerald ore to pay Void. If you don’t reach the goal, your run comes to an end right there. If you do, you can keep working on your build for the rest of the timer to stock up for the next round, where the quota progressively multiples. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island and Emerald Rush DLC Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Emerald Rush feels like a combination of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splatoon-3-multiplayer-review">Splatoon</a>’s Salmon Run and Side Order modes. Personality-wise, it clearly takes inspiration from Salmon Run: both feature a hilariously mean boss screaming at you to meet your quota through a walkie talkie over increasingly difficult rounds. This is also Nintendo’s first take on a roguelite since last year’s excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splatoon-3-side-order-dlc-review">Side Order DLC for Splatoon 3</a> which, notably, also came bundled with a nostalgic hub to explore. It feels like Donkey Kong is following the exact same playbook, as Emerald Rush features dozens of perks that impact your score multiplier in a very similar fashion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each run of Emerald Rush begins by stripping DK of all his skills – including his five Bananza transformations at higher difficulties – and it’s up to you to power him back up while also gathering piles of emerald ore. This is done by frantically exploring layers, fast traveling around with a limited number of barrel cannons, collecting emerald bananas and fossils that restore DK’s skills and give you the choice of one of three perks, and completing goals Void Kong assigns you at specific locations across the map. I love starting from nothing, giving me a place to put all of DK’s high-level base techniques to use, and I found I was able to reach a lot of areas in really cool, satisfying ways – for example, using a chunk to essentially quadruple jump to a platform I traditionally would have used Ostrich Bananza to reach. Emerald Rush challenges advanced players to go for the highest score possible, and there’s always room to grow by deepening your understanding of how DK moves.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Emerald Rush turns Bananza’s destruction-based platforming into a frantic, replayable roguelite.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But even if you’re not interested in crazy parkour tricks, the most important part of Emerald Rush are the perks that alter how much emerald ore appears. There are generic power-ups like generating more when defeating a certain type of enemy, but the most exciting ways to score are the Groove subset of perks, which revolve around multipliers that increase the more you perform a specific action. For instance, my favorite is Turf Groove, where more emerald ore appears based on the total distance traveled by Turf Surfing. The second this perk shows up, my whole playstyle changes. Suddenly, I’m trying to get everywhere by Turf Surfing, which is a big challenge on denser layers. Emerald Rush leads to scenarios you’d never see in the base game, and with such an incredible foundation to build a roguelite on, it’s always fun seeing how you can push the mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stacking multiple perks like this on top of each other can lead to completely busted results, and I scored well over one million points on a few runs where my target goal was less than half that. If you thought the base game had a lot happening on-screen at once, Emerald Rush achieves a new level of unregulated chaos, like one run where I got tons of bonus emerald ore for defeating enemies as Zebra Bananza, leading to 30 minutes of sprinting around nonstop, destroying everything in sight to flood the screen with an overwhelming, borderline unbelievable amount of emerald ore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not always a breeze, though. Like most roguelites, a lot of your success depends on what skills randomly show up, and I lost multiple runs by banking on a certain Bananza to spawn by building my perks around it, and ultimately failing when it never arrived. Speaking of Bananzas, Emerald Rush really rewards mastery over these five powered-up forms, as knowing the best way to take advantage of their unique strengths and swapping between them on the fly results in a high skill ceiling fitting of an endgame mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do wish Emerald Rush went a little bit further with its abilities, though. Seeing big numbers get bigger is always enjoyable, and the way Emerald Rush overlays your multiplier onto every individual explosion is a nice touch – but with a few rare exceptions, there are no brand new abilities to find, and the perks simply make DK’s already-existing moves worth more points. It changes the scoring and the way you play, but beyond reclaiming powers I’m already very used to using in the base game, it never meaningfully expands the options available to you. The best roguelites make you feel more powerful throughout a run by giving you fresh moves as you go, and adding more exciting techniques to DK’s toolkit could have elevated this from a good roguelite mode to a great one.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every First-Party Switch 2 Game</h3><p>Follow this list for my ranking of every Nintendo-published Switch 2 game from the very start of the generation. New content is all that counts, so the enhanced editions of the Zeldas aren't included.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing runs earns you piles of Banandium Chips and rating points that unlock cute bonus costumes, more powerful perks in the rotation, and new layers to tackle. Emerald Rush doesn’t take place in new areas besides DK Island. Instead, DK and Pauline return to familiar locations from Bananza’s campaign, and one of the coolest parts of this mode is how it rewards you for being intimately familiar with these layers. Emerald versions of Banandium Gems and fossils are found in the same locations as their counterparts in the main campaign, and knowing exactly where to find a vein of three fossils or a bunch of bananas makes Emerald Rush feel like a cool B-side to the main story. And, the Getaways you’ve built during the main story become essential fast travel points during a run, further incentivizing you to explore each layer to the fullest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that same vein, Void Kong’s objective will sometimes vaguely order you to do something like give Cranky Kong a high five, or take a swim in a layer that doesn’t have much water in it. Unlike the usual orders, these objectives don’t place a marker on your map, leaving it up to you to find them on your own. Thanks to my 100+ hours and multiple playthroughs, it didn’t take long for me to pinpoint Cranky hanging out on a big tree branch in the Forest Layer, or to find a quick pond to dive into in the Hilltop Layer. I initially thought reusing areas from the base game would be a weakness of Emerald Rush, but the way it leverages your knowledge of familiar locations is a really smart, novel way to effectively reuse old content.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I wish Emerald Rush had added a little bit extra to keep things fresh.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this is another place I wish Emerald Rush had added a little bit extra to keep things fresh. There are no new enemy types, and it never introduces boss encounters that could’ve nicely broken up the pace of runs that last up to 45 minutes. I reached the end credits after about six hours, and while the DLC’s postgame opens up several more layers to play Emerald Rush in, I’m starting to feel a little burnt out on the formula. I’ll probably only stick around to reach 100% completion out of obligation to the base game I’ve so thoroughly completed. And when I do return, I’ll almost certainly throw on my own music or a podcast – the pair of main themes is undeniably catchy with flourishes from Pauline that change depending on your active transformation, but I could definitely go without hearing either for a while after 10 hours in the DLC. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The best part about Donkey Kong Bananza’s DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC is that it gives me a reason to keep experimenting in one of my favorite playgrounds Nintendo has ever created. DK Island is a nostalgic rush that prioritizes fun callbacks to Rare’s golden era over stuff to actually do. Despite the warm, fuzzy feelings I had while exploring, I can’t help but think this would have been more fitting as a final postgame reward in Bananza itself rather than DLC locked behind a paywall. But the bulk of this expansion is housed in Emerald Rush, which let me unleash DK’s craziest parkour possibilities and strategically balance each transformation’s strengths to set new high scores. Its perk system creates unique ways to play you’d never consider in the original campaign, and it smartly returns to old locations and tests your knowledge of important places in a way that feels like a fitting endgame counterpart to the main story. That said, I wish Emerald Rush had introduced more new abilities and enemies to keep me around a bit longer than the 10 hours I’ve put in so far. If you’re hungry for more DK and aren’t opposed to a remixed, roguelite formula, Emerald Rush is probably worth the additional investment. Otherwise, Bananza’s DLC is an enjoyable but inessential expansion to DK and Pauline’s grand adventure.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-all-out-warfare-and-one-iconic-map-returns-and-it-rocks</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-all-out-warfare-and-one-iconic-map-returns-%E2%80%93-and-it-rocks.1300779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If the Battlefield series has ever been known for one thing, it’s the massive, chaotic scale of destruction that takes place in its largest multiplayer maps, and I got a wonderfully refreshing taste of just that when I dove into Battlefield 6’s upcoming 64-player game modes earlier this week. Mirak Valley, the biggest map available at launch, is a fantastic new warzone that reminds me a bit of a much bigger version of Blood Gulch from Halo, with two bases on each side battling it out in a massive, deadly no man’s land, while a remastered version of the iconic Operation Firestorm from Battlefield 3 made an appearance to kick me right in the nostalgia. Both were a literal blast to play, each in their own way, and it just felt so good to be back in large scale war games with bombs exploding and bullets flying every which way, especially with the environments being more destructible than ever and which alter the map in creative ways. Since I skipped Battlefield 2042, it’s been a good, long while since I felt the itch to play a military shooter with this kind of crazy player count, and after a few hours with Battlefield 6 I don’t know how I’ve managed to go so long without it. It feels good to be back!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">As I Walk Through the Valley…</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first map I played was Mirak Valley, which Battlefield Studios says will be the largest map at launch, and yeah, this thing’s pretty huge. Though it’s got small settlements and rocky terrain across long stretches of dirt road on each side, the main attraction are the two unfinished skyscrapers found in the center of the map where a lot of the action takes place. Battling in these claustrophobic concrete boxes and stairwells allows for plenty of close-quarters gunplay, but with unfinished walls all around you, it also leaves you exposed to the outside world to snipe you of launch a missile in your direction, which adds a unique challenge as you attempt to capture the all-important zones found in each of the buildings. And while the gradual destruction of these buildings can make them harder to control, they also allow for interesting opportunities to alter the geometry of the map, like how part of a destroyed building can fall down to create a ramp, which can then be used to reach the second floor of the skyscraper from the outside and make it much easier to navigate (but also harder to defend from would-be invaders).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6: Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mirak Valley ended up easily being my favorite of the two maps I played, both because it’s a fantastically well-designed and ridiculously large warzone to master, but also because of these moments where the new destruction engine makes itself so clearly known. For example, in one match I spent a lot of time in a small two-story building picking off the enemy from a distance and trying to remain hidden, but over the course of the match (and many deaths) the building I was in continued to lose pieces of itself until there was almost nothing left. The window I was shooting out of at the start became half of a wall absent a room, which then fell away as I retreated to a staircase, until there was almost none of the structure left by the end of the battle and I found myself peering out behind rubble to take my shots. Moments like that are an excellent showcasing of just how much mayhem you can cause over the course of the match, all of it which organically takes place over the course of battle instead of being pre-determined events that inevitably happen every match.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Into the Fire(storm)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">After not nearly enough time exploring (and blowing up) Mirak Valley, we moved on to more familiar terrain with the returning Battlefield 3 map of Operation Firestorm. If you’ve never played this one before, it takes place on an oil refinery with a big warehouse where you can get your fill of close-range encounters, or you can take the the labyrinth of metal stairs and walkways that is the refinery itself, complete with the unforgettable giant fuel tanks that explode in gobsmackingly beautiful fashion with a little provocation from the business end of your assault rifle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The return of this map is sure to bring back fond memories of good times had and bitter rivals slain, but it was noticeable to me how some of the legacy map design choices didn’t exactly jive with modern day multiplayer expectations. To their credit, Battlefield Studios certainly made some adjustments to line of sight, destructible setpieces, and the available combat lanes you can use to take it to the bad guys, but they also had to keep a lot the same to make it recognizable as the map we know and love. That means there are plenty of barren areas you’ll have to run through, especially on the outskirts of the arena, where you’ll be wide open for someone to pick you off without much trouble or simply be a bit bored waiting to get to your destination with not much to do along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the virtues of this map are still as clear as ever, especially the long-range potential of the refinery’s elevated walkways, which are a sniper’s dream that I took full advantage of. Plus, being able to blow up key parts of the warehouse to do things like kill the prone enemies hidden on the rooftop by blasting away part of the ceiling and shooting them through it, is just *chef’s kiss*. It definitely didn’t click with me as much as the sparkly, new Mirak Valley though, especially since this Battlefield 3 throwback feels like such a tiny arena by comparison.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">On Target</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter which map I was on though, I was consistently impressed by how good Battlefield 6 felt, whether it was the customizable character classes, more grounded gunplay, or the handful of game modes that put my combat prowess to the test. Each of the four classes – Assault, Support, Recon, and Engineer – have their advantages that made it difficult to stick to any one, like how easy it was to get my teammates back in the fight with the support class, or how awesome it was to have sniper dummies to distract my enemies as the Recon class. One cool aspect though, is that I was able to swap out weapons I preferred with one class when I decided to change over, like how I gave my Assault character the Support character’s machine gun so I wouldn’t have to bother reloading in between kills (and because I tend to play more stationary than most and so didn’t mind the list accuracy). This felt like a nice middle ground between locking classes out of using the arsenal not natively a part of their class, since gadgets and unique abilities were still exclusive, but weapons could be freely traded, and I got a kick out of experimenting with different combinations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also really appreciated some of the adjustments to gunplay that made engagements a bit less goofy, like how accuracy with weapons is diminished while in motion, or especially when midair or jumping around. This meant I saw less of players bouncing up and down cartoonishly to kill me, which always feels out of place in a military shooter that’s aiming for some level of realism. Don’t get me wrong, there was still plenty of couch spamming and ducking in and out of corners to get shots off, and mastering mobility certainly plays a role in your ability to dominate the competition, but I also felt more rewarded for calming taking my shot against players scrambling around wildly to evade me.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game modes we played on each map were variations of area control game types we’ve seen before and one new one that added a heavy helping of chaos. Conquest served as the classic game of maintaining control of as many key parts of the map as possible while scoring kills, while Breakthrough put one team on the offense to take control of specific regions of the warzone that the other team fought to defend. Escalation, on the other hand, has an interesting concept where throughout the match the capture points in play are gradually reduced, forcing conflict onto certain parts of the terrain that directs the flow of battle and reduces stalling. This made for absolute chaos as everyone rushed to certain areas for all-out warfare that usually just involved lots of tanks blowing everything to smithereens, and was maybe not as balanced as the more vanilla game modes, but damn if it didn’t make for a hilarious time.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-all-out-warfare-and-one-iconic-map-returns-and-it-rocks]]></content:encoded>

One of the surprise announcements, in addition to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-coming-april-2026-with-first-teaser-trailer">Mario Movie sequel</a>, was that a new collection of Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 is coming to Switch. And as we all know, one certainty in life is that when a new Switch game comes out, amiibo figures are sure to follow. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Nintendo is releasing two new Super Mario Galaxy amiibo. One is Mario and Luma. The other is Rosalina and Lumas. And despite that the game they accompany is out October 2, these figures aren’t out until April 2, 2026 – a day before the movie hits theaters. They available for preorder for $39.99 each, but they’ve already sold out at Amazon and Walmart. (They may come back into stock, but then again, they may not). Here’s where you can still get them.</p><p id="mario-and-luma-amiibo"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mario and Luma amiibo">Mario and Luma amiibo</h2></p><div catalogid="a6f603f1-53ae-418f-aced-1de573a6361c" id="228169"><div id="228169" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mario and Luma amiibo</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDryNw?object_uuid=848664ef-cbbd-49f4-b98e-2c6dc649cd57&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Best Buy</a> - $39.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QmOeJK?object_uuid=848664ef-cbbd-49f4-b98e-2c6dc649cd57&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at GameStop</a> - $39.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/911rlb?object_uuid=848664ef-cbbd-49f4-b98e-2c6dc649cd57&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a> - SOLD OUT</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9yGKYP?object_uuid=848664ef-cbbd-49f4-b98e-2c6dc649cd57&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a> - SOLD OUT</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mario and Luma amiibo is kind of perfect? Mario’s flying pose calls back to the cover of the Super Mario Galaxy. But it also includes a round patch of grassy earth as a base, just like the little planetoids you run around on in the game. And there’s a Luma character and a Launch Star. In that one amiibo figure, you get the gist of what the whole game is about. Pretty cool if you ask me.</p></div><p id="rosalina-and-lumas-amiibo"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rosalina and Lumas amiibo">Rosalina and Lumas amiibo</h2></p><p id="rosalinas-storybook-hardcover"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rosalina's Storybook (Hardcover)">Rosalina's Storybook (Hardcover)</h2></p><p id="super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-gal"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Gal">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</h2></p><div catalogid="a6f603f1-53ae-418f-aced-1de573a6361c" id="227967"><div id="227967" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While we’re at it, you might as well <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2-for-nintendo-switch-where-to-buy">preorder Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> if you haven’t already. It’s a collection of two absolute bangers from the Wii era. These were generally considered the best 3D Mario games until Odyssey came along, and they still absolutely hold up. The game is out soon, too, on October 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN. He also runs IGN's board game and LEGO coverage.
