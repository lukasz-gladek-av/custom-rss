            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-numbers-are-up-compared-to-last-year-seemingly-due-to-mods<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Baldur's Gate 3's players numbers are up compared to this time last year, seemingly due to official mod support from developer Larian Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian director of publishing Michael Douse shared the improvement on <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1858532995084271848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>, revealing the average daily active users is up 20% over 2023. "Mods are very good," Douse said of the improvement, referencing the release of official mod support as part of Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game, which released in August 2023, is also enjoying an increase of 3% in average daily peak concurrents and a 61% boost in Steam Deck users compared to last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This increase is impressive for a largely single-player game. Baldur's Gate 3 does have cooperative multiplayer but is not a live service that may be expected to enjoy a boost in player numbers year-on-year. And while Larian has continued to update Baldur's Gate 3 with new features and improvements, it has not released DLC for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mods, which are even available on console and not just PC as standard, are proving incredibly popular among Baldur's Gate 3 players. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-download-more-than-50-million-mods-including-10000-that-rename-withers-bone-daddy">P</a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-download-more-than-50-million-mods-including-10000-that-rename-withers-bone-daddy">layers downloaded more than 50 million mods via the official mod support tool</a> in less than two months, and this number doesn't include the thousands made unofficially.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mods released so far include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-mod-cuts-turn-based-combat-and-makes-everything-real-time">one that adds real-time combat</a> to the otherwise turn-based RPG and another that brought entire new maps to Faer√ªn, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-modder-reveals-first-custom-maps-including-avernus">including the highly requested Avernus</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 7 otherwise added official content including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/karlach-is-trending-on-xtwitter-after-baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-because-her-new-evil-ending-is-absolutely-metal">an "absolutely metal" ending for Karlach</a> and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-finds-scrapped-evil-ending-in-patch-7-thats-hilariously-anticlimactic">hidden evil ending</a>. Players will also be relieved to hear that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-is-not-the-final-update-larian-confirms-but-it-doesnt-want-to-talk-about-whats-coming-just-yet">it's not the final major Baldur's Gate 3 patch after all</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">In our 10/10 review of Baldur's Gate 3</a>, IGN said: "With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
