            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/anker-zolo-10000-mah-power-bank-deal-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Even includes a built-in USB cable so you don't have to buy a separate one.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For a limited time, Amazon has brought back one of its best power bank deals from Black Friday. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5b4K5?object_uuid=5f83cdc0-10f0-40db-8529-9a7a7be972dc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anker Zolo 10,000mAh 30W USB Power Bank</a> is back down to only $15.59, a 40% discount from its original $26 price. This is an excellent deal for an Anker-branded 10,000mAh power bank that can fast charge a Nintendo Switch console at its maximum rate. The Zolo is compact, can completely recharge a Switch console more than once, and has a couple of unique nifty features, like a built-in USB cable and a discrete digital display. Plus, it's decked out in a rare pastel blue, pink, and white color schemes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Anker Zolo 10,000mAh USB Power Bank for $15.59</h2><div catalogid="8479891f-e34a-4cd8-951d-5230aeb5aeed" id="209566"><div id="209566" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker Zolo 10,000mAh 30W USB Power Bank</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two reasons why this power bank is a great battery backup for your Nintendo Switch console: capacity and charging rate. A 10,000mAh (37Whr) power bank can charge a Nintendo Switch OLED from completely empty to full about 1.9 times. Provided you fully charge your Switch from the get-go, that nearly triples your total playtime. At the same time, a 10,000mAh power bank still maintains a pretty small footprint; for example, this particular model is about the size of an iPhone and weighs under 8oz. The Anker Zolo power bank also boasts a 30W charging output over USB Type-C. The Nintendo Switch console accepts a maximum charging rate of 18W. That means this power bank will be able to charge your Switch at the same rate as the official Nintendo charger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Zolo has a built-in USB cable, however it's not retractable. Instead, you plug it into itself so that it forms a secure loop that's strong enough to be used like a lanyard. I have this power bank myself and I can tell you the loop is quite sturdy. There's also a separate USB Type-C port that be used for either input or output. Finally, there's a simple digital display that shows you the remaining battery charge as a percentage.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TSA-Approved</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Note that the TSA requires all power banks to be brought in carry-on bags; <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/power-banks" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">power banks are not allowed in check-in</a> regardless of capacity. The Anker power bank's 10,000mAh capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh carry-on limit, so it can be brought onto planes. It's also low-profile enough that no one will take notice in the first place. If a TSA official actually does take the initiative to test the wattage on your power bank, you're well in the clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more options, check out our picks for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-portable-charger">best power banks of 2024</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/all-pokemon-games-on-nintendo-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Often cited as the world's most valuable media franchises, Pokémon is a household name that's been a Nintendo staple since the Game Boy. The beloved series is home to hundreds of amazing creatures, with each new generation bringing loads more to discover. Every console released by Nintendo has had dozens of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order">Pokémon games released</a> for it, and the Nintendo Switch is no exception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we approach 2025, now is a great time to explore the Pokémon offerings on Switch and catch up before new games (and perhaps a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">new Nintendo console</a>) are released. Below, we've compiled every Pokémon game that has been released on Nintendo Switch, and will keep an eye on any <a href="#upcoming-titles" data-cy="styled-link">upcoming Pokémon titles</a> that may arise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Many Pokémon Games Are There on Nintendo Switch?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In total, <strong>12 Pokémon games have been released for the Nintendo Switch</strong>. This includes the mainline games for the 8th and 9th Pokémon generations as well as plenty of spinoffs. For the sake of this list, we've counted mainline entries with two versions as a single release. We also don't include the Pokémon games offered through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, but you can check out that list below.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What Pokemon Game Should You Get in 2024? </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're wondering which game is worth picking up on the Switch in 2024, my recommendation is Pokémon Legends: Arceus. It's not going to give you that OG Pokémon game feeling, but that's what the older generation games are for. Instead, Legends: Arceus introduces more action and RPG elements to the Pokémon series, offering the freshness of open areas to explore, more control over encounters, and plenty of polish for the handheld. </p><div catalogid="50afecce-e265-4f93-be54-71713034bf2d" id="165225"><div id="165225" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch Pokémon Legends: Arceus</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">All Pokémon Games on the Nintendo Switch (in Release Order)</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Pokkén Tournament DX (2017)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/21/pokken-tournament-dx-review">Pokkén Tournament</a> was originally released for the Wii U in 2016.
