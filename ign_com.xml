Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and [graphics] sensibilities. Stay tuned."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is, of course, already a "third" game. As the last mainline Ecco instalment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ecco-the-dolphin-defender-of-the-future"><u>Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future</u></a> was released on Dreamcast 25 years ago in 2000. However, creator Annunziata wasn't involved. A further sequel, Ecco 2: Sentinels of the Universe, which had been written as a direct sequel to Defender of the Future, was cancelled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I just want to finally be able to enter my secret password from the end of Tides of Time. I still have it written in the codes section of the game manual," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1kfj391/comment/mqsd37c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one fan, while another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1kfj391/comment/mqshuvr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reminded</u></a> us: "I wonder how many people know how completely bonkers the plot of the games are."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">10 (Unintentionally) Terrifying Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Annunziata didn't provide any additional details as to when we'll get to be reunited with Ecco, but a countdown on the official <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ecco the Dolphin website</u></a> is set to expire in 8,508 hours' time — that's about a year from now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ecco the Dolphin originally launched in 1992 on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, and was followed by a sequel, Ecco: The Tides of Time, in 1994. Ecco Jr. and Ecco Jr. and the Great Ocean Treasure Hunt were released in 1995, although they were "edutainment" games and primarily developed as learning tools.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ecco the Dolphin sees you play as the titular dolphin, as your underwater world has been devastated by a swirling gust of air and water. You must help him navigate back through treacherous tropical reefs and freezing polar ice floes to reunite him with his dolphin pod. We thought the 2000 remake was okay, writing: "Ecco the Dolphin is a classic from SEGA. But sometimes classics should stay in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For those who have played Ecco before, there's really no reason to come back to it," we wrote of the 2007 remake in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/17/ecco-the-dolphin-review"><u>IGN's Ecco the Dolphin review</u></a>. "There are no extras offered and the Achievements are junk. If you've never played Ecco, then you may want to give it a go. It really is one of the more innovative titles of its time. But, again, that time has long passed, and Ecco's gameplay doesn't stand the test of time like Sonic's."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last Ecco the Dolphin game fared much better, getting a 7.6 score in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ecco-the-dolphin-defender-of-the-future"><u>IGN's Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future review</u></a>, saying: "If you thought Flipper had personality, wait until you get a load of Ecco the Dolphin. Experience amazing visuals and an engrossing story, and defend the ocean that is rightfully yours."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.
