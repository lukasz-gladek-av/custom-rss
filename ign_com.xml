It kicks off with anniversary concerts in Poland and Boston, Massachusetts in May 2025, before a tour of Europe in the fourth quarter of 2025 and then the U.S. in the first quarter of 2026. CD Projekt’s new U.S. hub is in Boston, which explains why the initial anniversary concert takes place there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tickets go on sale soon, CD Projekt said. The full scale of the concert series — as well as ticket information — will be unveiled over time, with more information to be revealed through the official website and newsletter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>The experience features select tracks from the game and its expansions, arranged for the occasion by The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt composer Marcin Przybyłowicz, who will also join select stops as a special guest. The live celebration is further bolstered by Polish folk metal band Percival, co-composers of the game’s soundtrack, known for their iconic contributions to the game’s sound. Alongside a skilled orchestra, they will bring to life beloved tracks from Geralt’s journey through the continent.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a busy time for CD Projekt.

In many ways it would make sense, given both Tekken and Pac-Man are owned by Bandai Namco, and The Swordsman is an actual humanoid fighter who wields a sword. But what does Harada himself think?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put that question to the man himself in a recent interview, and his response suggested such a crossover is certainly possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Perhaps,” Harada responded when asked, “because the game environment would be a good crossover for Tekken, atmosphere-wise.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out that Harada explored the possibility of adding Pac-Man to Tekken as a guest character long before Shadow Labyrinth was a thing. But designs for the character, which saw Pac-Man as a head on a muscular humanoid body, horrified original Pac-Man creator Tōru Iwatani.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Many years ago, Iwatani-san, the original creator of Pac-Man, was still in the company when we were here. And I thought about maybe using Pac-Man as a guest character,” Harada remembered. “So I had the artist come up with a sketch and it turned out to be that the character had like a Pac-Man head, but the body was this really muscular bodybuilder type.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I showed it to Iwatani-san, and Iwatani-san got so upset and scolded me quite heavily. So I was surprised that, ‘Oh, I can't just be quite liberal with the Pac-Man IP, I have to be more constrained.’ At the time I was a bit surprised, but now because of the atmosphere of this [Shadow Labyrinth], it's something that could be considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iwatani, by the way, is apparently fully on board with Bandai Namco’s plan to take the Pac-Man IP in totally different directions. “Iwatani-san seems to realize that that's something that's needed at this point,” Harada added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2D action platformer Shadow Labyrinth stars The Swordsman, a character whose only goal is to "eat" as they attempt to escape a maze. It’s a Metroidvania of sorts, and a significant departure for the world famous arcade franchise. Meanwhile, Tekken 8 gets Clive from Final Fantasy 16 as a DLC character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-nintendo-game-of-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-nintendo-game-of-2024.1063563/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-nintendo-game-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2024 will likely be remembered as a transitional year for Nintendo. Last year saw heavy hitters like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Bros. Wonder while next year is all about the Nintendo Switch 2, leaving this year in kind of an awkward middle ground. Even so, Switch owners still had a ton of great games to play during the aging console’s eighth year on the market as Nintendo somehow managed to publish a game every single month, while third-party and indie developers continued to support Switch with awesome series revivals and clever new ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While many fans were begging to turn the page to the next generation, Nintendo proved Switch still had enough in the tank for one more year with a surprise Zelda game where you actually play as Princess Zelda, our favorite Mario Party in years, and a whole lot more. These are the best Nintendo games of 2024, starting off with the honorable mentions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Nintendo Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Honorable Mentions</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A couple of titles just barely missed out making our top tier or picks for the year. For years, the concept of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake</a> felt as mythical and unattainable as opening the titular door itself, but Nintendo finally listened to this RPG’s extremely vocal fanbase and delivered a near perfect retelling of Mario’s iconic GameCube quest. It’s remarkable how well The Thousand-Year Door holds up 20 years later, with its hilarious script, satisfying combat, lovable party members, and memorable locations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario literally climbs the ranks of a pro wrestling league set on a floating island in the sky, and that’s just the setting for one chapter of this epic adventure. And, following the last few Paper Mario entries that traded in unique, original characters in favor of hordes upon hordes of samey Toads, it’s a complete delight to see the slimy city of Rogueport and its surrounding areas peppered with fresh personalities. Simply giving The Thousand-Year Door a gorgeous new coat of paint and sprinkling in a few quality-of-life improvements has instantly placed it on the list of the best RPGs on Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review">Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble,</a> a stunning return to form for a series that had completely lost its way for the better part of the last two decades. After several misguided attempts to get the monkey ball rolling again, the pieces finally fell into place in Banana Rumble thanks to the tightest controls, physics, and level design the series has seen since Super Monkey Ball 2 in 2003. Tilting the stage to roll your monkey to the finish feels right again, and the new spin dash ability significantly opens up speedrunning and trick shot techniques without feeling like a betrayal to Monkey Ball’s core mechanics like some past gimmicks did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t hold back by the end either, with devilish late-game obstacles that will throw your monkey off the stage dozens of times before you finally break through that sweet, sweet goal. It’s also a fantastic game to play with others, as you can tackle all of Banana Rumble’s 200+ stages in local or online co-op with up to four players. It may not quite soar to the lofty heights of the GameCube originals, but it’s undeniable that Super Monkey Ball is back after years of fall outs, and I’m both shocked and overjoyed I get to say that in 2024.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Super Mario Party Jamboree</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/smp-jam-blogroll-1728690742214-1734443527122.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we move onto the runner-ups – the games that narrowly missed out on the top spot. First is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review">Super Mario Party Jamboree,</a> one of Nintendo’s finest efforts of 2024, which simultaneously became a go-to multiplayer game on Switch and a standout entry in the longrunning dice-rolling, backstabbing series. It has pretty much everything you’d want from a great Mario Party: a wonderful set of seven boards each with their own unique wrinkles, an incredibly fun and varied set of minigames you’ll want to return to again and again, and a huge roster of 22 playable characters filled with both fan favorites and deep cuts. Plus, if you’ve been on the wrong end of one too many Chance Times or Bowser Revolutions and just can’t take it anymore, the all-new optional Pro Rules offer an alternative take on Mario Party that lessen the luck-based elements and emphasize skill and strategy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jamboree is particularly exciting because it’s easily the best original Mario Party game developed by Nintendo Cube, the studio that’s been in charge of the series since 2012’s Mario Party 9. The developers spent years trying to completely transform the Mario Party formula – from putting all four players into a car, to having everyone take their turn at the same time – and it just never really worked. But the Switch era represents a comeback story for the Mario Party series, beginning with Super Mario Party which was a step in the right direction, but still not entirely there. Then, Nintendo Cube returned to the franchise’s greatest hits in Mario Party Superstars, which was a ton of fun, but it wasn’t original content. Finally, the Mario Party comeback arc is complete with new boards, items, and minigames that stand side-by-side with the greats and cement Jamboree as a modern multiplayer classic. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/lorelei-blogroll-1719248226107-1734443527122.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like head-scratching, mind-bending puzzle games like Return of the Obra Dinn and The Witness, then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> is a must-play to add to your Switch wishlist. Created by Sayonara Wild Hearts developer Simogo, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes features the same unrivaled presentation and atmosphere with a tantalizing mystery to match. The story begins with Lorelei arriving at a creepy, surreal hotel and within minutes you’ll be enraptured by unraveling its greatest mysteries and discovering why she was summoned there in the first place. Our reviewer Tom Marks called it “the closest thing I’ve played to a modernization of what a point-and-click adventure could be,” saying “Its story is enticingly fresh, its vibes perfectly eerie, and the desire it evokes to uncover every inch of its intricately interwoven mystery is irresistible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also not afraid to scare you. While it never treads too far into horror game territory, it effectively keeps you on edge with a handful of frightening moments as you dive deeper down its ever-expanding rabbit hole. As Tom said, “Lorelei and the Laser Eyes does do a fantastic job of unsettling you as you go, using its beautiful black-and-white visual style with pops of neon to create haunting, abstract imagery that can sometimes be as anxiety-inducing as any monster.” This is one of the best examples of a small developer bringing a brilliant set of ideas to Switch in 2024, resulting in an unforgettable journey that’s not quite like anything else on the console.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Runner-Up: Unicorn Overlord</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/unicornoverlord-review-blogroll-1709773454638-1734443527121.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a phenomenal year for RPGs, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unicorn-overlord-review">Unicorn Overlord</a> is a big reason why. This is a superb high-fantasy strategy RPG from 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim developer Vanillaware, and the developer’s iconic art style is on full display with Unicorn Overlord’s beautifully animated characters and backgrounds, along with some of the most unnecessarily good-looking food we’ve ever seen in a video game. Our reviewer Eric Zalewski said Unicorn Overlord has one of his favorite strategy RPG combat systems ever, praising its unique blend of real-time strategy and turn-based RPG mechanics that result in something entirely new and delightfully deep. You’ll need to expertly maneuver your squads and fully engage with its complex ability system to succeed on the higher difficulties, and our review praised the scenarios you’re thrust into across Unicorn Overlord’s diverse maps, calling the mechanics and gimmicks presented some of the very best in the genre. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unicorn Overlord’s fairly stereotypical story about a prince fighting to take back his kingdom is immaculately presented across five separate arcs that each add vital context to the tale, with Eric saying, “Rather than lengthy exposition or 30-minute lore dumps, its wonderfully realized world is gradually fleshed out by the people you interact with, providing interesting perspectives as you learn the stories of both your allies and your enemies. Its overarching plot may be rather simple as a result, sticking closely to genre tropes, but when paired with a beautiful presentation, even familiar stories manage to feel fresh.” Unicorn Overlord is a special RPG in a year full of them, and proof that some third-party developers are still bringing the good stuff to Nintendo Switch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Winner: The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/zeldaechoesofwisdom-1731393838923-1734443527121.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There were a lot of great Switch games this year, but in the end it’s tough to beat The Legend of Zelda, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">Echoes of Wisdom</a> is IGN’s pick for the best Nintendo game of 2024. Echoes of Wisdom marks a lot of exciting firsts for the series: It’s the first new top-down Zelda game on Switch, the first time a Zelda game is played largely without a sword, and most importantly it’s the first time Princess Zelda is the playable character in a mainline entry. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this isn’t just a traditional adventure where Zelda simply takes the place of Link. Instead, Echoes of Wisdom carves out its own niche in Hyrule’s history thanks to its central copy-and-paste gameplay mechanic where Zelda can summon Echoes of objects and enemies she encounters to solve puzzles and take down powerful foes in unique ways. From plopping down a bed to restore her health with a quick nap whenever and wherever to finally turning the tables and commanding enemies that have been nuisances for years, there’s no shortage of fun, innovative uses for the dozens of Echoes at Zelda’s disposal. It takes a page from Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom by setting players loose to find their own solutions, where the only wrong answers are the ones that don’t work. It only took hours after Echoes of Wisdom’s launch to see crazy improvisational combinations surfacing on social media, like tornado beds and crows endlessly chasing after a chunk of meat just out of their reach, leading to a pretty reliable form of flight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Echoes of Wisdom doesn’t entirely return to the classic top-down setup that a lot of longtime fans miss, but it takes several half steps that bridge the gap between the modern formula and the old favorites. Hyrule is littered with Heart Pieces to find, warm orchestral melodies accompany nearly every step of the journey, and many characters, locations, and other references make Echoes of Wisdom feel like a love letter to cherished Zelda games like A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and many others. With Echoes of Wisdom, Nintendo once again took the Zelda series in a bold, unexpected direction, giving Hyrule’s princess her long-awaited starring role with new gameplay concepts we never could have imagined beforehand, and that’s why it’s our pick for the best Nintendo game of the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let us know what your pick is for the best Switch game of the year, and be sure to check out all of the other categories for the 2024 IGN Awards.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-starfield-dev-surprised-by-how-much-loading-the-game-launched-with<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big criticisms <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> players have with the game is the over-abundance of loading screens. When Bethesda’s sci-fi epic launched last year, fans were surprised by just how often you’d trigger loading, from on-foot traversal to simply heading into city buildings. Players said Starfield’s loading broke immersion and added frustrating pauses to gameplay, and modders have worked to remove as much of it as possible over the past year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/starfield/Neon_City_Guide">city of Neon</a> was a particular focus of loading complaints. This cyberpunk-style urban area would often trigger a loading screen just for opening doors, some near to each other, which made questing annoying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But did it have to be this way? In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/veteran-starfield-developer-surprised-by-sheer-number-loading-screens/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer.com</a>, developer Nate Purkeypile, who worked at Bethesda Game Studios from 2007 before leaving in 2021 to found Just Purkey Games, revealed his surprise at the sheer amount of loading the game ended up launching with, particularly in the city of Neon.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/17/starfield-neon-city-core-1734446210120.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Did the city of Neon need to launch with so much loading?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It could have existed without those [loading zones],” Purkeypile said. “Like, some of those were not there when I had been working on it and so it was a surprise to me that there was as many as there were.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why did Starfield launch with so many loading screens? Purkeypile said part of the segmentation of the game has to do with the way the Creation Engine, which Bethesda uses to make its games, works, and that has a lot to do with performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of it is gating stuff off for performance in Neon,” Purkeypile confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about New Atlantis, Starfield’s main city? It was designed with its train system in mind, but doesn’t let you sit on the train as it takes you from A to B. Instead, you get another loading screen. That decision, Purkeypile suggested, was more about having players not just sit there for the train ride.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Starfield Update Screenshots - gamescom ONL 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Purkeypile was lead lighting artist and senior world artist on Starfield and left Bethesda two years before the game launched, one year before its original release date, and a month before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-redfall-delayed-2023">its high-profile delay to 2023 was announced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of Starfield’s launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-starfield-performance-and-frame-rate-on-xbox-series-x-and-s">Bethesda development chief Todd Howard revealed that the game would release locked at 30 frames per second on both Xbox Series X and S</a> to ensure “consistency” of performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it'll come as no surprise, given our previous games, what we go for,” Howard said at the time. “Always these huge, open worlds, fully dynamic, hyper detail where anything can happen. And we do want to do that. It's 4K in the X. It's 1440 on the S. We do lock it at 30, because we want that fidelity, we want all that stuff. We don't want to sacrifice any of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fortunately in this one, we've got it running great. It's often running way above that. Sometimes it's 60. But on the consoles, we do lock it because we prefer the consistency, where you're not even thinking about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And we don't ever want to sacrifice that experience that makes our games feel really, really special. So it feels great. We're really happy with how it feels even in the heat of battle. And we need that headroom because in our games, really anything can happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since launch, Bethesda has worked to improve the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-gets-big-update-that-adds-detailed-surface-maps-ship-decoration-and-60fps-on-xbox-series-x">with 60fps now possible as part of performance mode</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-dev-seemingly-teases-snoop-dogg-appearance-in-project-century<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza / Like a Dragon developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio appears to be teasing a Snoop Dogg appearance in its mysterious new game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/project-century-rgg">Project Century</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RGG Studio posted a photo of Snoop wearing the distinctive jacket worn by the protagonist in the Project Century trailer. At the same time, studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama posted a photo of himself in the jacket, mirroring the pose of Snoop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Snoop photo has the teasing caption "...yet," while Yokoyama's, in Japanese, said: "please wait a bit, yeah?" It's not the tease RGG Studio fans were expecting of Project Century, which appears to be a new series potentially connected to Yakuza / Like a Dragon but set in 1915, given it was only revealed at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">The Game Awards 2024</a> a few days ago, but there are some elements which aren't completely bizarre.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="und" dir="ltr">"...yet." <a href="https://t.co/PZVRac0ag9" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/PZVRac0ag9</a></p>— RGG Studio | Like a Dragon &amp; Yakuza Series (@RGGStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1868824408225382702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Snoop was also at The Game Awards 2024, for example, where he performed a medley of songs to the developers and press in attendance. It's therefore likely the photo was taken there, and could be as simple as him liking the jacket and wanting a photo in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn't the first time Snoop Dogg's name has been brought up in relation to the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series. Following on from Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which featured Danny Trejo as the likeness and voice for villain Dwight Méndez, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-asks-yakuzalike-a-dragon-fans-if-they-want-celebs-like-keanu-reeves-and-mark-hamill-in-next-game">publisher Sega asked fans which other celebrities they'd like to appear</a> in the series going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside video game adjacent stars such as Keanu Reeves, Mark Hamill, Jack Black, Rami Malek, and David Hayter came other celebrities, one of which was none other than Snoop Dogg. This tease could therefore be the end result of this poll, though nothing is confirmed yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snoop would likely appear as a new character and not just as a cameo of himself, especially if he does show up in Project Century since it's set 56 years before he was born. Little is known about the game, however, so anything is possible.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ちょっと待ってね <a href="https://t.co/N2hkLB5Z53" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/N2hkLB5Z53</a></p>— 横山昌義 (@yokoyama_masa) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokoyama_masa/status/1868823727687057888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-fans-are-already-theorizing-what-the-heck-rgg-studios-project-century-is">RGG Studio fans are already deep in the theorizing phase to figure out what the heck Project Century is</a>, of course, and already have ideas on where it's set, if it's connected to the Yakuza / Like a Dragon franchise, who it's main character is, and if it's using the developer's Dragon Engine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They'll have to be patient for these answers though. Project Century is probably still a while away given it doesn't have a title yet, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-set-to-take-on-street-fighter-and-tekken-once-again-with-virtua-fighter-the-game-awards-2024">RGG Studio is currently developing Virtua Fighter 6</a> and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii alongside it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is known for its unbelievably speedy development times, however. In the last five years, for example, its released Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Judgment Remastered, Lost Judgment, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, alongside three Super Monkey Ball Games and an enhanced remaster of Virtua Fighter 5. That's 12 games in total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">In our 9/10 review of the last RGG Studio release</a>, IGN said: "Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
