Microsoft acquired ZeniMax Media for $8.1 billion in March 2021 and operates it under the Microsoft Gaming division.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúVideo games have been the revenue titan of the entire entertainment industry for years, and the workers who develop these games are too often exploited for their passion and creativity," said Jessee Leese, a member of the bargaining committee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we all deserve. Our first contract is an invitation for video game professionals everywhere to take action. We‚Äôre the ones who make these games, and we‚Äôll be the ones to set new standards for fair treatment.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ZeniMax QA workers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-zenimax-media-sees-300-qa-workers-unionize">first unionized in January of 2023</a>, following groups at Raven Software and Blizzard Albany, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-will-recognize-raven-software-union">Microsoft made a public commitment to labor neutrality</a>. However, the road to a contract has been challenging. In November of last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-elder-scrolls-and-doom-workers-go-on-strike-in-protest-at-parent-company-microsoft">workers went on a one-day strike</a>, citing a lack of progress at the bargaining table over remote work protections and allegations that Microsoft was outsourcing QA work without bargaining with the union. Then, in April, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640423/zenimax-union-cwa-strike-authorization-vote" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workers voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike</a>, again citing concerns over remote work and low compensation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tentative contract is contingent on ratification by the union members in a vote which is expected to be concluded by June 20.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-30-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Destined Rivals is officially here, and boy, it‚Äôs already a bloodbath. From the stunning Cynthia‚Äôs Roserade to the menacing Team Rocket‚Äôs Mewtwo ex, prices on chase cards have been crashing faster than you can say ‚Äúpreorder regret.‚Äù. Let's not even start on the folks who shelled out over a grand for an ETB.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond Destined Rivals, the Pok√©mon TCG scene is a minefield. Prismatic Evolutions and Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Classic are still absurdly overpriced at big-box stores, while TCGPlayer remains the go-to for cheaper singles and sealed products. Meanwhile, the MTG Marvel‚Äôs Spider-Man and Final Fantasy sets are prepped to drain wallets, and SteelSeries gear is still on sale for anyone wanting to upgrade their gaming setup. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Need a killer Borderlands collectible? That Psycho and Claptrap Diorama from the IGN Store is calling your name. And let‚Äôs not forget about the Elebase USB-C Adapters (a must-have for your messy cable life) or the Anker USB-C Cables for fast charging. Oh, and if you‚Äôre up for some gaming on the cheap, the Xbox Game Studios Bundle on Humble is stacked with hits like Wasteland 3 and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Let‚Äôs get into it.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Launches Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you'd like to pay for sealed product in this climate to rip open boosters and find your chase card, go mad and have a blast. But if you'd like to save some money long term and guarantee that chase card, TCG Player has Destined Rivals single cards available right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">. It's insane how much this set has already crashed on release day, with some chase cards crashing beyond 50% since yesterday. Looking for the best market values on Destined Rivals sealed products instead? I've got you covered with crashing prices on sealed product. Imagine being the one person in the world who paid over $1000 for a Pok√©mon Center Elite Trainer box? Madness:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pok√©mon TCG Stock Update</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Long story short; things are looking bleak at retail for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pok√©mon TCG</a> right now. Almost everything is way above MSRP and seems to becoming the new normal for big box retailers. I could write a whole article and why this is and what should be done to stop this practice, but here we are. If you have your heart set on opening booster packs, have at it, but you might want to check out the sections below to save money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TCG Player Has The Same Products For Less</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">TCG Player and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pok√©mon TCG</a> secondary collectors market is significantly cheaper than big box retailers at the time of writing. This will likely be the case unless you can secure preorders on new sets such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-destined-rivals-expansion-unboxing#:~:text=Destined%20Rivals%20is%20the%20kind,building%20it%20around%20a%20character.">Destined Rivals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a>. Make no mistake products are still over MSRP, but If small businesses can undercut large retailers on TCG Player, there's something fundamentally broken in the supplier-distributor-retail chain.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Pok√©mon TCG Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Single <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-destined-rivals-expansion-unboxing">Pok√©mon TCG</a> market on the other hand is going through a grand reset right now, which is down to a few factors. The crypto bro mentally to reselling products is dying down a little and more product is becoming available thanks to reprints. We're not out of the woods yet by any means, but this weeks <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-19">Crashers and Climbers</a> show recent cards going down in price and cards from the X and Y era shooting up in value. We're 100% moving in the right direction.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Marvel's Spider-Man Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst there's only the Play Booster Box and Scene Bundle for MTG: Marvel's Spider-Man live on Amazon right now, TCG Player has every sealed product that will hit the market on launch day. I've even found some pricing on cases of sealed product for those looking to rip open a tonne of boosters, so get on it before the market value on these products shoot up.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Spider-Man Single Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunatley there's no listings for Spider-Man single cards right now considering we're a few months out from release, but I've managed to round up the listings for cards currently sitting on TCG Player waiting for presale allocations, so keep your eyes peeled.</p><p id="mtg-final-fantasy-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG FInal Fantasy Bundle">MTG Final Fantasy Bundle Walmart Preorder</h2></p><div catalogid="840f5339-ee1a-4f4f-9923-f0b63792a061" id="221751"><div id="221751" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MTG FInal Fantasy Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the only preorder I can find from a big box retailer this morning, and it's actually cheaper than the market value over on TCG Player right now. Imagine that? If you're planning on picking up Final Fantasy at launch, this is a no-brainer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Final Fantasy TCG Player Preorders</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">MTG: Final Fantasy</a> is set to be the biggest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-your-first-look-at-over-a-dozen-new-cards-from-magic-the-gatherings-upcoming-final-fantasy-set">Magic: The Gathering</a> set ever, which is a shock to absolutley no-one. Preorders are drying up at retail, but there's plenty of choice available on TCG Player right now. I've found all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-preorder-restock-latest-amazon">preorders</a> listed so far (including prerelease boxes) alongside massive cases on booster displays. Don't sleep on these preorders, MTG FF is going to fly off the shelves on release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Final Fantasy Single Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The single card market for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-spoiler-amano-matsuda">MTG Final Fantasy</a> is flying right now, so I've included over 40 of (in my opinion) the most popular Final Fantasy cards collectors and players will be chasing once packs start getting ripped. Don't want to spend money on boosters and hope? Secure your chase cards for release day instead.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">SteelSeries Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has a solid sale going on right now for a bunch of SteelSeries gear, and if you‚Äôve been waiting for a good excuse to upgrade your gaming setup, this is it.
