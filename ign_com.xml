In celebration, Sandfall Interactive took the stage to announce that its previously-announced DLC for the game is out...now. Right now!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We learned back in October that this update - which is free, by the way - was happening, we just didn't know when. At the time, Sandfall said it would include a new dungeon, enemies, bosses, and more, new language localizations, new costumes, and "even more surprises." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also shared the following image at the time, which seems to hint at what story the DLC might cover...and we've got a few guesses from staring daggers at it, but we'll let you speculate yourselves. Or, just go play it now.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/12/unnamed-5-1759855788093-1765512708622.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the news, Sandfall dropped a "Thank You" update trailer that seems to cover a little more of what to expect. There's a colorful new environment full of toys, balloons, and assorted bits and bobs that seems to be an Act 3 location, and comments from Verso about how "Kids have quite the imagination," suggesting that this has something to do with- okay, I don't want to spoil it. It's an Act 3 thing. If you get it, you get it. We get a look at a number of new fantastical enemies, some of which look pretty brutal, and several new costumes that seem to include Maelle in a top hat. There's also a <em>sick</em> photo mode that lets you get down to a granular level of detail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer concludes with a rather creepy-sounding clip of Esquie, and a quick glimpse of a boss fight - is that Simon, again?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the full list of what the update includes, per Sandfall's press release:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to 'Verso’s Drafts’ - a whimsical storybook adventure with ties to a young Verso. Players will encounter celebratory Gestrals, surprising new locations and an encounter with a sinister, powerful presence... </em></li><li><em>New music tracks by Lorien Testard, the award-winning composer behind the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soundtrack, which are also now available on digital streaming platforms. You can listen to the playlist on YouTube </em><a href="https://cqqox54ab.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=0013qFP4scKGjUitaJ_g-yCpM0Cbvkfq4OSXzU9l1tqSq8wxHovVAVRhIhBVug_8wvOLnlxomXSxFB4NVQwy5g3_7YbjTOl9SZRdL4LmX5NsXSb4ITbDCcis6zHJ-ZGROcRLub4YsQSxIbxZE-CxRIdHNV2iEkyMU0AgT_mNsQztsQFcWOI1-HfSxUTwtm39GlPxMrFvhXooEIRHTIjT1gx3uF7_iwZmmjb&amp;c=ogilhyBmudh7fIv6DMHh1kN7juLE7iuO5cLaTG9ZesTT9lrPqz_pAg==&amp;ch=xnl1GHI30hHcB900D0q-pewy-jXNMi87kO9pjeTU9JUDeXU0tJv4FA==" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></li><li><em>Challenging boss battles for late-game players to overcome within the Endless Tower. Besting these powerful adversaries will reward players with powerful new Pictos, costumes and gear. </em></li><li><em>A much-requested official Photo Mode, allowing players to pause the action and commemorate their favorite moments from the game’s story and battles.  </em></li><li><em>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19.  </em></li><li><em>Added FSR 4 support, including AMD temporal upscaling for sharper visuals and frame generation for smoother gameplay on compatible GPUs. </em></li><li><em>New Quality of Life improvements, other new features and further improvements to the game’s performance across platforms, including on handheld PC systems. </em>
</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Sandfall creative director Guillaume Broche said when the update was first revealed that it was a "thank you" to fans for their support, a message which he echoed onstage tonight accepting Game of the Year on behalf of the beret-clad team in the audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is fantastic, and we loved it, giving it<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review"> a 9/10 and writing</a>: "Wearing its inspirations on its sleeve, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 paints itself into the pantheon of great RPGs with a brilliant combat system and a gripping, harrowing story."

It’s unclear what other elements will return for Mega Man: Dual Override, with the footage mostly promising vibrant visuals and a promise to warp onto PC, Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox consoles in 2027.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Mega Man returns in 2027 with a brand-new entry in the classic action platforming series!" a description from Capcom says. "Override challenges and blast down legions of robots while springboarding across a new array of futuristic frontiers!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its release date as much as two years away, it shouldn't come as a surprise to hear that we know little else about Mega Man Dual Override at the moment. However, Capcom is giving die-hard fans the chance learn more about what some are already calling Mega Man 12 with the introduction of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqfLH-9Jsj0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robot Master Design Contest</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The contest, which calls on fans to submit unique robot designs, will result in six winners, including one grand prize winner whose design will be turned into an enemy for Mega Man to fight.

It's September 9, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news came alongside a brand new trailer for the game, which showed off more of the game's story and combat. We get a look at Phantom Blade's mysterious metal masked antagonist stealing a baby and doing some real flashy sword moves, followed by plenty of shots of the protagonist, seemingly a wanted man. He's got some pretty swanky moves himself, highlighting further how cool Phantom Blade's combat promises to be. There's also a young woman who gives the hero a good luck charm, then turns into a weird hollow monster or something. Lots going on here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We've seen Phantom Blade a number of times since its original announcement, both in the form of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pc-and-ps5-action-rpg-phantom-blade-zero-gets-slick-trailer-but-still-no-release-date">trailers</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phantom-blade-zero-plays-more-like-ninja-gaiden-than-dark-souls">hands-on previews</a>. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phantom-blade-zero-is-a-delightfully-punishing-action-rpg">most recent look at it this past October</a>, we found the game to be delightfully difficult, with our previewer saying, "It never felt cheap; it just demanded more from me. In just over an hour of play, I was easily ten times the player I was when I started. It’s a feeling of achievement that is reserved for the very best action games on the planet. If the rest is anything like what I played at TGS, I feel like there’s a real chance that Phantom Blade 0 might be one of those games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Phantom Blade Zero is a wuxia action RPG by Chinese studio S-Game that follows Soul, an assassin framed for a murder trying to uncover the truth of what happened. It's coming out in September for PC and PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at The Game Awards <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

And indeed, the game is set after the Empire's fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Star Wars: Galactic Racer is a runs-based, high-stakes reinvention of racing born in the lawless Outer Rim of the Star Wars galaxy," an official blurb reads. "With the Empire gone and the galaxy rebuilding, The Galactic League is formed: an underground, unsanctioned circuit where syndicates bankroll chaos and champions are forged. "No Force. No prophecy. Just skill, strategy, and the will to rise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced tonight at The Game Awards 2025, the project will be published by Secret Mode, the newly-independent publisher that previously handled Still Wakes the Deep.
