            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski has said that his scrapped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/bioshock-the-movie">BioShock film adaptation</a> would have somehow included both of the original game's endings to mess with the audience's heads. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verbinski was attached to make a movie version of the beloved game back in 2008 alongside Universal Studios, with a script in place from Gladiator and Skyfall scribe John Logan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, the project never materialized due to lengthy wrangling over its planned $200 million budget — deemed risky due to it also aiming for an adults-only R rating. Verbinski has previously said the movie came within eight weeks of shooting, before plans faltered. Work continued to try and get the film financed for several more years, though BioShock creator Ken Levine confirmed the project had been fully cancelled by 2013.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I loved this project when we were getting close to making it at Universal," Verbinski has said now, discussing the project in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1qwyvlg/hi_rmovies_im_gore_verbinski_director_of_good/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> Q&amp;A. "I was going to dive deeply into the Oedipal aspect and definitely keep it hard R with the Little Sisters, and the 'choices' the protagonist makes... and the consequences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had worked out a way with writer John Logan to have both endings and I was looking forward to bringing that to the big screen and really f***ing with people's heads," he continued. "[We] had some great designs for the Big Daddies and the entire underwater demented art-deco aesthetic. Every year I hear something about the project, but I'm not sure any studio is quite willing to go where I was headed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> has two endings, based on the player's choices to either rescue or sacrifice the game's Little Sisters — and the two very different outcomes you get based on your level of mercy. The game's 'happy' ending — seen if you rescue every Little Sister — rewards the hero with a long life and the surviving sisters present on his eventual deathbed. However, if you harvest any Little Sister, your character is shown instead having influenced Rapture's citizens to believe that power is all that matters. An ominous final cutscene then shows what looks to be a nuclear submarine being taken over in an attack.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Concept Art Offers a Glimpse at the BioShock Movie That Could’ve Been</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The two endings are pretty different, then — a long and happy life or potential nuclear apocalypse — and it's unclear exactly how Verbinski's movie would have shown both. Could one have been a dream sequence, showing what might have been the alternative outcome? Or would the movie have presented audiences with two possible futures, and left viewers unclear as to which actually played out?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The later BioShock Infinite played on the multiverse theory ("there's always a lighthouse"!) but it's worth pointing out that this was still years away at the point of Verbinski being involved. Still, it's fun to ponder how an adaptation might treat the game's two endings now. Especially as plans to adapt BioShock have since resumed — with Netflix now involved in a potential adaptation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Netflix announced plans for a fresh adaptation back in 2022, though recent years have seen the project stall again, as cuts changed the scope of the movie, necessitating changes to its script. In September 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-movie-is-definitely-based-on-the-first-game-as-script-work-continues-following-netflix-budget-cut">producer Roy Lee confirmed the project is still in active development</a>, with director Francis Lawrence on board to direct after finishing his work on the forthcoming The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a tricky adaptation, so there's lots of things to figure out and to get right," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-director-says-were-in-a-pretty-good-place-with-netflixs-tricky-movie-adaption">Lawrence told IGN previously</a>. "There's regime changes at Netflix, and so things stall out and get re-energized and stall out and get re-energized, and I think we're in a pretty good place, honestly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in the world of video games, 2K confirmed last summer that it had overhauled the similarly long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock-next">BioShock 4</a>, which has been in development for the last decade. Amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-studio-cloud-chamber-undergoes-layoffs-appoints-rod-fergusson-new-bioshock-head">layoffs and a further delay to the project's release</a>, former Gears of War head and Diablo franchise lead Rod Fergusson will now oversee the project. Fergusson will also head up the game's development studio Cloud Chamber, as it attempts to finally wrestle the project to release.

"The pacing is a bit slow because you have a big character on the screen. It also has pixel-precise gameplay, so it's not always easy, but it's interesting that the constraints of yesterday make it still feel original today. Even though it's complex, I think there's a kind of remake planned."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">NEWS: Series creator Michel Ancel reveals in a new Retro Gamer article that Rayman 1 will be receiving an HD rerelease! This follows previous reports of a "Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition" being rated. (I apologize for the new post; my prior post was incorrectly worded) <a href="https://t.co/jzKlTg6on3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/jzKlTg6on3</a></p>— Rayman Merchandise (@raymanmerch) <a href="https://twitter.com/raymanmerch/status/2020239543279178007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 7, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't remember when specifically, but it will be in HD and I think Ubisoft is adding a few more checkpoints and things like that just to make it a bit less frustrating. I think it's a nice move, because that's the only point that could be a problem for non-skilled players. But yeah, I think it's still a very nice game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an extraordinary insight given the project hasn't officially been confirmed by Ubisoft yet, but it does make sense, as we were told late last year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-its-working-on-the-future-of-rayman-but-dont-expect-news-from-us-too-soon">Ubisoft is set to celebrate all things Rayman as it prepares to mark the series' 30th anniversary</a>, including information about the "future" of the series. At the time, the <a href="https://x.com/RaymanGame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Rayman X/Twitter account</u></a> had long been dormant, but last September, however, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-its-working-on-the-future-of-rayman-but-dont-expect-news-from-us-too-soon"><u>it was resurrected to bring us up to speed on what's happening in Rayman's world</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rayman turns 30! Join us on our official channels to celebrate an incredible legacy," the account exclaimed at the time, attaching a brief video. In the video, brand producer Loic Gounon — who has been working on the Rayman franchise since 2006 — revealed that "a very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working together on the future of Rayman."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in October 2024, Ubisoft confirmed a new Rayman project was currently in the "exploration phase" at its Montpelier and Milan studios, after it was reported that Ancel had been contacted to act as a consultant.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft began this year by announcing a sizable company restructure, resulting in the cancelation of six games, including its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake"><u>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake</u></a>, and a delay to a further seven titles. Two Ubisoft studios will close completely as a result of the changes, while others are subject to further layoffs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the half-dozen games that have been fully scrapped, Ubisoft only publicly named one: its long-awaited Sands of Time remake that had been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-remake-ubisoft-montreal"><u>rebooted once already</u></a>. Three of the other canceled games were new IPs, while one was a mobile game. We've received no specific details of the seven titles that Ubisoft has delayed, either, though this number does include the unannounced game once set for launch before March 31 that is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake"><u>widely expected to be the company's Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remaster</u></a>. This will now launch in the coming financial year — so before March 31, 2027. With Ubisoft's core focus going forward being open-world and live-service games, it's not clear how — if at all — a Rayman remake fits into those plans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-nft-game-captain-laserhawk-rayman"><u>Ubisoft quietly released an NFT game featuring Rayman at the end of 2024</u></a>, of course. Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E. was barely advertised or given the kind of showy spotlight reserved for major releases, quite possibly because it's a Web 3 game that uses cryptocurrency and blockchain. A top-down multiplayer shooter available on PC, it featured a number of Ubisoft characters, including Rayman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
