The patch notes, per <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/silksong-patch-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Cherry’s website</a>, are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All fixes will apply retroactively, Team Cherry added, so players who've hit a significant bug that prevents progress should now be able to proceed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Further fixes are currently being worked on for a third patch, the developer continued, with some additional focus around improving controller support on PC platforms. “Expect this one to come a little later, as we’re aiming to cover as many remaining issues as possible,” Team Cherry said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Team Cherry said for upcoming patches, beyond regular fixes, “our first priority remains to improve Silksong’s Simplified Chinese translation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is in response to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/chinese-players-use-steam-reviews-to-complain-about-hollow-knight-silksong-translation-team-cherry-promises-improvements">high-profile criticism of Silksong’s Simplified Chinese translation</a>, which had led to Chinese players leaving negative Steam reviews.

"This isn’t about effort, but about taste and direction, and speaking from experience likely can’t be fixed without replacing the translator."

"I’m talking about word salad type of situation. On top of the anachronistic pretentiousness, it’s downright gibberish at times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A new script, by a well-regarded team, is already well underway,” Team Cherry confirmed. “We’re expecting this new translation to be delivered in 3-4 weeks, with implementation to follow immediately after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the meantime, for Simplified Chinese players, we’ve recently been informed that a talented group of Hollow Knight fans has already produced their own full-translation mod for Silksong!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> came out, developer Gearbox has released a PC-focused patch that tackles crashes, among a few other things. But players are wondering what the studio intends to do about the looter shooter’s balance, especially at a time when builds that let you one-shot bosses are doing the rounds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has now indicated that in the short-term, it plans to buff underperforming gear and skills rather than nerf overpowered builds. Indeed, those instakill builds you've seen online are safe, for now. But, Gearbox insisted, they will get nerfed eventually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confirmation comes from Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins, who <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1970315557460398462" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to acknowledge the debate about what he called “builds that use unintended interactions and/or the knife.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement:</p><blockquote>“We’ve seen the discourse about builds that use unintended interactions and/or the knife. We’re not going to act on those immediately, instead, we’re looking at our first round of buffs. Those will get addressed but we’re going to start with underperforming gear/skills first.”</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s all this talk about a knife? As IGN has reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/abuse-it-while-you-can-borderlands-4-has-an-infinite-damage-build-so-broken-it-kills-bosses-in-seconds">Borderlands 4 players have discovered an infinite damage build so broken it kills bosses in seconds — even on the hardest difficulty levels</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To make this build work you need the Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife with the Penetrator Augment. Land a hit with this knife and subsequent damage to the target are automatic critical hits for five seconds. Add bleed stacking and each tick of the bleed effect registers as a critical hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have come up with eye-catching builds around the knife that essentially makes a Borderlands 4 boss fight a trivial experience, and thus farming for the game’s best loot a lot easier. For example, <a href="https://maxroll.gg/borderlands-4/build-guides/vex-leveling-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vex</u></a>’s Bloodletter passive makes your gun and skill critical hits have a chance to apply bleed, which counts as gun damage and is based on the initial damage dealt. Add Vex's Contamination passive, which causes critical hits to increase status effect application chance up to 100% and thus ensuring the bleed re-procs infinitely, and you’ve got exponential damage. So, throw the knife, land one big shot on the boss, and watch the numbers get bigger and bigger as the bleed ticks it down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news that Gearbox is focusing on buffs over nerfs right now is being celebrated by the community. <a href="https://x.com/MoxsyOG/status/1970370340640498072" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borderlands 4 content creator Moxsy</a> called it “such a huge W.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Massive nerfs hitting Wonderlands &amp; BL3 on launch caused huge outrage and frustration in the community. Love to see this direction,” Moxsy said in a post on social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is what steps Gearbox will take to nerf the knife. Will it change how it works completely, or apply slight changes to tone it down?</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no timeframe for Borderlands 4’s next patch, but we know some more of what the studio is working on. PC performance improvements are a “top priority,” the studio has said. A Field of View (FOV) slider is on the way to the console versions, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 console players are also keen for a patch to address <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-tech-experts-say-resetting-the-game-every-hour-should-really-not-be-an-expected-solution-for-players-patch-cannot-come-soon-enough"><u>some glaring technical problems</u></a>. Last week, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> confirmed a gradual worsening of framerate with continuous playtime, even on PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X. As revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/kRWW6qwjFBA?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a new video published to YouTube</u></a>, Digital Foundry found performance starts dipping after around 30 minutes to an hour, which it called "too intrusive on the overall experience, too regular an interruption." Even after a completely fresh boot, the game is still prone to framerate drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford has acknowledged the problem on social media, promising incoming improvements. As a workaround, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-performance-gets-worse-the-longer-you-play-on-console-randy-pitchford-suggests-quitting-the-game-and-restarting-as-a-workaround"><u>Pitchford suggested console players quit Borderlands 4 and restart</u></a>. Digital Foundry’s Tom Morgan confirmed this does restore performance, but criticized the situation, saying “resetting the game every hour should really not be an expected solution for players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-cricket-jumping-lets-players-skip-huge-chunks-of-the-map-gearbox-dev-says-ive-got-my-eye-on-this">Timmins has said he’s got his eye on “cricket jumping,”</a> which lets Borderlands 4 players leap across huge chunks of the map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This one sounds far in the future.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hideo Kojima has discussed his upcoming PlayStation exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Physint</a> during a Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary event in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on-stage during the event, Kojima said development on Physint was just starting. Indeed, the legendary developer is working on the concepts by himself right now, making characters and thinking about casting. “It is just the start,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a video message of support from Herman Hulst, CEO, Studio Business Group, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Kojima described Physint as the next stage tactical espionage action game. Kojima is of course famous for creating the Metal Gear franchise while at Konami.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The tech underpinning Physint is even more advanced than that powering Kojima’s Death Stranding games and upcoming Xbox Game Studios exclusive OD (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-reveals-first-trailer-for-xbox-game-studios-title-od">whose debut trailer was revealed at the show</a>), he said, because it’s due out later in the future. No release date or even release window was mentioned, but from what Kojima said, it’s OD next for Kojima Productions, then Physint, so it may be some time before we see anything meaningful on the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima did tease the main character of the game via the first poster for Physint, below. It doesn’t tell us much, as it’s hard to make out even their face. We don’t know who’s playing the main character, either (expect a casting announcement at some point in the future, Kojima said). We do have the tagline "here comes the feeling," although who knows what that means at this stage?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/physint-main-1758606021690.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The debut poster for Physint. Image credit: Kojima Productions.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima did confirm three actors set to appear in Physint, however, each of whom delivered a video message expressing their excitement. Charlee Fraser, who played Mary Jabassa in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga">Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</a>, is in the game, although we don’t know which character she’s playing. Also in the game are Don Lee, who played Gilgamesh in the Marvel movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/eternals">Eternals</a>, and Japanese actress Minami Hamabe, who played Noriko Ōishi in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/godzilla-minus-one">Godzilla Minus One</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima ended his Physint segment with a shot of Hamabe in CG form, showing off just how realistic the visuals are expected to be. We still don't know which game engine Kojima Productions is using for Physint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In May, Kojima said Physint was still "another five or six years" away from release, suggesting a launch in 2030 at the earliest, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-hideo-kojimas-return-to-action-espionage-be-one-of-the-first-ps6-games">potentially on PlayStation 6</a>. Kojima told Le Film Francais that his aspirations to direct a movie were on hold at least until he had finished developing his first action espionage game since he <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/why-hideo-kojima-left-konami#:~:text=Konami's%20change%20in%20focus%20from,Solid%20V%3A%20The%20Phantom%20Pain."><u>very publicly parted ways with Konami in 2015</u></a>.

It's called Death Stranding: Mosquito and, per Kojima and animation director Hiroshi Miyamoto's own words, it follows the story of a guy who sucks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We got a look at a snippet of animation from Mosquito, showing a man with something stuck to his face that has a weird tentacle thing coming out of it. He's in the water at the beginning of the clip, swimming and approaching something human-shaped that's difficult to make out. But in the second part of the clip, he's on land, in the Timefall, fighting a guy in a porter suit, still with the gooey thing on his face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's it! Who is this guy, and what does all this mean? No idea! We do find out from a follow-up conversation with Kojima and Miyamoto that the word "Mosquito" refers to the main character, who can suck...something. Not blood! Just something. We'll find out later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also revealed that Mosquito is being animated with hand-drawn lines that are then digitally used to assemble the animation itself. And Studio Easter, which worked on Dandadan, is doing the film's backgrounds. Additionally, Aaron Guzikowksi (Prisoners, Raised by Wolves) will write the scenario script.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the only Death Stranding film we're getting. We also got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-movie-will-tell-a-story-you-havent-seen-in-that-world-director-confirms">new information today</a> about the upcoming A24 Death Stranding movie.
