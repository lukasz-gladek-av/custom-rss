However, the majority of those players were on console — via PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass subscription — even though PC was "planned as the primary consumer sales channel."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game’s initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews," the financial statement said. "As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of FBC: Firebreak. Thus far, FBC: Firebreak’s commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognized throughout the contract period."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Remedy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-to-make-big-changes-in-fbc-firebreak-after-seeing-many-players-come-into-the-game-and-leave-within-the-first-hour"><u>promised big changes last month</u></a>. The pledge came after Remedy posted a candid statement <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-admits-not-everything-has-gone-well-for-fbc-firebreak-pledges-to-improve-multiplayer-shooter-as-it-launches-to-mixed-steam-rating"><u>shortly after Firebreak's launch,</u></a> acknowledging "not everything had gone well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio did, however, note that FBC: Firebreak was designed to evolves over time, and believes it's a solid game "despite the rocky launch." A larger "Major Update" scheduled for late September will be the next key step for FBC: Firebreak, which Remedy "expects to drive interest in the title." It said it remains "committed to continuing to work on FBC: Firebreak, engaging with the community, and expanding the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its financial results for the first half of 2025 and the second quarter, Remedy reported a revenue boost during both periods, following increases in game sales and royalties. The quarter once again operated at a loss — although at $580,000, this was not as sharp as last year's $3.7 million loss — and across the first six months of the year, revenue was up 43.4% to $35.1 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for other games? The studio confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-2">Control 2'</a>s development is "on track" and meeting milestones as the focus is now on "gameplay, environments, and missions." The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/max-payne-1-2">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2</a> remake project remains in full production as "collaboration with Rockstar Games remains close and productive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"FBC: Firebreak is a compelling co-op shooter that, despite its good looks, doesn’t have the depth to keep things interesting long-term," we wrote in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-review"><u>IGN's FBC: Firebreak review</u></a>, awarding it 6/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
