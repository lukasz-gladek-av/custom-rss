Is the discount indicative of Wizards of the Coast’s expectations for the set?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, the price dropped to $159.99, bringing the Universes Beyond box of Play Boosters to around the standard price of a Universes Within box, but this now drops even further to $148.20 - the lowest we’ve seen at Amazon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With 30 packs, that’s less than five bucks per one ($4.94, to be precise), which is a couple of bucks off what you’d usually pay when buying them individually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We saw similar drops for Spider-Man, which would be a little worrisome if Avatar hadn’t got the same treatment - and that set was great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Magic: The Gathering, check out the wild ride that is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-updated-2026"><u>the game’s 2026 set lineup</u></a>, as well as our guide to preordering the first set of the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-where-to-buy-2026"><u>Lorwyn Eclipsed</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Attention Everyone</strong>: Animal Crossing: New Horizons has a jump button now!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also walk backwards, and sideways!!!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why am I freaking out over this? Look. This is almost as exciting as when we all learned New Horizons would give us the ability to sit down on the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes as a part of Animal Crossing: New Horizon's 3.0 update, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-big-30-update-just-dropped-a-day-early">which dropped a day early today</a>, giving access to a new Hotel area, loads of new decorative items, some quality of life features like bulk crafting, and Dream Islands you can build alongside friends. But as players have discovered since, it's also added a subtle new feature to aid in construction and placement: essentially, a controlled way to step in the cardinal directions in very precise ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This feature is now tutorialed as part of obtaining the Construction App, though it's possible it may be available prior to that, and it's very easy to activate. You can use it any time by pressing the L button. Pressing it once will snap your character into place with a tiny little hop. Holding it down and moving the stick in a direction will let you take exactly one step in that direction, effectively the size of one "square" of space. This is ideal for activities such as precise furniture placement, or lining yourself up perfectly to hit rocks or even catch bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, sure, it's not actually a huge deal - just a fun quality of life feature. It's not like a REAL jump (and you can already jump small gaps automatically anyway). But Animal Crossing's audience has historically gotten very excited about little touches like this, such as the wave of excitement when sitting on the ground was confirmed to be in the game, or the love for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/77-amazing-little-details-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons">any number of other tiny details</a> players have found over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, if they ever add jump attacks it's over for you people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other small details in the new update worth celebrating, such as the ability to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qcmzyq/you_can_have_new_custom_design_on_slumber_islands/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">save individual custom designs to Slumber Islands</a> (effectively giving you even more slots), and the fact that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qcuyk8/former_villagers_remember_us/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former Islanders visiting the Hotel will remember you</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got a comprehensive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/ACNH_3.0_Update_and_Switch_2_Edition:_All_Details_and_Everything_New">guide to the 3.0 update</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/Kappns_Family_Hotel_-_How_to_Unlock_and_Guide">how to unlock everything</a> and what's included, as a part of our Animal Crossing: New Horizons Wiki guide. If you're just getting back to New Horizons today after a long hiatus, we also have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/animal-crossing-new-horizons-essential-tips-for-returning-to-your-island">number of tips</a> for people getting back into the swing of things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
