            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Treyarch has confirmed some Black Ops 6 skins <em>will</em> carry forward to Black Ops 7 after all, as the Call of Duty community debates the rights and wrongs of Activision‚Äôs decision to prevent players from bringing over their cosmetics to the upcoming game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty‚Äôs foray into goofy skins territory is well-documented, although recent releases have certainly amped up the conversation around them. With the likes of Beavis and Butt-Head and American Dad hitting the game this year shortly after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-ongoing-420-obsession-sparks-debate-among-fans-some-have-had-enough-others-really-want-that-seth-rogen-skin"><u>weed-obsessed bundles starring Seth Rogen</u></a>, some fans have said they‚Äôve had enough of what they call the 'Fortnite-ification' of their beloved Call of Duty, and pleaded with publisher Activision to return to its mil-sim roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, last month, Activision shocked the Call of Duty community when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-battlefield-6s-commitment-to-gritty-realism-activision-makes-shock-call-of-duty-change-for-black-ops-7-we-hear-the-feedback">it confirmed that Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 would no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This came as a big surprise to players who had expected content they‚Äôd bought for Black Ops 6 to carry forward, as it has done with previous entries, and given Black Ops 7 directly follows last year‚Äôs Black Ops 6. Explaining the decision, Activision said Black Ops 7 ‚Äúneeds to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúThat is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7," the publisher continued. "Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward, because we recognize your time and progression are important.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(This change applies only to Black Ops 7. Call of Duty: Warzone is not affected, and all your Black Ops 6 content stays usable there.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone's Bloke Biter Shark Skin Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It means that at launch, at least, you won‚Äôt see all those goofy skins running around Multiplayer. It sounds like Multiplayer will look like Black Ops 7, at least at the start of things. Activision went on to say that Black Ops 7 bundles and items ‚Äúwill be crafted to fit the Black Ops identity.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe hear the feedback,‚Äù Activision added. ‚ÄúWe need to deliver a better balance toward the immersive, core Call of Duty experience.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Initial reaction was a mix of shock that Activision actually canceled carry forward for Black Ops 7, excitement about getting back to Call of Duty‚Äôs roots, but for some a frustration that the time and in many cases money spent earning cosmetic items in recent months dies with Black Ops 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Treyarch has confirmed that some skins, mostly focused on the Zombies portion of Black Ops 6 will indeed carry forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a social media post, Treyarch said any of the four main quest Operator Skin rewards earned in Black Ops 6 will be available in Black Ops 7 at launch, as well as the New Orders Prestige Level 1000 Operator Skin reward, which will be available for Samuels on day one.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Heads up, Zombies players: any of the 4 Main Quest Operator Skin rewards earned in Black Ops 6 will be available in Black Ops 7 at launch!</p><p>And for the truly dedicated, the "New Orders" Prestige Level 1000 Operator Skin reward will also be available for Samuels on day one. ü§ù <a href="https://t.co/sJMXkR2SXX" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/sJMXkR2SXX</a></p></div>‚Äî Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1965567095145684994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Guild Override camo is joining the Zombies main quest Reward and New Orders Operator skins, and will be available at the launch of Black Ops 7 for those who digitally pre-order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, a slight U-turn on the U-turn then, one that Zombies fans are already calling a win. But, interestingly, some portions of the Call of Duty community want Activision to go one step further and let them carry forward all their skins. And some players are now hitting out at Activision letting complaints around cartoon skins like American Dad affect affect the entire playerbase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúOk but why exclude every BO6 skin just because of a few cartoon skins that people complained about?‚Äù said one disgruntled player on social media. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt let the cartoon skins transfer, but everything else that isn‚Äôt over the top goofy should carry over to BO7.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI dont know how I feel about this,‚Äù commented redditor Courtneyvictory, ‚ÄúSeems like Treyarch can't make up their mind, or maybe different people are fighting against each other about their game's direction internally.‚Äù</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Could we possibly have these skins carry forward?? <a href="https://t.co/L0UI7172PM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/L0UI7172PM</a></p>‚Äî Tox (@tox83958246) <a href="https://twitter.com/tox83958246/status/1965584725160165516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you!</p><p>Now, about carry forward in general...</p></div>‚Äî GuiGZ1 (@Guiiiiigui_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Guiiiiigui_/status/1965568659889553432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Wait I thought you all weren‚Äôt gonna carry things forward? Way to listen to feedback.</p>‚Äî ‚ô†Ô∏èAudsauce‚ô†Ô∏è (@Audjuice9989) <a href="https://twitter.com/Audjuice9989/status/1965572561481465990?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The row over carry forward has escalated in the weeks since Activision made its announcement, suggesting the decision wasn‚Äôt the nailed-on crowd-pleaser it looked like it might have been. It‚Äôs worth noting that this isn‚Äôt only about premium skins, either. Call of Duty players put in a huge amount of effort working their way through battle passes and completing challenges in order to unlock certain in-game skins, and with Black Ops 6 they did so with the expectation they‚Äôd be able to use them in Black Ops 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Activision felt the heat from EA‚Äôs Battlefield 6, which is going for a more grounded aesthetic. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-call-of-dutys-obsession-with-goofy-skins-firmly-entrenched-battlefield-6-dev-commits-to-gritty-realism-i-dont-think-it-needs-nicki-minaj"><u>Developer DICE has indicated it has no plans to release crossover skins that would break the aesthetic Battlefield 6 is going for</u></a>, and promised the developers were listening to fan feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DBLTAP</u></a>, Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil doubled down on EA's commitment to grounded realism, and even pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-call-of-duty-season-5-snoop-dogg"><u>Call of Duty's infamous Nicki Minaj skin</u></a> as something Battlefield 6 doesn't need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúIt has to be grounded," he said. "That is what BF3 and BF4 was ‚Äî it was all soldiers, on the ground. It‚Äôs going to be like this,‚Äù Uchil said, pointing at the key art featuring soldiers in soldier gear looking out over a wartorn New York City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it needs Nicki Minaj.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> boss Randy Pitchford has suggested that the game's pre-order bundle, which contains a free <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> skin, could become a worthwhile investment ‚Äî after a previous Borderlands skin fetched "over $2k when trading on eBay."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Writing on social media, Pitchford highlighted the looter shooter's Epic Games Store pre-order offer, which unlocks the Mad Moxxi skin in Fortnite. But players have been quick to point out that "trading" is against Fortnite's Terms of Service, and liable to result in a ban.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Is it true that the pre-order incentive Psycho Bandit skin in became one of the most valuable skins in Fortnite sometimes fetching over $2k when trading on eBay?" Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1964487591253966880" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. "What are the odds this bundle becomes worth much more than the price of the game it is promoting?"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, it's worth breaking down exactly what Pitchford is referring to here. The Psycho Bandit skin he mentions was originally released in 2019, as part of a similar Epic Game Store promotion with Borderlands 3. It was also briefly available via Fortnite's item shop ‚Äî before disappearing from sale for a lengthy period. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's during this time that the skin did become something of a coveted item among Fortnite players, though its perceived value dropped significantly when it returned returned on sale in April 2025, becoming widely-available once again after a gap of five years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite skins deemed rare or unlikely to be sold again often attract player interest, though Fortnite itself of course does not offer any ability to sell or trade in-game items with other players. Instead, some players simply buy or sell accounts with rare items included ‚Äî something which Epic Games is <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_EpicAccount/c-AccountSecurity/can-i-buy-sell-or-share-an-epic-games-account-a000090985" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clear</a> is against the company's Terms of Service, and risks a lengthy (or permanent) ban. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of which is worth bearing in mind when considering whether buying Borderlands 4 just for its attached Fortnite skin is really the best pitch for a money-making scheme. But hey, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-standard-edition-price-set-at-70-after-all">at least the game isn't $80</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 launches this Friday, September 12, for PC via Steam and the Epic Game Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A Nintendo Switch 2 version will then follow on October 3. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
