Photo mode has also been updated to include additional features and quality-of-life changes, alongside regular big fixes too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-working-on-single-player-batman-game-monolith-productions-wonder-woman-in-trouble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new report has shed light on the turmoil at Warner Bros. Games, while providing an update on the various projects in the works at its developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported</a> on concern about the upcoming slate of games from Warner Bros. Games following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-is-leaving-the-company-a-year-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disastrous-launch">the exit of chief David Haddad</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company has had a troubled 12 months, first with the catastrophic release of Rocksteady’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</u></a>, then the disappointing release of Smash Bros.-style brawler <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/multiversus"><u>MultiVersus</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Discovery has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure contributed to a $200 million hit to its business</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business"><u>MultiVersus added another $100 million on top</u></a>. Warner Bros. Games' only other recent release was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions"><u>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</u></a>, which failed to make an impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav said: "We recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-officially-ends-after-final-update-offline-mode-and-true-ending">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League post-launch content has come to an end</a> with the delivery of its year one roadmap, and Warner Bros. has announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-dev-calls-out-threats-to-harm-following-shutdown-announcement-i-am-in-deep-mourning-for-the-game">the impending closure of MultiVersus</a>. Rocksteady, meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-lays-off-staff-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop">has suffered significant layoffs</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also question marks over Mortal Kombat 1’s financial performance, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-chief-ed-boon-teases-t-1000-fatality-and-future-dlc"><u>NetherRealm chief Ed Boon recently announced over five million sales and teased future DLC following the release of the T-1000 Terminator guest character</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Zaslav said Warner Bros. was doubling down on just four games: Hogwarts Legacy (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines"><u>a sequel is already in the works</u></a>), Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, "in particular Batman."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio," Zaslav added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it may be some time before fans see the result of this work. Bloomberg said Monolith Productions’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wonder-woman-the-game">Wonder Woman game</a> is in trouble after reportedly rebooting and switching directors early last year. It’s already cost more than $100 million and is still years away from release, Bloomberg added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monolith’s reimagined Nemesis system (it developed the much-loved Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel) that would see Wonder Woman befriending enemies has been ditched in favor of a more traditional action adventure game. Its fate “remains in question.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal, meanwhile, pitched a John Constantine game but it was never approved. A Flash game was scrapped after the DCU Flash film bombed. It’s now helping out with other games and is reportedly working on a pitch for a new Game of Thrones game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hogwarts Legacy developer Avalanche is, as officially announced, working on new content for Hogwarts Legacy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-video-game-sequel-hogwarts-legacy-2-one-of-the-biggest-priorities-at-warner-bros">as well as a sequel</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Rocksteady will be excited to hear the studio “is looking to return to Batman for a single-player game,” but according to Bloomberg, it’s years away. There is no word in Bloomberg’s report on what’s next from NetherRealm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of this is Warner Bros. Games has, according to Bloomberg, a refreshed version of Hogwarts Legacy, a Lego game, and a few mobile games in the works for the next two years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
