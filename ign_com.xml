            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-19<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG market</a> is moving, and not quietly. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-where-to-buy">Black Bolt and White Flare</a> coming in hot, many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-9">Black and White</a>-era cards are suddenly on every collector’s radar again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're seeing massive jumps on cards that have sat stable for years, all because Gen V is back in style. If you're looking to trade, cash in, or just gawk at how weird card prices can get, I’ve got you covered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are five cards that are flying and five that are faceplanting. Some of these are smart buys. Others? Let’s say I wouldn’t want to be the one who paid full price three weeks ago.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/18/pixel-9-2025-05-18t121910-653-1747567332953.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1XAY?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon ex from Prismatic Evolutions</a> dropped 21% since mid-April, from $467.85 to $369.96. Still expensive, sure, but that's a big chunk of change to evaporate in just a few weeks. If you bought high, I’m sorry. If not, maybe give it a few more dips before you pounce.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJw3Y?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee ex</a>, also from Prismatic. Down 28%, now sitting at $172 after peaking above $240. Honestly, I think Eeveelution fatigue is real. There are just so many of them floating around that even good cards are struggling to keep their value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3O8W?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie’s Clefairy ex from Journey Together</a> has slid 26% this month, from $212 to $158. I still like this card a lot, but the dip is noticeable. Early adopters probably paid more than they should have, and now the market's correcting like it just remembered what money is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg5oM?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Salamence ex</a> is rough. It's down a staggering 63% since late March, from $242 to $90.50. That’s not a correction, that’s a full-on crash landing. I wouldn’t be shocked if it dips further. Might be worth watching, but I wouldn’t touch it yet unless you’re in it for the art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, we’ve got <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgM8w?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iron Crown ex from Prismatic</a>, down 19% just this month. It was sitting around $84 and is now at $67.75. That’s not terrible, but it’s still part of a clear trend. The set had a big debut and now the shine is fading fast.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/18/pixel-9-2025-05-18t122002-296-1747567351556.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll start with <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4wAW?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Reshiram from Black &amp; White</a>, which has absolutely rocketed. It was sitting at a modest $33.92 in mid-March, and now you’re lucky to find one under $240. That’s a 150% leap for a card that’s over a decade old. I’ve seen faster elevators, but not many. With all 156 Unova Pokémon getting fresh prints soon, I think Reshiram’s still got room to climb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwLO3?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom EX from Next Destinies</a>, which has gone from $34.63 to nearly $392 since March. It’s another reminder that Full Art cards from the EX era aren’t just collectible, they’re volatile. In a good way, if you got in early. I’d still grab this if it fits your binder, because it's only going to get more attention once White Flare drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also watching <a href="https://zdcs.link/akKvjX?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sprigatito from Paldea Evolved</a>. The IR version has quietly crept up from $17.98 in January to $21.95 today. It’s not a moonshot, but compared to the general slump of modern IRs, it’s doing surprisingly well. Plus, it’s a smug little cat and people love smug cats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbdJe?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dialga-GX from Forbidden Light</a>. This one was hanging out around $14 just two months ago, and it’s shot up to $74.99. I wouldn’t call it graceful, but it’s definitely gaining traction. GX-era cards are getting more attention lately, and Dialga's age plus playable nostalgia make it a solid hold in my opinion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t laugh, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJgO1?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vileplume-GX from Cosmic Eclipse</a> is up too. It was stuck at $6.83 for what felt like forever, and now it’s over $10. It’s not exactly a gold rush, but it’s one of those oddball rares that sneaks up when no one’s looking. You’ll thank yourself later if you pull it out of a bulk box and it suddenly pays for lunch.</p><p id="sealed-boosters"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Boosters">Pokémon Card Sealed Boosters</h2></p><div catalogid="0fe4ac08-2aeb-4f0f-834e-a41eccfc1ee1" id="221171"><div id="221171" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>151 Booster Pack</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Dropped by 8% since beginning of May</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unless you're dead set on grabbing the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAwMx?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">promo cards and poster in the 151 poster bundle</a>, grabbing booster packs from TCG Player is where it's at (<a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJwZV?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Or just the poster and promos seperately</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently sitting at $10.33 a pack, it's obvious that Amazon is now going above MSRP and secondary market value. If you're not bothered about opening packs and just want 151 chase cards, here's some of my favorites as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've dedicated your life to pulling chase cards yourself, here's what we can find in stock right now. Just watch out for pricing over MSRP, we're in a weird spot as Pokémon trainers right now, so don't pay more than what you have to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're desperate for some big box retailer products, here you go. Just make sure to be savvy before buying, as <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdblo5?object_uuid=e236db29-6ff6-4186-9737-edaf1d15bd5c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">9 times out of 10 TCG Player will be cheaper</a> in this climate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Pokémon TCG full Release Schedule</a> so far for this year, too, so you don't miss anything.
