            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda’s former Elder Scrolls loremaster has revealed his idea for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> story, and how it would have set up The Elder Scrolls 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> discussing his dissatisfaction with working at Bethesda and subsequent departure from the company following the release of Starfield, Kurt Kuhlmann said if he had got the chance to lead The Elder Scrolls 6 it would have been like the beloved Star Wars movie The Empire Strikes Back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kuhlmann, who left Bethesda in 2023 after more than 20 years at the studio, said that in his story the elven supremacists the Thalmor would not only have been the big bad of The Elder Scrolls 6, but they would have ended the game on the road to victory. This, he said, would have turned Elder Scrolls’ long-running ‘player is the chosen one’ who achieves a definitive victory at the end of the game plot on its head, saying that while you would have “preserved hope for the future” by the end of The Elder Scrolls 6, “overall it looks like the Thalmor are on the march.”</p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem, Kuhlmann said, is that he doubts Bethesda would go for an Elder Scrolls game with a “bad” ending such as this, and a cliffhanger is "completely unfeasible" because it takes so long for Bethesda to release new mainline games in the fantasy series. "That's not a good way to end a game and say, yeah, we'll see you in 10, 15 years,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, Kuhlmann’s idea is just that: an idea, and it’s unlikely that the actual storyline of The Elder Scrolls 6 will turn out to be anything like it. As for when we’ll find out, it could be some time yet. Last year, amid increasing pressure from fans for some information on the game, Howard said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 wouldn’t be out for some time</u></a>. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GQ magazine</u></a> to celebrate the release of Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, Howard said The Elder Scrolls 6 is “still a long way off,” adding: “I’m preaching patience. I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, speaking to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game Informer</u></a>, studio design director Emil Pagliarulo pointed to GTA 6’s high-profile delays as the “smartest thing they could do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What do fans really want?” he asked. “Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn’t meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know? That’s what I think people are going to want. So, we’re going to take our time and as long as it needs to be great.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, former veteran Bethesda developer Nate Purkeypile said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-sure-there-will-be-more-death-threats-again-former-bethesda-dev-wonders-how-the-elder-scrolls-6-will-meet-expectations-after-top-10-game-of-all-time-skyrim">Bethesda may get “hateful comments” even if <u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u> ends up just being as good as Skyrim</a>, which he considers to be one of the top 10 games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement became as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced</u></a>. Skyrim was released on November 11, 2011, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-elder-scrolls-vi-announced-at-bethesda-press-conference"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 was revealed on June 10, 2018</u></a> — 2,403 days afterwards. It is now seven-and-a-half years since the announcement, and we’re no closer, it seems, to the release of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the six-year anniversary of The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement arrived in June 2024, even Bethesda chief Todd <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>Howard paused to say, "oh wow, that has been a while."</u></a> The Elder Scrolls 6 is at least in production, with Bethesda confirming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-officially-in-early-development-but-dont-expect-to-hear-about-it-soon"><u>it had entered "early development" in August 2023</u></a> and "early builds" were available in March 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purkeypile said he assumed Bethesda announced The Elder Scrolls 6 so early because the studio was announcing Starfield at a time when it had already been so long since Skyrim came out, so “we needed to make sure people were not just pissed at us.” He continued: “it’s a very expensive way to do that, though. Those trailers are not cheap.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a few quiet months, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game"><u>Magic: The Gathering</u></a> is bringing back Commander Decks with Lorwyn Eclipsed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first set of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-2026"><u>packed 2026 schedule</u></a>, we’re getting the first precons for the EDH format since Edge of Eternities (which, to their credit, were great).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Wizards of the Coast revealing the full decklists for both, should you pick one up? Or both? Or skip them entirely in favor of the five-color <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-set-is-coming-soon">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> one arriving in March? Let’s dig in.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dance of the Elements</h2><div id="228490"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="228490" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lorwyn Eclipsed - Commander Deck</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t tend to get a great number of five-color decks, but as I’ve just mentioned, we’re <a href="https://zdcs.link/zn5bgx?object_uuid=c8ae574d-516c-4b95-83a5-b472607b2d84&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>getting one in consecutive sets</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite that, our Commander, Ashling, the Limitless, is a red card that makes it easier to bring an Elemental into play, albeit to be sacrificed if you don’t cough up the required mana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a gameplay perspective, I can see it being fun, particularly with Mass of Mysteries giving your Elementals the Myriad keyword, but the reprint value is pretty solid, too - with some caveats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Omnath, Locus of the Roil is currently going for $12 or so, while Endurance isn’t far behind. The big draw is likely to be Cream of the Crop, which, to my knowledge, hasn’t been reprinted in a long, long time (maybe ever).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s going for a decent chunk of change (around $24 and upwards), but therein lies the rub - as soon as these decks hit shelves, that price will plummet. So while you’re getting some value, it’ll be gone as quickly as you can say Timeless Lotus - another card which will likely see the same result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect the deck to offer around $130 in value, but that’ll drop to around $100 within a fortnight it seems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say it won’t be fun to play, but as an investment, I’d only recommend buying it if you need specific cards or just want to play with it (imagine that!).</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blight Curse</h2></div><div id="228491"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="228491" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lorwyn Eclipsed - Commander Deck</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From a rainbow of colors to the dreariness of -1/-1 counters, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yGZOw?object_uuid=c8ae574d-516c-4b95-83a5-b472607b2d84&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Blight Curse</u></a> is a little bit spooky in truth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Auntie Ool is all about Blighting creatures to trigger opponents to lose life or to give you card advantage, but the backup commander, The Reaper, King No More is a 3/3 scarecrow that turns your opponents’ cards into yours if you kill them with -1/-1 counters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, I’d be leaning into the sheer chaos of The Reaper, but one of the biggest draws here is the Necroskitter. It essentially mimics The Reaper’s ability, bringing creatures to your side of the board, and is worth around $30. Will that drop? Yes, for sure, from the moment this deck hits shelves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other decent reprints here include Tree of Perdition, Chimil, the Inner Sun, and Midnight Banshee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, the reprint value is likely to be around $130 again, but you’re losing a chunk of that with Necroskitter. And yet, I still think this is the better deck of the two.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Which One Should You Pick?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">First up, a caveat: I’ve put links on this page to pick these up, because, well, that’s my job, but if you give it a few weeks, I reckon the pricing will settle down as more decks are printed. You shouldn’t be paying too much over the odds for these decks. Keep an eye on TCGplayer as well, as the market price on these should come down comfortably post release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that said, I think each inhabits a unique design space for Magic: The Gathering. I’ve been buying precons to upgrade, take apart, or just play out of the box for a few years, and both of these are pretty unique.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m particularly excited about Blight Curse as a way to slowly grind an opponent’s game plan to a halt, potentially flipping cards to your side of the field, while Dance of the Elements, while exciting, is likely to lead to some wild plays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The choice is yours, of course, but I really don’t think you can go wrong with either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 16, 2026 3:00 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-precon-decks-in-stock-best-price-preview]]></content:encoded>
