We need to get the funniest person we can possibly find!"</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of a "month of anniversary surprises," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> developer Arrowhead has formally introduced us to the "face of Freedom, the voice of Victory, the light of Liberty… John Helldiver."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a fascinating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2l2g6H2ekc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>deep dive</u></a> into the writing and casting of the iconic character, actor Craig Lee Thomas and lead writer Russ Nickel discussed developing the face and voice of the game that the fandom has dubbed, quite rightly, John Helldiver.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Casting was crazy," said Russ Nickel, Helldivers 2's lead writer between 2020 and 2022. "I did all the writing, and then the script went off sort of into the abyss, and I didn't hear anything for a while. Then I found out that it was going to shoot in a week. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"They actually hadn't really done any casting. They were just going to use this actor who's based in Sweden, who was perfectly good, but I was like, 'This is going to be John Helldiver!' (I didn't know that would be his name at the time). We can't just get someone who's good! Like, we need to get the funniest person we can possibly find!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"From the initial audition, you read for what you can as an actor, and you get excited about so many things," added Thomas, admitting: "But this in particular, as soon as I read it, I was like, ahh, I really, really, <em>really</em> want to do this." So, with very little notice, he recorded a quick audition tape and sent it off. The video includes Thomas' audition and even though his portrayal is a little less amusing than we've come to expect, there's no doubting that it's our John Helldiver. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Within a couple days, I had gotten self tapes from Craig Lee Thomas, who plays John Helldiver," Nickel explained. "He's <em>perfect</em>. I love that man. He's so good!" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2l2g6H2ekc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>15-minute featurette</u></a> on YouTube, complete with insights into the recording and mocap process, and some thoughts from the director of the opening cinematic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2's next Warbond 'Siege Breakers' will release tomorrow, February 3. As detailed in a recent post by Arrowhead's social media and community manager, this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-new-warbond-siege-breakers-adds-a-great-big-breaching-hammer"><u>Warbond is for players needing "something to smash through [...] towering foe with impenetrable fortifications,</u></a>"... which I'm pretty sure means it's needed by all of us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, the studio’s CEO confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/think-runescape-arrowhead-ceo-rules-out-helldivers-3-will-keep-updating-helldivers-2-for-as-long-as-it-can-go"><u>Helldivers 3 is not in any plan developer Arrowhead has right now</u></a>, saying that instead it wants Helldivers 2 to keep going for years and years, like veteran MMO RuneScape. The Helldivers 2 movie<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-ceo-responds-to-call-for-the-helldivers-movie-director-to-play-the-game-at-least-once"><u> is also picking up steam</u></a>, and in December, Helldivers 2 received its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-patch-500-arrives-with-an-incoming-message-from-high-command-thats-already-got-players-worried"><u>big 5.0.0 patch</u></a> as well as its jungle-themed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-finally-getting-a-minigun-and-other-fan-requested-weapons-as-part-of-the-jungle-themed-python-commandos-warbond"><u>Python Commandos Warbond</u></a>, which added a number of fan-requested weapons, including a minigun. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
