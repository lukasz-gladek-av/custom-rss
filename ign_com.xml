Pokémon TCG Pocket is free to play but allows players to buy extra booster packs, cosmetics, and a monthly pass that awards one extra pack a day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The app launched to immediate success, with AppMagic estimating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">it was making $3 million a day after hitting $12 million after four</a>.

The projects in development are works in progress at the moment but diverse in genre, with some directed by Miyazaki himself, he said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware has a varied history in game development but has become known for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-fromsoftware-is-still-king-of-the-soulslike">defining the Souls genre over the last 15 years</a>. These games have varied in theme somewhat though are all role-playing games with a similar format of, at their most simple, progressing through an area before taking on a challenging boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review">The giant mech battling Armored Core series</a> is also developed by FromSoftware though, and outliers to the traditional dark fantasy themes of its Souls games include the gothic horror entry <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">Bloodborne</a> and Japanese mythology-set <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/21/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">None of the incoming projects have been revealed by FromSoftware as of yet, though one of them is almost certainly the next signature Souls game akin to Elden Ring. Many fans are hoping for a return to the Dark Souls franchise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review">which has been dormant for close to a decade</a>, while others are desperate for a Bloodborne sequel (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-fans-freak-out-again-as-playstation-anniversary-trailer-ends-on-bloodborne-and-the-phrase-its-about-persistence">and think an announcement is imminent</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring would have been the most obvious choice for a continuation, not just because its FromSoftware's best received game so far but, perhaps more significantly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-reaches-25-million-units-sold-ahead-of-shadow-of-the-erdtree">it sold a staggering 25 million units</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review">In our 10/10 review</a>, IGN said: "Elden Ring is a massive iteration on what FromSoftware began with the Souls series, bringing its relentlessly challenging combat to an incredible open world that gives us the freedom to choose our own path."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
