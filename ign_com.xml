I am grateful to the development team for their cooperation in optimizing the game until the very last moment. I hope many people will experience Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Steam Deck.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth doesn’t have its own PlayStation 4 port, it’s surprising to see it gain the coveted Steam Deck Verified badge, a feat that mainline <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-review"><u>Final Fantasy 16</u></a> couldn’t manage to achieve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, to celebrate, Square-Enix created three “specially crafted” Steam Deck units; but these are no simple custom case or repaint job, they're full-on Chocobo makeovers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Flocked with the Chocobo’s iconic yellow fluffy fur, feathers, and beak, one of these custom Steam Deck units was shown off in an official video, below. However, Square Enix warned: "we don’t advise trying to wrap high-tech gaming gear in fur at home."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Three of the furry Steam Decks were created, and on further inspection, they appear to be built on a Steam Deck OLED model (you can tell from the color of each analog stick). But you can’t help but question how practical it would be to game on the Chocobo Steam Deck, given that all of the feathers and flocking might get in the way. However, Square Enix has left the fan intake open at the rear, so the system can breathe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If your mouth waters at the prospect of playing a 100-hour RPG on a furry Steam Deck, Square-Enix has teased on social media that it will run some kind of giveaway or competition so a few lucky fans can get their hands on one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's Steam Deck verification reinforced the idea the game will eventually make its way to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">the just-announced Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Indeed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-games-reportedly-set-for-release-on-nintendo-switch-2">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is reportedly set for Nintendo Switch in 2026</a>, after Final Fantasy 7 Remake hits the console this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth launches on PC on January 23.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech &amp; hardware.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-trading-unveiled-but-is-so-poorly-received-the-developers-had-to-respond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> developer Creatures Inc. has finally unveiled how the incoming trading feature will work, but the community response was so poor it had to release a follow-up response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As expected, and perhaps feared, by the Pokémon TCG Pocket community, there are fairly severe restrictions on the incoming trading mechanic, which still lacks a release date despite being confirmed for January. Creatures Inc. announced these on <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Complaints are headlined by the inability to trade cards of 2 Star rarity or higher. This means no ex level alternate art cards can be traded, not in their basic forms, rainbow bordered forms, immersive forms, or gold (Crown rarity) forms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. said only "certain cards from the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island booster packs will be able to be traded," though it's unclear if this solely refers to the 2 Star or higher restriction or if there are further cards banned from trading.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Genetic Apex</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This all but confirms trading will arrive alongside the next full set, however, which is also due in January. Creatures Inc. is likely emphasizing that those new cards cannot be traded upon their release, but will seemingly be opened up to the feature later when it's less relevant. It also means the often timed exclusive Promo cards cannot be traded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other restrictions to trading apply too. Cards can only be traded between friends, which the community has deemed makes sense, and only cards of the same rarity can be traded, which has been accepted too. The last element that's frustrated many, however, is that "items must be consumed in order to trade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear what this means exactly. Pokémon TCG Pocket uses Hourglasses to pace certain features including pack opening, wonder picks, and event battles. One booster pack can be opened for free once every 12 hours, and one Pack Hourglass, for example, reduces that amount of time by one hour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's therefore possible Trade Hourglasses will be implemented as an item, essentially restricting how often players can trade without spending real-world money. Another popular theory is that Shinedust, an item considered by many to have little value as it solely changes the visuals of cards, will work for trades too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pay Day</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This mechanic, alongside the other restrictions, are likely being implemented to encourage (and maintain) player spending, as Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived October 30 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">is estimated to have made $200 million in its first month alone</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as the digital TCG follows the standard mobile and free-to-play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real-world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">outside of the occasional set drop like Mythical Island</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trading is undeniably a strong addition to Pokémon TCG Pocket that will improve the overall player experience, but fans have complained it's also fairly clearly being implemented as a means of increasing revenue too. Items being consumed in order to trade certainly alludes to this, as whether it's Trade Hourglasses or Shinedust or something else, players wanting to trade more regularly than the game deems okay will have to pay real money to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also evidenced in the inability to trade cards of 2 Star rarity or higher, which after almost three months of play for dedicated fans, are the majority of cards they are still missing. But making these cards available to trade would be a threat to Creatures Inc.'s revenue; if players could immediately trade for their missing cards, they wouldn't need to spend $10 or $100 for a random chance of getting them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As noted by the player who spent $1,500 on completing the first set, it's these final few pieces that are most difficult to get and thus require the most money spent. The standard $9.99 purchasing option grants 57 PokéGold, an item which can be used to replace any of the Hourglasses otherwise available but at an increased rate. One PokéGold replaces two Pack Hourglasses, for example.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spending $9.99 therefore lets players open 28 booster packs for a total of 140 cards. Booster packs work in the same as their real-world counterparts, or in digital terms, loot boxes, meaning nothing of (relative) value is guaranteed, never mind the specific card players are looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket does offer a mild alternative to finding these cards in the form of Pack Points; players earn five for every pack opened, and these can be exchanged for any card in the set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exchanging a 2 Star rarity card costs 1,250 Pack Points, however. This means players must open 250 booster packs in total, or around $220 worth of PokéGold, for a single card. Considering there are 29 different 2 Star rarity cards in the first set alone, plus three 3 Star rarity cards which cost 1,500 Pack Points and three Crown rarity cards which cost 2,500, there are fairly sobering restrictions to this mechanic.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Trading Complaints</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Trading was therefore seen as a saving grace for players looking to collect every card (which is encouraged in-game via missions and rewards), but those hopes are all but dashed given Creatures Inc.'s announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not being able to trade 2 Star at least really makes me want to drop the game," said lilgalois on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1i30m2w/tcg_pocket_official_update/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>. "Trash system," said Ashamed-Teaching6837. "So extra 3 Star cards are just dead cards. What a crock," said Analogmon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Social media is full of such complaints, which seemingly grew so excessive that Creatures Inc. had to issue a rare response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thank you, everyone, for your immediate thoughts on this topic," Creatures Inc. said in a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880027099836411924" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> post. "Your concerns are seen. Once this feature becomes available, I'd like to invite everyone to try it and provide feedback. This way, the game can continue to evolve in an enjoyable way for everyone." Crucially, Creatures Inc. failed to say it would consider this criticism and aim to make changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-marvel-rivals-bot-conspiracy-explained<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There are no strings on me.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> continues to land atop Steam and Twitch charts, one issue has fans suspicious of their time with NetEase Games’ new hero shooter: bots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The superhero-themed competitive multiplayer experience launched in December to critical acclaim and praise from fans thanks to its style and creative use of iconic characters like Spider-Man, Wolverine, and, most recently, the Fantastic Four. It’s achieved so much success that hundreds of thousands of gamers are still firing up Marvel Rivals every day on Steam alone (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#1w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>). While NetEase’s new hero shooter has managed to dodge some of the pitfalls that trap other competitors in this space, fans have spent weeks raising concerns regarding how AI enemies have been implemented across several of its game modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know people may feel differently but playing against bots in (Quickplay) just doesn’t feel good at all to me,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hnamlz/comment/m41caaq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user commented</u></a>. “AI should be in AI modes and that’s it.”</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like other multiplayer games released over the last 15 years, Marvel Rivals offers practice modes that make it clear players will be competing against what many refer to as “bots.” These AI-driven opponents can often have their difficulty tweaked to a user’s liking, cementing these modes as valuable tools for those looking to improve their skills or cool down between the often more intense matches against human players. Where the Marvel video game is running into trouble is the appearance of what many believe are bots in standard Quickplay matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For weeks, social media has slowly flooded with posts from users concerned that they are being tossed into matches against low-level bot players, with some reporting that their teammates are also occasionally being replaced by bots. The jury’s out on what triggers these bot matches, but the working theory is that Marvel Rivals will match players into these comparatively easier matches after the occurrence of one too many losses. It’s a tactic that could keep players from feeling so defeated that they quit the game, and it may help users load into Quickplay matches without delay instead of sitting through long queue times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, there is little transparency from NetEase regarding which players are bots or if there are bots in Quickplay matches at all — and the company has remained quiet thus far (IGN has asked for comment). More than a few posts caught fire on social media in the weeks since launch as players tried to establish what is and isn’t a red flag in the hope of finding their own solution. Examples include bizarre-but-repetitive behavior in-game to similarities between each teammate’s names, including team names filled with single words and all capital letters or names split between one full name and one half name. The most telling sign, though, is when every enemy’s career profile is labeled “restricted.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The fact that you can even get bot games after wins and that the game doesn't tell you that you're against bots is what gets me about this,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hnamlz/comment/m42u5ep/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a>. “You don't want to learn new heroes in comp because people will understandably rage at you for doing that, but if you try to learn a hero in (Quickplay) you now have to second guess if you actually are getting any better on that hero or if the game is just making you think you are because it's handing you free wins in the form of bots.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of bots in multiplayer games is far from new; players have argued about how bots could be impacting their Fortnite performance for years. As for Marvel Rivals, some have called for the option to toggle bot matches on or off, while others want the feature removed completely. There is also a selection of players who don’t mind fighting against the occasional bot lobby, explaining that they use these matches as an opportunity to complete a few specific hero achievements. Reddit user ciaranxy began to question some of their matches shortly after launch and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hnamlz/everything_you_need_to_know_about_marvel_rivals/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">created a post calling on the community to do the same</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, you can choose to believe this is an issue or not – that is your CHOICE,” ciaranxy says in the post. “But – for everyone else – when you press Quickplay, NetEase does not give you a choice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played Marvel Rivals for more than a few hours since launch, there’s a good chance you found yourself in one of the questionable lobbies that has others so fired up. I can confirm running into at least one suspicious Quickplay match that featured more than a few of the elements players have warned of, including stiff player movement, similarly structured names, and three teammates and an entire enemy team with restricted profiles. We’ve reached out to NetEase for clarification about the matches that have players concerned and the alleged existence of bots in Marvel Rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While users flock to investigate bots across gaming, you can learn more about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-are-using-the-invisible-woman-to-detect-alleged-bot-matches"><u>how some Marvel Rivals players are using the Invisible Woman to literally stop bots in their tracks</u></a>.
