As of this morning, only a handful of listings remain, and prices are climbing fast, compared to other stores. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, Amazon’s listing for the standard<a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47g2d?object_uuid=d36e5ab1-dbdf-433b-b476-f5bb25082c28&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u> Play Booster Box (30 packs)</u></a> is hovering at around $163.50, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJm6Y?object_uuid=d36e5ab1-dbdf-433b-b476-f5bb25082c28&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Bundles</u></a>, including nine Play Boosters, a foil promo, and a set of borderless Basic Lands, are available from $58.00. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03DxE?object_uuid=d36e5ab1-dbdf-433b-b476-f5bb25082c28&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Pre-release Kit</u></a> (six packs, dice, and a Traditional Foil Rare/Mythic card) can still be found for about $50.95, but it’s marked with low stock at the time of writing, with there only being a handful of units left.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of Amazon, though, several major US retailers are currently filling the gap for players eager to get their hands on the new set, some at far better prices.
