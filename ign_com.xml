It's in development for PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunting, combat, and scavenging are all mandatory if you're to have any chance at making the journey successfully, with resource management of your food, shelter, and faith vital to your quest. Should any of your pilgrims fall to the ever-more-grotesque monstrositites that hunt you each night, their death is permanent in Peregrino. Each of your people has a name, purpose, and history, and your decisions will affect their chances of survival. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Peregrino - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll need to constantly be vigilant about watching out for your caravan, meaning you must upgrade your wagons, fortify your shelters, and choose which road – and risks – to take. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3268150/peregrino" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a> Peregrino on Steam if you're interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

His queue position: 22,880.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/20250806132929-1-1754486065955.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">That's a long wait to play Battlefield 6.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking again just before this article was published, the queue position had jumped to 31,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You could pre-load the game as early as 8am PT on August 4, letting fans download the Battlefield 6 open beta ahead of early access opening at 1am PT tomorrow, August 7 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/BF6_Open_Beta_Guide"><u>here’s IGN’s guide on how to get in on the action</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lots of players are getting ahead of the game and setting their options, taking 30 minutes or so to edit user interface colors and weapon Field of View, for example. Others are just using it to share their excitement with friends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Steam's official stats, the Battlefield 6 open beta currently has 17,477 “players” on Valve's platform, which means it’s officially more popular than any other Battlefield game there, including Battlefield 5.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what does this mean for Battlefield 6? From EA’s perspective, it suggests there’s significant interest in the game. EA has said it’s all-in on Battlefield 6, so there’s significant pressure on it to perform. It will be interesting to see the concurrent figures on Steam when the open beta goes live. I suspect the queues will only get bigger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Battlefield 6 producer Jeremy Chubb has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-producer-admits-2042-was-missing-the-excellence-of-predecessor-battlefield-bad-company-2"><u>fan-favorite Battlefield: Bad Company 2 was a "huge inspiration" for developing the shooter's upcoming instalment</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh light has been shone on an interview that claims Nintendo once suggested Pokémon's beloved mascot Pikachu should have breasts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The interview, with The Pokémon Company's veteran CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara, dates back around 25 years, and is in Japanese — something that has prompted debate over the exact translation of what Ishihara originally said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, however, Japanese site <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/29/155531.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game*Spark</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-of-america-really-did-suggest-giving-pikachu-large-feminine-breasts-at-one-point-japanese-media-confirms/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>) has examined the original interview in detail to uncover as firm an interpretation as possible — and yes, it really does seem to be what it sounds like.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, let's examine what Ishihara says, before further discussing the specific issue over the word "breasts." For context, Ishihara is discussing an early conversation he had with Nintendo of America employees regarding the localisation of the Pokémon franchise — before it launched in the West and became the global phenomenon it is today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When I first showed Pokémon to them, they told me it was too cute," Ishihara recalled. "The staff at Nintendo of America then suggested their own designs for the characters – I won't show those illustrations to anyone as long as I live, but they kind of looked like the characters from the Cats musical.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, for example, Pikachu was changed into a character shaped like a kind of a tabby cat with huge breasts."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/cats-official-trailer-00-01-54-1754483355008.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Taylor Swift in the Cats Musical movie. Image credit: Universal.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Automaton notes, there is some debate here about the exact Japanese word used to describe "breasts," which could also mean pronounced masculine pecs. However, there's added context in what is said next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Ishihara is asked whether he means breasts "like those girls who do Pikachu cosplays at anime conventions," the CEO replies in the affirmative. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yes, exactly," Ishihara states, "they presented that kind of design to us for real. I thought it was interesting, in a sense of appreciating such cultural differences. However, I didn't want to compete in the [overseas] market with that kind of thing."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/untitled-1-1754483413321.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Cosplay Pikachu.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One final wrinkle in the matter is a subsequent anecdote from the late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who in 2008 recalled early localisation conversations that featured a westernised Pikachu concept with big muscles, in an attempt to make the mascot "stronger and scarier." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, as Game*Spark notes, this could simply refer to an additional concept also being discussed in the same meetings, as Nintendo suggested a range of alterations. And, if anything, it's yet more proof that Nintendo once had some eye-opening ideas to change the design of some Pokémon for the franchise's rollout outside of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Judging by the popularity of Pokémon today, and the failure of Cats' movie adaptation, that's probably for the best.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Universal.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
