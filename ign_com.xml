From a wide variety of manga to lore encyclopedias, these books make the perfect gift for the Zelda fanatic in your life. Or if you just wanted to spruce up your own bookshelf, we got you covered. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-april-2025">Amazon's April book sale</a> might be over, but many of these are still available at a discount for the foreseeable future and make for great gifts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda Manga</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Penned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Himekawa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akira Himekawa</a>, the Legend of Zelda manga span almost the entire history of the games, with major manga series based on many of the mainline titles like Ocarina of Time and the Minish Cap. These are great for people new to manga wanting to dip their toes in, or die-hard fans of the games looking for deeper world building. All of these stories are available individually, but if you're a collector, you can get some of them in various collected box sets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 11 volume Twilight Princess Manga has its own boxed set, which includes the complete story and a poster. Additionally, the Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past manga by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotaro_Ishinomori" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shotaro Ishinomori</a> is a great quick read that's also available. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedias</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're in the mood for something a little more educational, the Legend of Zelda encyclopedias are the perfect place to get a deep dive into Hyrule's lore, culture, and different races. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/09/the-legend-of-zelda-hyrule-historia-review">The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia</a> originally released in 2013 and gave fans the first officially established timeline. If you're unfamiliar, for years fans have meticulously speculated about a branching timeline that began in Ocarina of Time — one branch where adult Link defeats Ganondorf and one where he doesn't. It's a pretty interesting bit of lore that explains some of the settings in later and past games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda Encyclopedia and Art &amp; Artifacts offer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/02/20-fascinating-facts-from-the-legend-of-zelda-encyclopedia">even deeper looks at the universe</a>, and include detailed breakdowns of the different items, characters, and enemies, as well as exclusive interviews with developers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Creating a Champion is an over 400 page companion to the 2017 game. It contains countless design artwork and concept art, a look at the history of Hyrule, and interviewers with key developers.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Legend of Zelda Guides</h2><div catalogid="89efae87-604d-4b30-ac6f-e2e995689a5b" id="219537"><div id="219537" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - The Complete Official Guide: Collector's Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks in part to the internet, they just don't quite make video game strategy guides like they used to. These days, older guides from publishers like <a href="https://primagames.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prima Games</a> and Brady Games have become steeply priced collector's items. There is, however, one massive hardcover official guide for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">2023's Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> that is currently available on the Nintendo Switch. This almost 500 page guide covers everything you need to know in the game, from every Korok location and cooking recipes, to dungeon solutions and boss fight strategies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, you can also find all of that information in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">IGN's guide to the game</a>, but this physical copy is a great addition to your shelf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.
