Rather vaguely, there's also mention that "some battle rewards that can be received for each battle have been added and increased."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A selection of bug fixes are also included, tied to Mega Evolutions, side missions and "some other issues" — the full details of which can be found in the official patch notes below. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Pokémon Legends Z-A - Version 1.0.2 (November 6, 2025) patch notes:</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The following bugs have been fixed:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>If you have not opened the box screen since the box was full before the first Mega Evolution battle, you will definitely fail to capture a Pokemon. Also, if you proceed with a side mission that allows you to obtain a Pokemon in that state, you will not be able to complete it.</li><li>In some side missions, if the day/night change occurs at the same time that a skill is hit on a target, it will no longer be possible to hit the target with a skill, and the side mission will no longer be able to progress.</li><li>During a trainer battle, if the opposing trainer switches Pokemon and the player simultaneously Mega Evolves, the opposing trainer will not be able to send out a Pokemon and will be unable to proceed.</li><li>Fixed some other issues.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rank Battle Balance Adjustments:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Adjustment of points earned based on ranking so that points are not reduced depending on the outcome of the match.</li><li>Some battle rewards that can be received for each battle have been added and increased.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">*The latest update data is required to play online features.<br>*Local communication is not compatible with previous versions.

Perhaps there's more hidden in today's update that's tied to that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since launch, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has gone on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-sells-58-million-in-launch-week-half-were-bought-for-nintendo-switch-2">sell almost 6 million copies in its first week</a>, and has been getting a generally warm reception from fans. The adventure "finally feels like Game Freak hitting its stride in Pokemon’s 3D era, with a fun setting to explore, a well-written story, and a total battle system overhaul that works surprisingly well," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Pokémon Legends: Z-A review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bots keep players from waiting "possibly forever" to get into games.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield lead producer David Sirland has taken to social media to clear the air about how Battlefield Studios uses bots in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> multiplayer to keep players engaged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA’s latest entry in the Battlefield series notoriously uses bots to populate standard matches that struggle to fill teams with real-world players. It’s led to some confusion in the community, as fans attempt to grasp when, how, and why BF Studios has been implementing them in online matches.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986035968592204179" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X/Twitter</a> to shed light on bots, explicitly calling attention to “confusion” in the player base that he hopes to clear up. The thread of posts comes with an explanation for why some may see more bots than others, as well as the promise that EA and BF Studios will continue listening to feedback from Battlefield 6 multiplayer fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have noticed bots in standard multiplayer playlist options, especially for game modes with large lobbies like Conquest, since Battlefield 6 launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 10. EA proudly touted that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-sold-record-shattering-7-million-copies-in-3-days-giving-eas-shooter-franchise-its-best-ever-launch"><u>it had managed to sell 7 million copies</u></a> in just three days, leaving many to wonder why they are being tossed into bot-filled matches less than one month after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sirland explains that players should only find themselves fighting against Battlefield 6 bots in unique situations. Specifically, if the pre-round waiting period takes longer than about three minutes, than bots will be introduced as a last resort, but that doesn’t mean you’ll be forced to work with dozens of AI teammates for the duration of a 30-minute Conquest match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At that point, the game starts, and you can play with the bots instead of waiting,” Sirland explains. “Other players in the same region matchmaking on that same playlist - will join this server (as it has you on it). Each time a player joins, a bot leaves.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a sacrifice that gets players into a match with as little waiting as possible at the cost of filling a lobby with real people. Even if bots only temporarily fill a match, it sounds like BF Studios prefers the trade, with the alternative being wait times that could last forever for servers with low population.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">2: you see no other players<br>Well, the reason for that is you are first. You need to stick it out (or atleast give it a minute or two, or how may you are willing to try and wait for)<br>We can and will test longer wait limits for the seed bots to kick in, but please spread the word!</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1986037104405582136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">One <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986037656707342653" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>exception to the rule</u></a> that sees bots eventually traded out for real players involves beginner playlists, such as Initiation Breakthrough. As made clear via an in-game mode description, bots will stick around in these matches to help players warm up for the typically more tense matches filled with real people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bots have remained a hot topic for the Battlefield 6 community for months, with BF Studios having addressed concerns <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-increases-xp-gain-addresses-progression-complaints-and-targets-xp-farms-taking-up-server-space">regarding XP farms</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-clarifies-use-of-bots-in-the-open-beta-insists-theyre-only-in-the-training-grounds-playlists">open beta bots</a> mutliple times in the past. Battlefield Portal fans and multiplayer playlist regulars have almost certainly encountered bots at some point, and many will no doubt continue to have their complaints as post-launch development continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Like I stated in this thread earlier today - bots are only there to seed servers so they start,” Sirland said in response to a fan who expressed concern about the bot system. “The alternative would be no server under those circumstances. We will of course check for issues here too, and when and if servers spawn in the wrong way or when they shouldn’t.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 team at EA and BF Studios has continued listening to fan feedback as post-launch development continues. Recent changes include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-major-overhaul-of-challenges-and-assignments-with-significant-reductions-to-challenge-requirements-available-now">an overhaul for challenge requirements</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-recently-patched-conquest-mode-to-make-the-matches-shorter-the-community-complained-and-now-the-developers-have-reversed-the-decision">tweaks to Conquest ticket sizes</a>, and a plan to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-to-revert-aim-assist-settings-as-pc-players-edit-files-to-turn-off-crossplay">revert aim assist back to the settings seen during the August open beta tests</a>.

Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick called the 2022 leak "terribly unfortunate... and we take those sorts of incidents very seriously indeed."
