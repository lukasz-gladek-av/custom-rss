            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has been out for over two months now, which means players have had ample time to puzzle over and tease out every morsel of its lore. But there's still one ultra-rare item in the game that most players have probably never seen before, but which some in the community believe still holds an enormous secret: the Cord End.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you play Nightreign and, like me, had no idea what this even was until just now, here's the rundown: the Cord End is a legendary consumable item that only appears in big and small churches in Nightreign from breaking boxes. Its drop percentage is ridiculously low - just 0.035% - meaning most players will likely never even run into it. Its listed use is cryptic: "Gain entry somewhere." If you don't know where that somewhere is, the item is totally useless to you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But for those in the know (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Use_Cord_End_in_Nightreign_for_Secret_Door">or those following our handy guide</a>), it's not too hard to find the secret door it opens. Hidden in a cliff wall in a ravine at the center of the map, there's a sealed entrance that only opens if you have the Cord End on hand. Inside is a strange statue of a girl, and three Sacrificial Twigs, talismans that allow the wielder to die exactly one time without losing runes or levels. It's an interesting reward, to be sure, but admittedly a little underwhelming given the ridiculous rarity of the Cord End required to get them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, granted, it's likely at least part of the Cord End's mystery is in adding lore details to Elden Ring Nightreign via its description and the statue of the girl in the chamber it opens. We won't cover that here, as the meaning behind it is pretty deep into endgame spoiler territory for Nightreign, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9FXm1IEwHY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lore YouTuber VaatiVidya</a> has a great breakdown of what the Cord End is from a lore perspective and why it matters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that all said, the lack of real mechanical payoff for such a rare find has players speculating that there's something more to this secret door. For the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l7j5m9/follow_up_to_my_sacrificial_twig_theory/?share_id=LXYt4Qg7gPNfE7Cg27Cpo&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last two months</a>, the community has been testing out theories around the Cord End and the Sacrificial Twigs. With a lack of any new or recent clues, the secret hunting had largely slowed down, but a cryptic post on the Nightreign subreddit recently fired up everyone's curiosity again, inspiring people to float new theories about how to do... something... with those twigs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest barrier to finding anything is the sheer rarity of the Cord End. Some players are reporting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mft3jp/after_exactly_222_hours_got_my_first_cord/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seeing their first one</a> after hundreds of hours of play. So anyone who wants to test theories has to get extremely lucky in actually getting a Cord End to begin with, and then also getting the exact perfect other circumstances they're looking for (specific bosses, certain locations appearing, certain characters in the party, and so forth) to test out whatever it is they want to test. So while it's unlikely that there's anything new to discover regarding the Cord End at this stage, there's at least a whisper of possibility in the fact that so few people are in a position to make that discovery to begin with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is it a secret? Is it merely lore? Is it something we'll be able to unlock in a future DLC, as some have theorized? Who knows! But what's genuinely cool here is that an ultra rare item is still sparking this level of curiosity and discussion and mystery in the community months after the game's release. Whether there's anything deeper to the Cord End or not, its enticing rarity is sufficient to get me, at least, fired up... if I can ever get one to drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave Elden Ring Nightreign a 7/10, saying that "when Elden Ring Nightreign is played exactly as it was designed to be played, it’s one of the finest examples of a three-player co-op game around – but that's harder to do than it should be, and playing solo is poorly balanced." Nightreign <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-finally-gets-duos-mode-with-patch-102-game-balance-adjusts-to-the-current-number-of-players">recently saw the addition of a duos mode</a>, and the game had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-developer-thanks-fans-as-nightreign-and-shadow-of-the-erdtree-top-new-sales-milestones">sold five million copies</a> as of July.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Alternatively, the premium Xbox Ally X will cost €899 (US prices to be confirmed).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dealabs cautions that this release date has only been verified via its sources for the machine's European launch — so there may still be some slight difference here for other markets, though likely not by much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft is set to showcase more of the ROG Xbox Ally this month at Gamescom, with the handheld available to try publicly on Microsoft's trade show booth, alongside the highly-anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But whether this gives us a firmer grasp on Silksong's elusive release date remains uncertain. During June's Xbox Games Showcase 2025, Xbox president Sarah Bond stated that Silksong would be "available at launch and in Game Pass when Ally releases later this year" — leading many fans to believe the game was being lined up to arrive as a launch title for the handheld.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, writing on the game's official Discord, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-responds-to-release-date-confusion-promises-launch-before-holiday-not-tied-to-xbox-handheld-arrival">Silksong developer Team Cherry subsequently clarified that the game was not sat waiting for the ROG Ally X to launch</a>. Instead, according to marketing manager Matthew 'Leth' Griffin wrote, fans should simply expect the game to arrive before the holidays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I confirmed BEFORE Holiday," Griffin wrote, adding: "we are not tied to a console release." And just in case of confusion, when asked which holiday he was referring to, Griffin added: "Christmas yes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-a-new-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-playable-at-gamescom">Silksong will be playable at Gamescom</a> on both the Xbox and Nintendo booths, in a big marketing push. Surely, then, it can't be much longer?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Powerful hardware, a streamlined operating system, and the ideal ergonomics for a gaming handheld are all key areas that are addressed," IGN wrote after previously going <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hands-on-with-the-xbox-ally-x-the-new-gaming-handheld-from-asus-and-microsoft">hands-on with the Xbox Ally X</a>, "but it shouldn’t come at a cost that boxes out a large swath of interested folks."
