            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Going up to the great big pasture in the sky.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grass Wonder, one of the real-life racehorses that inspired a character in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/umamusume-pretty-derby">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a>, passed away on August 8 at age 30, prompting an outpouring of condolences from fans of Cygames’ anime horse-girl franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The stallion Grass Wonder is one of the real-life Japanese racehorses Cygames turned into a character for its Umamusume: Pretty Derby anime and games. As all Umamusume’s characters are anime girls with equine ears and tails, Grass Wonder also got a sex change. In the Umamusume universe, Grass Wonder is a friendly but determined girl who grew up in America but loves Japanese culture, echoing how the real horse was American-bred but trained in Japan. The character’s light brown hair with a white dot at the front mimics the horse’s chestnut coat with a white star marking.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/08/grass-wonder-1754672021724.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grass Wonder has passed away aged 30. Image credit: Big Red Farm.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The real Grass Wonder is known for winning Arima Kinen, one of Japan’s prestigious Grade 1 races, twice. During his four-year career (1997-2000), he placed first in nine out of 15 races. At the time, Grass Wonder was matched against fellow racehorse Special Week (resulting in a tense <a href="https://youtu.be/cptKFbDoEqY?si=QGM7eJaojt5v7MIG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>photo finish back in 1999</u></a>), and this rivalry is portrayed in the Umamusume: Pretty Derby anime. After retiring from racing in 2000, Grass Wonder went on to sire four champions including Screen Hero and Earnestly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the <a href="https://www.bigredfarm.jp/post/%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AF%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC-%E6%AD%BB%E5%8E%BB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official obituary</u></a> from Big Red Farm, where Grass Wonder lived out his twilight years, the former champion racehorse was in good health until he started to decline yesterday evening. He passed away from age-related multiple organ failure at the age of 30, an impressive age for a racehorse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response to the news about the real Grass Wonder going to the great big pasture in the sky, Umamusume’s <a href="https://x.com/uma_musu/status/1953773211667009804" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official X account</u></a> posted: “On August 8, we received the news that Grass Wonder, one of the horses that served as inspiration for a character in our franchise, has passed away. We would like to extend our condolences to all related parties, and pray for the repose of this champion horse’s soul.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans also posted messages of condolences, with many hoping that Grass Wonder was now in a place where there are plenty of dandelions (his favorite food). “The last horse from the strongest generation has set off on his final journey… Thank you Grass Wonder,” one commenter <a href="https://x.com/rUdtTauYetz6ouj/status/1953774418229879163" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted.</u></a> Another <a href="https://x.com/yaya777season2/status/1953792038161272978" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pointed out</u></a> that although they feel sad when the real horse behind a character passes away, the horses will keep on shining forever in the world of Umamusume.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By coincidence, Rena Maeda, who voices Grass Wonder in Umamusume: Pretty Derby, posted on X yesterday about her experience visiting the racehorse in real life. She said she intends to go back and see him again, although sadly she won’t get the chance.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr"><p>海外のトレーナーさんたちが2018年のこのポストを見つけてくれている！ありがと！</p><p>Trainers from overseas are watching this post!

But don't sleep on this patch's best, most important feature: the ability for your character to lean back against a wall and look brooding or nonchalant, just like you've always wished they could.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, but seriously! WoW's latest patch, 11.2, Ghosts of K'aresh, adds a brand new emote to the game: /lean. It does exactly what it sounds like. Your character leans back, either relaxing against whatever wall or support is behind them or, if there's nothing, will just sort of lean in mid-air awkwardly. It's a fairly small addition, but players are already having a lot of fun with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkln6i/rating_each_lean_emote/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One player has shared tier rankings</a> of each race and gender's unique /lean emote, ranging from Blood and Void elves up in S-tier for having perfectly sassy leans, all the way down to D-tier which contains gnome males, draenei females, goblins and dracthyr of both genders, and several more, all of whom apparently have stiff and uninteresting poses.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>? Launched to huge fanfare in 2023, Bethesda's big sci-fi hope landed to a mixed reception from players — who have since gone on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-design-director-addresses-fan-concern-as-starfield-dlc-shattered-space-plunges-to-mostly-negative-steam-review-rating">complain about the game's disappointing first expansion</a> and lack of substantial ongoing support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, one bright spot on the horizon appears to be signs of Bethesda finally adding the highly-requested ability to travel in your spaceship from one planet to another — rather than what happens now, as you load up a loading screen to enter orbit, and from there load up another loading screen to get to where you're going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fragments of code uncovered by Starfield fans now suggest Bethesda has a more streamlined experience in the works, though potentially still with some caveats. While you may be able to travel between planets within the same system, fans say it looks like you won't be able to fly all the way between systems. Oh, and you also won't be able to fly directly from a planet's surface into orbit, like No Man's Sky. Oh, well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">References to the new offering, referred to in the game's code as "Cruise Mode," were detected by players this week and shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1mii922/new_findings_in_the_last_2_update_suggest_dev/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, though Bethesda has reportedly now issued another small patch to scrub them from view.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-starfields-xbox-no-show-even-its-most-loyal-fans-are-starting-to-worry-bethesda-makes-it-so-hard-to-defend-this-game">another no-show at June's Xbox Games Showcase</a>, it remains to be seen when Bethesda will get around to mentioning the game again. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-breaks-silence-on-starfield-future-promises-to-share-details-on-exciting-things-in-the-coming-months">Bethesda said it had "exciting things" coming to the game soon</a> — presumably referring to this. Perhaps we'll hear more in a couple of weeks around Gamescom, ahead of the game's two-year anniversary?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-reportedly-set-for-ps5-release-during-spring-2026-alongside-new-expansion">Starfield's second expansion and much-anticipated PlayStation 5 port will now arrive in 2026</a>, following the poor reception to 2024 add-on Shattered Space. Bethesda boss Todd Howard had <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previously talked of expansions arriving annually</a>, but perhaps Bethesda sees the addition of some form of spaceflight as something to keep players occupied until then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

That's despite requiring players to enable Secure Boot to access the playtest, and EA's own anti-cheat system, Javelin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>EA published a user guide for how to enable Secure Boot on PC</u></a> just yesterday, August 7. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-forces-pc-gamers-to-mess-about-with-their-bios-to-enable-secure-boot-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-next">As we reported at the time</a>, it requires a degree of confidence, as it involves tinkering with the BIOS, but it works by checking that only trusted programs are running on a player's PC before they play. And no, this isn't just an EA diktat — coincidentally, this week Activision also announced the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will require the exact same thing: Secure Boot enabled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, players have begun posting on social media to share video clips of purported cheaters, such as this one below, already viewed 5.8 million times on X / Twitter.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨CONFIRMED: Cheats are already working in Battlefield 6.</p><p>This footage proves CHEATS are FULLY FUNCTIONAL on Day 1 of Early Access Beta. <a href="https://t.co/j9WSyWPEI1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/j9WSyWPEI1</a></p></div>— ItsHapa (@ItsHapa) <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsHapa/status/1953515565084967379?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">DICE <a href="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1953572607074202062" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>producer Alexia Christofi was quick to respond</u></a>, confirming that the team was aware of the issue and assured beta testers that the player identified as cheating in the clip above was "already banned."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Battlefield 6 open beta boasting over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam alone, making it the third most-played game on Valve’s platform behind only Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2, developer DICE has said it’s working on a "substantial" increase in server capacity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it is impossible to stamp out cheating in competitive multiplayer games completely, but given the established narrative around cheating in rival shooter Call of Duty, EA will be keen to nip this one in the bud ahead of Battlefield 6's launch in October.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As it stands, it seems TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are the new reality for PC gamers. Here's Activision's explanation, from a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> published yesterday:</p><blockquote>TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) is an industry-standard, hardware-based security feature built onto CPUs or motherboards that verifies the PC’s boot process has not been tampered with. Secure Boot makes sure a PC can only load trusted software when Windows starts.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">When Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 releases later this year, TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot will be required to play on PC. "These hardware-level protections are a key part of our anti-cheat efforts, and we’re asking all players to get compliant now," Activision warned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for information on how to join the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, head to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/BF6_Open_Beta_Guide"><strong>our BF6 Open Beta Guide</strong></a>, where you’ll find details on how to get into the BF6 Open Beta, the dates and times, available maps, and more.
