We’ve changed our internal processes as a result of this and will be better in the future," the team said in a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/developer-update/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are working to reimburse vehicles and items (to the best of our ability) to players who were impacted by this. You can expect the reimbursed materials, items, and vehicle components to show up in the in-game ‘Claim Rewards’ tab by the end of this week."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same statement, the team also revealed it was working hard to eliminate cheaters from Arrakis, writing, "our primary focus, which continues over the next weeks and months, will be to remove all identified exploits (third party cheat engines, client hacks, or in-game exploitation of game mechanics). In addition, we will be hard at work improving the game, adding quality of life features, and addressing critical gameplay issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have zero tolerance for the type of player behavior that has an impact on the experience of other players, and we will continue to focus on ensuring that players can enjoy the game as it is intended," the statement added. "If you see someone cheating or exploiting, please report them to us using the available reporting channels."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Funcom said that so far it has taken action on "several hundred" cheats caught using exploits, cheats, and hacks, with "more waves of bans coming as we identify further culprits."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have a team dedicated exclusively to fighting hackers and fixing exploits. Over the next few patches, they will be introducing additional efforts to prevent exploits by increasing security on several client/server communication layer, performing additional penetration testing against common attack vectors, and auditing our item and inventory systems to make sure they are resistant to item duplication," Funcom stated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the team also apologized to players who had lost "vehicles or other resources" due to in-game bugs. Though admitting some issues are hard to replicate and resolve, Funcom said it is now working on tools to "better reimburse players for vehicle losses due to bugs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dune: Awakening has enjoyed a superb launch, with a 'very positive' user review rating on Steam.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-may-be-mario-karts-rarest-track-is-available-to-play-now-for-a-limited-time-as-part-of-smartphone-spin-off-mario-kart-tour</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A little bit of Mario Kart trivia for you — what is the one Nintendo track you can't play anywhere but the series' smartphone spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer is Piranha Plant Pipeline, a fun, waterslide-esque level set within the bowels of various Mushroom Kingdom warp pipes that for some reason never got ported over into Switch entry Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart Tour's lengthy track roster is a mix of classic tracks and new courses that also arrived in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as part of the game's Booster Course Pass. These included Squeaky Clean Sprint, a level partially set in a toilet, and Sky-High Sundae, which was immediately brought back for Switch 2 as part of Mario Kart World's open-world map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For unknown reasons, Piranha Plant Pipeline never made the jump to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and because of Mario Kart Tour's rotating track selection it is only rarely playable. Indeed, Nintendo celebrated the track's return with a post <a href="https://twitter.com/mariokarttourEN/status/1942826049639006482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1942826049639006482%7Ctwgr%5E81d207006539890989a8031d8157fbf376b45753%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FmariokarttourEN%2Fstatus%2F1942826049639006482" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">today</a> on X/Twitter, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mario-kart-tour-grants-access-to-a-track-unplayable-anywhere-else" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Life</a> notes that the course's reappearance now marks only the third time it has ever been playable, and its first appearance this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Well hello Piranha Plant Pipeline," one fan wrote. "Missed you so much."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to try out what may be Mario Kart's rarest track, you have until 22nd July to do it, before Piranha Plant Pipeline goes back in Nintendo's content vault. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could we ever see it return in another Mario Kart game? Much will likely depend on Nintendo's plans to keep <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> fresh over the coming years — something the company is currently keeping schtum on. Fans strongly suspect that Nintendo will at some point detail a post-launch content roadmap for its hugely-popular Switch 2 launch title, though Nintendo is yet to say anything of how it may keep its racer refreshed over the coming generation. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The Pipe Tour starts today and it features Piranha Plant Pipeline! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKartTour?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKartTour</a> <a href="https://t.co/6X76J0X7w0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6X76J0X7w0</a></p>— Mario Kart Tour (@mariokarttourEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/mariokarttourEN/status/1942826049639006482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Nintendo's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-upset-over-mario-kart-world-patch-that-makes-a-big-change-to-online-play-thanks-i-hate-it">only major update to Mario Kart World so far has been its unpopular move to further limit the chances of racing on the franchise's standard looped courses</a>, rather than so-called open-world 'intermission tracks'.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Nintendo wrapped up launching new content for Mario Kart Tour back in 2023, the game remains playable on iPhone and Android devices. Originally launched in 2019, Mario Kart Tour made millions for Nintendo, though its gacha-style system for unlocking characters and karts was heavily criticised, and was later removed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo smartphone has a mixed track record on keeping its smartphone games online, with several notable titles such as Miitomo, Draglia Lost and Dr. Mario World no longer playable. The original free-to-play version of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp was shutdown, meanwhile, but replaced with a pricey paid-for alternative. Should Mario Kart Tour ever get retired, Piranha Plant Pipeline will disappear forever with it — so maybe give it a go now, while you can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
