            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Violent weather is about to hit the Rust Belt, as developer Embark Studios has revealed a first look at the new Hurricane map condition coming to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio pulled back the curtain on Shrouded Sky, its next major content update, with <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on its website</u></a>. It comes with a sneak peek at how hurricanes will tear through maps like Spaceport, promising what already looks like the most dangerous weather the southern Italy-set video game has faced yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Powerful Electromagnetic Storms and wintery Cold Snap conditions have had players seeking shelter before, but Embark says Arc Raiders hasn’t seen anything quite like this. Starting with the launch of Shrouded Sky February 24, Raiders may be subjected to strong winds that will have them rethinking how they approach PvP and PvE.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Searching for topside resources and blueprints during a hurricane will have players fighting both with and against the wind. Running with the storm could provide a small speed boost, for example, but running against it will result in slowed movement and drained stamina. Raiders can also expect everything from gas grenades to trailblazers and other throwables to behave differently when winds pick up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One look at the trailer makes it clear visibility will be low during a hurricane, but Embark says Arc Raiders players will want to be wary of debris, too. However, like with most other map conditions, the increased threat level means more opportunities to find better loot, with today’s post teasing Raider Caches and relics of the First Wave for those who brave the storm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shrouded Sky is Embark’s major update for February and follows the January <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-big-arc-raiders-update-of-2026-adds-solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-bird-city-and-more-tomorrow"><u>Headwinds update</u></a>. While that relatively small content drop added a solo vs. squads queue option and the Bird City map condition, Shrouded Sky is said to come packed with a Raider Deck and map update, as well as a new Arc threat, which we may have gotten a small glimpse of toward the end of today's trailer. Players can also expect to reset their ranks once again with the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-outlines-expedition-changes-after-players-criticized-steep-reward-requirements"><u>the next Expedition</u></a> the following day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026"><u>Arc Raiders roadmap</u></a> also promised the Flashpoint update for March and Riven Tides for April. The former is said to come with yet another map condition, while the latter’s headlining feature is a brand-new map to raid.

Alongside the promise to bring a host of new features to Early Access players on Steam in just a few weeks, the footage comes mixed with a stylish animation that almost looks like it could stand alone as its own TV show.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the trailer’s silent hero falls in battle, we see others come to their aid, revealing that players won’t have to fight through Slay the Spire 2’s dark fantasy world alone. Gameplay featured in the footage highlights combat encounters for up to four players, with Mega Crit explaining in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2868840/view/538879349212840702?l=english" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post on Steam</u></a> that the multiplayer mode will feature its own specific cards and team synergies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Early Access is said to come with new cards, characters, events, relics, potions, abilities, alternate acts, and more, today’s trailer shows off how some of these new mechanics will offer chaotic twists on the original formula. The footage also teases an additional new character to look forward to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For 1,000 years, the Spire lay dormant, its secrets buried and its horrors forgotten,” an official description for Slay the Spire 2 says. “Now, it has reopened, hungrier and more dangerous than ever, devouring all who dare to ascend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“New perils demand sharper strategies, relentless cunning, and unwavering resolve. Outwit the Spire’s brutal trials and uncover the truths hidden at its peak.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Slay the Spire 2 Early Access Release Date Trailer - Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Slay the Spire 2 is Mega Crit’s follow-up to its massively popular 2019 original and was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slay-the-spire-2-officially-announced-first-gameplay-screens-revealed"><u>announced</u></a> in 2024.
