It'll run at 4K 60 FPS with a free <strong>Switch 2 Edition</strong> download from day one of release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's Andrew McMahon recently got to play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-labyrinths-weird-metroidvania-take-on-pac-manactually-works">Shadow Labyrinth at PAX East, and had this to say</a>: "Whether it is the fluidity of Puck’s grappling hook and wall traversal combined with Swordsman No."</p></div><div catalogid="de455281-5bca-4908-a2a6-df77b028bfd2" id="223939"><div id="223939" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Shadow Labyrinth</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Release Date: July 18, 2025.

The game features something for everyone here, as the platforming, combat, and puzzles each stand out on their own as enjoyable experiences."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I implore you to suspend your disbelief about how this bizarre concept can even work, and at least give Shadow Labyrinth a try when it is released, as this insane creative bet by Bandai looks like it might actually pay off."</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV: July 24, 2025</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-super-mario-party-jamboree-jamboree-tv-nintendo-switch-2"><strong>Super Mario Party Jamboree – Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</strong></a> drops exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 24. This expanded version includes everything from the original Super Mario Party Jamboree on Switch, plus the brand-new Jamboree TV expansion, a flashy game show mode hosted by Toad that leans even harder into chaotic party-game energy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also another example of Nintendo’s new pricing strategy for Switch 2. While most first-party games on the original Switch launched at $59.99, Switch 2 titles are climbing higher. </p></div><div catalogid="ad581713-13ff-4891-a62b-ffdf4bbad65c" id="218284"><div id="218284" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Release Date: July 24, 2025.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Switch 2 Edition will retail for $79.99, matching the price of Mario Kart World and Tears of the Kingdom - Switch 2 Edition, though not every game is hitting that ceiling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This version includes the original game, an HD upgrade with smoother performance, and the new expansion content. If you already own Jamboree on the original Switch, you can skip the full re-buy and grab the Switch 2 Edition Upgrade Pack separately for $19.99 via the Nintendo eShop or participating retailers.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>No Sleep for Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES: </strong>July 25, 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Step into the mind of Kaname Date, a special agent with an AI partner living in his cybernetic left eye, as you race to uncover the truth behind a missing internet idol. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Sleep for Kaname Date throws you into a surreal mystery where Iris, a popular streamer, has been trapped inside a bizarre, high-stakes escape game, and the only way to find her is to interrogate suspects, dive into dreams, and decode the secrets buried deep in the subconscious.</p></div><div catalogid="fdf16b30-9409-4669-b9e8-7be6e01c8d31" id="219218"><div id="219218" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES Aiba Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect psychological twists, dream logic puzzles, and plenty of stylish weirdness when the game launches for Nintendo Switch 2 on July 25.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Wild Hearts S: </strong>July 25, 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Wild Hearts S is back with a vengeance on Switch 2, bringing its beast-slaying action to a new generation.

It’s fast, frantic, and completely untamed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Plenty More New Switch 2 Games Are on the Way </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That's all for July on Nintendo Switch 2. Next up, we can look forward to Madden NFL 25, Drag x Drive, Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar in August, alongside even more big releases later in the year like Borderlands 4 in September, Pokemon Legends: Z-A in October, and hopefully a confirmed release date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond sooner rather than later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Senior Commerce Editor, for IGN.
