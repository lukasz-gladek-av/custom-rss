            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As Pokémon TCG collectors race to secure the hottest new cards from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions"><em>Prismatic Evolutions</em></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/journey-together-pokemon-card-prices-are-crashing"><em>Journey Together</em></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-preview">Destined Rivals</a>, and the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-japan-black-bolt-and-white-flare-most-expensive">Black Bolt and White Flare</a> sets, the often overlooked <em>Paradox Rift</em> expansion is quietly taking a back seat. That cooling attention is having ripple effects, especially for high-rarity cards. While Special Illustration Rare (SIR) ex cards are seeing a notable drop in value, several Illustration Rares are climbing fast, in part due to shifting collector interest and low inventory levels in my opinion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this shift echoes the rise of <em>Groudon</em> IR from earlier this year, where unexpected demand met low availability. Now other Illustration Rare cards are following suit, gaining ground while their flashier SIR counterparts take a dip. Here's a look at the top climbers and crashers from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-deals-find-these-insane-pokmon-tcg-pulls-with-these-etb-deals"><em>Paradox Rift</em></a> that collectors and players should keep an eye on as we move from the Scarlet and Violet era and toward <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025"><em>Mega Evolution</em></a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/07/pixel-9-35-1751898227168.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Game Freak / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://zdcs.link/znx4vG?object_uuid=73e6b9e5-3d37-4db4-a9e3-0322753b1b97&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Altaria ex</em></a> is down 25% and now sits at $37.13. It’s got some defensive tools and a bit of healing, but I just don’t see it showing up in many decks. Collectors seem to be moving on from it too, which helps explain the drop. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qbbpgw?object_uuid=73e6b9e5-3d37-4db4-a9e3-0322753b1b97&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Gholdengo ex</em></a> has fallen 21% to $23.77. I actually really like the discard mechanic on this one, but it’s being overshadowed by newer SIRs that are getting more attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://zdcs.link/aebjg7?object_uuid=73e6b9e5-3d37-4db4-a9e3-0322753b1b97&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Steelix</em></a><em> </em>has dropped 19% to $25.20. It’s a nostalgic pick for sure, but Earthquake hitting your own bench hurts, and the retreat cost makes it clunky to play. <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjp2NM?object_uuid=73e6b9e5-3d37-4db4-a9e3-0322753b1b97&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Roaring Moon ex</em></a> is down 16% to $46.98. It still hits hard, but the buzz around it has definitely cooled. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRN8A?object_uuid=73e6b9e5-3d37-4db4-a9e3-0322753b1b97&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Garchomp ex</em></a> has also taken a hit, falling 19% to $26.64. It’s still useful for energy acceleration and sniping, but with so many new cards dropping, it’s getting left behind.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/07/pixel-9-34-1751898250628.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Game Freak / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7AJg?object_uuid=73e6b9e5-3d37-4db4-a9e3-0322753b1b97&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Groudon</em></a> is up 13% and now going for $75.99. It hits hard, charges fast, and looks awesome. No surprise it’s still trending up. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRN8b?object_uuid=73e6b9e5-3d37-4db4-a9e3-0322753b1b97&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Morpeko</em></a> is the biggest climber, up 43% to $31.99. Its ability is pretty niche, but the art is fun and people seem to love it right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnwEE?object_uuid=73e6b9e5-3d37-4db4-a9e3-0322753b1b97&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Plusle</em></a> has jumped 32% to $29.50. It’s good in damage-stacking builds and pairs perfectly with <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoGRMl?object_uuid=73e6b9e5-3d37-4db4-a9e3-0322753b1b97&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Minun</em></a>, which is also on the rise. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoGRMl?object_uuid=73e6b9e5-3d37-4db4-a9e3-0322753b1b97&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Minun</em></a> is up 16% to $22.98. Its Buddy Pulse ability adds some nice pressure, and people clearly want the pair together. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObxEn?object_uuid=73e6b9e5-3d37-4db4-a9e3-0322753b1b97&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>Iron Valiant ex</em></a><em> </em>is up 9% to $20.36. It’s great for decks that focus on spread damage and is the only ex SIR from this set that’s currently climbing.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been closely tracking the Pokémon TCG market, and right now we’re seeing a clear split between two major sets. Surging Sparks is going through a sharp correction, with top cards like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu ex - 247/191</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydreigon ex - 240/191</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milotic ex - 237/191</a> dropping 51%, 34%, and 26% respectively. Even chase cards like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu ex - 238/191</a> and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latias ex - 239/191</a> are down over 20%. But this isn’t a crash, it’s a natural correction driven by rising supply.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side, Crown Zenith is heating up fast. Cards like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giratina VSTAR - GG69/GG70</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR - GG68/70</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR - GG67/70</a> have surged 17%–24% in just days. Even <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mewtwo VSTAR - GG44/GG70</a> and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arceus VSTAR - GG70/GG70</a> are gaining ground. With the Scarlet and Violet era wrapping up and Mega Evolution returning soon, Sword and Shield sets like Crown Zenith are entering that sweet spot where older modern sets start gaining long-term value. I’m buying into both while the market is still adjusting.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy Japanese Pokémon Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-japan-black-bolt-and-white-flare-most-expensive">Japanese Pokémon TCG</a> booster boxes have far better odds at pulling chase cards, have far less bulk and are often half the price of English booster boxes. This also mean said chase cards are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-cards-2025">worth significantly less</a>, but Japanese cards are far easier to get perfect grades in given they're always busting out of booster packs in perfect condition. Want a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Pokémon card collection</a> on a budget? Go for Japanese cards.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">The Most Expensive Pokémon Cards In Packs Right Now</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s easy to envy those with deep pockets grabbing the priciest Pokémon TCG cards, there’s something way more exciting about pulling a massive hit straight from a booster pack, especially with sets like <em>Destined Rivals</em>, <em>Prismatic Evolutions</em>, <em>Twilight Masquerade</em>, and <em>Surging Sparks</em> still in print. Right now, cards like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umbreon ex - 161/131</a> are leading the market at over $1,000, followed by heavy hitters like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex - 231/182</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greninja ex - 214/167</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethan’s Ho-Oh ex - 230/182</a>, all pushing $300+. The iconic <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikachu ex - 238/191</a> has cooled to around $295 after peaking last year, making it a solid buy. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More fan-favorite chase cards include <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roaring Moon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latias ex</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Rocket’s Moltres ex</a>, all hovering between $195–$260. And then there’s the Eeveelution invasion. <em>Prismatic Evolutions</em> is packed with top-tier art like <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sylveon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Espeon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leafeon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vaporeon ex</a>, <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolteon ex</a>, and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glaceon ex</a>, all sitting comfortably above $230. Each card is absolutley stunning, pumped with nostalgia and some competitive utility to boot (Although I'd suggest getting the standard ex cards for you deck). The odds of pulling them are slim, Prismatic Evolution is notoriously unforgiving with pull rates. Buying singles might be the smarter move if you're after specific cards, but I also don't like having fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Karlach's greatest, rage-filled monologue is "the core of her" according to Samantha Béart.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fan-favorite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> character Karlach is almost universally beloved for a number of reasons — chief among them, her cheery, sweet, and playful personality. But according to her voice actor Samantha Béart, that upbeat exterior belies something far, far darker, shaped by time spent in the bowels of Hell itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/samantha-beart-interview-karlach-baldurs-gate-3/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with The Gamer</a>, Béart spoke about their time playing Karlach, including the recording process and some very specific plot points. Béart specifically goes in deep on one of Karlach's late-game monologues, delivered after a character who has essentially ruined Karlach's entire life and future is finally dealt with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning! </strong></em><em>Spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3 lie ahead. Read on at your own risk.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who have played Baldur's Gate 3 and seen Karlach's story through know where this is going. Karlach is a tiefling who, prior to the events of the game, has spent a decade in Hell thanks to a fellow named Gortash, who sold her to an archdevil and replaced her heart with what amounts to a bomb that will eventually, inevitably kill her sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That time in hell will really mess with a person, Béart says. So while most of the player's interactions with Karlach are jovial, that's Karlach making a choice to become someone better — it's not who she's always been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For me, [Karlach's story is] a redemption arc,” Béart said. “I think she was a piece of work in hell. She would have had to be [...] It was life in prison. That's where I was in my head with that, because otherwise, it's quite hard to relate it to something realistic. You just think about how people behave in those very small communities. Essentially, I think you can completely change to survive.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When the player finally slays Gortash, Béart as Karlach delivers an incredible monologue unleashing all the pent-up rage, sorrow, and fear that Karlach has felt from spending all that time in Hell and facing her own inevitable demise. It's a really fantastic scene, and according to Béart, that monologue is at the center of who Karlach is:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's the core of her. That's the bit of her she's been hiding until she can't anymore,” Béart explained. “It's a piece I auditioned with, so I always knew it was coming. When it did happen, all the gates were off. All the ugliness can come out. It was a very satisfying and cathartic experience to film."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Béart added that this side of Karlach is absolutely something they discussed with Larian during recording, so even during Karlach's most upbeat moments, that undercurrent of pain still exists, which is perhaps why Béart's performance throughout is so effective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, it's in no small part thanks to performances like Béart's that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">we gave Baldur's Gate 3 a 10/10</a>. "With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs," we wrote. Sadly, Larian recently said goodbye to active development on the game with its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-notes-include-final-farewell-message-as-larian-looks-ahead">final major patch in April</a>, as the studio moves onto new projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
