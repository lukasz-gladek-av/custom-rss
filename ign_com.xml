            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-first-impressions-classic-dq-has-never-looked-so-good<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Anecdotally, it’s been said that in its native Japan, Dragon Quest is more popular than Final Fantasy, which is more popular abroad. This is most obvious for any fans of fantasy anime who will find Dragon Quest’s undeniable influence over the genre, from monster designs like Slimes to other fantasy tropes pioneered by the early Dragon Quest games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who grew up primarily in the United States, I’m in the camp of gamers more familiar with the Final Fantasy series, with only a passing familiarity with Dragon Quest. Plus, while newer entries like Dragon Quest 11 have been rapturously received by fans, it’s the older Dragon Quest games that hold that certain air of history and mystique for someone like me who’s more interested in the legacy of the series.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake: Preview Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which also means it’s been a pretty good couple of years for me as Square Enix is finally remaking these older, beloved, Dragon Quest games for modern systems – and with a fresh new look. Rather than a full, polygonal upgrade, Square Enix is utilizing the retro-modern fusion they call HD-2D from its Octopath series to revive games like Dragon Quest 3 for modern audiences. And that continues with its next remake, Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake, coming later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being released before Dragon Quest 3, Dragon Quest 1 and Dragon Quest 2 are actually sequels, so playing Dragon Quest 3, 1, and 2 in that order is chronologically correct within the game’s universe. I got a chance to play those next two recently on PlayStation 5, and I came away even more excited to finally discover these early Dragon Quest titles.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Best Way to Play the Original Dragon Quest Games</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first three Dragon Quest games comprise the “Erdrick Trilogy” – named after the hero of Dragon Quest 3. It’s no spoiler to say that in Dragon Quest 3, Erdrick is successful in his mission to save the kingdom from evil. You will then play as Erdrick’s descendents in Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2. Thus, Square Enix is actually releasing these games in chronological order, which is nice of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up until these remakes, these have only been released as ports on mobile and certain game consoles, but there’s no need to bother with those now, unless you want a truly classic experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>How Square Enix is Modernizing Dragon Quest</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Given the legendary status of these games, Square Enix has to walk a bit of a tightrope trying to maintain parts of them that fans already love while modernizing some of the more dated bits. These changes, aside from the art style, are typically related to gameplay and storytelling, I’m told. In Dragon Quest 1 for example, there was no party system in the series yet, so the whole campaign is played using a single character who fights one enemy at a time. This has been changed so that now the player, while still solo, faces multiple enemies at once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two games are also “shorter” compared to modern RPGs, with How Long to Beat clocking <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/2833" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Quest 1 at around 10 hours,</a> while <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/2837" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Quest 2 dials it up to 16 hours</a> of playtime. Square Enix says they’ve beefed up some of the content and cutscenes to try and push those numbers up a bit, but don’t expect to be suddenly playing a 100-hour RPG.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Even Better Looking Than Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/24/dq2-field-pc-1748045668905.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dragon Quest 2 HD-2D Remake. Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The main draw of the remakes, certainly, is the visual style. Square Enix has championed this HD-2D art style – wherein pixelated 2D player character models exist in a vibrant, 3D world. Despite already playing games like Octopath Traveler 2 and Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D in this art style, it somehow looks even better in the upcoming collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The textures are even sharper, making the contrast between the 2D pixels and the 3D world starker, but more striking as a result. The 2D pixels have also received an upgrade, though you might not realize it at first. I compared some of the screenshots Square Enix sent over with my copy of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D running on the Switch, and they’re quite different, with the pixelwork in Dragon 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D looking much more detailed and sophisticated than the pixels in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The character models are a little larger, and much more detailed with their armor and weapons looking particularly sophisticated in the new remakes. I found the art style, combined with the gorgeous music, drawing me into the world of Dragon Quest quite completely. Square Enix put out some chips during my preview event and I found myself munching away while fully engrossed in the story of the hero’s party discovering the wreckage of a fallen kingdom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a way, Dragon Quest’s, let’s say “classic” storyline and trope-ish setting is easier to appreciate today than maybe a decade ago. Nowadays, with graphics as advanced as they are and storylines trying to compete with the biggest movies and TV shows, Dragon Quest is a reminder that some stories are timeless for a reason. I’m looking forward to playing both of these HD-2D remakes  when they’re released on October 30, 2025 for all major systems – including the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Missed out on your Final Fantasy and Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering preorders? Don't worry, I've got you covered.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've also had my eye on the Pokémon TCG collectors market, and I've found prices on sealed product cheaper than big box retailers such as Amazon. It's been a big issue trying to get a fair price on stock for the past few weeks, but I've got the best prices on sealed and single cards. There's even some absolute gems to pick up for your Pokémon binder with this week's crashes and climbers. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Marvel's Spider-Man Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst there's only the Play Booster Box and Scene Bundle for MTG: Marvel's Spider-Man live on Amazon right now, TCG Player has every sealed product that will hit the market on launch day. I've even found some pricing on cases of sealed product for those looking to rip open a tonne of boosters, so get on it before the market value on these products shoot up.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Spider-Man Single Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunatley there's no listings for Spider-Man single cards right now considering we're a few months out from release, but I've managed to round up the listings for cards currently sitting on TCG Player waiting for presale allocations, so keep your eyes peeled.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Final Fantasy TCG Player Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">MTG: Final Fantasy</a> is set to be the biggest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-your-first-look-at-over-a-dozen-new-cards-from-magic-the-gatherings-upcoming-final-fantasy-set">Magic: The Gathering</a> set ever, which is a shock to absolutley no-one. Preorders are drying up at retail, but there's plenty of choice available on TCG Player right now. I've found all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-preorder-restock-latest-amazon">preorders</a> listed so far (including prerelease boxes) alongside massive cases on booster displays. Don't sleep on these preorders, MTG FF is going to fly off the shelves on release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Final Fantasy Single Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The single card market for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-spoiler-amano-matsuda">MTG Final Fantasy</a> is flying right now, so I've included over 40 of (in my opinion) the most popular Final Fantasy cards collectors and players will be chasing once packs start getting ripped. Don't want to spend money on boosters and hope? Secure your chase cards for release day instead.</p><p id="expedition-33-merch"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Expedition 33 Merch">Expedition 33 Merch</h2></p><div catalogid="840f5339-ee1a-4f4f-9923-f0b63792a061" id="221665"><div id="221665" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Expedition 33 Merch</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve been captivated by the hauntingly beautiful world of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the IGN Store has an e<a href="https://zdcs.link/a03JPN?object_uuid=c599aaa7-75a3-4e14-9c03-e16957e02ed1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">xclusive collection of officially licensed merch</a>.

Almost everything is way above MSRP and seems to becoming the new normal for big box retailers. I could write a whole article and why this is and what should be done to stop this practice, but here we are.

The crypto bro mentally to reselling products is dying down a little and more product is becoming available thanks to reprints.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-26<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Prismatic Evolutions is down, X and Y promos are up</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's amazing how quickly the Pokémon TCG collectors market changes. We're seeing a ridiculous rise in value for three X and Y era promo cards, which is valid because they've always looked amazing. The thing is, Venusaur EX, Blastoise EX, and Charizard EX box promos have never been a highly-priced card. Looking at TCG Player, the market is flooded with lightly played and damaged condition cards, so perhaps the rarer near mint copies of these cards are worth the higher price tag?
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-may-19">last week's Crashers and Climbers</a>, we saw signs of Prismatic Evolutions chase cards crashing hard, and for the most part, I was spot on. We're seeing massive drops on Glaceon ex and Sylveon ex by 28% over the last few days, which is insane. Let's get into it:</p><p id="crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/26/pixel-9-2025-05-26t135024-371-1748263995267.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/znxejD?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee ex SIR</a> has dropped by 36% since mid-April, which would also mark around the time Prismatic Evolutions reprints started rolling onto store shelves. This alongside the community refusing to pay astronomical prices on Scarlet and Violet chase cards seems to be driving down prices across the board.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7LGY?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon ex SIR</a> has always been one of the cheaper eeveelutions in Prismatic Evolutions, but seeing a cool 28% drop from $338.69 to $240.98 feels like a half decent plateau, although I would personally put my money on this becoming a sub-$200 card before the year is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GZv2?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sylveon ex SIR</a> is in a more popular-yet similar boat, going down from 28% to just shy of $400 from $562.60. Sylveon isn't one of my favorites, but the artwork on this card is incredibly detailed. Pair that with Sylveons dedcated fan base and you're looking at a stable $400 card in my opinion.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpbP2?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Espeon ex SIR</a> is suprisingly cheaper than Sylveon. In my mind, the top two eeveelutions is Espeon and Umbreon. Whilst the latter half of that statement is ridiculously true, it's a good time to start looking at adding this card to your collection. It's only dropped by 5%, but 5% off a card that's pretty much floated around the $350 - $400 mark since launch (after the hype) is pretty good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't think Ceruledge is a cool Pokémon, then we can't be friends. That dark knight energy and purple flames is just epic, and the artwork on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgY1E?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ceruledge ex SIR</a> reflects everything i've just said. A Pokémon that can still look this ruthless with a crown of jewels floating on it's head is worth shelling out $151 for. Expecially once you consider the 27% price drop from $206.71 from the start of May.</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/26/pixel-9-2025-05-26t135054-432-1748264014702.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRVKx?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Venusaur EX promo</a> was a peak card for me in the X and Y era. My first ever starter was Bulbasaur in Pokémon Blue, and this is the best artwork I've seen for its final evolution. Apparantrly i'm not alone, seeing as this card has seen a massive climb of 263% in the space of a week. A near mint conditioned version of this card has climbed from $49.53 to $180 in a matter of days.<br>
<a href="https://zdcs.link/QObMGB?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blastoise EX promo</a> is doing the same, although it's quite a bit cheaper. It's up 88% in the past week, that's from $68.94 and currently has listings for $130. That's currently the cheapest price for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a rare occorance for Charizard collectors, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w1qN?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard EX Promo</a> is cheaper than a Venusaur equivalent. It's a wonderful time to be alive and a fan of grass-types. Zard is still flying high like the other Kanto starters though, a 183% climb in a week. That's a jump to $129 from $45.58.
</p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Another favorite deck inclusion for me in the X and Y days was <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgYKG?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shaymin EX</a>. I bloody love this card. Providing you had double colorless energies to hand, you could use it's Set Up ability in tandem with it's Sky Return attack to draw 6 cards from your deck, do 30 damage and heal it by returning Shaymin EX to your hand. Oh, and it's also raised in value by 44% in a week.</p><p>Another card to rise by 41% is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgY1J?object_uuid=337745cf-4977-4d5b-887c-8f540c62e648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Togepi &amp; Cleffa &amp; Igglybuff GX</a> from Pokémon TCG's Sun and Moon era. The Team Up cards were such a good gimmick and would love to see it come back. It's also had a crazy climb in the last week, springing from $127.61 to a lofty $180. </p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Stock Update</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Long story short; things are looking bleak at retail for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> right now.
