            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it’s the difficulty of gathering your game group together consistently, you prefer playing solo, or you're just looking for new players to test your strategies against, physical board games and tabletop experiences may not be enough. Luckily, some fantastic games have been adapted into digital formats that allow for gaming wherever your gaming group may be and for tense matches whenever you want. It really is an exciting time to be a fan of tabletop games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This guide will point you in the direction of digital adaptations that will scratch that itch you have to play some board games, but also serve as learning resources to introduce new titles into your game night rotation.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Just a note: This list won’t include digital adaptations for TCGs such as Magic: The Gathering or Virtual Tabletop platforms for TTRPGs; it focuses solely on board games. </em></p><p id="root"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Root">Root</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225994"><div id="225994" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Root</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Root from Leder Games disguises rich asymmetric area control under the facade of cute and cuddly woodland critters. Anywhere from one to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a> struggle against one another, attempting to take control of areas and complete unique faction-specific goals to earn Victory Points. Whoever reaches 30 points first wins. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This digital adaptation successfully captures the visual style of Kyle Ferrin’s art and benefits from different aspects being automated. Root offers both Local and Online play in addition to some wonderful tutorials, which are especially helpful and a great resource in learning all of the factions. Speaking of factions, developer Direwolf Digital (expect to see that more on the list) continues to release expansions, unlocking new maps and playable factions.</p></div><p id="dune-imperium"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dune: Imperium">Dune: Imperium</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225995"><div id="225995" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dune: Imperium</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With the physical version winning <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/news/2022/2022-sxsw-gaming-awards-winners-announced/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SXSW’s Board Game of the Year in 2022</a> and the digital adaptation recently winning <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3508413/19th-annual-golden-geek-winners-for-2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BoardGameGeeks' 2024 Golden Geek</a> award for Best Board Game App, Dune: Imperium is an easy recommendation. This mixture of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-worker-placement-board-games">worker placement</a> and deck-building title set in the Dune universe is a modern classic that offers a fun time for board game hobbyists while not being overly complicated to get into for newcomers. Players take turns placing their spies around Dune, improving their standing with different groups, and waging war in an effort to earn enough points to trigger the end game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's really neat about this digital version is that not only does it feature a good tutorial, solo play against computers, and online play (ranked, events, and casual options), but you can also test your skills with special Challenge games with unique rules. Regardless of how you play it, anyone even remotely interested in board games should try Dune: Imperium – or its sort of 2nd Edition, Dune: Imperium - Uprising – at least once. Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review">Dune: Imperium board game review </a>for more details about the game itself.</p></div><p id="spirit-island"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Spirit Island">Spirit Island</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225996"><div id="225996" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Spirit Island</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You are a powerful spirit, and your island and its inhabitants, the Dahan (who are also your worshippers), are in danger from foreign invaders who are laying claim to portions of your home. It’s up to you and your fellow spirits to deal with this problem. Spirit Island is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> deck-building and area control game, where you and your friends will have to use your spirits’ special abilities and build out a power deck to force these colonists off your island. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This digital implementation streamlines the process, offloading all of the upkeep between turns like spawning more colonists and moving them around, making this feel like an overall much faster game. Despite being a cooperative title, this game can be challenging, but luckily, the various spirits are ranked in terms of complexity, so even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">board game beginners</a> can have a good time. Adding in the expansions will provide you with even more spirits to choose from, more customization choices for your island, with Horizons of Spirit Island designed as the ideal jumping-in point for those learning Spirit Island. </p></div><p id="machi-koro-with-everyone"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Machi Koro with Everyone">Machi Koro with Everyone</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225997"><div id="225997" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Machi Koro with Everyone</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s even better than getting one digital board game?

In Machi Koro, players spend coins to buy new properties for their small cities and roll dice to try to earn money, with the end goal of being the first person to build three special buildings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This adaptation features colorful art and cute customizable avatars. It is an excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">board game for families</a> to enjoy, thanks to its local play functionality and short game time of approximately 20 minutes. When you’re ready, though, you can go online and test your skills against other players around the world. Machi Koro with Everyone is the easiest game to learn on this list, and arguably one of the most charming.</p></div><p id="scythe-digital-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Scythe: Digital Edition">Scythe: Digital Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225998"><div id="225998" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Scythe: Digital Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in an alternate version of the 1920s Europe where giant mechs exist and help with farming (and war), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/scythe-board-game-buying-guide">Scythe</a> is an engine-building / worker placement game where players manage not only gathering resources but also waging war on one another. This digital adaptation of the game captures all of the tense moments and rich strategy that players have fallen in love with in the physical board game, but speeds things up thanks to the automation of various systems that only a digital game can provide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a nifty added bonus, Sythe Digital allows you to customize the paint scheme of your units. If you're looking to play against your friends instead of just the computer or random folks online, Scythe: Digital Edition features crossplay, allowing you to play with others regardless of the platform.</p></div><p id="gloomhaven"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225999"><div id="225999" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gloomhaven</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be argued that one of the games that has defined this new era of tabletop was 2017’s behemoth of a game, Gloomhaven. This sprawling campaign title featuring 95 unique scenarios, branching storylines, a ton of characters, and intricate card-based combat has left it’s mark on the scene, but one thing that has always held it back somewhat are the space it takes up and the large amount of time investment it takes to get to the end. Thankfully, Gloomhaven has a digital version that allows you to play online with your friends, instead of trying to organize 50 in-person game nights with friends, regardless of what platform someone may own the game on. If you find yourself a master Gloomhaven player already, then you can take on the 100 special Guildmaster missions or build your own levels with the game’s built-in level editor, and share with the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our love for Gloomhaven here at IGN is well established, being featured on a number of our various board game buyer’s guides including “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-board-games">The Best RPG Board Games Worth Playing</a>”, “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">The Best Campaign Board Games</a>”,  “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/board-games-like-dungeons-and-dragons">11 Board Games Like Dungeons &amp; Dragons Worth Playing</a>”, and now you can add one more to the list. The game really is just that good, and this is the easiest way to play, including its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review">Jaws of the Lion expansion</a>. And there is no better way to get ready for the upcoming digital version of its follow-up, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frosthaven-board-game-review">Frosthaven</a>!</p></div><p id="dominion"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dominion">Dominion</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="226000"><div id="226000" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dominion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The progenitor of the deck-building genre of board games, Dominion is the perfect game to bust out when you have a little time to kill. In Dominion, players take turns buying cards from a shared pool of available options, determined by the expansions and sets they have, creating unique scenarios. What makes this game beloved is how different card effects and triggers play off of one another, requiring you to plan out not only what cards you will purchase, but also the order in which to play them from your hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This digital version continues to see strong support, with many of the physical game’s expansions seeing release in this format as well, and with the option to play not only against computer opponents of various difficulties, you can also play online against friends and random players around the world, regardless of the platform. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact that the base game, which can provide hours of fun on its own, is completely free, when paired with just how many expansions you can also get for this digital game, make it an easy inclusion on the list, and we have also featured Dominion on some of our other lists too, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games"><u>best deck-building games</u></a>.</p></div><p id="werewolf-mafia"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Werewolf / Mafia">Werewolf / Mafia</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="226001"><div id="226001" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>One Night: Ultimate Werewolf</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">How well can you tell when your friends are lying, and how well can you hide when you are? Werewolf / Mafia is the purest form of social deduction and deception out there, and while it balances the lines of whether it's a social experience or a game, there are still a ton of options available to folks who want to play this online with their friends. Many of these can be played right from the internet browser on your smart device or computer (<a href="https://wolfy.net/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>https://wolfy.net/</u></a> , <a href="https://mafiathegame.benrobinson.dev/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mafia The Game</u></a>, <a href="https://mafia.gg/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>https://mafia.gg/</u></a>, and <a href="https://netgames.io/games/onu-werewolf/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>One Night Ultimate Werewolf</u></a> are some free examples), others like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/334230/Town_of_Salem/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Town of Salem</u></a> and its sequel, which have higher production values and more “stuff” to them, can be found on Steam or the various app stores.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Werewolf is a blast to play at parties, and thanks to these online options, you can play with your friends whenever you want! There is also a really interesting history behind the game that you can check out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=049fTXv6XFI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>No Pun Included</u></a> YouTube channel.</p></div><p id="wingspan"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Wingspan">Wingspan</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="226002"><div id="226002" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wingspan</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Birds. Birds everywhere! Wingspan is one of those games that has seemingly been able to break into the mainstream consumer environment (and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review"><u>we think it's pretty great</u></a>, too). If your family or game group is one of those who adores collecting these feathered friends, this digital version of Wingspan is a must-have. Wingspan is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building game</a> in which you attract different types of birds to roost on your board, lay eggs, and earn points. Thanks to this release, you will be able to play all the Wingspan you can handle, including against your friends, regardless of where they buy it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t have a bunch of time all at once to sit down and play a complete game of Wingspan, this digital version also lets you play over the course of numerous days in the form of its asynchronous play. This also allows you to have multiple games going on all at once!</p></div><p id="board-game-arena"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Board Game Arena">Board Game Arena</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="226003"><div id="226003" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Board Game Arena</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With over 1,000 games, more than half of which are available to play even with a free account, Board Game Arena is an amazing option when you and your far-off friends want to enjoy a night of game playing. Playable straight from your phone, tablet, or computer’s browser, BGA lets players connect with other players around the world, take part in tournaments, play either in real time or asynchronously over the span of a week or longer, and even create a friends list so it’s easy to connect with loved ones. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Classic and beloved titles like Catan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions">Ticket To Ride</a>, River of Gold, and Wingspan are all available, in addition to some brand-new games that aren’t even out yet. A vast majority of the games on BGA (917 currently) come with in-depth step-by-step tutorials to help you learn the game, too. This is a handy tool for individuals who want to make sure they like a game before spending a bunch of money on the physical product. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want access to the entire catalog that Board Game Arena offers, you will have to pay to get a Premium account, but at only $5 a month or $36 a year, the price is well worth it just for the additional games you get alone. However, free players can still play those games, they just can’t make a table of those games, meaning they are still able to join other premium players’ tables without having to drop a dime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of all the games on this list, Board Game Arena is by far the best value for your buck. The service runs on your normal internet browser, so anyone with a smartphone can join and play, though we recommend playing it on your computer or tablet instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the very opposite of the idea behind this list, check out our picks for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">best board games based on video games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is suing Tencent, alleging its upcoming game Light of Motiram is "a slavish clone of SIE's...Horizon series of video games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The complaint, which was filed in a California court last week, alleges that Tencent's upcoming adventure game Light of Motiram is illegally similar to Horizon: Forbidden West and Horizon: Zero Dawn in everything from creature design to protagonist to marketing materials. The complaint outlines numerous similarities, comparing various marketing screenshots from both games as well as the game descriptions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Horizon, Light of Motiram takes place in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by giant robot dinosaurs who roam large, natural environments such as tropical forests, deserts, and snowy mountains. Humans, just like in Horizon, live in tribal groups and must fight the machine animals, who also largely line up with those in Horizon, to survive. Both games even feature red-haired women protagonists that wear very similar outfits and styles, and Motiram even has its lead sporting a device awfully similar to Aloy's "Focus" earpiece.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/28/capture-1753727930304.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A comparison between the two games' marketing imagery, as shared in Sony's complaint.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The complaint also cites headlines from a number of gaming websites, including Kotaku, TheGamer, and GameRant, as well as various Steam and Reddit comments, that all remark on the similarities between the two games and the likelihood that Sony would probably sue over the issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The commonalities with Horizon disclosed in the Light of Motiram promotional game trailer and other promotional materials included not only identical story and gameplay themes, cultural, and character elements, but also art style, landscapes, architectural and art elements, color palettes, fonts, and symbols. Lighting and points of view are also highly similar," the complaint reads.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Also per Sony's complaint, Tencent allegedly knew exactly what it was doing here. Sony says that Tencent began developing Light of Motiram in 2023, and approached Sony at the 2024 Game Developers Conference to ask for a licensing deal to develop its own Horizon game. Sony turned Tencent down. But Tencent kept developing Light of Motiram anyway. Sony also claims it approached Tencent informally to resolve the copyright dispute once it became aware of the game, but when it did so, Sony says Tencent tried once again to license Horizon. Sony once again refused, and Tencent allegedly moved forward with the game's promotions and playtests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is suing Tencent for copyright and trademark infringement, as well as false designation of origin. It's asking the court to forbid Tencent from infringing its copyright, for costs and damages of up to $150,000 for each separate work in Horizon that's been infringed, and demand that Tencent deliver all infringing materials to Sony for destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Light of Motiram has a Steam listing, but no release date just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-review.1255347/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The most devastating part about Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game is just how short it falls of fulfilling such an insanely promising premise. I mean, which Tolkien nerd among us hasn’t daydreamed about living a relaxing life as a halfling? But instead of the warmth and comfort of the Shire, I spent 25 hours feeling like I was marching through the Dead Marshes in this cozy misadventure. It’s regrettably dull from start to finish, and runs so badly I wasn’t even allowed to be bored out of my mind in peace. The barebones life sim mechanics offer some of the most shallow versions of classic activities like fishing and farming that we’ve seen done much better in dozens of other games, and building social links with the inhabitants of Bywater is monotonous, repetitive, and never worth the effort. There’s at least some humorous writing and fun moments here and there, and the cooking minigame that serves as the main progression activity thankfully has slightly more depth than the other chores you do, but the few bright spots that exist are drowned out by one of the most disappointing cozy games I played since the Second Age. I went into Tales of the Shire thinking I’d be as happy as Denethor seeing Boromir, but I got Faramir instead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though it rarely succeeds in the attempt, Tales of the Shire mostly follows the blueprint of games like Animal Crossing and Disney Dreamlight Valley, with stress-free slice of life activities in a quiet village as the main draw. You’ll try your hand at lesser versions of the usual fishing, gardening, and cooking minigames as you improve your relationships with your fellow townsfolk – all wrapped in a Tolkien skin that plays with the characters and locations found in The Lord of the Rings. The minimalistic story puts you in the hairy feet of a hobbit who’s recently moved to Bywater and begins to establish themself in the community, all while fixing up the rundown hobbit hole you’re given. You’ll meet some recognizable characters like Gandalf and Rosie Cotton and run samey errands for your neighbors in an attempt to get Bywater officially recognized as a village. As is often the case with games like this, it’s not much of a story, but has some likeable characters and amusing moments here and there as the goofy cast of hobbits bicker and squabble over trivial things that only a hobbit would bother caring about. Unfortunately, a complete absence of voice acting inhibits this high point; it just never quite felt right for such colorful and well-known characters to be completely silent throughout the story’s roughly 15-hour runtime.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Tales lacks those hidden layers of depth to get completely lost in.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the great things about the life sim genre is that, although they can appear fairly superficial at first, the longer you play, the more you discover hidden layers of depth to get completely lost in. Unfortunately, Tales lacks this essential component. At the point where I’d usually expect to enter an impossible-to-put-down chain of easygoing activities as I build out a quiet, virtual life for myself, it instead had me scratching my head as to what the point of all the monotonous busywork they’d saddled me with even was. That’s mainly because, despite featuring lots of cooking, Tales has very little meat on the bones for the vast majority of its mechanics, like how the best way to make money is to slowly walk back and forth across the very small map, picking up the same very small handful of foragable goods, then selling them so you can buy a single cut of bacon to use in cooking. The only time anything changes is when the seasons shift every dozen or so in-game days and you get a few new ingredients to find and crops to plant, but there’s a whole heck of a lot of tiresome grinding in between those shifts, which ultimately only alter the ingredients you’re collecting and the look of the village anyway.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>If you're looking for a game that pairs well with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea, look no further than these TieGuyTravis-approved recommendations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly every activity you’re expected to grind, from fishing to gardening, suffers from this same infuriating lack of depth. For example, you can only fish in a few spots around the map, and doing so yields the same very small handful of fish with little to augment or evolve your angling over time. When I unlocked my first fishing rod upgrade after completing numerous fishing-based quests, I was hopeful this would expand the number of fishing holes accessible to me or let me catch a whole new roster of sea creatures, but only moments later those hopes were dashed as I returned to the same places and caught the exact same fish I’d been reeling in for hours. And since you’re given tons of humdrum quests that require quite a lot of fishing to complete, you’re subjected to a whole lot of tedious repetition with very little in the way of payoff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Really the only exception is the cooking minigame, which serves as the main activity that all the others seem built to support and is much more substantial as a result. Fishing, foraging, gardening, taking care of chickens, and buying ingredients are all just a means to an end for your ever-hungry hobbit, and all of the components you gather are brought back to your home to combine into a dish you’ll then use to curry favor with other hobbits. You’re able to invite a few of your neighbors to share a meal with you once per in-game day, and after learning their preferences and cravings, you’ll have to mix together the right combination of flavors to maximize how much your cooking causes them to like you. Doing so levels up your social links, which awards ingredients and new recipes that open up new possibilities, and even occasionally result in a short conversation between you and whichever hobbit you’ve charmed – a decent payoff to your investment in a game that doesn’t respect your time in most other areas. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’re subjected to a lot of tedious repetition with very little payoff.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, Tales still doesn’t really nail this minigame either, as the actual game part isn’t very good and is overly simplistic, especially in the first dozen or so hours before you unlock additional cooking tools that add a tad more nuance to the process. For example, unlocking the sauce pan allows you to stir different seasonings into your dishes that augment the flavor profile. Plus, you’re required to take on a ton of very boring chores just to get the ingredients you need, and then there’s a good chance you’ll just be waiting around for the next day to come before you can invite new people, since there are so few things to do aside from the time-gated meals. But cooking and the social elements it triggers are at least a relative highlight in a life sim that is so consistently underwhelming, and it does evolve over time in a way that the other activities don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the grind of gathering ingredients, cooking meals, and feeding them to the residents of Bywater, you’ll also improve and decorate your little slice of the Shire. The home you’re given is pretty rundown at the outset, but is expanded and fixed up as you complete activities, the most important of which is the ability to raise chickens that generate eggs and gain access to more farm space. Unfortunately, although it’s nice to have more room and other small improvements like an actual working front door that takes way too long to unlock, there’s not a lot of interesting things to do with the additional space you’re given indoors. You gradually unlock decorations by completing quests, but there isn’t a ton of variety to them, zero functionality to adding things like new shelves and whatnot, and the entire layout of your home is static, so you have to just work around an existing floorplan that doesn’t offer much room for expression. This means that yet another component that’s usually a major draw in life sim games feels like only the minimum amount of effort was put into it. The good news is that the home you’re given definitely nails the Shire aesthetic when it’s fully upgraded, and even if there’s not many exciting options for personalization, it at least gets the job done when it comes to fulfilling part of the hobbit fantasy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if Tales of the Shire were a more interesting game than it is, it would still be pretty hard to play purely by how unacceptably bad it runs. With constant framerate hitches, pop-in, aliasing, hard crashes, and other wonky stuff that suddenly broke, I never went more than a few minutes without something going terribly wrong. The worst of it was the consistent and repeated crashes throughout my play time that forced me back to my desktop, resulting in half an hour of lost progress as I had to start the entire day over. This often happened right after I completed sharing a meal with my halfling homeys, which requires quite a bit of prep work and planning, making it just about the worst time for a crash to happen. At one point I repeated a single day five times (totaling several hours of game time), with a crash happening at the end of the day each time, to the point where I wondered if I’d permanently broken something and wouldn’t be able to progress any further. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the issues, like how inconsistent the framerate is and how objects pop up right in front of your face, are more confusing than anything else – I mean, this does not seem like a particularly demanding game and I played on a high-end PC. It’s such a bummer, specifically because the painterly art style and iconic setting of the Shire has so much potential, and almost none of that comes through when you’re seeing shrubbery pop up right in front of you as you walk around town. Then there’s the one-off bugs, like one time where my fishing line stayed in the water when I was done fishing, and it wouldn’t let me put away my rod, so I walked around Bywater with a hilariously long fishing line stretching across the entire map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also tried out a little bit of the Switch version and, well, let’s just say that I’d have to write a whole separate review to talk about how especially awful of an experience that was. It’s worth mentioning that near the tailend of my time with Tales of the Shire, there was an update that did improve some of the framerate issues slightly, so there’s at least hope that it will run better in the future after some patching up. But even after the most recent update, it still doesn’t run great.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game is the Grima Wormtongue of games: it whispered many wonderful promises into my ear, but by the end I was left a wretched shadow of my former self. I had a lot of hope that this could be the perfect mix of a genre I love and the Tolkien world I’ve spent much of my life nerding out about, but those hopes were cast into the fires from whence they came. With life sim mechanics that are shallow as they come, terrible technical performance, and almost nothing original to say, Tales of the Shire disappoints every step of the way. There’s hints of a better game to be found in its slightly more robust cooking mechanics, as well as the occasionally amusing writing and dialogue that prove this setting was indeed ripe for a life sim if executed better – but like a Silmaril, those dreams have vanished deep in the depths of Angband.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-review]]></content:encoded>
