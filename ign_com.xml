            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">To heck with this guy in particular.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're merrily strolling your way through Hollow Knight: Silksong right now, not a care in the world, you may want to brace yourself. Because aside from Silksong's usual slate of super-tough bosses that'll have you corpse running over and over again, there's one very early miniboss enemy that's causing a lot of players a whole heap of trouble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warning: Very minor spoilers for an early-game miniboss in The Marrow appear below. Don't read on if you don't want to know anything about any of the game's enemies.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The miniboss in question is considered so minor by the game that it doesn't appear with a name on-screen, making it tough to Google a guide when you get stuck on him. But his name is Skarrgard, and he's a bulky red bug enemy wielding a big piece of bone as a weapon. You can find him waiting in a cave on the east side of The Marrow, just above the prison.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Skarrgard seems inocuous when you first approach him, just like a slightly tougher regular enemy. But this guy really has some folks on tilt. He's got three attacks: one where he disappears underground and pops up for an attack, a jump attack, and one where he swings his bone around. He's got some real range on that bone weapon, and because the tunnel is so tiny, most of his moves are very hard, if not impossible, to jump over. What's more, his attacks hit for <em>two whole masks of damage</em> rather than just one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two ways to beat Skarrgard, the easy way and the hard way. The hard way is to keep practicing and eventually defeat him (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/How_to_Defeat_the_Skull_Ant_Miniboss_Early">see our red axe ant mini boss thing strategy guide for exactly how to do beat him early</a>). You can lure him down the narrow tunnel a bit so he can't do his jump attack more, and if you run past him whenever he goes underground, you can sort of bounce him back and forth in the center of the room, taking careful swings, and eventually bring him down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I recommend the easy way, which is to come back later. You'll eventually get a dash ability that makes it <em>much</em> easier to avoid his hits, and it seems like you're meant to have that ability before challenging Skarrgard for real. Even if you're tempted by a juicy reward for killing him early, maybe don't bother? The reward for fighting him is that it unlocks access to a new area, and if you're fighting him early you probably have plenty else to explore that isn't hidden behind a giant, bone-swinging bug man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, good luck with this guy. For many, he's significantly tougher than any of Silksong's early actual bosses, so don't feel discouraged if you die to him a lot before you finally score a win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong is out now, and we're <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong">hard at work on our Wiki guides</a> of everything you might possibly want to know as you start your adventures in Pharloom.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"That tension is hurting a lot of people..."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda Softworks’ former senior vice president of global marketing and communications, Pete Hines, says gaming subscription services like Xbox Game Pass are “worth jack s***” if the game developers who create content for them are not properly supported.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ex-Bethesda figurehead, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesdas-pete-hines-announces-retirement"><u>announced his retirement in 2023 after 24 years with the company</u></a>, opened up about the state of the gaming industry during a new interview with <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DBLTAP</u></a>. In addition to touching on the early days of the company behind Fallout and The Elder Scrolls, Hines spoke about what he feels the future of services like Game Pass looks like.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He admits his retirement from the Microsoft-owned Bethesda means his view on the matter may not be up to date. However, Hines says he witnessed what he “considered to be some short sighted decision making several years ago” that now appears to be “bearing out the way I said.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Subscriptions have become the new four letter word, right? You can't buy a product anymore,” Hines said. “When you talk about a subscription that relies on content, if you don't figure out how to balance the needs of the service and the people running the service with the people who are providing the content – without which your subscription is worth jack s*** – then you have a real problem.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That tension is hurting a lot of people, including the content creators themselves, because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Gamers have discussed the viability of platforms like Game Pass since its launch in 2017. While a service flooded with hundreds of games for subscribers to play sounds like a dream come true for players, how the developers behind these games receive support has been hazy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Game Pass <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-history-subscription-service"><u>pushed forward into the early 2020s</u></a> and PlayStation eventually established its own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-plus-ps-now-spartacus-subscription-tiers-price-ps3-xbox-game-pass-release-date"><u>PlayStation Plus-centered competitor</u></a>, more question marks popped up. Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden is one of many who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-style-subscriptions-bad-for-the-business-and-turn-developers-into-wage-slaves-former-playstation-boss-shawn-layden-says"><u>recently critiqued the gaming subscription service model</u></a>, calling the “’Netflix of gaming’ idea” a “danger” that has him questioning, “…is it healthy for the developer?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft touted that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-revenue-was-nearly-5-billion-for-the-first-time-over-the-last-year"><u>Game Pass achieved $5 billion in revenue over the last year this past July</u></a> after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff"><u>laying off hundreds of workers across its gaming branch earlier that same month</u></a>. Today, Hines adds that the pressure of an ongoing gaming subscription service is affecting the very developers it needs to exist in the first place. It’s a reliance on this model that he feels is “hurting a lot of people.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You need to properly acknowledge, compensate and recognize what it takes to create that content and not just make a game, but make a product,” he elaborated. “That tension is hurting a lot of people, including the content creators themselves, because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two Bethesda studios – Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks – were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda"><u>shut down in May 2024</u></a>, though the latter was eventually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-ip-and-tango-gameworks-acquired-by-krafton-from-xbox-studio-will-no-longer-be-shut-down"><u>saved after PUBG publisher Krafton acquired it from Xbox</u></a>. In the wake of mass layoffs and studio closures, original Arkane founder Raphael Colantonio <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/in-the-wake-of-xbox-layoffs-founder-of-dishonored-and-prey-dev-arkane-slams-game-pass-why-is-no-one-talking-about-the-elephant-in-the-room"><u>called Game Pass</u></a> the “elephant in the room” and an “unsustainable model.” He added, “I don’t think GP can co-exist with other models, they’ll either kill everyone else, or give up.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Some kinds of games...are going to get priced out of existence."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Hollow Knight: Silksong out now, many players are celebrating its unexpectedly low $20 price tag. But some independent developers are pointing out that great as this may be, it could lead to unreasonable expectations for other indie games that can't afford to sell for that low.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a number of threads on social media from developers of games such as Unbeatable, Dorfromantik, and others. In one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rj.dcellgames.com/post/3lxlbk2ldkc2s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky thread</a>, Unbeatable director RJ Lake says that Silksong should cost $40, "and I'm not even joking."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Lake isn't upset at Team Cherry for charging $20 - that's their perogative. But it will have an impact on gaming audiences. As Lake explains:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"millions of people will probably buy silksong on day one, and it was a game that had a very 'low' budget, because the budget is 'these devs worked on it without direct pay for however long they wanted to do that,'" Lake writes. "it had a 'these devs are independently wealthy' budget of 'effectively zero dollars.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"they can price however low they want, as a result. their return on investment is infinite no matter what they do. but by charging such a low amount, they are causing lizard brain signals to fire off saying 'this kind of game is worth twenty dollars. you should expect this game for twenty dollars.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"if enough of those lizard brain signals fire, some kinds of games with actual budgets to pay people who need to live are going to get priced out of existence unless they can get the kind of organic groundswell you can't plan for"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot of other indie devs think Lake might have a point here, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ivanlesan.bsky.social/post/3lxr3siklds2m" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">folks from Deck 13</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/redsquirreltim.bsky.social/post/3lxm4n7ajgk2j" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Squirrel Games</a>. Over on Twitter/X, Basti Games, the developer of Lone Fungus: Melody of Spores, asked the audience how much Lone Fungus should cost given Silksong's $20 price. Basti had originally been planning on making Lone Fungus $20, too. But because it's shorter in length than Silksong, should it be cheaper?</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>As a dev making a smaller Metroidvania than Silksong, which I originally though would be fairly priced at 20 USD... what should I price it now?</p><p>It'll be a 10-15+ hours game, but it was made by one person with limited dev time and funds, I can't afford to give it away for free. <a href="https://t.co/FFcgz6TI1z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/FFcgz6TI1z</a></p></div>— Lone Fungus (@BastiArtGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/BastiArtGames/status/1962412246039953783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately for Basti, the replies overwhelmingly encourage them to price it at $20 if that's what's required. "Dude charge 20$," wrote one fan. "Price is not about the game is about context. They are able to price 20$ for a bigger game because they steem to receive a million times the cost. You are a small company, dude charge 20$ you deserve thst"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another wrote, "10-20 is totally fair imo. Team cherry could have made silksong 40 and still sold hotcakes, the fact they didn't just means they are cool as fuck. Don't hold yourself to standards of giants, or else you'll have to climb a staircase."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, other developers are worried too. In an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-hollow-knight-silksongs-cheap-price-a-problem-for-other-indie-games-devs-and-publishers-weigh-up-its-impact" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer article</a> on the subject, Dorfromantik developer Toukana's co-founder, Zwi Zausch, said that the studio's next game, Star Birds, would have its pricing impacted by Silksong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're trying not to compete too directly with Silksong, both in terms of release date and pricing. Of course, these are two very different games with potentially different player bases, but there's definitely some overlap. That makes things tricky, especially since Star Birds is a joint project between two studios, together employing more people than Team Cherry."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indie game prices has historically been a challenging subject, as teams balance needing to ensure all their members are adequately paid, uncertainty around sales numbers, and the volatility of audiences in deciding not to buy smaller games at prices they perceive as too high. As AAA game prices climb fro $60 to $70 to $80, there has been renewed discussion on where indies should fall - many can't afford to go lower than $20, but many will also lose sales if they don't.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People have less money now and are buying fewer games," says Mike Rose, founder of No More Robots, "so you have to set yourself up to hopefully be that one game they buy when they do have money. And if you are a higher price, it's now actually a bit offputting."</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/indie-developers-are-worried-silksongs-20-price-tag-will-make-it-harder-to-price-their-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of Switch 2's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-a-little-disheartening-the-thing-remastered-dev-says">widely-disliked Game-Key Cards</a> was defended by a Ubisoft developer who worked on the Nintendo port of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Writing on social media, Ubisoft audio architect Rob Bantin shared the real reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Star Wars Outlaws uses a Game-Key Card — a physical cartridge that requires owners still download the game, rather than including the full thing on the cart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer? It's all due to the Switch 2's data speeds, and how quickly the hardware can read information from its bespoke cartridges, versus games downloaded to the console's internal memory. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Star Wars Outlaws game engine] Snowdrop relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments, and we found the Switch 2 cards simply didn't give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for," Bantin <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:l45oa4c3p2ndptazexy33q3z/post/3lxzsvi6s7c2e?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%252Fnews%252Fstar-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-because-of-storage-speed-not-cost-dev-says%252F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The information has come as a surprise to some Nintendo fans who have previously grumbled over the use of Game-Key Cards, which are cheaper and therefore increasingly popular among developers of larger games which would otherwise require more costly cartridges with increased memory capacity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't recall the cost of the cards ever entering the discussion – probably because it was moot," Bantin continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not a comprehensive reason for all developers to use Game-Key Cards, Bantin went on to explain that it was important for Ubisoft and its Snowdrop development team, especially as Outlaws was originally developed for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S — console platforms that had faster SSD memory on board.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think if we'd designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different," Bantin said. "As it was, we'd build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case I think our leadership made the right call."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Nintendo launched a fresh <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-survey-asks-your-openness-to-digital-games-and-offers-a-chance-to-give-feedback-on-switch-2-game-key-cards">fan survey that quizzed Switch 2 owners</a> for their opinions on buying digital games instead of boxed copies, and specifically asked for feedback on Game-Key Cards, following their less-than-stellar initial reception among fans who prefer their physical games to include... well, the full game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First released last year to a mixed response and lackluster sales, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-flopped-because-the-brand-itself-was-in-choppy-waters-ubisoft-ceo-says">blamed <u>Star Wars Outlaws</u> disappointing sales performance on the "choppy waters" of the sci-fi saga's own fandom</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
