But to tide everyone over, today Wizards of the Coast just offered a first look at over a dozen never-before-seen new cards from the set, including Sephiroth, Yuffie, Cecil, Garland, Chaos, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new look includes a number of new cards and a handful of art variations, alongside the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">four commander cards</a> we've already gotten a look at: Tidus, Cloud, Y'shtola, and Terra. In addition to various powerful legendaries like Sephiroth and Cecil, we also get a look at a new Food token art, and art variations on cards such as Stilzkin, Moogle Merchant; Sin, Spira's Punishment; and Summon: Shiva. You can see the full gallery below:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Set First Looks</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's reveal also shows off some special features of the set, including Summons, a part of Magic's first-ever Saga creatures that players can call upon for aid in battle (see Summon: Shiva in the gallery). Additionally, double-faced cards make a return, as seen with Cecil's two sides: Dark Knight and Redeemed Paladin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In total, the Final Fantasy set will feature over 100 legendary creature cards, including 55 legendary borderless cards, some of which are drawn by fan-favorite artists from across Final Fantasy history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering's Final Fantasy set will be a fully draftable, Standard-legal set that will release alongside four preconstructed Commander decks, one themed after each of four Final Fantasy games: 6, 7, 10, and 14. Each deck consists of 100 cards, a mix of both new Final Fantasy cards, as well as existing cards with new Final Fantasy art. The set launches on June 13.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-next-battlefield-spotlights-the-destruction-in-store-for-its-gameplay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Destruction has been a hallmark of Battlefield over the years, and for the next Battlefield game, DICE looks to be amping up the rubble-producing chaos even more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer recently dropped a <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1913249264488296827" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1k27bt3/community_update_battlefield_labs_destruction/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battlefield Labs Community Update</a>, to spotlight what's in store for the next entry in the Battlefield series. In the pre-alpha footage, we can see some of the destruction designed by DICE, as an explosive takes down the side of a building, opening up a new pathway through the structure.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re back with another Battlefield Labs Community Update focused on destruction! Check out an early pre-alpha example of destruction that showcases the ability to destroy a wall to quickly traverse through the building. Read the full article now! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield</a> <a href="https://t.co/bgDcPgZRbg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bgDcPgZRbg</a></p>— Battlefield (@Battlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1913249264488296827?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Destruction can lead to creative solutions for players, and in the Community Update, DICE said it is working to add more gameplay depth by letting players reshape the environment around them. Whether you bring down a wall to launch an ambush or open a new path towards a critical point, sometimes getting those pesky buildings out of your way can help.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're designing destruction around easily identifiable visual and audio language that lets you understand what can be destroyed, altered, or transformed through gameplay," DICE said. "We aim to make destruction an integral part of your Battlefield experience to create an intuitive, fun, and rewarding environment where you feel empowered to shape the world around you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Different impacts will affect structures like walls; while explosions obviously work, bullets will also chip away, so players can shoot through them. Audio VFX cues will let players know that their efforts are working.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The aftermath of all this destruction also leaves tangible effects on the battlefield. Rubble created by destroying a piece of a building, for example, will remain on the field, and could be used as cover. The next Battlefield certainly seems to have destruction on the mind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next Battlefield game, colloquially "Battlefield 6," is slowly taking shape. Not too much has been officially confirmed, though there have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-fans-are-digging-the-leaks-and-ea-hasnt-taken-them-down-yet">some gameplay leaks that have received positive responses</a> from Battlefield fans. It's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">heading to a modern setting</a> for the series and it's expected to arrive sometime in Electronic Arts' fiscal year 2026, or between April 2025 and March 2026. Of course, things could change if <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-boss-willing-to-move-battlefield-release-date-to-account-for-nuanced-year-relative-to-competition-cough-gta-6-cough">certain massive, industry dominating competitors lock in a date</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-puts-criterions-need-for-speed-team-on-battlefield-confirms-no-more-content-coming-to-nfs-unbound">a lot of effort behind this next entry</a>, this new Battlefield seems to be pulling out all the stops. Getting all the level destruction right certainly feels like a step in the right direction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
