            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">10 years ago, Metroid Prime series producer Kensuke Tanabe sat down with me at E3 2015 and said he'd like to make a new game in the franchise with a time travel mechanic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was, obviously, a long time ago — so long ago that the Nintendo Switch was still only known by its codename NX — but the chat remains one of Tanabe's most forthcoming interviews on the Metroid Prime series' future, discussing the stories of Dark Samus and Phazon, bounty hunter Sylux, and an idea for a new Metroid Prime game that focused on a single planet across multiple points in its timeline.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Instead of broadening it to more planets I would have one and would focus on the timeline, and being able to change that," Tanabe said to me, at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-proper-metroid-prime-would-likely-now-be-on-nx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> at the time. "That's one interesting idea I have in mind... but I understand many people thought that [Echoes] was too difficult."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By evoking Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Tanabe is referring to its dual-world gameplay that saw players shift between light and dark versions of the same space — a concept that prompted a mix of reactions from players. Still, the idea of time travel appears to have stuck with Tanabe, who has once again returned as the producer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> — a game which contains other similarities to the concept he discussed back then. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Take the bounty hunter Sylux, for example, a character that even fans of the Metroid Prime trilogy might struggle to remember. A rival of Samus, Sylux was introduced in the Nintendo DS spin-off game Metroid Prime Hunters (for which Tanabe was also a producer). As part of the same interview a decade ago, Tanabe confirmed the spaceship seen during the cliffhanger tease at the end of Metroid Prime 3 belonged to Sylux, potentially setting up a rivalry in a future game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was Sylux, another hunter from Metroid Prime Hunters at the end of Metroid Prime 3," Tanabe said to me at the time. "Personally I'd like to create a story centring around Sylux and Samus."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, roll forward a decade and Sylux is indeed a major presence in Metroid Prime 4 — and last week the character was even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-amiibo-where-to-buy">announced as getting an amiibo figurine</a>, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the idea of a game featuring time travel, fans have long held onto Tanabe's suggestion — and even pointed to the black hole shape seen in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's logo in the hope that it might mean Samus can create some kind of time-dilating space hole to travel into the past or future.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, supposedly leaked box art for the game posted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1njugon/metroid_prime_4_japanese_promotional_case/netbjid/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> appears to mention Samus as being stuck on the game's planet of Viewros after being transported across space and <em>time </em>— prompting more chatter that time travel, just like Sylux, has remained part of Tanabe's plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm assuming it'll work exactly like how Dark Aether works in Prime 2," wrote Metroid fan Spinjitsuninja on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/1jldbti/how_do_we_think_prime_4_could_implement_time/mk2xs16/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, before the supposed box art leaked. "We see several portals in the recent trailer anyways, so unless those are awkward warp points, I think it shows similar world design. They could always have the game take you to different eras, with more than two 'worlds' to go between? But that might be ambitious."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Calling it now: you have to hit a certain speed on the bike to time travel, back to the future style," added another fan, Gleethor on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/metroid-prime-4-beyond-releases-december-4-2025.1295940/page-34#post-145309569" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "Could even see it near instantly changing the landscape around you when you time travel, which could certainly explain why it's relatively sparse."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-has-a-release-date-while-samus-has-a-motorbike">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond trailer finally revealed the game's release date</a> and also showcased a new open-world motorbike for Samus, though the video felt something of a low-key showing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">within the wider Nintendo Direct</a>. Here's hoping we get to see more of the game before its December 7, 2025 release date — if only we could time travel to that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">These are going to sell out fast.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With the build-up to the next <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-october-2025-dates-announced">big Amazon Prime exclusive sale</a> (Prime Big Deal Days, or October Prime Day, as it's better known) well underway, we're already starting to see some notable early discounts that you should <em>absolutely</em> consider snapping up ASAP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That now includes a handful of new Nintendo Switch 2 games down to record low prices at Amazon, including <a href="https://zdcs.link/911rNx?object_uuid=824ca160-3573-4745-a58d-92076ec50881&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Donkey Kong Bananza, down to $53.54</a> (previously $69.99). Other discounted games include Cyberpunk 2077, Mario Kart World, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Breath of the Wild, with the additional discount automatically applied during checkout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's the catch? These are technically sold under <strong>Amazon Resale</strong>. Now hold your eye rolls, as we've seen deals like this before, and these discounts are some of the IGN Deals team's most anticipated offers going into the biggest sale period of the year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of what I'm recommending in the sale is classified as "Used - Like New," essentially what Amazon deems almost brand new, never used, with small damage to the packaging, but not to the contents themselves. So you're not losing anything, or buying a game that looks like it's been recently run over repeatedly. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've also already noted some PlayStation deals at Amazon Resale, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-deal-amazon-resale">PS Portal dropping to around $140</a> (but now sold out), and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-dualsense-edge-controller-deal-amazon-resale">DualSense Edge controller</a>, also down to around $140 right now (also likely to sell out soon). In case you hadn't already realised, the main with kind of deals is stock tends to be extremely limited, so be fast to the trigger if you don't want the disappointment of missing out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of the best ways to buy into some of the most expensive new games available, and find rare discounts where you normally wouldn't (I'm looking at you, Nintendo). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, you still get the 30-day Amazon return policy, so it's still a much safer option than just buying a used game off some random on Facebook Marketplace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, if you're looking for more Switch 2 game deals, we also recently covered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-games-on-sale-at-amazon-including-discounts-on-sonic-and-more">discounts on other games sold by Amazon this week</a> (not resale either), including Split Fiction, Sonic x Shadow Generations, Madden NFL 26, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tencent has hit back at Sony's lawsuit that claimed upcoming game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-of-motiram">Light of Motiram</a> was nothing more than a "slavish clone" of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> — and highlighted concerns within the PlayStation maker that its own game was too similar to Enslaved: Odyssey to the West.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a fresh response to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-is-suing-tencent-over-shameless-horizon-knock-off-game-light-of-motiram">Sony's legal action</a>, Chinese tech giant Tencent branded the lawsuit as an "impermissible" attempt to claim ownership of "well-trodden" tropes — such as a red-headed heroine fighting robot dinosaurs — and a bid by Sony to gain a monopoly over an entire genre. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, Tencent highlighted past comments made by Horizon Zero Dawn developer Jan-Bart Van Beek, where the art director admitted concerns within Guerrilla that its concept was too similar to Ninja Theory's 2013 game Enslaved: Odyssey to the West — another example of a red-headed heroine fighting robot beasts.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a legal filing reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Post</a>, Tencent described Sony's move as an overreach, and highlighted other game franchises with similar elements to Horizon Zero Dawn such as The Legend of Zelda and Far Cry. It was "startling," Tencent said, that Sony was now attempting to claim Horizon's concept was original, rather than an idea based on "ubiquitous genre ingredients."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"By suing over an unreleased project that merely employs the same time-honored tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after Horizon — like Enslaved, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Far Cry: Primal, Far Cry: New Dawn, Outer Wilds, Biomutant, and many more — Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions," Tencent wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony's claim that Horizon was an original PlayStation concept was also "flatly contradicted" by remarks made in a behind-the-scenes documentary by Van Beek, Tencent stated, claiming that Guerrilla had briefly shelved work on Horizon Zero Dawn due to internal concerns it shared too many similarities with Enslaved.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Light of Motiram Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Long before this lawsuit was filed, the developers of Horizon Zero Dawn publicly acknowledged that the very same game elements that, today, Sony claims to own exclusively, were in fact borrowed from an earlier game," Tencent argued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Mr. Van Beek warned, 'I don’t think we should do this; it touches too much of these other points,' referring to prominent elements of Enslaved. Sony shelved the project — only to revive it later with full awareness that the idea was far from novel. When Horizon Zero Dawn finally launched in 2017, the gaming community noted its striking resemblance to Enslaved and other genre staples."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tencent's rebuttal attempts to dismiss other elements of Sony's lawsuit, too, by stating that its work on Light of Motiram was unconnected to a failed pitch meeting with Sony for a Horizon spin-off. Tencent has also claimed that Sony's entire lawsuit is invalid because the company had named the wrong parts of Tencent in its initial complaint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, while attempting to defend itself from Sony's legal action, it is notable that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tencent-quietly-changes-light-of-motirams-steam-page-assets-following-horizon-sony-lawsuit">Tencent has also seemingly made adjustments to the work-in-progress Light of Motiram itself</a>. A glance at the game's Steam page shows it has been scrubbed of screenshots and logos that depicted its redheaded star and those robot dinosaurs. The suggestion here is that Tencent plans to ultimately release Light of Motiram without the elements Sony has deemed most similar to Horizon. It'll be interesting to see how Sony responds to these apparent alterations when it issues its rebuttal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
