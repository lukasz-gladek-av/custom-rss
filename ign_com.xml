That’s because within it hides the blueprints for “Liberty Prime Alpha” — a name that will excite you if you’ve played the Fallout games, but may confuse you if you haven’t. Rest assured, though, because we’re here to tell you exactly why you <em>should </em>be eagerly anticipating its apparent arrival in Fallout’s third season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To cut to the chase, Liberty Prime is a giant robot originally built by the United States Army in the years before the Great War that turned America into the wasteland it is today. A 40-foot-tall metal monster packed with extreme power, including highly destructive head-mounted energy cannons and a seemingly endless supply of throwable explosives, it's quite the weapon of mass destruction. Think the Iron Giant, but nowhere near as friendly.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/03/fo4-liberty-prime-concept-art-1770135733764.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Liberty Prime concept art from The Art of Fallout 4 book.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Initially conceived in 2072 and planned for deployment against the communist forces of China in Alaska, Liberty Prime never actually made it into battle, despite being fully constructed, as a sufficient power source was never obtained. That doesn’t mean it would never see any action, though, as this colossus appears in both Fallout 3 and Fallout 4. Let’s take a look at what it got up to in those games, as well as theorise a little about how it could be deployed in season three of the show.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fallout 3</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Liberty Prime would sit dormant for many, many years after the bombs dropped, until it was rediscovered in 2255 amongst the ruins of Washington, D.C., the setting of Fallout 3. For over 20 years, the Brotherhood of Steel worked away on restoring the war machine with mixed results, until its eventual revival in 2277. Its first taste of action would come in a battle against the Enclave, where it destroyed many of the shadowy faction’s forces as the Brotherhood laid claim to the fallen capital’s Jefferson Memorial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Brotherhood would repeat this tactic for another couple of weeks, with Liberty Prime too strong a foe for the Enclave to handle. But soon this tactic would prove predictable, and the giant robot would eventually be lured into a trap that would see orbital weapons descend upon it. Following its destruction, the Brotherhood attempted to rebuild it, but to no avail. Instead, its shattered remains would be left to rust deep in storage until the next person was bold enough to build it again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fallout 4</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A decade later, in 2287, someone would try to do exactly that. This time, a chapter of the Brotherhood headquartered in Boston decided that it needed the power of the walking superweapon to turn the tide in its battle for the Commonwealth. This effort would take many years to come to fruition, as Liberty Prime’s components had to be airlifted along America’s East Coast and pieced together in Massachusetts. Such a mammoth effort was required to combat the newly risen synth threat — an AI lifeform created by the scientific faction called the Institute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A newly improved Liberty Prime MK II, packed with a laser capable of carving tunnels down into the earth and the ability to deploy mini nukes,  then took to the streets of Boston. Depending on your actions at the end of Fallout 4, Liberty Prime can either be destroyed again or live to fight another day as it roams the Commonwealth in the service of the Brotherhood.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fallout: Season Three</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So, this brings up the curious case of how Liberty Prime will be deployed in the Fallout TV show. Set in 2296, nine years after Fallout 4, the show could directly tie into the events of the Brotherhood’s Boston bust-up by having Elder Quintus claim components for Liberty Prime from the Commonwealth. However, considering his civil war antics and the death of Paladin Harkness, it seems unlikely his Boston brothers will consider Quintus an ally anymore. It’s also worth considering that the blueprints are for “Liberty Prime Alpha”, which is presumably a model that pre-dates the MK II version deployed in Boston, and perhaps even the original robot created for the Alaskan front. It seems possible that we’ll be seeing a brand new version of the iconic robot, designed especially for the show.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Declaring himself “Quintus the Destroyer”, it seems like the Knights of San Fernando chapter will be on a nuclear warpath next season. But who will be in his crosshairs? Will his mission be to wipe out the other chapters, or will the violence see The Brotherhood put on a collision course with the New California Republic?. Will season three’s apparent Colorado location be the backdrop for their war? The potential imagery of a looming Liberty Prime walking a warpath towards Denver could well be on the horizon. A mile-high robot in the mile-high city? We wouldn’t say no.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you think we’ll see a fully rebuilt Liberty Prime in Fallout season three? Or do you think the showrunners have different plans for The Brotherhood’s iconic massive robot?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Within the first three missions of Menace, I am talking to my squads of snappy space marines as if they are action figures on my bedroom floor. "Fan out and move up. Good shooting! That was clean, girl." My roommates are probably used to me talking to myself when I'm playing video games at this point, but it speaks to how engrossed I got in this turn-based interplanetary war that I was already developing that kind of relationship with it. There's a lot still missing from the Early Access release. But the tactical, bug-blasting fun is already dialed in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably the biggest way in which it's obvious that this is an Early Access game is the overall lack of context. I know that I'm a Major on a military ship that suffered some kind of FTL drive accident that destroyed many systems and most of the crew, leaving me as the senior commanding officer. I know that we've wound up in an area of space called the Wayback that is home to a handful of interesting, competing human factions and also a species of giant alien bugs. It's not all that difficult to get a grasp of the basics.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Menace screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But I'm not actually sure why we're here, what the original mission was, what kind of faction we're representing, or what the Wayback even is. Why is it called that? How long have these other humans been here? There are references to some kind of in-game lore encyclopedia, but it doesn't seem to have been implemented yet. At the end of the day, none of this really gets in the way of my ability to shoot at things. But it does make the early game feel a bit aimless, and I find the setting interesting enough that I'd like to know more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not like Menace completely doesn't care about story, either. There is clearly something brewing here, as unfinished as it is, with tension between the Wayback factions and the marines playing out in voice-acted cutscenes every few operations. It's just unclear where it's going or what I'm ultimately building up to other than harder missions, better gear, and upgrading my ship. In about 35 hours, I didn't run into anything that seemed especially like the main plot. There is a steady escalation of stakes and difficulty, though, which at least does a good job of helping me feel like I'm not just spinning my wheels.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hit the Ground Running</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As a squad-based tactics game, man, I really like Menace. The pacing and action economy are so cleverly crafted to encourage you to play in more active and interesting ways. You can't just set everyone on ov erwatch and creep forward, for example, which is a rut I tend to fall into in similar games. There aren't a lot of passive or reactive abilities, so victory comes from making proactive choices. Moving up the field requires thinking about who still has turns left to spend, and how you can make sure your advance elements have adequate support if they run into trouble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Suppression is a huge deal, at least when fighting other humans, and this adds a feeling of authenticity to  every firefight. In actual warfare, they say hundreds of rounds get fired for every one that hits a target, and that's exactly how Menace works. It's often far more important to keep every enemy in line-of-sight pinned down than it is to inflict casualti es. That gives your second wave safety and freedom of movement to either charge in or flank and win the fight, and this creates a constantly engaging tactical loop. Your own squads who get suppressed will have their action points and accuracy penalized, but will also hunker down or hit the deck intelligently depending on the amount of heat they're under, further making them feel like real soldiers.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">This blends nicely with the fact that every squad is led by a named character you can recruit, level up, and customize. They all have distinct personalities and backstories along with a unique ability that defines them. There's sort of an over-the-top Jagged Alliance vibe, though a bit less goofy. Jacques, a private security contractor I hired from the Wayback, can regain action points when he's under heavy fire, so he thrives at the tip of the spear. Marta begins every mission with a major debuff that turns into a strong buff the more turns that pass, making her a clutch asset for closing out a long mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And unlike in, say, XCOM, these flagship characters only die if their entire squad is wiped out and you can't get anyone over to them to render medical aid, so it doesn't feel like playing a little bit risky will rob you of your beloved blorbos. On the othe=r hand, accompanying each of them (excluding vehicle drivers, which are their own thing) are up to eight renameable squadmates with no dialogue or special abilities. And these guys are… kind of expendable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Manpower is a limited resource you have to manage on the strategic level, so you can't just go throwing background extras into the meat grinder all the time. But especially as you get more advanced medical facilities online that can rehabilitate casualties, the grunts kind of become a wager you can afford to risk by making aggressive plays. And this is such a clever way of getting me to command more actively and break out of my usual, turtle playstyle.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Alien Menace</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Encountering the alien bugs changes things up quite a bit. They're much harder to suppress, though heavy losses can force them to flee. And especially later on, some of them are so heavily-armored that your standard assault rifles are all but useless. They don't really take cover, and a lot of them only have melee attacks. But simply holding your ground and grinding them down at range isn't always an option. Having to switch up my gear and my thinking depending on what I was fighting, in addition to the wide variety of mission types, made me come up with new tactics constantly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Squad customization is also deep and satisfying. There is no standard currency in the Wayback, so all gear is either a mission reward or purchased using the barter system on the black market. But even once you do build up enough scrap bombs and alien guts to trade for the best stuff available, there's a supply budget on each mission that takes into account every piece of equipment and keeps you from simply buying your way to victory. I think this  could use some tuning, since it currently feels like the missions are getting harder a bit faster than my supply budget is increasing. It's almost there. Maybe just a nudge is all it needs.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Favorite Turn-Based Tactics Games</h3><p>Some of my favorite turn-based tactics games, in no particular order.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/LeanaVanadis/lists/lens-favorite-turn-based-tactics-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems like a lot of thought has gone into the various veterancy upgrades squads can earn from promotions, as well. They're pretty well-balanced, feeling powerful enough to be meaningful but not so game-changing as to trivialize combat on their own, like increasing evasion based on how many tiles you moved. Each has a clear role in mind, and almost none feel like they wouldn't be at least situationally useful. It's an area of progression where I can really tell developer Overhype Studios has a strong footing in what works and what doesn't about this genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The strategic layer is not quite as well-developed yet. There are a few different things you can buy with the components gained from completing each multi-mission operation. You have ship upgrades like the med bay and the recruiting office for managing manpower, along with armaments that can be deployed from orbit a limited number of times per mission. Then you have loyalty tracks with each of the three major Wayback factions that can unlock their unique buildings, which can do things like give you an extra chance at post-mission loot or allow you to call in supplies in the middle of a mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They can be neat, but still feel a bit limited in both scope and depth. It's a good first iteration, but this is for sure somewhere I'd like to see more love  given to over the course of Early Access. There are also only three planets so far, which can start to feel a little samey after a while. More are in the works. Technical bugs have been relatively sparse, though my main file is afflicted by a fairly annoying one right now where my manpower counter seems to be permanently broken.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Menace is off to more than a running start already. The turn-based tactical action is some of the best I've played lately, and I love the distinct, voiced squad leaders, as well as both the variety of missions and enemy factions. The biggest missing piece is really story and context. It's hard to get too invested in what's going on in the Wayback when I'm not even really sure why we're here yet. But for Early Access, this is a truly impressive effort, and there's plenty of fun to be had already.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/menace-early-access-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players aren't happy after EA and Battlefield Studios' changes to two of its most controversial cosmetics failed to live up to expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-to-alter-2-controversial-cosmetics-after-fans-accuse-ea-of-ai-generated-content-and-call-of-duty-ghosts-inspiration"><u>promises to address fan feedback</u></a> last week, the Battlefield community was quick to see how update 1.1.3.6 adjusted the Objective Ace skin and Winter Warning sticker when the patch went live this morning. The problem is the changes are almost too small to notice.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— DETONATED (@DETONATEDcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/DETONATEDcom/status/2018712937670627367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s first take a look at Objective Ace. The skin drew criticism through Season 1 when players noticed it bore a striking resemblance to the Call of Duty: Ghosts logo, with both sharing even a few finer details, such as cracks and paint streaks. The Assault skin also caught flak related to the large white armor piece located on its chest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The updated version of the cosmetic received the more noticeable facelift of the two impacted, with its updated look now featuring new details and a slimmer design overall. Still, it’s not enough for the players who were expecting more significant changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“[I] think the damage has already been done,” one <a href="https://x.com/BABYBLUBERRYZ/status/2018723941251256755?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player commented</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Why did they copy COD in the first place?” <a href="https://x.com/Negan259/status/2018713351526748283?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another added</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">AI Sticker Before VS After Patch <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a> <a href="https://t.co/Srfjhp7ZHj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Srfjhp7ZHj</a></p>— Battlefield Intel (@BattlefieldInte) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldInte/status/2018666389972902043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Winter Warning sticker, on the other hand, was the center of controversy when players noticed details that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-fans-accuse-ea-of-selling-ai-generated-image-after-spotting-what-looks-like-an-m4a1-with-two-barrels"><u>suggested it may have been created using generative AI</u></a>. Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.6 seems to have brought no change to its design, with its soldier finger placement and double-barreled M4A1 still plainly in view despite being two of the bigger talking points amongst fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been cause for concern for those who feel EA and BF Studios may have misled fans. However, the developers have since <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2018746377569013844?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stepped in</a> to say the timing relayed in last week’s patch notes, which promised to adjust Winter Warning with the February 3 update, was “incorrect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The latest update notes communicated that a change would be made for the Winter Warning Player Card Sticker to bring it more in line with Battlefield’s visual identity,” a message shared today says. “This timing was incorrect. Winter Warning will be updated when Season 2 launches on February 17th.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear what the new version of the sticker will look like when it launches with Season 2 in about two weeks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The CEO of Take-Two Interactive has denied ongoing rumors that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be a digital-only release upon its initial launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Variety, which spoke to CEO Strauss Zelnick today ahead of the company's Q3 2026 earnings release. When asked if subsidiary Rockstar would delay the release of physical copies of GTA 6 until 2027 to avoid leaks, he replied, "That's not the plan."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors of such a physical delay <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/grand-theft-auto-6-may-not-have-a-physical-version-on-day-one-to-avoid-leaks-report-claims/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emerged late last month</a>, when an alleged insider industry source shared that Take-Two had no plans for a physical edition of the game at release due to concerns about physical copies falling into hands early and leaking online.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, the report suggests that physical copies could be delayed into 2027, or delayed just a few weeks, which would make Zelnick's answer somewhat unclear. IGN reached out to Take-Two to get more clarity on what his statement meant, and was informed that Zelnick's statement was denying any delay plan at all, not just a move to 2027 specifically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is still set for release on November 18, 2026, a date that Zelnick <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-marketing-will-kick-off-this-summer-as-take-two-confidently-reaffirms-november-release-date">reaffirmed confidently to us today</a>, alongside plans for Rockstar to spin up its marketing machine this summer.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-marketing-will-kick-off-this-summer-as-take-two-confidently-reaffirms-november-release-date</link>
            <guid>1424707</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto VI's November 19, 2026 release date is drawing nearer. And while the game has now suffered multiple delays, Take-Two Interactive is starting to sound more confident than we've ever heard them that this time, it's really happening. So confident, in fact, it's announced that Rockstar will be spinning up its marketing beats this summer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Take-Two's Q3 2026 earnings results, which were just released. In those earnings, Take-Two reaffirms that GTA 6 is indeed still planned for November 19, 2026. That on its own would be exciting news after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">two</a> separate <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">delays</a>, but even better is a sentence at the bottom of the release sent to IGN. "Our execution throughout Fiscal 2026 has been extraordinary and we are highly confident as we approach Fiscal 2027 – which promises to be groundbreaking for Take-Two and the entire entertainment industry – led by the November 19th release of Grand Theft Auto VI with Rockstar’s launch marketing set to begin this Summer. "</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's sounding pretty confident, to me! Speaking to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick earlier today, I asked him how he felt about the release date at this time, to which he replied, "I feel good about it. Very good about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we've asked Zelnick this before, and he said he felt "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">really good</a>" about the fall 2025 release date that was originally announced, ahead of two delays. So I asked him if this time was different in some way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course," he said. "Because any time you're getting closer to marketing beats, you're obviously in a place where your confidence level is as high as it can be."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 is one of the most anticipated games of all time, with many already suggesting it as a potential Game of the Year contender despite us not having seen any gameplay footage of it yet, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/increasingly-convincing-ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-getting-millions-of-views-on-social-media">leaks and AI fakes</a> going viral all over social media late last year, and its delays having <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-the-gta-6-delay-also-delay-next-gen-consoles">potential industry-shaking impacts</a>. So far, we've seen two cinematic trailers for the game, which have shown the dual protagonists Duval and Lucia Caminos, and the setting of Leonida, Florida, including the infamous Vice City.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even without GTA 6, GTA as a franchise had a great quarter. It "vastly outpaced" Take-Two's forecasts, with GTA+ membership levels nearly doubling year-over-year. We asked Zelnick for insight as to the cause of GTA 5's excellent quarter, and he pointed to the Safehouse in the Hills update for GTA Online doing especially well. GTA 5 has now sold over 225 million units.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, Take-Two brought in net bookings of $1.76 billion for the quarter. The company is raising its expectations in light of a better-than-expected quarter on multiple fronts, with total annual net bookings expected to range between $6.65 billion to $6.7 billion, representing around 18% growth year over year. Take-Two expects that nearly half of its full-year earnings, which it will report next quarter, will come from its mobile business, Zynga.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

In IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws review</a>, we called it "a fun intergalactic heist adventure with great exploration" despite overly simplified stealth and repetitive combat.
