            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> players are up in arms after first information about Season 1 revealed what they believe is an out of place soldier skin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have waited weeks for a first look at Season 1 and its new maps, modes, and guns. However, after EA and Battlefield Studios finally pulled back the curtain with a trailer yesterday, the only thing on the community’s mind was a question: could this be the beginning of the end?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New Battlefield 6 maps like Blackwell Fields and Eastwood certainly served as meaningful attention grabbers, but it’s just one skin that has completely controlled the conversation. The cosmetic in question is Wicked Grin, a new skin for the Assault Class. A sneak peek at the suit arrived via various Battlefield 6 Season 1 previews that hit the web yesterday, revealing a wardrobe that fans feel ranges from grounded to gaudy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6s-first-batch-of-soldier-skins-is-more-tactical-than-tacti-cool-but-if-you-thought-that-one-green-skin-was-a-step-too-far-i-dont-know-what-to-tell-you/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PC Gamer</u></a> was one of a few sites to share an image of the skin, which features dark blue highlights from head to toe. It’s Class operator also sports a toothy smile painted across their bandana. It’s been more than enough to set off alarm bells among the Battlefield 6 community, especially considering the Wicked Grin skin description teases that it can be “unlocked as a free store gift.” It suggests Assault players could flood lobbies with those standout blues as soon as next week, potentially bringing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youre-too-good-for-camo-battlefield-6-players-cant-help-but-poke-fun-at-absurd-orange-recon-skin">fans' fear of goofy skins</a> into reality. Even if this or any of the other Season 1 skins remain a far cry from the dozens of celebrity, superhero, and cartoon character crossovers present in other popular shooters <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-paying-attention-to-community-feedback-on-goofy-skins">like Call of Duty</a> and Fortnite, tens of thousands of fans are clearly unhappy with what they’re seeing so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, weren't we supposed to have realistic skins for some time?” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/grounded_skins_for_a_while_18_days_exactly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>popular comment from a fan</u></a> says. “Something that someone would really wear during a war? Yet it seems that with the start of Season 1, everything will turn to colorful mess, with no way of differentiating teams based on uniforms, the game will look more like a Paintball or [ActionSportGames] event.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will not revive anyone wearing this kind of skin. My take,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/comment/nkt70ol/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user says</u></a>. “I’m gonna miss the days when everyone has default and beta skins,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/comment/nkt5341/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user adds</u></a>. “I’m afraid this game won't be recognizable in the future.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and BF Studios have never set a hard rule describing what exactly their version of a grounded Battlefield 6 looks like. Still, the Season 1 skin is being perceived as a breach of trust after the community had been told to expect grounded visuals across the board for at least a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are a gritty, grounded, realistic shooter,” Ripple Effect and BF Studios technical director Christian Buhl <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042"><u>told IGN</u></a> last month. “That's what we intend to be, and that's what the game is going to look like for a while.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many admit that there is still much ground to cover before Battlefield 6 stops looking like the grounded military shooter that it currently is and starts introducing some of the more outrageous characters seen in other games. There's also the fact that there are, of course, many other more grounded outfits both in the Battlefield 6 base game and coming in Season 1. As for what we’ve seen from Season 1 so far, though, fans are now more on edge than ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Is it realistic? No,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/comment/nkt5oeo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>community comment adds</u></a>. “Is it more grounded then Beavis and Butt-Head, Peter Griffin, Sgt. PsPsPs, Wubz, Feelin Sloothy, the list goes on... I would say yes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you want to use regular, realistic outfits, there are plenty," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/comment/nktdcmc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">someone else says</a>. "If someone wants to wear one with a bit of colour, they can. It’s a video game, not real war."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Time will tell if Battlefield 6 will push past the Wicked Grin skin seen with Season 1.

Microsoft tried to make the jump to $80 video games, but ended up reverting to $70 after fans pushed back on the idea of paying $10 more for Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds 2.

Over the past six years, Xbox has hit 10-20%. To put that 30% target into more context, Sony's PlayStation division achieved a 16% profit margin in Q1 FY25. Bloomberg said Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood enforced the new target in fall 2023 — amid Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot now is, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, that games that are cheap to make or considered more likely to make lots of money may take priority over riskier projects.
