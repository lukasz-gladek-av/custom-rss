If you have some trips planned for the months ahead, these are sure to keep you entertained on any long journeys.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The seven games in this bundle (which you can see in full below) have a total value of $129, but through the bundle you can get them all for as low as $12. That's a sweet offer to jump on, though keep in mind it's only live for 15 more days. If the selection has caught your eye, now is the time to grab it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Humble Bundle Decked Out Collection</h2><div catalogid="93180f0a-22a4-4a22-b0e7-957474cf89dc" id="234389"><div id="234389" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Decked Out Collection</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>$5 gets you two games, $12 gets you seven games.</p></div></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ultrakill">ULTRAKILL</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/haste">Haste</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/creatures-of-ava">Creatures of Ava</a></li><li>Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands</li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/backpack-hero">Backpack Hero</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nidhogg-2">Nidhogg 2</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned before, paying as low as $12 will set you up with all of the games above. However, you can also pay just $5 for Vampire Survivors and Nidhogg 2, if you're not looking to splash out on multiple games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you decide to pay a little more than the $12, your money is actually divided up between publishers, Humble, and a charity, which is American Cancer Society through this bundle. That's a nice little bonus on top of the games, if you're able to give a bit extra.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of this bundle, there's plenty more to check out right now on Humble Bundle. If you're on the lookout for even more PC games to add to your library, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/humble-choice-january-2026">January’s Humble Choice lineup</a> is live. With a Humble Choice membership, which costs $14.99 per month, you can take advantage of this month's selection which features a great variety of games, including Sonic Frontiers, Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered, and six other titles. What better way to keep busy over the winter months, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 13, 2026 5:54 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/humble-decked-out-collection-steam-deck-game-bundle]]></content:encoded>
