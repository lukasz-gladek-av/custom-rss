The bulk of this won't come until after the game's launch, though buying it now will unlock extra costume items immediately.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can already pre-load Pokémon Legends: Z-A now via the Nintendo eShop, including the game's day one update.

Indeed, IGN has seen word of some of the all-new Mega Pokémon included in the game — though we won't spoil them here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in Kalos, home of the Mega Pokémon mechanic, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-new-mega-pokmon-announced-for-pokmon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A adds the first new batch of superpowered creatures to the franchise's Mega Pokédex in over a decade</a>, although no all-new Pokémon species are expected. To date, The Pokémon Company has revealed just a handful of the new Mega Pokémon expected to make up the game's final roster of fresh Mega species. How many will feature in the final game? You'll just have to play and find out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon Legends: Z-A – September 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As with other Nintendo game launches, digital copies of Pokémon Legends: Z-A are expected to unlock within your local region as soon as it hits 12am (midnight) on Thursday, October 16. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in the U.S., previous Nintendo game launches have treated the whole country as a singular region, meaning those in timezones behind Eastern (i.e. Central, Mountain and Pacific time) all get to play late on Wednesday, October 15.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Legends: Z-A global release times:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Wednesday, October 15, 2025</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>PDT (San Francisco):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>9pm</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>CST (Mexico City):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>11pm</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Thursday, October 16, 2025</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>EDT (New York):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12am midnight</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>BRT (Sao Paulo):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12am midnight</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>BST (London):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12am midnight</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>CEST (Paris, Rome, Berlin):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12am midnight</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>EEST (Turkey):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12am midnight</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>UTC (New Delhi):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12am midnight</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ICT (Hanoi):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12am midnight</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>HKT (Hong Kong):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12am midnight</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>CST (Beijing):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12am midnight</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JST (Tokyo):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12am midnight</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AEST (Sydney):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>12am midnight</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Ready to get started?
