            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatched by the crown as part of a secret expedition to a remote island part of the realm, you're ready for a life of adventure. But in third-person RPG Of Ash and Steel you're not one of the highly-trained, well-armored holy knights trying to enforce the will of the king… you're the clever orphan-turned-cartographer along for the ride because the maps of the island, Grayshaft, are pretty bad. Perhaps they're bad because the island suffers periodic volcanic eruptions so devastating that it's blanketed in deadly ash that cakes inside your lungs and kills you, eruptions so awful that ships avoid the island for the entire year when one seems imminent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is obviously why brave cartographer Tristan has agreed to go there. And so like many fantasy protagonists, Tristan will soon be in way over his head—all because he wanted a bit of adventure—when the holy knights are all dead and he's the only one left to deliver the urgent missive. At least, that's what a hands-on preview with a beta build tutorial and first few hours of Ash and Steel told me.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Of Ash &amp; Steel - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of Ash and Steel looks like a pretty traditional RPG, reminiscent of classics from the 2000s. It's unapologetic about not giving you quest markers or anything but in-world directions, but at the same time it does highlight loot on the ground or chests you can interact with when you're near them. It's somewhere between Gothic and the first Witcher game, in its own way, with a nod toward the survival-centric games of the last decade or so. While it doesn't go all-in on survival and encumbrance, Ash and Steel still has something of the 2019 RPG Outward in it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's unapologetic about not giving you quest markers or anything but in-world directions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More than anything, Of Ash and Steel feels like a game in the legacy of dearly departed mid-tier RPG studio Piranha Bytes, creators of the Gothic, Risen, and Elex series. That includes the signature campy acting mixed in with some decent drama, as well as plenty of oddball and unexpected humor. (One early quest has you finding the soiled trousers of a man who, when drunk, just craps himself and leaves the pants right there to clean up later.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps its most old-school feature is how it has no level scaling in its world—creatures are a fixed level in a fixed location, forever. You're warned early on that going off the path can be dangerous, and each new enemy encounter is often a question of getting close enough to see if it massively out-levels you before you decide to try and take it on or not—and hope for good loot when you do. Coupled with that lethal-but-rewarding exploration is the rudiments of a survival system, where staying fed and watered is a must to survive, and setting up shop at pre-determined campsites lets Tristan rest and cook to regain hit points and pick up buffs. It also passes time, which is useful in a world where the NPCs and monsters follow a schedule of their own as to when and where they appear, or even when they're taking a nap and won't talk to you about your very urgent quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tristan has three skill trees, and perhaps the most pressing one is Combat. Investing in combat skills lets you pick up to three different stances to fight from, each of which looks to have different effects based on what kind of weapons you're wielding—there were axes, swords, clubs, daggers, and a crossbow. Sadly, poor starter Tristan wasn't strong or competent enough to wield most of them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is a big part of what I think the story developer Fire Frost is telling with Of Ash and Steel. This isn't a fantasy hero game where your character starts as competent at any useful skills relevant to his current situation. It's going to be a zero-to-hero story, with other characters in the world reacting to Tristan as he grows stronger. "If at the beginning of the game you were treated like a ragamuffin," said Fire Frost, "by the end of the game the characters will literally bow to your feet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a hint of that in action during the preview play, as characters who previously saw Tristan dressed only in threadbare clothing later had complimentary things to say about a suit of basic armor I'd purchased. Where before they'd just asked: "Are you really wearing <em>that?"</em> they later said, "Ah, I had a sturdy suit like that when I was younger."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And a sturdy suit of armor is much needed, because the fighting can get pretty brutal. Armor will help you survive a few hits, but the stamina-based combat was really based around perfectly timed dodges and parries. Tristan's attacks, at least at the start of the game, are slow and clumsy—he's literally never fought before. As he got combat skills, though, he moved more confidently and picked up the ability to parry in a way that opened up enemies for counterattacks. That blended well with a fast knife, which let him get in those hits before quickly going back on his guard. Still, there's some tweaking to do on the early stages of the fighting—some people will definitely bounce right off of how clumsy Tristan was, or just won't be familiar with the time-honored strategy of "train the difficult enemy into a nearby powerful NPC."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A sturdy suit of armor is much needed, because the fighting can get pretty brutal.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of trying to survive, that's the focus of Tristan's other two skill trees: Survival and Crafting. They're much more down-to-earth, practical skillsets simply due to their nature. Survival lets you keep yourself fed and alive, while Crafting lets you upgrade and upkeep your equipment. Crafting also does one very important job: Makes you money. Quests and other odd jobs are a great source of experience and cash, sure, but paying people to train Tristan in all these new skills ain't cheap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was cool is that investments of money and skill points into the Craft and Survival trees actually did pay off in combat. A good craftsman can better sharpen their weapon for bonus damage, or reinforce their armor for extra defense. Survivalists, meanwhile, could pick up nasty tricks like thrown daggers and the use of poisons on their weapons—though poor preview Tristan was a bit too intellectually dull and low-level to get to try those skills out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with all the advantages of level and time, however, Of Ash and Steel is definitely going to be a game where you get your butt kicked. A lot. Quicksave, I expect, is Tristan's greatest friend in the world. Enemies hit hard, and enemies that are higher level than you hit extremely hard—or even so fast that poor low-level Tristan simply stood no chance of reacting in time, let alone getting a single attack in. As a result, he got splatted by a lot of things. He got mauled by a giant rat-thing. Trampled by a big bug. Eaten by a lizard-thing. Dismembered by all manner of bandits, both living and apparently undead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the only dang reason Tristan didn't get splatted by this giant troll is because when everything can splat you, well, you get pretty good pretty fast at running and climbing your way out of danger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some people might find that kind of thing frustrating, Of Ash and Steel was pretty nice on that count. The action-RPG combat was somehow clunkier than a FromSoftware game but settled into its own rhythm after a while, and hopefully gets more and more fluid with more skills and abilities in the full game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't expect miracles from Of Ash and Steel, but the preview was evidence of a promising mid-tier RPG that'll likely enthuse ye olde genre purists while still being accessible and interesting enough to draw in lovers of more modern character-driven action.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/of-ash-and-steel-is-an-old-school-rpg-with-on-the-job-training-for-fantasy-adventurers]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-are-there-no-good-superman-games.1242192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman may be widely regarded as one of the greatest pop culture icons of all time, but there’s one area where even the Man of Steel has struggled to fly. Why, after all these years, aren’t there any good Superman video games? Where is Superman’s answer to Rocksteady Studios' Batman Arkham series or Insomniac’s Spider-Man games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With James Gunn’s Superman movie putting Kal-El back in the spotlight, let’s take a step back to explore Superman’s incredibly rocky gaming history, and why there still hasn’t been a great Superman game after all this time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">DC Universe: Every Upcoming Movie and TV Show</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman’s Ugly Gaming History</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, the problem with properly depicting Superman in games isn’t so different from movies or TV or even the comics. He’s an incredibly powerful character. Some would argue that he’s overpowered. When a guy has this level of strength, speed, and invulnerability, not to mention all the other handy powers like flight and heat vision, it’s hard to paint him as the underdog. How do you build a game around a guy who’s basically all-powerful and still create challenges for the player to overcome? </p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Problem With Superman’s Powers</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/maxresdefault-1752260901743.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Some Superman games have made the mistake of weakening Superman or walling off his powers. That problem dates all the way back to the very first Superman game, 1978’s Superman for the Atari 2600. Like a lot of licensed games on that system, you’d have to squint to even recognize the source material in those blocky, primitive graphics. But that’s not the core issue with the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman tasked players with repairing Lex Luthor’s damage to Metropolis and capturing the villain and his henchmen in as short a time as possible. Exposure to Kryptonite would cause Superman to lose his powers, with the only cure being a kiss from Lois Lane. Not the most auspicious start for the Man of Steel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The NES game is the perfect example of this frustrating trend. Similar to contemporaries like Castlevania II: Simon’s Quest and The Legend of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, the NES Superman featured a top-down overworld map that transitioned into various side-scrolling action levels. However, the game committed the same sin as many superhero games of the time by locking Superman’s various powers behind limited-use special meters. That, combined with a generally obtuse and punishing difficulty level, ensured the NES Superman was never much fun to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When your flight, heat vision, X-ray vision, and other powers are tied to rapidly depleting special meters, you don’t really get the sensation you’re playing as Superman. It’s not as if he normally has to ration his powers in the comics and films. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Superman’s Generic ‘90s Phase</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The late ‘80s and early ‘90s saw a handful of new Superman games released, including the 1988 Superman arcade game from Taito and the 1992 Sega Genesis side-scroller. These games weren’t as egregious as their predecessors about walling off Superman’s powers. The problem during this period was more that Superman was relegated to generic side-scrollers and beat-em-up titles - the same fare gamers were being inundated with across the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most notable release in this crop is 1994’s The Death and Return of Superman. Based on the popular comic book crossover, that game cast players as both Superman and his replacements from the comics like The Eradicator and Steel. It was basically DC’s answer to Spider-Man: Maximum Carnage, coming in an era when the prevailing wisdom for superhero games was “when in doubt, make an arcade-style brawler.” Fine for keeping Superman in the public consciousness, but not for forging games that truly take advantage of his vast powerset. It’s tough to truly feel like a Man of Steel when you’re just moving left to right and punching endless waves of generic enemies.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Infamous Superman 64</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/11/superman64-1649369538183-1752260801225.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman’s gaming fortunes seemed to be on a slow upswing in the ‘90s, only for the franchise to reach its nadir with 1999’s Superman: The New Adventures. Or as we all know it, Superman 64. Put simply, Superman 64 is still widely regarded as one of the worst games ever made, with clunky flying controls, frustrating difficulty, and more bugs than even Superman’s heat vision could hope to melt. It’s not exactly a looker, either. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman 64 highlights the issue that no game has really nailed the art of controlling Superman in flight in a 3D environment. Superman 64 forced players to steer a clunky Man of Steel through an endless series of rings and obstacle courses in a fog-covered Metropolis. Much later, Superman Returns would emerge with a somewhat better and more intuitive system of flight control, but the lack of Superman games since means no one has iterated on that design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, the franchise did bounce back a bit with the release of 2002’s Superman: Shadow of Apokolips on the PS2 and Gamecube. Compared to Superman 64, that game did a much better job of capturing the look and feel of the animated series. That said, the gameplay never matched up to the production values. If this is generally considered to be the best Superman game of all time, that’s still damning it with faint praise.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Superman the Protector</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the more modern games have veered in a different direction by making Superman himself invulnerable but centering gameplay on rescuing civilians and protecting Metropolis. In some ways, that feels like a step in the right direction. The key to understanding Superman is realizing that, as powerful as he is, he can’t save everybody. He does have limits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, the Xbox got its own Superman game in 2002 courtesy of Infogrames in the form of Superman: The Man of Steel. Based on the comics rather than the animated series or movies, this game pitted Supes against Brainiac. While the game succeeded in giving players control of a wide variety of super-powers, the lousy controls and emphasis on protection missions served as a one-two punch of doom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s 2006’s Superman Returns, a game with interesting ideas but subpar execution. The game featured most of the cast from the film reprising their roles, along with other iconic Superman villains like Bizarro and Metallo for good measure. To its credit, the game didn’t put many limits on Superman’s abilities as it introduced an open-world version of Metropolis. In fact, the Man of Steel himself was effectively invulnerable, with Metropolis itself having a health meter. But between the poor controls, equally bad graphics, and the fact that the game’s final boss was a literal tornado, Superman Returns was ultimately panned.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building a game around rescuing innocent bystanders (like Superman: The Man of Steel) or protecting Metropolis itself (like Superman Returns) can be an exercise in frustration. Protection missions in games are always a tough sell. Without fine-tuned controls and an NPC AI smart enough not to be actively fighting against the player at all times, these missions can be aggravating at best and downright rage-inducing at worst.    </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How Should the Superman Franchise Move Forward?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Shockingly, that’s it for Kal-El’s gaming career. It’s been almost 20 years since the release of Superman Returns, and the Man of Steel has yet to star in another dedicated game. His subsequent gaming appearances have been limited to Justice League-centric series like Injustice: Gods Among Us and LEGO Batman. Superman is also playable in Fortnite, but there he’s basically just a dude that flies and shoots lasers. At some point, developers seem to have given up trying to crack the Superman code. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gaming world has yet to deliver that satisfying Superman experience that embraces all his incredible powers while still creating a sense of danger. What’s the key? Do you load up enemies with Kryptonite weapons? Do you follow the example of the Injustice games and create a super-strength-bestowing MacGuffin that levels the playing field? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe there’s a better question to be asking. Does a Superman game even really need combat in the first place? Certainly, Telltale found success with the Batman franchise in an adventure game setting. Could Superman benefit from a similarly narrative-driven approach? Is a full-blown Superman point-and-click adventure game the way to go? Maybe, but there are other ways of downplaying action in superhero games.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Does a Superman game even really need combat in the first place?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re seeing modern AAA games like Death Stranding start to deemphasize combat in favor of other mechanics (some would argue the Death Stranding games would be better if they eschewed combat entirely). Maybe the key is to pivot away from a traditional action game focus in favor of finding other ways to explore and utilize Superman’s powers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2005’s Shadow of the Colossus offers another possible path forward. That game isn’t devoid of action, but it does break the traditional mold by focusing on exploration and limiting combat to the battles with a handful of massive boss characters. Maybe that’s the key to getting Superman right. Rather than pitting him against generic goons like Parademons or Intergang agents, perhaps the goal should be to focus on a handful of epic, prolonged boss battles. Picture Kal-El’s fight with the kaiju in James Gunn’s Superman movie and you’ll have some idea of how a Superman game could play out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, flight, not combat, is the most important component of a Superman game. Flight in Superman games is really as key to the overall success as web-slinging in Spider-Man games. Activision nailed that element in 2004’s Spider-Man 2, paving the way for Insomniac to cut loose in their Spider-Man games. We can’t say the same for Superman. Without more modern Superman games to take risks and explore the possibilities, the character has completely stagnated in this medium. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s probably going to take some trial and error before a developer hits upon the perfect, Arkham-esque formula for Kal-El. And that requires DC to prioritize Superman in the video game arena once more. With any luck, James Gunn’s Superman movie will be a major success, thereby serving as the catalyst the character needs in the gaming world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wolverine-history-marvel-video-games-x-men">Wolverine's clawful history in video games</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-video-games-history-arkham-asylum-telltale">the long road to perfecting Batman in games</a>.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/why-are-there-no-good-superman-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an old idea that second efforts generally aren’t as good as the first. It’s called the sophomore slump, and there are a dozen reasons for it. Sophomore students don't care as much as freshmen; bands have less time to write, practice, and record a second album than the “breakout” hit they worked on for years before anyone knew who they were; athletes who have exceptional rookie years regress to the mean; and so on. There’s no denying the power of new car smell. I think part of the reason College Football 25 popped off as hard as it did (and trust me if you’re unsure: it <em>popped off</em>) was it’d been more than a decade since NCAA 14 and people really, <em>really </em>wanted a new game based on college football. It didn’t hurt that it was also a good game, but the yearly “it’s the same game as last year” fatigue of the sports genre hadn’t set in yet. That makes College Football 26 the real test.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll be honest, reader: I haven’t had a ton of time with this sequel yet (I've been busy finishing up my review of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-review"><u>Mecha Break</u></a>, which I thought was pretty great), so these impressions are going to be pretty light. One of the things I’m interested in as I play more is how this car handles after we’ve put some miles on her, and if it falls into the same slump so many games, bands, and students have hit before it. But while that remains to be seen, I’m having a pretty good time so far. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of that is College Football 26 is built on a really firm foundation. College Football 25 was a good game, and it still has that infectious spirit and sense of tradition that made it a nice change of pace from the more straight-laced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-review">Madden</a>. From what I’ve seen, College Football 26 builds on that in good ways. One of the things I’m appreciating most is the Trophy Room, which tracks the real world trophies you’ll accumulate across your entire career, no matter what mode you’re in. It’s cool to see stuff like the Heisman Trophy, the Unitas Golden Arm Award, and the Orange Bowl Trophy collected in one place, and be able to learn about them, too. There’s a lot of history to college football, and I appreciate that EA has tried to capture that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, most of my time has been spent sneaking Quick Play games in where I can, so I haven’t really dug into College Football’s major modes too much yet (something I plan to remedy this weekend), but I have noticed some on-the-field stuff that makes me happy. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Better defenders can now make plays average ones can’t.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The little change I’m happiest about is to how defenders play the football when it’s in the air. If you’ve played College Football or Madden in the last few years, you’ve probably been intercepted (or had one of your defenders intercept) a pass that they can’t see without turning around. They’ve essentially got eyes in the back of their heads, and it could be very frustrating. EA has said they’ve changed that, and in my testing, it’s proven true. Now a defender has to see the ball to pick it off, and you’ll notice defenders turning their heads (or not) before the ball arrives. If they don’t, however, it doesn’t mean that defender can’t make a play on the ball. They can still swat it. It’s a good change because it’s two-fold: you now actually have a reason to swat the ball down instead of going for the pick every time, and better defenders can now make plays average ones can’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also a big fan of dynamic subs and custom zones for defenders. The former allows you to swap players on the field and not just on the playcall screen (thank <em>God</em>), though you may have to wait a play for the substitution to take effect, and the latter is the defensive version of last year’s custom stems for routes on offense. I enjoy the defensive game more than the offensive one, so being able to set where I want my zones to be on the field in real-time and not in a menu is welcome. I’m enjoying playing around with this stuff, and I imagine I’ll be using it quite a bit.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Football Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that I have the time to really dig into College Football 26, I am excited to see all the new additions to Road to Glory, where I’m really looking forward to being able to play my high school career, as well as all the new bells and whistles in Dynasty, which is where I imagine I’ll be spending most of my time. But the on-field stuff is where it counts. I can’t say yet if EA has avoided the sophomore slump with College Football 26, but I’m going into this year optimistic, and that’s not nothing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-26-review]]></content:encoded>
