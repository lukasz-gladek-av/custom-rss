            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was a kid, we always had our own homemade version of an Advent calendar. It was a sort of tapestry that my mom had sewn together and she would drop little surprises in each pocket for every day of December. Now that I'm an adult with a kid of my own, this is a tradition I really want to continue with my son. Since my sewing skills are severely lacking, I've been really happy to see how much things have advanced in the Advent calendar market since my childhood. There's even a Clue Advent calendar now apparently, which seems like a cool way to make new holiday memories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This version of the classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board game</a> is an interesting take on the tradition. Instead of a little treat each day, you get a new clue to help you solve a murder. It's something the whole family can partake in or you can enjoy on your own.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Clue Advent Calendar: Secrets of Snowfall</h2><div catalogid="32ea85e6-204d-4404-a416-1d2010930fc2" id="226899"><div id="226899" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Clue Advent Calendar: Secrets Under Snowfall</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Who killed Boddy Black at his winter gala?</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This unique 2025 Advent calendar is now available to buy on Amazon for $29.99. According to the description for it, this game includes 24 days of clues and puzzles all connected to a larger mystery. The calendar itself opens up like a book to reveal a crime board and a map of the mansion. Players have to work together to unfold the mystery of who killed Boddy Black at his winter gala as each day as you open up each daily clue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest downside of this game is that you'll only be able to play it once. Unlike other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-murder-mystery-board-games">murder mystery games</a> that you can pass to other friends or family when you're done, this Advent calendar can only be used during the 2025 holiday season. This is due to some parts requiring folding, writing, or cutting and you won't be able to return them to their original condition. So in that way it functions like any other standard Advent calendar.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clue Advent Calendar 2025 Images</h3></div></output></p><h3 data-cy="title3">The LEGO Advent calendars are pretty cool too</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for more Advent calendar options that aren't just candy, it's worth mentioning that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2025-lego-advent-calendars-where-to-buy">2025 LEGO Advent calendars</a> are now up for preorder as well. Each day includes a new build or minifigure that makes it a great gift for kids that will last beyond one season.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 13, 2025 4:32 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/clue-advent-calendar-board-game-2025-where-to-buy]]></content:encoded>

Dixon for his thoughts on how horror production company Blumhouse will translate Phasmophobia's genre-defining gameplay to the big screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you would be forgiven for presuming this adaptation could end up feeling like any old ghosthunting film, Dixon is clear: this will be very much a "Phasmophobia film" that "fans will want to watch."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've got a really good partnership with Blumhouse. It's brilliant," Dixon said.

In fact, Final Fantasy 7’s Limit Break is STILL $72.50 at Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon reckons it’s 29% off of the MSRP of the bundle, but given the price some of these decks have been going for (rightly or wrongly), we’d call that a <strong>more conservative estimate</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a reminder, here’s our ranking of the four.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">4 - Revival Trance (Final Fantasy 6)</h3></div><div catalogid="a14fe182-2495-4e51-b750-54b3bf633d12" id="222831"><div id="222831" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy - Revival Trance Commander Deck</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not just focused on Final Fantasy 6, but specifically the back half of the game, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OxDL?object_uuid=8ec68330-2c08-47c8-a71b-03377315ae28&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Revival Trance</u></a> is helmed by Celes, tasked with rebuilding a party after the world goes to ruin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’d be a great theme for a revival deck, but there aren’t that many cards that, well, revive fallen comrades from your graveyard or anyone else's.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also no big reprints of note here, which is a shame.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">3 - Scions and Spellcraft (Final Fantasy 14)</h3></div><div catalogid="a14fe182-2495-4e51-b750-54b3bf633d12" id="222832"><div id="222832" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy - Scions and Spellcraft Commander Deck</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QObkWD?object_uuid=8ec68330-2c08-47c8-a71b-03377315ae28&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy 14’s Commander deck</u></a> is somewhat of a rare beast insofar as it’s a spellslinger-style deck in Esper colors (White, Black, Blue).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, its focus is on non-creature spells and dishing out damage with Y’Shtola, one of the two Commanders. It’s just a little slow to get going, needing you to pull out as much mana as possible in early turns to be able to start slinging those big spells.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Propaganda and Snuff Out are decent reprints, but there’s little else of big financial value.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2 - Limit Break (Final Fantasy 7)</h3></div><div catalogid="a14fe182-2495-4e51-b750-54b3bf633d12" id="222833"><div id="222833" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy - Limit Break Commander Deck</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47KZD?object_uuid=8ec68330-2c08-47c8-a71b-03377315ae28&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy 7’s deck</u></a> is absolutely fantastic, and actually dovetails nicely with Fallout’s Scrappy Survivors precon from last year (as long as you're happy with yet another bold RPG crossover).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s all about getting your creatures to 7 power to trigger additional effects from Cloud or Tifa, while minimizing equip costs to allow you to switch gear and keep opponents guessing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reprint value is decent, too. Not only do you get Darksteel Plate, Sword of the Animist, and Fire-Lit Thicket, but Clever Concealment has some amazing new art of Cloud’s disguise.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">1 - Counter Blitz (Final Fantasy 10)</h3></div><div catalogid="a14fe182-2495-4e51-b750-54b3bf633d12" id="222834"><div id="222834" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy - Counter Blitz Commander Deck</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Arguably the most balanced deck out of the box, Tidus and Yuna helm this<a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnyE6?object_uuid=8ec68330-2c08-47c8-a71b-03377315ae28&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u> Final Fantasy 10 offering</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s all about counters, meaning you can buff your creatures, deal damage, and proliferate. It really could get out of hand quickly, and you can even get creative with the Summons in the deck, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reprint-wise, you can get Walking Ballista, Damning Verdict, and Bane of Progress, all with new artwork.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.
