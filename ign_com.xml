Fast forward to 2025 and we have amassed invaluable experience along the way. We know how to capture the essence of world-class intellectual properties, and deliver licensed games that delight fans everywhere."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vancouver-based Radical was bought by Activision in 2008, and was shuttered little more than five years later after living out its final years as a Destiny support studio. Hothead — also based in Vancouver — went bankrupt in 2024. The new studio is led by CEO Ian Wilkinson, who co-founded Radical, and COO Tim Bennison, who served as chief operating officer at Capcom's Vancouver studio and had previously worked at Radical, too, as executive producer and VP technology.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">News of the new studio from the people who brought us games like Prototype, Scarface: The World Is Yours, and The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run has clearly excited fans, with many now crossing their fingers that the new outfit could be set on bringing those dormant IPs back to life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I LITERALLY JUST TALKED ABOUT THIS IN A THREAD ABOUT WHAT DEV STUDIOS WE WOULD REVIVE IF WE WERE RICH A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO!! HOLY S***!! I WILLED THIS INTO EXISTENCE!! I'M A GOD!!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1rcru49/comment/o70k5fc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>exclaimed</u></a> one very excitable fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A few months ago, rumors started going around about a Prototype remaster. Today, Radical games has seemingly relaunched and their website prominently displays their older titles including Prototype and Simpsons Hit &amp; Run," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1rcqler/radical_entertainment_just_relaunched_their/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a> another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Late last year, IGN reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prototype-remaster-may-be-on-the-way-after-new-credits-were-quietly-added-to-the-steam-version"><u>fans thought they'd uncovered proof that 2009 action game Prototype could be getting a new lease of life</u></a>. While the game has mostly remained dormant on Steam since its release 16 years ago, eagle-eyed fans spotted a flurry of updates behind the scenes via SteamDB, as well as a revealing datamine effort that has discovered a mysterious change to the game's credits that adds in remaster studio, Iron Galaxy, and a curious reference to Ubisoft Connect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all, though. "So one of the OG modders for the game data mined the recent update and has found a lot of interesting things," a fan explained on the game's subreddit. "For Prototype 1, they have added some test maps and quite a few new names in the credits. There might be some hope for a remaster after all."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't, of course, evidence that a remaster is <em>actually</em> happening — right now, we're purely going on vibes and crossed fingers — but New Radical must have been established to work on <em>something</em>, so keep those fingers crossed!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Calls for an official Simpsons: Hit and Run remake have similarly cropped up from time to time in the 20+ years since the original’s release, but it seems an unlikely project. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/matt-selman-simpsons-hit-and-run-remake"><u>In 2021 we spoke to Simpsons writer Matt Selman</u></a> who said that while he "would love to see a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/12/best-games-that-deserve-sequels"><u>remastered version of [Simpsons Hit &amp; Run]</u></a>", it would be "a complicated corporate octopus to try to make that happen."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-worst-and-weirdest-simpsons-games"><u>find out exactly where we placed The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run in our rundown of the best, worst, and weirdest Simpsons games</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty publisher Activision has issued a rare, if brief, comment to seemingly deny a claim it planned to launch a standalone Zombies game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2025670143184101532" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGhostofHope</a> stated on social media that Activision was prepping two separate Call of Duty games for the launch of Microsoft's next-gen Xbox console (currently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-generation-xbox-could-launch-in-2027-hints-amd">expected to launch in 2027 at the earliest</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The claim described these two launches as "a traditional Call of Duty multiplayer and a standalone Zombies title presumably developed by Treyarch," and likened their release to when "Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered where [sic] both released together."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That leak was then picked up by gaming blog Dexerto, to which Activision has now responded using its official Call of Duty social media account: "The rumor factory working overtime," Activision <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/2026038116364992596" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. "This ain't it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision typically does not respond to rumors or speculation, making this intervention notable. That said, the vague nature of the denial makes it unclear exactly which parts of the original claim Activision is now saying are untrue, or whether some element of this claim was true until plans ultimately changed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On social media, Call of Duty's response comes specifically in reply to a thread of tweets discussing the standalone Zombies title, and the claim it was being prepped as a launch title for Microsoft's next console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original rumor suggested that Microsoft's shifting release plans for its next Xbox hardware had meant that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4, the franchise's most anticipated upcoming release, would no longer be a launch title for the next-gen Xbox, as apparently had been planned. While not yet officially confirmed, Modern Warfare 4 is expected by fans to be this year's Call of Duty entry — but there's absolutely no suggestion that Microsoft is planning to launch new consoles this year. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Call of Duty Campaigns</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some kind of shakeup to Call of Duty's forthcoming release schedule is expected, following Activision's recent pledge to make <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games"><u>significant changes</u></a> to the franchise following the underperformance of Black Ops 7. The publisher has said it will never release back to back games in the same sub-brand (Modern Warfare, Black Ops) again, meaning it will likely need to come up with other options if it continues with an annual release schedule.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Microsoft's plans for new consoles, the company has confirmed it has fresh hardware in the works on several occaisons. In 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console">former Xbox president Sarah Bond said</a> Microsoft was "moving full speed ahead on our next generation hardware, focused on delivering the biggest technological leap ever in a generation." A year later, the company publicly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-first-party-next-generation-xbox-consoles-announces-deal-with-amd-and-promises-full-backwards-compatibility-with-your-existing-xbox-library"><u>confirmed its partnership with AMD on its next-generation Xbox project</u></a>. But a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-2027-launch-reportedly-best-case-scenario-following-amd-hint-that-microsoft-may-ship-new-hardware-next-year">recent report suggested that 2027 was now a conservative estimate for the company's new hardware</a> — which instead could now arrive later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-considering-pushing-back-ps6-release-to-2028-or-even-2029-amid-ai-fueled-chip-crisis">Sony is also reportedly considering delaying the launch of PlayStation 6 to 2028, or potentially even later</a>, due to the ongoing AI-fueled chip crisis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Large digital signboards that cycle through all the logos can be found in prominent locations, including Tokyo’s Shinjuku Station and Osaka’s Namba Station. The signboards feature all of the different logos arranged in a color spectrum on a white background.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The colors of each logo match the colors and elements of their respective Pokémon. Of course, well-known Pokémon like Pikachu, Charizard and Bulbasaur have their own logos, but newer and more obscure Pokémon are also being shown love, such as Paradox Pokémon Iron Bundle and the matcha-themed Poltchageist.
