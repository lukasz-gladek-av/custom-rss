However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reading between the lines, Wilson is suggesting that if Dragon Age: The Veilguard had “shared-world features" and “deeper engagement,” it might have sold more copies. But it’s hard to understand that position when you consider EA backed BioWare’s major reset of Dragon Age. As IGN has reported, this reboot saw Dragon Age shift from the skeleton of a multiplayer game with repeatable quests, a tech base, and the outline of a story, to a full-blown single-player RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are already saying EA has learnt the wrong lessons from Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and are pointing to the enormous success of single-player only RPGs that have been released recently, including Larian’s all-conquering Baldur’s Gate 3. Either way, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-dragon-age-fans-fear-the-death-of-the-series-one-former-bioware-developer-offers-words-of-reassurance-dragon-age-isnt-dead-because-its-yours-now">it seems Dragon Age is now dead</a>, at least for the foreseeable future. But what does this all mean for Mass Effect 5?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA CFO Stuart Canfield touched on EA’s decision to restructure BioWare to focus on the next Mass Effect, which has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dev-bioware-reportedly-down-to-fewer-than-100-employees-following-layoffs-and-staff-exits">reportedly involved cutting the 200-person studio down to less than 100 people</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Historically, blockbuster storytelling has been the primary way our industry bought beloved IP to players,” Canfield said. “The game's financial performance highlights the evolving industry landscape and reinforces the importance of our actions to reallocate resources towards our most significant and highest potential opportunities.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that single-player only games make up a tiny portion of EA’s overall revenue. The bulk of the company’s cash comes from live service (74% in the last 12 months). Ultimate Team is doing the heavy lifting here, but there are live service contributions from everything from Apex Legends to The Sims. The upcoming Skate is a live service, and the next Battlefield will inevitably be treated as such, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
