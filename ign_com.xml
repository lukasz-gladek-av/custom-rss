            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/if-there-is-no-the-last-of-us-3-would-naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-keep-the-tv-show-going-past-the-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I leave nothing on the line."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid question marks about the future of The Last of Us video game series, fans are wondering where the story might go next after the HBO series Season 2 and 3 cover off the second video game. Earlier this month, series creator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">Neil Druckmann cast doubt on the prospect of The Last of Us 3</a>, saying: “I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if there’s no The Last of Us 3, would Naughty Dog and Druckmann keep the TV show going past the games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the question IGN put to Druckmann himself on the red carpet ahead of The Last of Us Season 2 premiere, and he replied to say that while he has an ending of The Last of Us story in mind, because he’s not sure if he’ll get the chance to make The Last of Us 3, he’s leaving nothing on the line.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have to have an ending,” Druckmann said. “When I made The Last of Us 1, I didn’t know if there was going to be a sequel, so that had to be a definitive ending. When I worked on Uncharted 4, I don’t know if we’ll ever get to do it again. I need it to be a definitive ending. Last of Us 2, same way. All these things have to line up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t know how long I’ll keep doing this or whether I’ll be given another opportunity. So I leave nothing on the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Right now it’s like, we have an ending in mind. And that ending will be it. That ending will be it for this story.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One question hanging over Druckmann is if he will even have the time to make The Last of Us 3, were it to be green lit for production. That’s because he has his hands full with The Last of Us TV show, which is set to round-out the events of The Last of Us 2 video game with Season 2 and Season 3, and the recently announced PlayStation game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As far as everything else, and you’re asking me about future games, my time so much is, we have to finish this season,” Druckmann continued. “We’re not quite done. We’re almost there. Knock on wood we get to do it again. Season 3, there’s a lot more story we have to cover, as you know with game two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then my hands are pretty full with Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Last of Us Season 2 Character Posters</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In February 2024, Druckmann teased a "concept" for a potential The Last of Us 3 at the end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC3C7GMMfDU&amp;ab_channel=NaughtyDog" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2</a>, noting that there's "probably one more chapter to this story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first game had such a clean concept of like, the unconditional love a parent feels for their child," he said. "The second one, once we landed on this idea of the pursuit of justice at any cost, justice for the ones you love, we felt like, 'there's a clean concept here and there's a throughline from the first game, about love.' If we never get to do it again, this is a fine ending point. Last bite of the apple, the story's done."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The great thing about working at Naughty Dog is that we don't have to," he added. "It's always like, 'we would love another Last of Us, but if you guys feel you're passionate about something else, we'll support this other thing.' Very privileged position to be in, I never take that for granted. I've been just thinking about it, 'is there a concept there?' And for now years, I haven't been able to find that concept. But recently, that's changed, and I don't have a story, but I do have that concept that to me is as exciting as 1, as exciting as 2, is its own thing, and yet has this throughline for all three. So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundles-back-in-stock-amazon-spring-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus more Pokémon TCG booster sets hanging on during the Spring Sale.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I wasn’t planning to buy more Pokémon cards this week. Then I saw that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Scarlet &amp; Violet – Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</a> was somehow <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXEDw?object_uuid=97f4f848-ef36-4c95-a72e-88d7b7b771c5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">still in stock on Amazon for $45.02</a> following its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-finally-solves-pokemon-tcg-shortage">massive Pokémon TCG restock</a>. The restock has come at a great time, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-spring-sale-2025">Amazon Spring Sale</a> in full swing, there are plenty of hot sets to pick up while stock lasts. Suddenly, my willpower crumbled like a 60 HP Basic tackling a 390-damage Hydreigon ex. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite? This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> set is chaos in the best way. You’ve got chase cards that deserve to be slabbed, like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5AlX?object_uuid=97f4f848-ef36-4c95-a72e-88d7b7b771c5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$432 Pikachu ex Special Illustration Rare</a>. That’s not a typo. The little electric mouse is putting in work as both a collectible and a monster in battle. Topaz Bolt deletes nearly anything from the board, and Resolute Heart makes it annoyingly hard to knock out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the Latias ex and Latios combo, pulling a full-on romance movie moment with matching connected artwork. Latias is the rarer and, apparently, the more expensive twin at over $200. I guess big sibling energy costs more. Meanwhile, Milotic ex is out here channeling its inner supermodel with light and shadow drama, and somehow also counters Tera Pokémon like it moonlights as a meta card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My personal favorite? Ceruledge. It’s giving neon fever dreams, and I mean that as a compliment. This is the first time its card has actually been valuable, and I think illustrator Rond deserves a standing ovation. Or at least a coffee. Ceruledge isn’t even a top-tier Pokémon competitively, but with this art, I don’t care.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a collector, the value potential is real. If you're a player, some of these cards slap on the battlefield. And if you just like shiny things and the thrill of gambling $45 on cardboard, welcome to the club. I already cracked one box and I’m convincing myself I “need” another for science.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bundle includes six booster packs, so you’re not guaranteed any heavy hitters, but at the rate people are snapping these up, I wouldn't wait too long. Pikachu isn’t going to pull itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-destined-rivals-launch-ran-into-the-same-old-issues-with-scalpers-shortages-and-outages<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> set, Destined Rivals, has been fully unveiled and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025">the first pre-orders are already underway</a>. If you've been collecting for a while, it might not surprise you that it's been a fairly chaotic launch window though, with scalpers and store issues already reportedly plaguing the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fully unveiled on March 24, Scarlet &amp; Violet - Destined Rivals is set to launch starting on May 30, 2025. A few factors make this a particularly sought-after set. First, it marks the return of Trainer's Pokémon cards. Those old enough to remember <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1jjbcba/mom_says_we_have_destined_rivals_at_home/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vintage Trainer's Pokémon cards</a>, like Brock's Sandslash or Rocket's Mewtwo, should take a moment to stretch their back and adjust their posture before expressing excitement for this returning archetype.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They're popular ways of tying beloved Trainers into the actual Pokémon cards in cool ways. Additionally, Destined Rivals is also centered around Team Rocket, the bad-team faction of Pokémon's first generation. Suffice to say, much like Prismatic Evolutions and its Eevee-lutions earlier this year, Destined Rivals has the makings of a very popular set.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Destined Rivals Pokémon Center Elite Trainer Box Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, when the pre-orders went live, it should be little surprise that frustration quickly ensued. People trying to get into the Pokémon Center website to buy an Elite Trainer Box, a themed box of packs and other niceties that's a common pick-up for people looking to crack into a set, were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1jiwtc5/mood/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left staring in from the outside</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, still unsurprisingly, scalpers immediately hit online auctions like eBay with their ETB pre-orders. Listings of several hundred dollars for the typically $54.99 box were <a href="https://x.com/TCGDannyP/status/1904219026391499227" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seen hitting the site</a>. Again, this is for a confirmed pre-order of the Pokémon Center-specific ETB. Serebii's Joe Merrick summed it up well, <a href="https://x.com/JoeMerrick/status/1904215887965511861" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlining his own experience</a> waiting for hours in queue to get a Destined Rivals ETB.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I truly hate this," Merrick wrote. "The way almost all Pokemon TCG content has shifted to financial. The way that people just treat it as investment. The way people just want to flip it. It's disgusting. Shame on all involved."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is, sadly, par for the course. The aforementioned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-company-breaks-silence-on-prismatic-evolution-shortage">Prismatic Evolutions set had shortages</a>, and the Blooming Waters 151 box also came and went fast. It's not uncommon to see notifications and signal-boosts of sets <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-paradox-rift-etbs-in-stock-now-on-amazon-live-new">restocking on various retailers</a>. Already, TPC has said in a FAQ online (<a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/03/pokemon-center-says-more-destined-rivals-product-coming" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">per PokéBeach</a>) that more inventory of the Destined Rivals ETB will become available later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even on top of scalper issues, some purchases are <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-destined-rivals-elite-trainer-box-pre-orders-are-being-cancelled/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting that their ETB orders are being cancelled</a>. Demand and popularity for the Pokémon TCG seem to be through the roof, but sadly, it also seems to be marring the actual hobby for most trying to just crack some packs or play some matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> offers virtual solutions for the woes of physical scarcity, it's an understandable frustration for those who'd like to simply partake in the hobby. A stroll down your local store's card aisle will, more than likely, paint a clear picture of what it's like trying to pick up some packs right now. It's doubly frustrating when these drops have been exciting ones to see. Hopefully we see some remedies soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That's The Skyrim Library, a three-volume collection of texts detailing its massive world and history, a must-buy for any avid fan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that you can <a href="https://zdcs.link/akRE73?object_uuid=0640381f-e18b-4c6b-a81a-7daa706490e0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">buy this collection for just $49.99</a> in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-spring-sale-2025">Amazon’s Big Spring Sale</a>, your bookshelves can become even more spectacular at a bargain. Just clip the coupon on the product listing for that additional savings.</p><div catalogid="1ade7db2-e22a-4f7a-a075-d9f688f9b8dd" id="217501"><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally released in 2017 at $110.00, this The Skyrim Library brings together gorgeous volumes— I: The Histories, II: Man, Mer &amp; Beast, and III: The Arcane— into a deluxe slipcase that can either be displayed on its own or fit neatly into your larger home assortment of tomes at home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With each of its 232 pages thoughtfully written in impeccable detail and artistically illustrated, each book promises to immerse you in Skyrim’s history, its people, creatures, and the depths of its magical roots, almost as much as the iconic 2011 game had.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Going into some of the video reviews on its Amazon page, the whole package looks especially impressive. The outer slip case carries a distinct stone aesthetic and folds out to show a very well-done illustration of what appears to be Alduin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The books themselves look just as high-quality, with embellished and raised text over the durable hardback cover—giving you that luxury feel every time you want to open one up and peek into the Skyrim universe without jumping into the game itself or checking your phone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Written by Elder Scrolls developer Bethesda Softworks themselves, such a superb set comes as no surprise. Although their games aren’t short of imperfections with bugs, Bethesda always seems to go the extra mile when it comes to books based on their worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re in the UK, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YOgdl?object_uuid=0640381f-e18b-4c6b-a81a-7daa706490e0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Skyrim Library is also on offer for just £58.30 at Amazon UK</a>—a 35% price drop at the site's equivalent sale, Spring Deal Days. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.
