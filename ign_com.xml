            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember that MTG: Avatar Collector Booster Box I shared yesterday? Well it's just dropped by nearly $100, so get your preorder in before prices go up. Seeing as you all liked the Final Fantasy Anniversary Collection deal so much, I've also included the HD-2D remakes of Dragon Quest I - III on Nintendo Switch. It's a pixel art kind of week.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Prismatic Evolutions Figurine Collection is also dropping from today at potentially four different retailers, so if you missed out on your preorder I have all the inside scoops on where it'll show up and when. I've also got a couple of essential gadget deals for your desk and car too, so let's get straight into it:</p><p id="prismatic-evolution-figurine-collect"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Prismatic Evolution Figurine Collect">Prismatic Evolution Figurine Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230771"><div id="230771" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Prismatic Evolution Figurine Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Missed out on preorders? Well multiple retailers will be selling the Prismatic Evolution Figurine Collection out of the gate. Here are the details on when I think they'll be on sale and where:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Walmart: <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2do0?object_uuid=2dbde68a-fca4-406a-bf06-9146eb5d5f0d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Today at 6 p.m. PT / 9 p.m. ET</a></li><li>Target: Online should drop around <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDr5PW?object_uuid=2dbde68a-fca4-406a-bf06-9146eb5d5f0d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10 p.m. PT on Nov. 20</a></li><li>Best Buy: Preorders never went live, so an <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdpo2x?object_uuid=2dbde68a-fca4-406a-bf06-9146eb5d5f0d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">online drop may rock up on Nov. 21</a>. The same goes for in-store, but it might be a limited drop.</li><li>Amazon: Not confirmed, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/98P8m2?object_uuid=2dbde68a-fca4-406a-bf06-9146eb5d5f0d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">could drop on release day (Nov. 21)</a></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Black Friday Arzopa Portable Monitor Deals at AliExpress</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A portable USB monitor has many practical uses, such as a secondary display for your laptop or a travel-friendly screen for your Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck handheld gaming PC. Ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aliexpress-early-black-friday-sale-2025-starts-now">Black Friday</a>, Arzopa is hosting some big markdowns on its popular lineup of portable USB monitors via its official AliExpress storefront. Combined with some general AliExpress coupon codes, these deals are the lowest prices I've seen all year long. All of the portable monitors listed ship free from the United States, which means you don't have to worry about tariffs or long shipping times.</p></div><p id="magic-the-gathering-avatar-the-l"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The L">Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230696"><div id="230696" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The price on this has already dropped by nearly $100 to $455.88 compared to yesterday, so now is a better time than ever to get your preorder locked in. Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best things Nickelodeon put out when I was a kid, and its fandom still beats strong. This Universes Beyond MTG set hasn't only got me back into Avatar, but it's got me on MTG Arena to learn the game, not just collect it when I can. Collector Boosters aren't for playing, it's for those who want some solid binder material with far better pull rates than standard play boosters. There's a premium for that of course, but Amazon won't charge until it ships, which means you'll probably have a day or two to get the money you need together.</p></div><p id="final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-annive"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Annive">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230603"><div id="230603" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (Nintendo Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For Final Fantasy fans who haven't played the 2D old school games, or for those who are fans of the sprite-based RPG vibe, this is the deal for you. It features a re-arranged soundtrack by original series composer Nobuo Uematsu, improved gamplay, a user interface overhaul, auto battle options and more quality of life improvements. 47% off makes this collection a no-brainer.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Dragon Quest HD-2D Remakes</h2></p><div><div id="230773" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake</h3></p></div><div id="230774" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</h3></p></div><div id="230775" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Quest I, II and III HD-2D remakes are all out now on Nintendo Switch, with I and II also out on Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo Switch titles can be played on Nintendo Switch 2 if you want the full game on-cart rather than a game-key card, which requires a sizable content download to play. Of course you'll miss out on graphical fidelity and other upgrades.</p><p id="jvscam-130000rpm-cordless-electric"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="JVSCAM 130,000RPM Cordless Electric ">JVSCAM 130,000RPM Cordless Electric Air Duster with Adjustable Tips</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230772"><div id="230772" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Amazon Prime Members Only</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>JVSCAM 130,000RPM Cordless Electric Air Duster with Adjustable Tips</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I love my cordless electric air duster, it comes in so handy for my desk and gaming rig, with the added attachments turning it inot a mini vacuum cleaner or duster. Ditch the cans of compressed air when cleaning out your keyboard and get one of these bad boys, you won't regret it for under $20.</p></div><p id="astroai-p10-car-battery-jump-starter"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="AstroAI P10 Car Battery Jump Starter">AstroAI P10 Car Battery Jump Starter</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230776"><div id="230776" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>5000A Portable Jump Starter Battery Pack for Up to 10L Gas &amp; 8L Diesel Engine</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>AstroAI P10 Car Battery Jump Starter</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unless you've been stuck with a dead battery waiting for your breakdown cover to pick you up, you have no idea how handy these things are. They fit right in the trunk of the car, ready to save the day when you've left your headlamps on at night or need a bit of juice to get you to your local mechanic. With $50 off, this is something everyone should have in their diesel and gas cars.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article"> Up to 50% off Pokémon TCG and Free $60 Gift Card</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Imagine getting Pokémon TCG Booster Bundles for free, or paying $20 to $30 for an Elite Trainer Box, cool right? Well it's a real deal, and here's how to do it. Start by applying for a Amazon Visa card, then if accepted you'll get an instant $60 Amazon gift card added to your account, which means free Booster Bundles, Premium Collections and Booster Blisters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're after something more expensive and want to knock the price down before using the $60 gift voucher, you'll need an AMEX or Discovery card. By paying $1 on your Pokémon TCG items in your basket, you'll receive an automatic discount up to 50%. So whatever you need to pay after the gift card is cut in half. That's not bad when you're talking Elite Trainer Boxes and Booster Boxes. If this discount doesn't apply, check the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z31VGq?object_uuid=2dbde68a-fca4-406a-bf06-9146eb5d5f0d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">loyalty page on Amazon to see if you're eligible</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TCGPlayer 10% Cashback Black Friday Event </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You read that right, everything is eligibe too.

It was such a fun project and this printer can handle some insane projects on the large and small side. In fact all of these FDM 3D printers are great for printing anything practical. I'm looking at you cosplayers.</p><p id="meta-quest-3s-128gb-amazon-exclusiv"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Meta Quest 3S 128GB (Amazon Exclusiv">Meta Quest 3S 128GB (Gorilla Tag Bundle) </h2></p><p id="teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-la"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The La">TMNT: The Last Ronin Box Set</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230604"><div id="230604" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Preorder: Releases November 25</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin Box Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This set contains three hardcover graphics novels encompassing the TMNT: The Last Ronin continuity. That includes "Lost Years", "The Last Ronin", and "The Last Ronin II: Re-Evolution". I won't spoil them for you, but this is one of the best series i've ever read, and I'm not a massive TMNT fan. And you won't be charged for your preorder until this bad boy ships. Not a bad deal at all with that cheeky 25% off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> team has reversed its defibrillator changes for the Support class after players reported recent difficulty reviving teammates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios delivered a series of new adjustments via a small update that is live for players across PC and consoles now. Details about the hot fix, which were published in <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991168660103180339?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X/Twitter</a>, highlight a fix for those pesky defibrillators, as well as tweaks to the new limited-time Sabotage game mode and additional challenges changes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Players took to social media to complain of inconsistent defibrillators following the launch of the Battlefield 6 California Resistance update yesterday. Where previous versions of the game had players using the Support gadget to slide and dive in for last-second saves, changes brought about by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1120-patch-notes-include-aim-assist-tweaks-and-bloom-adjustments-as-season-1-continues"><u>update 1.1.2.0</u></a> instead asked players to slowly and precisely use the tool if they wanted to revive their friends. It’s resulted only in confusion, as the demanding requirements left teammates with what has been perceived as either a new bug or a bizarre nerf without any explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At first I thought it was just a pointless range nerf,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1p0yjlv/comment/npn1bdq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a> says, “but it's also <em>much</em> more inconsistent and easy to get bodies bugged into a state where the defib doesn't work at all, and you have to grab / drag them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Overall, I hate it, but that second part of it makes me think it wasn't really intentional.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 team didn’t clarify what caused faulty defibrillators to pollute matches, but it sounds like they didn’t like the change either. Today’s hotfix reverts the gadget back to how it was before yesterday’s update by increasing hit-boxes and range.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Sabotage game mode has had its AFK kick timer increased from 60 seconds to 180 seconds. Bot backfilling for the mode has also been temporarily disabled and will be reintroduced in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, there’s challenges, which have benefited from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-major-overhaul-of-challenges-and-assignments-with-significant-reductions-to-challenge-requirements-available-now"><u>frequent adjustments</u></a> as BF Studios continues to fine-tune its progression system. Today’s Battlefield 6 update targets clarity while reducing requirements for a few of the harder-to-achieve challenges. You can see the full list of every challenge change below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 Challenge Updates November 19, 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Here is the full list of changes:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Recon 2: </strong>Get headshots beyond 150m as Recon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Challenge and Description Updated to: Get head shots hits beyond 75m as Recon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Recon Expert 3: </strong>Get headshot kills beyond 200m as Recon in a match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Challenge and Description Updated to: Get headshot kills beyond 125m in a match as Recon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Deadeye 2:</strong> Get headshot kills over 200m with Sniper Rifles</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Challenge and Description Updated to: Get headshot kills beyond 125m with Sniper Rifles</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Engineer 3:</strong> Deal damage to Laser Designated enemy vehicles using lock-on weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• This has been removed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rapid Fire 2:</strong> Get kills beyond 50m with Assault Rifles</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Challenge and Description Updated to: Get kills beyond 40m with Assault Rifles</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rapid Fire 3: </strong>Inflict damage under 15m while hip-firing with Assault Rifles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Challenge and Description Updated to: Inflict damage while in ADS with Assault Rifles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bullet Storm 1:</strong> Suppress enemies with LMGs</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• This has been removed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bullet Storm 1:</strong> Inflict hip-fire damage with LMGs</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Challenge and Description Updated to: Inflict damage with LMGs</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Squad Death Match 5:</strong> Enemy Squad Wipes of the whole Squad in a Round</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Adjusted to add squad to the criteria</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rush 4:</strong> Destroy M-COMs in Rush</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Challenge and Description Updated to: Destroy or disarm M-COMs in Rush</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Battle Royale 3:</strong> Call in three strike packages in a match of Battle Royale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Added team mates to this criteria</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Combat Expert 2: </strong>Perform 10 Takedowns in a round</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• Challenge and Description Updated to: Perform Takedowns</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Protection Expert 3: </strong>Destroy a Vehicle with the Power Tool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">• This has been removed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 10 and is currently in the midst of its first post-launch season.
