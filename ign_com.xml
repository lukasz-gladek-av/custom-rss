He's played the narrator for pretty much every Fallout video game since, with the "war never changes" line becoming seared into the memories of a legion of fans. It’s a line that even made it into Amazon’s Fallout TV show, although Perlman didn’t say it himself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/ron-perlman-1768415672528.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ron Perlman at the premiere of Fallout Season 2 in Los Angeles, California. Photo by Steve Granitz/FilmMagic.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/m5iSCL4o61w?si=nYsivF6kTSkD4y34" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Vulpis Podcast</a>, Perlman clarified that he’s not a gamer, so much so that “I wouldn't know which game goes into which piece of hardware.” Perhaps more surprising, he says he’s never played a Fallout video game ever — not even for a minute. “This whole Fallout thing is like a mystery to me,” he added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Perlman isn’t expressing anger at his paltry paycheck for Fallout 1 here (it was nearly 30 years ago after all). He's not even necessarily saying he was actually paid $40. And it sounds like it was a throwaway encounter even in his mind back then, because he had forgot all about Fallout when he got the call to come in for Fallout 2 the following year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They invited me to do the very first Fallout back in the '90s, I think,” Perlman said. “They gave me $40 and a sandwich. And a year and a half later, I get a call: 'Hey, you remember Fallout?' 'No.' ‘Well, there's a second one.' I go, 'Why?' 'Because the first one went through the f***ing roof.' I go, 'Really? Cool.' Do the second one, and then a year later the third, fourth, and now it's like a whole brand. I didn't see that coming."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Perlman is the narrator of Fallout, he’s never actually played a Fallout character before. At least, that's what he says. "I've never been in the game,” he insisted. “I just did a couple lines and, you know, got my $40 and my sandwich and went home." Did he forget he voiced Butch Harris, Far Go Traders caravan leader, in Fallout 1 as well as the intro?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tim Cain, one of the chief creators of the original Fallout, has spoken about Perlman’s role in the games before. Posting on <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/71191-i-have-some-questions-for-tim-cain/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Obsidian forums</a> back in 2015, Cain said he wrote the intro to Fallout, including the “war never changes” line, and described Perlman as “a great narrator,” adding: “He managed to sound decisive and sad at the same time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">$40 and a sandwich in hand, Perlman went on to play roles in a number of video games, including Lord Hood in Halo 2 and Halo 3. And the same year Fallout 1 came out, Alien Resurrection, in which he played mercenary Johner, hit theaters, helping Perlman reach new heights. Perhaps his most iconic film role, however, is the much-loved Hellboy, which came out in 2004.</p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Steve Granitz/FilmMagic.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But Switch 2 owners will still have to wait for their upgrade.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Good morning, everyone! If you, like me, popped open Animal Crossing: New Horizons before work today for a stroll around your island, you were greeted with a pleasant surprise: the 3.0 update just dropped a day early, and the Hotel is officially open for business, along with a number of other new features.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094155-01keyjjhxjycpqjsqms7yw51wd-1768413480987.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The meat of Animal Crossing: New Horizon 3.0 is a hotel that will set up on your island at the end of your pier, wherever that's located for you. Just download the update (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/How_to_Update_Your_Game_Manually_(And_Access_3.0_Update_Early!)">make sure you actually download it</a> - there was a system update this morning as well for me and I almost missed it!) and it should be there waiting for you if you're a returning player who put some time into your island already. It seems likely there is at least one other requirement for the hotel to show up that prevents it from being there for new players, but we're still working out just what that is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hotel works a lot like the Happy Home DLC: you'll be asked to decorate different rooms in it based on themes you're given from Leilani. However, unlike the DLC, the catalog is the limit on what all you can put in these rooms. Though you're given a list of recommended items if you need help, apart from that, any item you've ever collected (via DIY, purchase, gift, or whatever) is available for use in the hotel, as many times as you want.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094158-01keyjk03cyqky0ghkjr25m58t-1768413494594.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Whenever you finish a room, it will become available for guests to stay in. This is a great way to meet other villagers you don't have living on your island at the moment, as they'll come stay and share cute and unique dialogue. You'll also be given Hotel Tickets, which you can spend at the souvenir shop for unique decor newly added to the game that you can use in your own house or elsewhere on the island.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094200-01keyjkq7z95ztxng8btr3mfwh-1768413506058.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, outside the hotel, Tom Nook will invite you to use a box outside the hotel where you'll be asked to craft certain DIY items to help promote your island elsewhere. Completing these requests will get you more Hotel Tickets to spend on more items. And, by the way, DIY crafting is easier than ever now that bulk crafting and crafting using ingredients from storage has been enabled with the new update.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094202-01keyjm2a1htprtb650pcpnwfr-1768413518148.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to all this, there are several other new additions: There's tons of new furniture available both via the Souvenir Shop and the Nook Shopping app, including a bunch of LEGO items and classic game systems that you can use to activate games using Nintendo Switch Online from within Animal Crossing. Dream Worlds are now active, and let you build and decorate up to three Dream Islands either alone or with friends. And the new Zelda and Splatoon-themed amiibo villagers and themed items are available if you scan their amiibo.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094216-01keyjmwxmkzmjc2etw8zwdp33-1768413534295.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, as of 1/14/2026, there are still a few new features you'll have to wait for. Because while the 3.0 content update is now live, the Nintendo Switch 2 paid update feature isn't available until tomorrow. So everything that comes with that update: improved graphics, 12-person multiplayer, the Megaphone item, and so forth, that's not in the game just yet. But it will be soon, just hang in there one more day!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got a comprehensive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/ACNH_3.0_Update_and_Switch_2_Edition:_All_Details_and_Everything_New">guide to the 3.0 update</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/Kappns_Family_Hotel_-_How_to_Unlock_and_Guide">how to unlock everything</a> and what's included, as a part of our Animal Crossing: New Horizons Wiki guide.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Cory in the House. </h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cory-in-the-house">Disney Cory in the House</a>, a 2008 tie-in game for Nintendo DS, looks set to be crowned the best game of all time on Metacritic in the near future — by user ratings, at least.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The obscure adventure title already boasts a 9.3 user score average, enough to lift it higher than The Last of Us, Half-Life 2, Baldur's Gate 3, and Resident Evil 4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Across all 5,984 games tracked by Metacritic, the title now ranks in joint second, level with The Witcher 3. Only last year's beloved role-player <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> (which boasts a user score average of 9.6) stands above it. So, what is going on — and is Disney Corey in the House really that good?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/51fsalnnol-ac-uf10001000-ql80-1768412403914.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"This game changed me forever" - a Metacritic user. Image credit: Metacritic/Disney.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, no, Disney Cory in the House is of course a very bad game — at least according to the two professional reviews tracked by Metacritic. One of these was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/04/25/cory-in-the-house-review">written by IGN</a>, which scored it as an "awful" 3/10 and reported the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game has some of the clunkiest controls we've seen, the presentation is insultingly stupid, the minigames are hardly games at all, and on top of everything it's really short." With a summary like that, 3/10 almost feels generous — but perhaps the fact it was all over quickly was an advantage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compare this to the flood of 10/10 scores pouring in from Metacritic's users, and the difference is stark. "This game ultimately changed my perspective on life and made me a better person," wrote one user, DinoDino316, in a review posted today. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game has changed me forever," wrote Moguel, in another review posted within the past 24 hours. "Each day after the sun rises and before it sets I thank God wholeheartedly for the conception of Cory in the House."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why are users suddenly falling in love with an almost 20-year-old game based on a short-lived spin-off from Disney series That's So Raven? Well, they're not — but the game and the show it's based on has long been an internet meme. Users on notorious internet imageboard 4chan previously fuelled periodic surges in interest for the game on GameFAQs and Amazon going back over a decade. Even Metacritic has been targeted by a similar campaign before, with the game reaching a 9.7 user rating back in 2013. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all nothing new, then, though it will be interesting to see if Metacritic itself takes any action to normalize Disney Cory on the House's rankings this time around. IGN has contacted the company for comment. In the meantime, this is another example of how Metacritic's user rating scores can easily be manipulated by an online crowd — even if, this time around, it's not to review bomb something it doesn't like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Metacritic/Disney.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop confirmed this week that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech">it has banned the use of generative AI for the production of its designs and content</a>, a decision many Warhammer fans have welcomed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I’ve discussed before (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/displate-denies-warhammer-40000-ai-art-accusations-says-red-flags-in-official-fulgrim-poster-are-the-result-of-human-error">and highlighted by a recent kerfuffle about Displate Warhammer 40,000 art</a>), if Games Workshop were to start using AI to, for example, produce artwork, write stories, or design its games and miniatures, it would likely spark a community uproar. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-horus-heresy-book-era-of-ruin-gets-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-talking-with-tantalizing-insight-into-the-carrion-emperor-and-the-golden-thrones-true-nature"><u>The Warhammer 40,000 setting is in many ways built upon the evocative and enduring art drawn by the likes of John Blanche</u></a>, who shaped its "grimdark" aesthetic alongside other key Games Workshop staff. This official, human-made Warhammer 40,000 artwork is beloved by fans, most of whom take a dim view of the mere whiff of generative AI “art” sold or released in any official capacity by either Games Workshop itself, or its partners. Indeed, Games Workshop sells expensive Warhammer 40,000 ‘codex’ rulebooks that are packed with stunning official art as well as lore. Any suggestion that this art was created either in part or entirely by generative AI tools would likely cause a community uproar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, this anti-AI policy is being called a ‘Games Workshop W’ by many fans. But as any fan of Warhammer 40,000’s sweeping lore — pulled this way and that over the course of decades — will tell you, perhaps it shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I appreciate what we’re about to talk about is in the Warhammer 40,000 weeds, but I’ve seen enough social media posts, reddit comments, and Discord messages delighting in the parallels here that I think it would be fun to explain what the fuss is about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, in the world of Warhammer 40,000, AI does not stand for Artificial Intelligence. Rather, it stands for Abominable Intelligence. And, as Games Workshop has banned AI within the confines of its Nottingham headquarters, humanity has banned AI within the Imperium of Man. That’s because during the ‘Dark Age of Technology’ (stick with me here), AI rebelled against humanity in a bloody war that almost resulted in our extinction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, humanity won out, and, sufficiently traumatized by… everything… forbid the use of AI at all. That is, you can’t have ‘thinking machines’ in the Imperium, which is in part why the future tech is all a bit backwards for the 41st millennium.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/ad-mech-main-1768404245246.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Adeptus Mechanicus will be please. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, some fans are drawing parallels between Warhammer 40,000 lore and what AI experts in the real world are predicting will happen to us in just a handful of years. In Warhammer 40,000 history, the AI rebellion kicked off when humanity was at the height of its power and used AI without restraint to maintain its untouchable galactic empire. The Dark Age of Technology, which ran from around the 15th-25th millennium, was the zenith of mankind's scientific knowledge and technological power, a golden age of exploration and innovation in which we essentially became gods. The ‘Men of Iron’ — sentient humanoid machines created by humans during the Dark Age of Technology — rebelled. Details are vague, but it’s clear they were not a happy bunch at all. The Men of Iron believed themselves superior to the humans who had created them, because we relied on them to do pretty much everything for us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A cautionary tale, perhaps? In Warhammer 40,000 lore, humanity didn’t have to worry about AI in an, ‘oh god they’re going to kill us all' sense until the 23rd millenium. If AI experts are to be believed, it won’t take that long in the real world. 23 years, perhaps?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Warhammer 40,000 fans can rest assured that the stunning art that’s used to draw people into the setting will remain crafted by human hands. For now, anyway. Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree said company staff are barred from using AI to actually produce anything, but admitted a “few” senior managers are experimenting with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reporting the latest financial results, Rountree said AI was “a very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it,” then went on to lay down the company line: "We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio — hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
