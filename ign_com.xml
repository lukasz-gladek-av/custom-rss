            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ataris-classic-adventure-is-back-as-adventure-of-samsara-and-its-a-metroidvania<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I really admire the retro throwbacks Atari is doing these days, whether it’s something like Wayforward’s utterly gorgeous and charming Yars Rising or the underrated Lunar Lander Beyond. These games imagine the world around the Atari originals that inspired them, using them to build a base for a new game while celebrating what came before. It’s a neat idea, and something I wish other publishers would learn from. Needless to say, when I got an invite to sit down with their latest retro revival, I took it, even if I didn’t know what it was. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I got was Adventure of Samsara, a new take on the Atari classic Adventure on the Atari 2600. Adventure was before my time, but it’s remarkable to go back to because of how simple it is. That doesn’t mean it’s not interesting, though. Seriously, go look up a playthrough of Adventure if you’re unfamiliar; it’s amazing what you can convey with very simple graphics and a little imagination on the part of the player. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Adventure of Samsara Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not what Adventure of Samsara is, though. This game is stunning, with simple yet evocative pixel art that is some of the most visually striking I’ve ever seen; I didn’t appreciate how much it captured the visual vibe of the original game until after I went back and saw it, but once you’ve seen them both, it’s easy to see how Adventure of Samsara understands its visual roots. My demo started with a beam of light striking a planet, resurrecting a fallen hero, and covering him in golden armor. The first thing I had to do was help a guy named Ombro out of a cage. “But Will,” you might be wondering, “how do you translate a game like Adventure into the modern era?” Well, dear reader, I’m glad you asked. The answer, of course, is that you make it a metroidvania with soulslike elements (resting at golden anvils restores your healing flasks and respawns enemies). I know, I know, but hear me out. This actually works pretty well.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This game is stunning, with simple yet evocative pixel art that is some of the most visually striking I’ve ever seen.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">See, the original Adventure was about navigating a world and finding the way forward, whether that meant solving a maze, finding a key to open a locked door, or bringing the right thing to the right place. There was a good deal of backtracking and learning how to navigate your environment. Sounds like a metroidvania, right? Well, 45 years later, here we are.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, I had to get my guy Ombro out of his cage, but I didn’t have a sword. So I went into a shining room behind me (Ombro was basically like, “Hey, check out that room back there”), grabbed a sword and shield, and came back. And in between, I got my first taste of Adventure of Samsara’s combat. I wouldn’t call it slow, but it is deliberate. Moving, jumping, dodging, and swinging your sword are weighty experiences, and once you commit to an action, you’re going to be stuck doing it until you finish. When you’re in combat, you want to make sure you’re doing the right thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adventure of Samsara also has a parry, but again, this animation is pretty long, so if you attempt a parry at the wrong time, you’re going to get hit. Get it right, though, and you’ll be treated to one of the most satisfying parries you’ve ever seen, as the Solar Champion (that’s you) uses their sword to knock your opponent back before bringing your own sword down in a giant arc that deals massive damage to stronger foes and kills your basic mooks in one shot. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/d-1750204828984.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Once I’d used my fancy new sword to bust Ombro out, he told me that our people, the Orphics, were under attack by Necromancers. No biggie, just a regular Tuesday. Sounds like a Solar Champion problem, so I set out for the nearby village.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect, this is where I spent most of my time with Adventures of Samarar’s demo. Aside from the combat, which kept me on my toes because of how deliberate each choice was, I was mostly jumping from ledge to ledge (holding on is something you can do manually, which allows you to do some more complex platforming), finding new ways to get to places, and discovering hidden secrets, such as Data Cubes (think pixely murals) that referenced the original Adventure. At one point, I had to help Potisto, the Orphic Crypt Keeper, who was also in a cage (noticing a pattern here?) get a Spoiled Elixir, which meant finding it in a nearby chest. Once I did, he gave me a key to the next area.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was mostly jumping from ledge to ledge, finding new ways to get to places, and discovering hidden secrets.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shortly after that, I fought my first boss. The Fleshless Giant was a good test because I couldn’t just rely on my parry to beat him. I could parry two of his three attacks (the third was a magic spell I had to avoid), but only parrying one of those actually did damage. Parrying the other let me avoid damage, but knocked me backwards. The trick was finding spacing where I could avoid that attack and set myself up to parry the other one. It wasn’t a complicated fight, but finding the right spacing felt good. And better yet, I didn’t have to play it that way. I could have just dodged and whacked away at him. I just wanted to try it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/f-1750204845103.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the big fella went down, I got to get down to the whole “finding the Orphic Village” thing, so I went exploring. I found an ability that let me manipulate a ball of fire to light hi-tech torches (that’s one of the fun things about Adventure of Samsara; you wield a sword, but there are automated metal doors and elevators scattered around) and burn away overgrown plants. I got spells that let me push enemies away and teleport back to the last golden anvil I used. And I ran into more enemies. Spiders that ran into me instead of attacking, so I couldn’t parry them! Flying dudes I had to jump to deal with! These really annoying ground worm things that spat poison! No matter what new thing I got, I had to stay on my toes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did eventually find the Orphic Village, and met more Orphics. I only saw an early segment, but I did come to appreciate Adventure of Samsara’s writing as I played it. Each character speaks with a unique voice, and you’d never mistake one of them for the others. Whether I was learning about the Orphic’s sacred tree that I could help nourish to upgrade my flasks (I see you, video game mechanics), learning about the Blacksmith’s lost friend, or just getting the key to the next area, exploring the town was interesting. Other Orphics even made jokes about how I was the strong, silent type. It’s just nice when people really <em>see you</em>, you know?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/18/c-1750204875606.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">But maybe the most interesting thing in my demo happened at the end. After I left the village, I ran into what appeared to be an astronaut with a jetpack fighting a dragon that looked suspiciously like one of the ones from Adventure, just… you know, way more detailed. I got a couple of hits in to help out, but we didn’t get him. He vanished, and the jetpack astronaut warned me that he (and the dragon) was from another world. They weren’t supposed to be here. I needed to be wary of ambushes. My demo ended shortly thereafter, but I had no shortage of questions, and that’s where you want to be when a preview wraps up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bringing a 45-year-old game into the present era is a challenge. I’ve just scratched the surface of what Adventure of Samsara has to offer, but it feels like it’s doing a good job of staying true to Adventure while guiding it into a new era. I knew nothing about it going in, but I came out fascinated by both the original game and this spiritual successor (and if this sounds cool to you, there is a demo on Steam right now). But that’s the magic trick of a game like this, right? You’re always torn between the present and the future, balancing what you’re seeing with what comes next, wondering what's around the next corner. The only thing left to do now is see if developer Ilex Games and Atari can hold onto that feeling for an entire adventure.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the case of Relooted, you can put Indy’s mentality to the test by reclaiming relics of sub-Saharan Africa back for their homelands in this sleek and fascinating 2D heist title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Relooted puts the player in control of a team of Robin Hood-like thieves that have dedicated their talents to the cause of reuniting items of cultural significance with their home countries. The group gets together upon discovering that a museum is hiding their ownership of multiple antiques in a vault, not even providing a reasoning of public education, but opening them up to having nowhere to report a theft. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Relooted Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Ironically, this idea started when my mother visited the British Museum,” states Nyamakop Creative Director Ben Myres. “We met up later and she was wild with rage talking about this one element where the whole front of a temple from the south of Turkey was literally moved to the museum. She said, ‘You should make this into a game.’”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The developers wanted to ensure that Relooted uses only real-world examples of items countries have been trying to reclaim.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Myres thought about the mechanics of stealing a building from a museum and work on Relooted began. A year after, Marvel’s Black Panther released in theaters, and provoked a conversation about the idea of reclaiming a country’s history from elsewhere through less official means.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nyamakop brought on full-time researchers and 3D modelers for all of the very real artifacts in the game that had been stolen from Africa. The developers wanted to ensure that Relooted uses only real-world examples of items countries have been trying to reclaim.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We were never worried about not having enough relices,” Myres explains, “but rather which ones are we not going to be able to fit in?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the demo that I played, the group hatches a plan to visit the “House of Horrors,” a mansion that contains the body of Ethiopian Prince Alemayehu, who died while in England 150 years ago and has never been returned home. After a briefing at the base, it is explained that the priority is getting the remains out of the mansion and grabbing some optional items on the way out. This is where the planning aspect of Relooted begins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each level is a series of different rooms that have their own entrances and exits and potential hazards to blocking your way out, like shutters that threaten to close as soon as the alarm goes out. Before the heist begins, players decide where and how the team should be distributed: should you put the acrobat with the hookshot on the roof to aid you in rappelling down? In theory, the hacker locksmith should go where you suspect a security door will close, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are indeed wrong choices, but there could also be off-the-wall decisions that may facilitate the retreat in ways not explicitly intended.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If the player put items under the shutters prior to the escape, there should still be a gap to free-run under them when it's time to get out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the player grabs one of the artifacts, the alarm goes off and the escape begins, surfacing a timer in which you can get the other items and get to the getaway vehicle at the far end of the stage. Here is where all your planning comes to fruition; if the player put items under the shutters, there should still be a gap to free-run under them. That is, of course, assuming you placed items that your character can move through. A safe is a big, bulky item but it does not do much good if it is still closed and locked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The level ends as the player makes their way into the van, with promises of many more capers to come. The story promises to expand with not only interesting new heists, but BioWare-style choices along the way to shape the story. I came away from Relooted feeling like it is one of the freshest, most interesting games at Summer Games Fest and I cannot wait to play the full title.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-sets-its-sights-on-reclaiming-the-looter-shooter-throne<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With action-packed gunplay, an innumerable quantity of badass guns to loot, and some of the most crass humor in gaming, the Borderlands games have held a special place in my heart since way back in 2009. But it’s also a series that practically invented the looter shooter genre, then saw itself fall behind the curve as a renaissance of RPG-infused multiplayer shooters dominated the space. With Borderlands 4, the team at Gearbox seems eager to take some big swings in hopes of reclaiming the throne of firearms and shell casings they themselves built, and whether it’s the greatly improved shooting mechanics, an interesting revamp to RPG mechanics, an entirely fresh setting, a slew of new characters, or a more grounded tone in its story, the handful of hours I played left me fairly confident that I will find myself pulled back into this wonderfully weird world of psychopaths and extremely irritating robots.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>I Need Guns</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a whole heck of a lot of novel things Borderlands 4 tries, but the first thing that immediately jumped out at me was the focus on movement. I counted no fewer than <em>five </em>additional ways to keep your vault hunter in motion while hunting for treasure and blasting wild animals, including double jumping, gliding through the air, dashing from side to side, pulling yourself around with a grappling hook, and even swimming – which is especially great, because dying every time one of my toes got wet was always pretty annoying in the previous games. Each of these traversal options added an interesting dimension to navigating arenas while sniping mercenaries and lobbing explosives in the faces of the local fauna, and also went a long way to speeding up how quickly I could close distance between me and the baddies in my path. That was a welcome change, because I’d always found myself frustrated by how slowly I move in old Borderlands entries. If there’s anything worrisome about all these extra ways to get around, it’s that there are so many of them I often forgot to use them. Being able to double jump, glide, and grapple hook across a room all in the same motion honestly feels like too much power, at least in the hands of a rookie like me who only had a few hours to familiarize myself with it all. By the end of the demo, though, I felt a lot better about my ability to keep myself in motion while bringing my arsenal to bear upon swarms of monsters, but it definitely feels like it’ll take some getting used to.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Switch 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it wouldn’t be a Borderlands game without the promise of a bottomless cache of weapons to discover, each designed to inject a little anarchy into combat. While I only got a small sampling of what’s in store, there honestly weren’t a ton of things I wasn’t expecting, even with the additional weapon manufacturers introducing some new stufft. One of the new gunmakers, Ripper, seem to have a lot in common with the COV weapons from Borderlands 3, as they need to spin up before they can be fired, but then pile on a heaping helping of lead into enemies, while Daedelus reminded me a lot of the Dahl weapons that offer multiple ammo types to switch between. The only distinct new type I got to try out was called The Order, which have an alternate firing mode – like a pistol I found that could create gravity wells instead of shooting normal bullets. Most of what I played was from pretty early in the campaign, and I only found a single legendary weapon during my travels, so it’s fairly likely there are more surprises I haven’t seen, but at least on the surface I wasn’t too shocked with what I found in that regard.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Get Built</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">What seems significantly more distinct are the new buildcrafting options, including a healing item, called a Repkit, that can be used in addition to the usual pickups you find in chests and pick off the sorry corpses of slain foes. These add an interesting dimension to defining your build, as you could just play it safe and equip the item that offers the most healing with the shortest cooldown, but bolder vault hunters might instead favor one that intentionally offers lesser healing benefits to instead grant some other effect every time the item is used. For example, I found one that caused a large explosion of cryo to explode around me whenever I used it, versus another that restored significantly more health and could be used twice before it needed to be cooled down.h Depending on how risky you want to play it, or the specific strategy behind your build, I could see this opening up a lot of doors for clever min-maxers to do some pretty fun stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each Borderlands has a different roster of vault hunters to play, and this entry is no different. I got the chance to try out Vex, the magical siren whose main focus (at least with my setup) was in summoning NPC companions to help me fight off mobs, and Rafa, a soldier who had a bunch of high-tech gadgets to unload onto anyone stupid enough to get in his way – including some melee blades that made short work of anyone within arm’s reach, or some shoulder-mounted cannons that automatically helped me lather folks in lead. It’s al  ways hard to tell just how awesome each of these bonafide badasses is going to be after just a few hours, but I was already very much heartened by the number of interesting options to pick from, and I already felt myself transforming into an armed-to-the-teeth instrument of death, even as low-leveled as I was. Also, some of the perks I saw on those trees looked downright spicy, like the ability to disconnect Rafa’s shoulder-mounted turrets to convert them into a stationary battle station, so consider me pretty hyped to try out a late-game build.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Story Time</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Another interesting change coming with Borderlands 4 is the new, clearly darker setting and story. Taking place on a new world called Kairos, the world has been dominated by an oppressive, immortal being known as the Timekeeper, who controls the population using cybernetic implants. But naturally, the actions of the vault keepers in recent Borderlands entries (which I won’t spoil here) has ruined the perfect, unjust order on Kairos, throwing the place into chaos, and opening the door for you and your friends to shoot everything in the face and score some sweet new loot. Noice. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The change in tone is pretty clear, and even though you’ve still got the usual cheeky characters, sexual innuendos, and over-the-top gore, there’s also quite a bit of darkness and the beginnings of what seems to be a significantly more grounded story in play, which will hopefully wash away some of the shallowness found in Borderlands 3 – specifically where the antagonists are concerned. It’s also worth noting the intentional shift away from Pandora to focus on this new world. This, combined with the fact that a lot of the cast is entirely new (at least in the sections I played), makes things feel a bit like a soft reboot that gives a fresh start to tell new stories compared to prior games that have mostly leaned pretty heavily on the locations and characters established in their predecessors.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Borderlands 4 feels a bit like a soft reboot that gives a fresh start to tell new stories compared to prior games that have mostly leaned pretty heavily on the locations and characters established in their predecessors.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m all for this shift, honestly, because although Borderlands was my addiction for many years, it’s also pretty clearly been on its backfoot as a series, as the looter shooter space has both evolved and become more crowded, especially where its ongoing live-service peers are concerned. To be clear, I don’t want to see Borderlands chase the GaaS model and fundamentally change what it is, but it’s nice to see that Gearbox seems willing to take some sizeable risks in pursuit of evolving the series, because I genuinely think it needs to do so if it wants to keep the attention of longtime fans like myself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say that there isn’t a ton of good, old fashioned Borderlands goodness inside Borderlands 4 – quite the opposite. I still spent ludicrous amounts of time dabbing on loads of enemies who shouted expletives at me after running out of darkened spawn points, watched colorful loot explode out of enemies like fireworks, and ran doglike enemies over with my vehicle, which is now very awesomely available to be summoned anywhere on the map, rather than having to be picked up at a designated spawn point (thank God). There are also perilous vaults to be raided and massive, badass bosses to take down in the name of loot, XP, and bragging rights – which I unfortunately can’t show you today, because of some unfortunate restrictions on what I’m allowed to showcase at this time. But I can say that the one boss I fought a number of times is perhaps the most mechanics-heavy and interesting enemy I’ve encountered in Borderlands, and if it’s at all representative of the level of quality we can expect from Borderlands 4, then we’re in for quite a treat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After several hours dipping my toes into what is sure to be a massive looter shooter, I’m much more optimistic about Borderlands 4’s odds of recapturing my affections after years apart. Stay tuned in the coming days, when I’m allowed to show off some later game footage and a boss fight that I took down a number of times in an effort to grind out some unique weapons – old habits die hard, I guess.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What questions do you have about Borderlands 4?
