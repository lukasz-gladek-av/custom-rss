Even then, though, Radcliffe said he was instantly aware that this was "a bad idea."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"One of the worst ideas I've ever heard, during Potter, somebody came to us and I think asked... like they wanted to cast all three of us, me, Emma and Rupert, in a remake of Wizard of Oz," Radcliffe revealed. "Emma was Dorothy, I can't remember what Rupert was, and I just remember that I was going to be the lion, but also he knew karate?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was like a karate kicking cowardly lion," he continued. "And I remember I was like 14 or 15, and I was like, 'I don't know a lot about the world, but this is a bad idea, this should not be made."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, the timeline here would place Radcliffe and his co-stars as filming the fourth Harry Potter book, Goblet of Fire. So, had the Wizard of Oz remake progressed, the trio would still have been fairly young — though not too dissimilar to the age of 16-year-old Judy Garland in the story's classic 1939 adaptation.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Harry Potter HBO TV Series Cast and Characters: Who's Confirmed for the Reboot?</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Numerous Wizard of Oz adaptations have surfaced over the years, including various spin-offs, prequels and sequels. These include the 2013 Sam Raimi-directed Oz the Great and Powerful, which starred James Franco, Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis, and of course the two-part Wicked, starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Radcliffe discussed HBO's upcoming new adaptation of Harry Potter, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/id-like-to-not-be-weird-spectral-phantoms-in-these-childrens-lives-daniel-radcliffe-says-dont-ask-the-new-harry-potter-tv-show-kids-about-him">issued a plea for the series' new young cast to be allowed to get on with their work</a> without the original movies' cast becoming "spectral phantoms" in their lives. Maybe hold off from offering them a new Wizard of Oz adaptation, too?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Scott Gries/NBC via Getty Images</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
