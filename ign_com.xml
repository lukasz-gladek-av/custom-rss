            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-plus-games-for-april-2025-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has revealed RoboCop: Rogue City (PS5), The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (PS4, PS5), and Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory (PS4) as its trio of PlayStation Plus Essential titles for April 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gaming giant unveiled next month's service additions in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-april-robocop-rogue-city-the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation.Blog post</u></a> today. Each joins a catalog of titles available to subscribers of the cheapest PlayStation Plus tier at no additional cost and will remain available until the next batch of games rolls out come May 5. Every game in today’s list is available starting April 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Plus users will note the April 2025 lineup has a little something for everyone. Teyon and Nacon’s brutally accurate ‘80s love letter, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/robocop-rogue-city"><u>RoboCop: Rogue City</u></a>, is likely the biggest headline for players this month. This first-person shooter puts players into the hulking metal shoes of Alex Murphy himself as he works to save a crime-riddled Detroit from another murderous threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-gets-new-game-plus"><u>its more recent and substantial updates</u></a> arrived in January of last year, granting players access to a much-asked-for New Game Plus mode. With or without a reason to revisit its story mode, we felt RoboCop: Rogue City was worth checking out at launch and gave it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-review"><u>a 7/10</u></a> in our review.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Plus subscribers looking to scratch that bloody action itch with friends can check out Sumo Digital and Gun Media’s asymmetrical multiplayer adaptation, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre"><u>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</u></a>. Players work to survive – or kill – others in a set-up that pits survivors against the bloodthirsty Slaughter Family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an experience not for the faint of heart that aims to simulate what it might be like to hear Leatherface rev up his iconic chainsaw just feet behind you. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review"><u>6/10 review</u></a> at launch, we said it offered “a few entertaining, technically challenged hours of fun.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">RoboCop and Leatherface will no doubt get your blood flowing, so it’s nice that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory"><u>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory</u></a> is here to bring down the tempo just a bit. Bandai Namco expanded on the already massive digital world of digital monsters with this turn-based monster collector offshoot back in 2018. It’s got more than 320 Digimon to meet and collect as players look at the events of the original Cyber Sleuth story from a new perspective.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As RoboCop, Leatherface, and Agumon make their way onto PlayStation consoles next week, players should make sure to download <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-months-after-launch-dragon-age-the-veilguard-headlines-playstation-plus-march-2025-lineup"><u>the March 2025 titles</u></a> while they still have the chance. It was a particularly strong lineup that included Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Sonic Colors: Ultimate, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection. So, if you’re a subscriber or a non-subscriber who has been looking for a good opportunity to sign up, make sure to add all three games to your library before the offer goes away March 31.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

He has football attacks (one of Ronaldo’s command moves is called Headed Clearance, and he can slide tackle), and even does his trademark 'Siuuu' celebration, although Ronaldo didn’t do his own voice work - voice actor Juan Felipe Sierra did it instead.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on Ronaldo’s character:</p><blockquote>One of the top football players in the world. He uses his time off to visit South Town to hone his new football skills. The various techniques he has developed playing football make him an unstoppable force, even to seasoned fighters.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The 40-year-old forward currently plays for Al Nassr FC, a professional football club based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia that competes in the Saudi Pro League. It is majority-owned by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is chaired by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. Incidentally, SNK is now almost entirely owned by the Saudi crown prince’s foundation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves launches on April 24, 2025, featuring a dynamic art style, new and familiar fighters, and modernized battle systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
