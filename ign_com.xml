            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-berserker-khazan-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m exhausted after playing The First Berserker: Khazan over the past week and a half. My hands ache, my brain is fried, and I’ve often had to step away in frustration. It’s a brutally difficult game, one often expecting near-perfection in its toughest encounters. I’m slowly working my way through this Soulslike extension of developer Neople’s Dungeon &amp; Fighter universe, and it’s an understatement to say it’s given me trouble – which is part of why I still have a bit more to go before I’m able to call this review finished. But like a new military recruit, it’s broken me down and, over time, built me into a lethal weapon that’s prepared to take on whatever hellish nightmares wait ahead. Even though I’ve hit seemingly insurmountable roadblocks for hours at a time, I’ve somehow found myself enjoying and reveling in the battles that take me to the brink of my abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The First Berserker: Khazan is a classic revenge tale. Khazan, a celebrated general, is betrayed by his empire and labeled a traitor. After being gravely injured while apprehended, he is revived and possessed by a melded legion of vicious warrior spirits who antagonize him into doing their bidding. The Blade Phantom, as the ethereal symbiote is known, is more concerned with advancing the objectives of the underworld from which it hails, while Khazan is out for the blood of those who wronged him. The setup provides plenty to build on, tying grounded medieval politics to the occult forces leeching their way into the world, but the story after has mostly been thin and underwhelming beyond that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Khazan meets various characters as he ventures forth into the world, but besides adding some minor connective tissue to the ongoing plot, they don’t contribute to the story in a way that makes me care about really anything that’s happening. Distressed villagers, otherworldly advisors, former military cohorts, and more start to fill out a sparse hub area known as The Crevice. Outside of being visually interesting as a floating stone sanctuary with mysterious broken staircases and far-off platforms that I’d like to get to and explore, there’s not a lot to do in The Crevice apart from managing my inventory from time to time or pressing onto the next mission area. There’s shockingly little to glean from the greater world despite being the perfect place to slow things down and foster an environment for further flavor. Instead, it’s more a mechanical necessity to pick up optional quests or craft, upgrade, and augment gear for Khazan than an area to explore and enhance the overall story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Being a well-honed instrument of war, Khazan has a handful of tools at his disposal to slaughter his enemies – although it took a long time before I felt like I was on his perceived level of capability. An early mission introduced me to The First Berserker’s three types of weaponry: You can choose to use the powerful but slow and defensive greatsword, a nimble stamina-draining spear, or the whirling assault of the dual blades. I enjoy how unique each weapon type is from the others, offering transformative move sets ranging from defensive and methodical to all-out aggressive. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Khazan feels way different than he did at the start roughly 40 hours ago. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each weapon is further expanded with a full skill tree that enhances Khazan’s effectiveness in battle. Nodes on these trees modify your basic attacks, like altering how your charged Potent Blow (or heavy attack) works, changing the stamina depletion for actions like dodging and blocking, or providing new moves entirely by spending a resource called Spirit Points in combat. My Khazan currently feels way different to play than he did at the start roughly 40 hours ago. There are a lot of options to kit out Khazan with as you level him up, and it’s been rather fun to figure out which moves and perks contour best to my playstyle to help me slice my way out of its hardening conflicts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The First Berserker lets you swap between your three weapons freely, but with little overlap between their various abilities, what’s normally a quick switch is actually a dramatic change and a hassle. For instance, in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review">Dark Souls</a>, most weapons boil down to having light and heavy attacks, with maybe a special ability available when switching to a two-handed grip. Weapons in The First Berserker, on the other hand, allow for up to six of the previously mentioned Spirit attacks and further optimization of the skill tree. It’s a lot to deal with when equipping what is essentially a bespoke class. That’s why I’ve dedicated myself to the dual blades during my playthrough, which I’m still tweaking and learning about with every big fight I pick. Thankfully, If I ever wanted to make the big jump to the greatsword or spear, you can reallocate skill points freely. However, the process is <em>just </em>obtuse and annoying enough to do on the fly that I’ve stuck with one kind of weapon throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon embarking on The First Berserker’s mainline missions, the structure is extremely similar to what’s expected in a soulslike. Each level involves slaying dangerous enemies patrolling the area, figuring out how to survive with limited healing items, collecting spoils of the dead, and using them to level up at this game’s version of a bonfire, called a Blade Nexus. It’s an overly familiar formula that’s certainly inoffensive in its design, with levels smartly built to weave back to prior respites via shortcuts. The First Berserker unfortunately doesn’t add anything that you haven’t already seen in FromSoftware’s games, but it recreates that loop well enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capping off each mission is a tooth-and-nail fight with that area’s boss, each of which represents a potentially substantial roadblock before you can continue to enjoy The First Berserker, but these encounters have begun to win me over. The first big encounter I struggled with was the end boss of Mission 2, a manifestation of souls like the ones inhabiting our newly possessed hero. Its aggressive melee attacks would quickly kill me, and after several unsuccessful attempts and unforeseen weapon swaps from my adversary, I needed to try another strategy to finally break through. Another early boss, a bipedal goat demon wielding a flaming spike and hammer, caused plenty of grief by hitting hard and often, occasionally lighting the battlefield ablaze with a carpet of flames. At first, I tried to grind weaker enemies around the level to collect Khazan’s version of souls, called Lacrima, to boost my stats and give myself a better chance of living. It helped, but ultimately didn’t do enough to tip the scales. I then took a close look at my gear and opted for a tankier build. Still no dice. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What was once a peak point of frustration has become my favorite part of The First Berserker.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Khazan’s bosses are just painfully tough, and the early ones are like a brick wall. Some of the smaller enemies leading up to a boss will somewhat teach you how to deal with certain aspects of them, but there’s little to ramp you into what is continually asked of you moving forward. There’s no easy way to smash your way through these walls in The First Berserker, like finding an overpowered item or excessively juicing your stats. Even in a brutal game like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review">Elden Ring</a>, a notorious early boss like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Margit_the_Fell_Omen"><u>Margit</u></a> can be overcome more easily if you spend some time getting stronger in the areas before him, but that’s not really an option here. In turn, this immediate difficulty spike genuinely made me want to stop playing after the first few levels – but I’m glad I stuck with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The process of learning each oppressive bosses’ moves and tells, figuring out when it’s ideal to dodge or block, is extra important in The First Berserker. It’s how I ultimately figured out how to enjoy the experience in the face of overwhelming odds. Honing these abilities was mind-numbing and shredded my will to play early on. There’s no way around the need to execute well-timed damage blocks or rolls and then strike back at opportune moments. Some bosses in the first half of the campaign burned upwards of five hours of my time alone, often leaving me wondering if <em>maybe </em>I should just consider dropping down from the default Normal difficulty to Easy to save myself the stress. These enemies tested my patience, but after overcoming that initial barrier,  building the foundation of my reaction options, and adapting my plan of attack, I became much more successful at figuring out the ones that followed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was once a peak point of frustration has become my favorite part of The First Berserker; the bosses are ultimately what make it worth playing. While they are incredibly hard to take down, every one can eventually be read like a book, telegraphing the moves they’re about to make and predictable strategies they’ll use throughout the fight. Every death that was once met with confusion and irritation has become a learning experience I look forward to absorbing. Every restart is a renewed chance to land my attacks and survive with newfound knowledge. Yes, there are plenty of cheap attacks, one-hit kills, and groan-inducing mistakes, but I’ve been enjoying studying each big boss I come across as much as the catharsis of finally taking them down.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The First Berserker: Khazan Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve also been able to achieve these insurmountable feats thanks to two great quality-of-life decisions Neople has implemented into The First Berserker. First, dying repeatedly at a boss isn’t for nothing, but rather grants precious Lacrima based on how far you took their life down. Each upgrade that helps you afford gets you a little bit further the next time, and gaining levels by grinding the boss you need to beat is far more valuable than breaking away to farm elsewhere. Second, skill points are awarded separately from the levels you get from cashing in Lacrima, and are instead earned through a more traditional experience bar that is filled simply by being in battle. While not necessarily an increase in stats, unlocking new moves to use or enhancing your favorites can be just the thing needed to beat a stubborn encounter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After finally finding my footing with what’s being asked of me at the conclusion of each mission and gaining abilities that make me feel like I can stand a chance against anything, I’ve come to enjoy Khazan’s devastating bosses. They’re what’s keeping me trudging through largely uninteresting levels and hordes of enemies. It’s been a steep and sometimes demoralizing climb to feel effective with my skills and stats – but there’s also the exhilaration of executing split-second guards and dodges to escape relentless attacks and hit my foes with my own flurry of steel. If I weren’t reviewing it, there’s a very good chance I would have taken a long break early on, and who knows if I would ever go back. But now that I know I’m capable of taking on the worst Khazan has thrown at me (so far), I’m looking forward to seeing it to the end.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/forestrike-demands-absolute-unconditional-kung-fu-pixel-art-perfection-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Like a demanding, wizened kung fu master insisting you repeat a training exercise until you’ve gotten it exactly right, Forestrike shows no mercy, absolutely insisting you achieve perfection before proceeding to the next level. Despite being squarely centered on martial arts mastery, this pixelated 2D roguelike has more in common with a chess match than an action game, as you repeat encounters until you’ve perfected them in one of the most satisfying, unique, and immediately compelling brawlers I’ve played in a very long time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever wanted to live out your most epic kung fu fantasies where every moment plays out like you can see into the future, Forestrike very well might fill that need unlike any game has so far. The premise is simple: you’re a martial arts master who can enter your mind palace and practice each combat encounter as many times as you want before heading into battle for real. After a dozen or more rehearsals, even the most seemingly insurmountable scenarios went off without a hitch as I moved with the precision and speed of someone who knew every enemy’s move before they made it – because I quite literally had. And since this is a roguelike where just one or two mistakes will send you all the way back to the beginning, having that handicap is extremely important to success.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Forestrike Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In one level, I practiced again and again to resolve an encounter where I had to protect a traveling merchant from a band of ne’er-do-wells, and in another I challenged an extremely tricky boss who was annoyingly good at dodging, eventually beating him by getting his henchmen to accidentally hit him with friendly fire. Each level is its own miniature puzzle that must be solved and practiced before you try it for real, and even after all that, there’s always a chance your nerves will get to you and you won’t pull things off quite right, resulting in an untimely end to your journey.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When you’ve got unlimited time to practice walloping the enemy in clever and creative ways, why not go beyond simply achieving victory and aim for a bit of flourish?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But sometimes beating your opponents isn’t enough – after all, when you’ve got unlimited time to practice walloping the enemy in clever and creative ways, why not go beyond simply achieving victory and aim for a bit of flourish? Sometimes this is incentivized via optional missions, like one where you’re encouraged to knock the hat off an enemy’s head, have it land on your own, then don’t let it get knocked off of your head for the rest of the encounter; those can be a great way to earn some extra gold for upgrades (like armor that will allow you to take one additional hit without ending your run) when you next find yourself at the shop. But if you’re like me, you also just might find it funny to see if you can get through an entire fight only using misdirection and dodging to get the enemy to kill one another.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The really crazy thing is I only played a little beyond the first of five regions, where encounters were still mostly on the simpler side, the number of unique enemies was fairly low, and I didn’t get to try out any of the other four fighting styles. Having gotten just a peek beyond that, it seems there’s a whole lot more in store, including some absolutely nutty looking encounters – like creepy banshee monsters that were introduced at the tail end and charged at me with reckless abandon. The demo I played also focused on the School of the Leaf fighting style, the first of five total schools you’ll be able to unlock and incorporate into your build, each of which has their own flavor and abilities you unlock on each run. The Leaf style is all about evasion and misdirecting enemy attacks to encourage friendly fire, and some of the abilities shown in the sizzle trailer that played at the end of the demo looked like they extended that idea to its logical conclusion – like by linking yourself to an enemy, then magically switching places with them when you take a hit. In a game that was already impressively clever in a short hour-long demo, I’m extremely excited to see what else the developers have got up their sleeves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, I have to mention just how beautiful and stylish Forestrike looks. Don’t be fooled by the pixel art simplicity! Animations are charming and detailed, character art during dialogue makes you forget they’re represented by pixels to begin with, and the music, sound effects, and overall presentation are absolutely unforgettable. I’m telling you, friends: this is one to watch!</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to a former executive, the Nemesis system came about from trying to solve a different problem: secondhand sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5f65WksXqA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new video</a>, Laura Fryer — former vice president of WB Games who oversaw the publisher's Seattle studios at the time — talked about her time with Monolith. While discussing the way trend-chasing affects the industry, Fryer mentioned that chasing trends is what "literally led to the Nemesis system."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, used game sales were a hot-button topic. Companies like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/05/10/ea-sports-locks-out-multiplayer-modes-on-used-sales">Electronic Arts</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/05/18/ubisoft-to-tackle-used-game-sales">Ubisoft</a> were taking measures such as selling season passes to counteract an active used game market. Fryer said a sales drop-off for Rocksteady's Arkham Asylum was attributed, by analytics, to a theory that people would play the game, then return the disc to a retailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This was great for gamers, because they could buy the game and then sell it back to a company like GameStop and buy something else," Fryer said. "It was great for GameStop, because then they sold that used game for a discount and they pocketed the money. For game developers, though, it was a disaster, because they weren't getting paid for every game. They were only getting paid for the first copy sold. They lost millions of dollars."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is where the Nemesis system, according to Fryer, came about. Faced with secondhand game sales and potential losses, how does a studio encourage players to hold onto their game? Memorable experiences, it seems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With Shadow, we faced the same problem," Fryer said. "How do we create a single-player game that is so compelling, that people keep the disc in their library forever? We knew Monolith's game engine wasn't yet capable of having a fully open world like a GTA, and this team wasn't interested in going the multiplayer route. But we still had to solve for the constraint. And this thinking is what led to the Nemesis system, arguably one of the most creative and coolest game features in recent memory."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solving for this constraint would, as it turns out, lead to an incredibly memorable system of named Orc rivals, who would remember your actions and previous encounters, developing stories out of the action combat. It's often the best-remembered part of Monolith's Lord of the Rings duology, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel, Shadow of War.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-cancels-wonder-woman-game-closes-three-studios">with the sudden closure of Monolith Productions</a> and cancellation of its Wonder Woman project, that particular success seems doomed to life in the vault. Though the Nemesis system was due to be implemented in the Wonder Woman game, Warner Bros. still owns the patent for the system, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-mordors-brilliant-nemesis-system-is-locked-away-by-a-warner-bros-patent-until-2036-despite-studio-shutdown" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stands with an expiration date in 2036</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's fascinating to hear more about how the Nemesis system came together, even if it means <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-warner-bros-shut-down-shadow-of-mordor-developer-monolith-and-canceled-wonder-woman-fans-lament-the-wasted-potential-of-its-nemesis-system">further lamenting</a> the fact that it will gather dust for the forseeable future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Shadows, which like Ghost of Tsushima is set in Feudal Japan, launched last week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-japan-concern-about-assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-confirms-day-one-patch-that-makes-tables-and-racks-in-temples-and-shrines-indestructible">alongside a day-one patch that quietly made a number of important changes, including to temples and shrines</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The update made tables and racks in temples and shrines indestructible, and changed citizens without weapons so they no longer bleed when attacked and thus reduce blood spill in temples and shrines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft told IGN the day-one patch was for all players and not Japan-specific, but was hard to see the changes as anything but a response to the controversy surrounding the game in the country.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That controversy even reached the upper echelons of Japanese politics. Last week, Shigeru Ishiba, the Prime Minister of Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-prime-minister-of-japan-responded-to-a-question-about-assassins-creed-shadows-today-heres-whats-actually-going-on"><u>responded to a question about Assassin’s Creed Shadows during an official government conference meeting</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Assassin’s Creed Shadows question was asked by Japanese politician and member of the House of Councillors of Japan, Hiroyuki Kada. Kada, who will campaign for re-election this summer, said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I fear that allowing players to attack and destroy real-world locations in the game without permission could encourage similar behavior in real life. Shrine officials and local residents are also worried about this. Of course, freedom of expression must be respected, but acts that demean local cultures should be avoided.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Minister Ishiba responded:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How to address this legally is something we need to discuss with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Defacing a shrine is out of the question - it is an insult to the nation itself. When the Self-Defense Forces were deployed to Samawah, Iraq, we ensured they studied Islamic customs beforehand. Respecting the culture and religion of a country is fundamental, and we must make it clear that we will not simply accept acts that disregard them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The shrine being “defaced” in pre-release Assassin's Creed Shadows gameplay videos was the Itatehyozu Shrine in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, which is within Kada’s constituency. He said that he had consulted with representatives of the shrine, who confirmed that Ubisoft did not seek their permission to show the shrine and use its name in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As our colleagues at IGN Japan explained to us last week, Japan has seen record numbers of overseas visitors in the wake of the country reopening its borders after the pandemic and the lure of the weak yen. In this government budget meeting the politician Hiroyuki Kada twinned his complaints against Shadows with the controversial subject of what he called “over tourism” and an attendant perceived rise in vandalism and graffiti in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His argument was that if players were able to deface a temple or harm individuals with a katana in the game, they may be inspired to do it in real life when they visit Japan, similar to the age-old argument that Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto inspire copycat violence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba responded that if such actions were taken in real life, he would oppose them. His comments were aimed at theoretical real-life copycat actions rather than at the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
