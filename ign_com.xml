            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 has already been a productive year for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phasmophobia"><u>Phasmophobia</u></a> maker Kinetic Games, not least because though it's only August, we've already seen a major overhaul of the in-game journal, the release of the (terrifying) reworked Bleasedale Farmhouse, and now a revamp for the fan-favorite Grafton Farmhouse map has just gone live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we dive into the final half of the year — and get ever closer to spooky season — we sat down for a chat with art director Corey J. Dixon to talk about what's new, when Phasmophobia will finally feel finished, the possibility of Phasmophobia 2, and what it's like working with Blumhouse Films on a movie adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Tell us about the reworked maps. Why rework them at all?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>[Creator] Dan [Knight] wanted Phas[mophobia] to be the best thing it could be. And with the amount of asset packs that he had to use to create the game, there was a feeling of it not being his own thing. The design and the game and everything else inside of it was his baby — and it was successful because of that — but anyone could recreate Tanglewood. They just needed to buy the asset. So Dan was like: 'I want to make this the best puzzle horror game I can. Let's rework the maps.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I joined Kinetic Games about nine months after Phas came out, so it's just over four years now. Back then, there were only three of us. It was me, Dan, Ben [Lavender], and I was doing all the art myself. My first job was slowly replacing all the art assets, [and] we're still going four years later. But there's a lot more people now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Why was Grafton next on the list to get a revamp?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We do what we feel is best for players. Asylum was the most repetitive map. It was absolutely <em>huge</em> before. I'd had chats with Dan where he's like, 'Oh yeah, it took me so long, like I was just copy-pasting rooms because I'd made it so big,' and it just wasn't that enjoyable to make. That was the first target — we felt that that was the most repetitive, and could have the biggest uplift. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we did that one first, and then the farmhouses. There are two farmhouse maps, but they were almost identical. We had so many players who couldn't even tell the difference between Bleasdale and Grafton because they were the same asset pack. So we had the conversation, and I suggested that we should really spread them apart. Let's make one of them this kind of ornate, mansion-y, bigger map, and then take the other one in the opposite direction. Let's ruin it, destroy loads of it — give it that abandoned ghosthunting experience that a lot of people do in real life. I think it's worked — they feel completely different now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Do you have plans to rework anything else?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>Earlier this year, we announced we would be doing Tanglewood, and that's a fan-favorite map. Everyone absolutely <em>loves</em> Tanglewood. So we'll have to make sure we maintain a balance of, you know, giving it a fresh coat of paint, but not changing <em>too</em> much, because we know how much players absolutely adore it. But I'm pretty sure we'll find that balance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How do you manage demand from players who want smaller maps with those who want much bigger ones?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>It's a combination of things, the first mainly being the community. We've got statistics on what maps people play. We know that people play small maps, and we hear people talk about small maps all the time. That's a massive factor. We want to update and add things that players <em>want</em> to play. We understand there is a community of players that do like the larger maps, but the bigger the map, the longer it takes to make or redo. So, for us, if we're going to do, for example, three maps in a year, and if we [chose] a large map, that might mean we only get to do one or maybe two a year. So players are missing out because we're doing something that takes much longer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's kind of weighing up what the benefit is for the community versus how long it takes. We would like to rework all of the base game maps eventually — it's just how long that takes, and in what order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Have you ever considered expanding beyond four-player co-op?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>A lot of the community have asked for that, especially on the big maps! Yeah, more players means you'll find the ghost and identify it quicker. But it's not really something we're looking into. The whole game is locked in around four players. And it's a 10-year project. Now, for Dan, he's [already] worked on the game that long, and the code base is kind of locked in, there's a lot of linking, intertwining systems, and it all kind of works together. So even if we wanted to do that, it would be an absolutely huge project.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Phasmophobia Nell's Diner Map Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You've also recently revealed that the next new map coming to Phasmo is Nell's Diner. Tell us about it.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We planned for a new, small map this year and, again, looked at the community. People suggest things all the time. We have a <em>massive</em> list that has all of the things the community has suggested, so we reference that and see what we think, what we think would work or not. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We need to make sure that small maps make sense, because the way that the game plays, you're restricted in what kind of maps you can do. A lot of people have suggested a theater or an amusement park, and while those would be absolutely amazing art tasks — they'd be so fun to make, gameplay-wise — they'd be really difficult. Massive open spaces mean you don't have ghost rooms, and you need to have things on the floor or things for the ghost to interact with. So a diner just kind of made sense. You can split it up into these nice little chunks — you've got the dining area, the counter, the kitchen, the staff areas at the back, and then some toilets. It's a perfect little, small map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also a familiar thing. People love the house maps because they play Phas in a familiar environment, which is just a house that doesn't look creepy or abandoned. They stop playing [for the night] and walk around their house at night and go, 'Oh my God. This is so similar. This is my house, and I'm scared of looking around at night.' And a diner is very familiar for a lot of people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The theming is super unique. We've never done a retro American style or really embraced the culture of it all. Shout out to the art team!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is that because you have a bigger team now? One of the criticisms we see is about the pace of development, which has felt sluggish at times.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>Oh, yeah. Definitely. If you compare our updates this year to last year — I think last year was just the console update, and then we did [new map] Point Hope. This year, we've already done the Bleasdale update. Grafton. The Chronicle update — which was a huge shake-up of the gameplay — came out a couple of months ago, and we're still on track with our roadmap. We did Easter, we've got the Halloween holiday, and then Nell's Diner as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You recently said the diner was a chance to use a little environmental storytelling, too?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We're trying to push that as much as possible. Phas doesn't have a story, per se, but even back when I did the asylum map, I tried to add a bit of storytelling there about, like, maybe there's an origin story there for one of the ghosts, or maybe it's just a crazed lunatic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're trying to let players think about what happened here without being too hand-holding. We've dropped these little bits and pieces around, and people absolutely love it. We did some stuff in Bleasdale that even referenced Grafton. [Our community] absolutely loves it. So we're just trying to push that Phas is not just a ghost-hunting game with these environments that look pretty but don't mean anything. It's a living, breathing world. We've got a lore update coming at some point that's just going to push the storytelling in the game as far as we can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Does this mean we're closer to a 1.0 release?  Phasmophobia's been in early access since its 2020 debut.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We definitely have plans for 1.0, probably in line with our Horror 2.0 update [<a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>slated for 2026</u></a>] is where we feel the game is feature-complete. It doesn't mean we'll stop working on it — we still want map reworks and new maps and stuff in the future, so there'll be more stuff for the game. But I think once the Horror 2.0 has been redone, which is the next thing we work on after the [2025's] Player Update, the game will feel finished. Once that's in, I think it will be in a good spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's really difficult to know [when it may be finished]. Our community is constantly putting out, 'Oh, it should have this!' so we can look at that and just keep doing it! We'd love to work on it until we're really happy with it. We haven't set a date or an update that's like: we're done. I think we'll just know: there'll be that company-wide feeling that this project is done now, we've made it the best it can be, which is what Dan wanted Day One. I think we'll know when we hit that milestone — I don't think we can plan for that. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Phasmophobia Grafton Farmhouse Map Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How do you keep the horror sequences fresh (and scary) for veteran players while keeping the gameplay loop simple enough for new ghosthunters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We just try and maintain a balance. Like with the Chronicle update, we wanted to make it make sense. Before, something would be dropped on the floor, and you take a photo and go to the person you're selling them to, and say: 'I promised the ghost threw this! It wasn't me!' So that was the main goal of the update: let's make the evidence system make sense, right? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">People come up with crazy ideas, and some of them are great. Going back to the first anniversary, and we did a mini update where we redid the journal, because that was a big pain point for players. And people were posting designs on Reddit. It meant that when we came to do it, we had <em>tons</em> of reference, and we knew what players wanted feature-wise, and we just had to make it kind of look pretty, and we haven't touched it since. The community's great, it's almost like you don't need anyone [on the development team] with a brain now. We could just be developers that don't have any thought, and we just follow the Reddit thread and just churn out stuff, because there's <em>so</em> many good ideas on there!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When we got to the gameplay design of the Chronicle Update, it was just about maintaining that interest for new players, but having it complicated enough so that experienced players would enjoy it as well. With the unique and duplicate system, you can go in and take whatever photos, videos, and sounds you want, and not worry about the unique and duplicates, and you'll still get a pretty good payout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But veteran players with thousands of hours [in the game] — they know every nook and cranny. They can kind of curate their own really difficult game mode in custom difficulty, and they can go for a perfect investigation, and they can make each game the hardest they want it to be, and then end up with these <em>huge</em> payouts. The custom update is kind of 'play your way.' We noticed so many people were making their own little challenges, and we were like, let's just put it in the game. Let's just spend the time and put it in. We did a few updates to get the rewards right, but now it's super solid. It's rewarding when it needs to be, and it's less rewarding when it doesn't. I'm really happy with how that turned out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Given how much Phasmophobia has changed since its launch half a decade ago, have you ever considered starting from scratch with a sequel?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>I wouldn't write it off. It would be a fun challenge to see if we could do another one. There are a lot of things that I know we would change as a company if we went into Phas fresh. There's definitely things we would all probably say, 'Oh, let's not do that!' Or 'that would be awesome. We should do that instead.' So, yeah, you never know. It's definitely not off the cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What about a Nintendo Switch 2 version?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We want what's best for the game, and if the opportunity arises, we'd love to. But there's no news or anything I can share. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Before we go — the Blumhouse movie adaptation. How can Phasmophobia's genre-defining gameplay translate to a movie?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We've got a really good partnership with Blumhouse. It's brilliant. It <em>will</em> be a Phasmophobia film, it won't just be a ghost hunting film — we're going to make sure it's a film that fans want to watch, and we're going to work with them really closely. They're really willing to work with us, and, obviously, we want to work with them. So yeah, we've got a really good partnership, and I think fans are going to love it when it comes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Phasmophobia's Grafton Farmhouse reworked map is now live across all platforms, including PC via Steam, PS5, PS VR2, and Xbox Series X and S.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

As a new set of high-difficulty quests, 9★ monsters will start appearing when you are HR 100 or higher.</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting with Ver. 1.021, Tempered Monsters (9★) of nine monster species will begin appearing in locales.<br>Following that, our third title update in late September will see additional 9★ monsters appear in event quests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For veteran players who have experienced end-game content in previous Monster Hunter titles, we understand that the difficulty of Tempered Monsters at launch may have felt lacking. Therefore, starting with Title Update 2, we've introduced a system for more detailed monster parameter customization, as well as other adjustments to ensure a challenging and rewarding experience.</p><strong>2. We're adding the Glowing Stone appraisal item as a quest reward for quests with 9★ monsters.</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon quest completion, the Glowing Stone appraisal item — a quest reward for quests with 9★ monsters — will transform into an Appraised Talisman with randomly assigned skills.<br>Unlike other talismans which can be crafted and upgraded at the Smithy, Appraised Talismans cannot be upgraded. However, they can be randomly granted not only armor skills but weapon skills and decoration slots (both weapon skill and armor skill decoration slots), allowing for more customization and experimentation with builds. We hope this leads to more engaging gameplay and encourages hunters to try different weapons and armor based on the talismans they obtain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, we recognized that end-game content early after the game's release was slightly skewed around Arkveld. This, combined with the fact that Arkveld is relatively resistant to elements, resulted in limited opportunities to try out diverse builds. In response, we have adjusted the difficulty, average hunting time, and rewards for each of the 9★ monsters being added in an effort to ensure that all monsters offer balanced rewards fitting with the effort spent hunting them. We encourage you to select your hunts based on your own individual skill, equipment, or needs, and enjoy each challenge.</p><strong>9★ Monster Adjustments</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">In light of the addition of 9★ monsters, we've lengthened the duration of meal effects so that they're less likely to expire if the hunts go on a little long. We also raised the upgrade limit for armor of rarity 5 or above, so that players can squeeze in a little more defense before they go up against these challenging new monsters.<br>Additionally, from HR 100 and higher, Rey Dau and Nu Udra will now appear in the Wounded Hollow, and each region's apex predator will be more likely to appear even with that region is not experiencing an inclemency.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Title Update 3
</strong>As mentioned previously, Title Update 3 will see the gradual introduction of 9★ monsters in Event Quests as well.<br>We are also adjusting the strength of support hunters in line with the addition of 9★ monsters. We apologize that the timing of these adjustments are in stages and come after the implementation of the monsters themselves, but we hope you understand that this is a result of expediting the monster implementation.<br>In order to diversify the lineup of quests, we are working to make it possible for Lagiacrus to appear in the Wounded Hollow, as well as other additions such as more hunts targeting packs of monsters. We are also implementing adjustments to improve gameplay convenience, such as preventing monsters from spontaneously destroying pop-up camps and resetting the cooldown for mantles upon beginning a quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, we can also assure you that any new monsters added in Title Update 3 will also feature 9★ difficulty quests.<br>We hope you look forward to the new contents for Title Update 3, and that in the meantime you can enjoy the new additions from Ver. 1.021 to strengthen your equipment and collect Appraised Talismans in preparation for the challenging hunts ahead.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Weapon Balance Changes</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously announced, we had been planning balance adjustments for 5 weapon types. However, in the end we have expanded the scope and will be implementing adjustments (upward adjustments) for 11 total weapon types.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Affected Weapon Types:
</strong>Great Sword, Long Sword, Sword &amp; Shield, Dual Blades, Hunting Horn, Lance, Switch Axe, Charge Blade, Insect Glaive, Light Bowgun, Heavy Bowgun</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bug Fixes Only: </strong>Gunlance, Bow</p><strong>Overall Direction</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">In previous updates, we aimed for greater diversity in hunting styles and equipment builds, including equipment with elemental properties. We performed balance adjustments, including some downward adjustments, to ensure no single strategy was overly effective against monsters introduced later on. However, this resulted in some hunting styles becoming less viable and certain weapon types experiencing lower-than-intended viability.<br>We apologize for the results and that we did not communicate our balancing intentions clearly enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This update will mitigate the excessive downward adjustments made in Title Update 2, and will focus on enhancing each weapon type's individuality while strengthening their ability to face high-difficulty monsters planned in the future. We will be implementing upward adjustments for 11 weapon types.</p><strong>Revisiting Downward Adjustments</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">For sword &amp; shield, charge blade, light bowgun, and heavy bowgun, we will be revisiting the downward adjustments made in Title Update 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sword &amp; Shield
</strong>In Wilds, we've been particularly focused on making the weapon easy to handle even for beginners, making adjustments to its moveset so that a certain level of damage can be dealt with any action.<br>Among these, the damage output of some actions was found to be too high in relation to their ease of use when compared to other weapon types. Therefore, we made some downward adjustments in Title Update 2.<br>Among those adjustments, we found that the downward adjustment to Guard Slash reduced the usage frequency of Counter Slash, so we're applying a slight power increase to Guard Slash to compensate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Charge Blade
</strong>In Title Update 2, we aimed to balance Amped Element Discharge so that it could offer another reliable source of damage beyond multi-hit attacks in Axe Mode. However, the adjustment resulted in less power than intended, and also failed to expand player options.<br>To address this, we revisited these adjustments and made it so that increased damage via enhanced phials is reflected while in Power Axe Mode, making it easier to maintain high damage output while keeping Power Axe Mode active.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Light Bowgun &amp; Heavy Bowgun
</strong>In the Ver. 1.011 update, we introduced downwards adjustments to elemental and pierce ammo to prevent them from being overpowered against future high-difficulty monsters, like the recently-introduced Arch-tempered Uth Duna, and to ensure that a variety of weapon types were viable. However, we're reviewing this change and will be slightly increasing the power of elemental ammo for light bowguns.<br>We will also relax the downward adjustment to the amount of rapid fire and ignition gauge recovery when using pierce ammo. Finally, we'll increase the amount of gauge recovery for various ammo types and improve the handling and power of special ammo in order to expand viable ammo selections for more situations.</p><strong>Other Weapons</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">We will perform some upward adjustments for weapons like the great sword and insect glaive as well, which previously have not been the subject of balance changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For dual blades, we focused on improving usability, such as making Demon Boost Mode easier to maintain and making Focus Strikes easier to use. In particular, based on player feedback, we added a Focus Strike action (which can be chained into others) that provides another option for continuing attacks without changing your position.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have implemented upwards adjustments for each weapon type, focusing on expanding playstyle options. We encourage hunters to try each of the weapons out again after the update is live.<br>Details on the adjustments made for each weapon type will be included in Guild Reports on our official social media accounts, so please check the reports for more information that we weren't able to share here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also plan to adjust some series skills that were previously difficult to use, with the overall goal of increasing equipment build options.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Efforts to Improve Game Stability</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We'd also like to touch on our efforts to improve game stability, particularly for the Steam version, in response to numerous player comments.</p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">We are currently aware of an issue across all platforms where the game may crash when a player gesture, such as the Water Gun gesture, hits another player at the same time that a specific type of communication error has occurred.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We plan to fix this issue in the Ver. 1.021 update.<br>We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and ask that you please wait a little longer for the fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We are strengthening our checking system to prevent game crashes caused by issues on the application side. In the event that a bug is found, we will investigate and fix it promptly.</p><strong>CPU Usage Optimization (Steam Version)</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">In Title Update 2, we fixed bugs related to shader compilation and reduced the impact of anti-cheat measures on processing load by about 90%. In addition, as an option to reduce CPU load while improving frame rate, we implemented support for the latest super-resolution technologies, DLSS4 and FSR4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, in Title Update 2 we improved our texture loading process, reducing instances where low-quality textures are displayed when monsters suddenly enter the player's field of view.<br>Title Update 3 will see similar improvements for NPCs and Seikret mounts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Future Plans
</strong>In general, increasing the native frame rate will also increase CPU usage. If the frame rate limit is set to unlimited or a high value in the options, CPU performance will be maximized(*) in the attempt to increase the frame rate, which may result in a very high CPU usage. Please adjust your graphics options to limit the frame rate in accordance with your hardware's specifications.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">*In cases where GPU performance is bottlenecked, CPU performance may not be fully utilized.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We are aware that some players may be concerned about the potential strain on their PCs, particularly those using CPUs known to have stability issues (as reported by various manufacturers), due to prolonged high CPU usage during extended play sessions.<br>On the other hand, as making changes to CPU processing could affect the game's overall performance, we plan to proceed with caution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In regards to CPU load reduction, we plan to address this issue in the fourth title update scheduled for this winter. Once the initial implementation is complete, we will proceed with a second stage of further mitigation measures.<br>We will also address GPU load reduction in a similar manner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We will continue to work on improving the game's stability so that more players can enjoy the game on PC with peace of mind. Thank you for your understanding.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Looking Ahead!</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all of you who have provided us with valuable feedback and requests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We will continue to share the development team's progress on these through our Guild Reports. For detailed information on adjustments, including those we were unable to cover in this update, please refer to our <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official social media accounts</a> and <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note: Information will be published on our social media accounts first, and later posted on our official website as well. For the absolute latest, please check social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We will continue to make various fixes and adjustments through future updates, as well as implement additional exciting new content.<br>We also plan to address improvements that were not included in the Ver. 1.021 update in future title updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Please also look forward to more details we'll be announcing soon about Title Update 3, scheduled for release at the end of September.<br>For our fourth title update this winter, on top of new monsters, we are also considering additional weapon-related end-game features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll continue to work hard to make Monster Hunter Wilds as enjoyable as possible for hunters throughout the world. Thank you for your continued support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
