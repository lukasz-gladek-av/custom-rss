I haven't touched Bloodborne Remake for a year for 50 reasons (too big, too risky to finally be C&amp;D).</p><p> But last week I decided to start a new project from scratch, Bloodborne Top Down Arena</p><p>Maybe you won't like it, but I'm enjoying developing it and playing it üòÇ <a href="https://t.co/OPont0sS45" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/OPont0sS45</a></p></div>‚Äî Maxime Foulquier (@MaximFoulquier) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853835793388953662?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay looks very much as you‚Äôd expect: FromSoftware‚Äôs hugely popular Bloodborne but with the camera pulled up into an action RPG perspective. The repurposed Bloodborne combat is action RPG snappy, perhaps a good fit for a Diablo-style game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Foulquier <a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1853834672347758739" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> Bloodborne Top Down Arena is "less ambitious and different from a true remake‚Äù of Bloodborne, so hopes it will avoid falling into the crosshairs of Sony‚Äôs lawyers. ‚ÄúThe Demake and the Minecraft Project didn't receive CnD so I cross the fingers,‚Äù Foulquier added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs worth noting that the developer behind Bloodborne Nightmare Kart <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nightmare-kart-bloodborne-kart-release-date">ended up re-jipping the game after Sony got in touch</a>, so perhaps Foulquier is being a little naive here. Foulquier insisted, however, that because Bloodborne Top Down Arena is not planned for release on Steam, it will avoid a similar fate.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah but I don't want to release this on Steam.</p>‚Äî Maxime Foulquier (@MaximFoulquier) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1854087594008617080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, what Bloodborne fans really want is a sequel to the PS4 classic, or, saving that, a next-gen update for the original game. Neither are so far announced from either FromSoftware or Sony. In February, ahead of the launch of FromSoftware‚Äôs Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">director Hidetaka Miyazaki said that because the developer doesn‚Äôt own the Bloodborne IP</a>, he can‚Äôt speak about its future. He did, however, admit Bloodborne would benefit from releasing on more modern hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps5-pro-can-you-see-the-difference">IGN has had a look at Bloodborne running on the PS5 Pro</a>, which launches November 7 priced $700. And then there‚Äôs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-no-bloodborne-remake-but-there-is-a-bloodborne-outfit-for-astro-bot">the Bloodborne cameo in recently released PS5 exclusive Astro Bot</a>, if you‚Äôre desperate for a fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Once players have collected one of each of these Pok√©mon the 3 Star Mew card will unlock.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/06/mew-1730901811705.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The 3 Star Mew card in Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only condition is the cards must also be from Genetic Apex, meaning, for example, that collecting the promotional Butterfree card from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">the special Lapras ex event</a> won't count towards the 150 total despite it being among the first 150 Pok√©mon. Any version of the Pok√©mon from Genetic Apex will work, however, whether it's an ex or alternative art or regular or whatever else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While simple, collecting so many cards may still take some time. One player recently worked out it could take almost two years of daily play to collect every card in the set, though thankfully hitting the 150 necessary for Mew will require considerably less time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mew holds a special place in the set as one of just four 3 Star cards, meaning it's one of the special immersive cards with fully animated artwork. It joins Charizard, Pikachu, and Mewtwo in this category, the three Pok√©mon which feature on the booster pack covers of Genetic Apex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pok√©mon TCG Pocket arrived in October as a streamlined, digital version of the beloved trading card game. It has players opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others;</a> a simple formula that's already proved popular given it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">$12 million in four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players may otherwise want to keep an eye out from cards from the two decks currently dominating the Pok√©mon TCG Pocket meta, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">headlined by usual suspects Charizard ex and Mewtwo ex</a>.
