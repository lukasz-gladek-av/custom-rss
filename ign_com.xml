This also mean said chase cards are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-cards-2025">worth significantly less</a>, but Japanese cards are far easier to get perfect grades in given they're always busting out of booster packs in perfect condition. Want a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Pokémon card collection</a> on a budget?

Whilst that unfortunately means it's still way above MSRP, some of these sets are at the best prices they've been in the last month.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet base set prices have been shifting noticeably ahead of the final sets Black Bolt and White Flare, with Psychic-type Illustration Rares like Ralts 211/198 and Kirlia 212/198 each climbing 28 percent this month while Gardevoir ex 245/198 now sits at $54.99 after a 25 percent jump. Miraidon ex and Koraidon ex are both trending upward as well, holding value around $23.99 each. At the same time several cards are sliding down as Fidough 213/198 dropped 15 percent, Armarouge 203/198 is down 11 percent, and Pachirisu 208/198 fell 19 percent. The steepest dips hit Dondozo 207/198 and Starly 221/198, now around $9.99 each after dropping 30 percent and 37 percent respectively, reflecting a market that is narrowing in on long-term playability and collector interest.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As newer Pokémon TCG sets grab the spotlight, Paradox Rift is seeing its high-rarity SIR ex cards drop in value while several Illustration Rares quietly climb due to shifting collector interest and low inventory. Cards like Altaria ex, Gholdengo ex, and Steelix have dropped between 16% and 25%, while Illustration Rares including Morpeko, Plusle, Minun, Groudon, and Iron Valiant ex are climbing fast, with Morpeko leading at a 43% increase. This mirrors earlier trends where less flashy cards gain traction as availability tightens.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Edge of Eternities Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering’s next set, Edge of Eternities, officially launches August 1 with preorders now live on Amazon for bundles including Play Booster Boxes, Commander Decks, and Collector Booster Boxes.

Fan-favorite tribes like Eldrazi and Slivers return alongside reprints of coveted Shock Lands. Wizards of the Coast is gradually revealing more details, with a full card gallery arriving July 18 and prerelease events happening July 25 through 31, so now is the time to lock in your preorder if you want first access.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Pricing Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a bit of a mixed back for Magic: The Gathering prices this week, so it's always worth double checking eBay before TCG Player and Amazon for a last minute bargain.

I grew up playing these games, so jumping back in with the ability to duel online and unlock classic cards feels pretty great. The save-anywhere feature makes it easy to squeeze in a match during a break and come back to it later. I also like that you can rewind or fast forward during duels which makes testing out new strategies a lot more flexible.</p></div><p id="superman-blu-ray-digital"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)">Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225245"><div id="225245" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I was hoping to grab the steelbook edition of Superman but it looks like that’s already sold out. The standard Blu-ray is still available though if you’re just looking to watch the movie without the collectible packaging. James Gunn delivers a Superman story that feels fresh while staying true to the character. There’s a solid balance of action, humor, and heart, and it sets a strong tone for what’s next in the DCU. If you’re into superhero movies that keep things grounded while still feeling big and cinematic, this one’s worth picking up.</p></div><p id="split-fiction-ps5"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Split Fiction (PS5)">Split Fiction (PS5)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225246"><div id="225246" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Split Fiction (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Split Fiction on PS5 recently and it’s been a great pick for co-op sessions. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">We gave it a 9 out of 10</a> and after playing it I can see why. It focuses on split-screen teamwork where you and a partner have to sync your actions to clear each challenge. I really like how each level introduces new mechanics and switches between sci-fi and fantasy settings so it never feels repetitive. Mio and Zoe’s story adds some extra depth too since they do not get along at first but that dynamic makes the whole adventure feel more personal as things ramp up.</p></div><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds">Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225247"><div id="225247" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features. At $199, they offer a strong balance of value and performance. The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switc">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225248"><div id="225248" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake</a> caught my attention for how it brings that classic RPG feel into a modern format. At $34.99, it’s a pretty big discount compared to the usual price, which makes it an easy pick if you’ve been waiting to try it. The HD-2D visuals really stand out with that mix of pixel art and depth that makes the world feel fresh but still familiar. Battles stick to the traditional turn-based system but with small updates like adjustable speed and auto-battle, so it doesn’t feel stuck in the past. The soundtrack ties it all together with that same timeless vibe DRAGON QUEST fans already know.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-illustrated-t"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (T">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225249"><div id="225249" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Edition feels like more than just a regular hardcover.

FromSoftware is sending out its next set of enhanced bosses, the Everdark Sovereigns, for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> at the end of this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next four Everdark Sovereigns will arrive as part of a "new Everdark cycle" in Limveld, starting on July 31. The four bosses up for upgrades this time are Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast, and Fissure in the Fog.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the past Everdark Sovereigns, FromSoftware has adhered to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-bringing-back-its-first-set-of-everdark-bosses-before-the-next-sovereigns-arrive">weekly release schedule</a>. Though it's unconfirmed whether the rollout will be the same again, or which Everdark Sovereign will be the first to arrive, <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1946208540416168293" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FromSoft's teaser image</a> does show Libra, the Equilibrious Beast fight, ready for battle.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The veil thins, and the Night hungers still.</p><p>On July 31, 2025, a new Everdark cycle shall begin; the enhanced Nightlords Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog will soon unleash their darkest powers upon Limveld.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#NIGHTREIGN</a> <a href="https://t.co/IN71Mm53ux" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IN71Mm53ux</a></p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1946208540416168293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">I'm curious to see if this affects Libra's Faustian bargain mechanic at all, but even putting aside a deal with a devil, these could be some fearsome fights. Tricephalos isn't exactly a pushover, and the Fissure in the Fog battle already has some pretty strong mechanics that often catch newer players unaware. More powerful versions of these bosses could get interesting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, it seems like the Everdark Sovereigns have been well-received. Though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-players-dont-seem-to-be-having-as-much-trouble-with-its-second-enhanced-boss">their difficulty levels vary</a> depending on the upgrades and enhancements each one gets, it does seem like FromSoftware has found interesting ways to remix each of the main bosses of Elden Ring Nightreign.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The update cadence for Elden Ring Nightreign has felt akin to Monster Hunter, in that way. Since launch, there's been a steady, even stream of patches and "enhanced" content, gradually raising the difficulty ceiling in the process.
