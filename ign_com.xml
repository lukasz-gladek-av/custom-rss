            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The brainchild of Mike Pondsmith back in 1988 as a TTRPG, Cyberpunk as a property has exploded in the past decade, thanks in no small part to CD Projekt Red and 2020's release of their first-person RPG, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Now, five years and expansions, patches, and board games later, the world of Cyberpunk is trying its robotic hands in a brand new – and highly competitive – market with a fully fledged, and collectible, <strong>Cyberpunk: Trading Card Game</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has had the opportunity to speak with the teams at WeirdCo and CD Projekt Red, who are working on the newly announced TCG, to get a better understanding of the designers at WeirdCo, how this partnership came to be, and even some goodies about the game itself. We've also got an <strong>exclusive first look</strong> at key card art from the Cyberpunk TCG <strong>(flip through the gallery below)</strong>, featuring Cyberpunk 2077's Saburo and Yorinobu Arasaka, and their handy bodyguard, Goro Takemura. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">WeirdCo, a new face in the world of TCGs, has been working in close partnership with CDPR themselves to devise this new card game, aiming to capture the tone and aesthetic of 2077 and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/cyberpunk-edgerunners">Edgerunners' Netflix anime</a>, to deliver a game that doesn't just feel like another TCG just with a coat of Cyberpunk yellow overtop. One way the team is doing this is by working with high-profile artists, both internal to CDPR and the wider community, to deliver gorgeous card art featuring faces that will be familiar to anyone worth their wait in Chrome. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking with Elliot Cook (WeirdCo President) and Luohan Wei (WeirdCo CEO), both co-founders of the business, I wanted to know how this new studio came about. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elliot began, "WeirdCo was formed when Luohan and I met each other through our mutual mentor, Bill Mooney: a true legend in the digital gaming space. We immediately hit it off over our passion for building games that truly connect with their communities. Later, we formed WeirdCo to create games together — ones that authentically bring together and inspire people." </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Players can look forward to collecting an array of unique variants of characters including V, Johnny, Panam, Judy, Adam Smasher, and more."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"CD Projekt Red has a similar goal, and when we saw this in each other we knew it would be a great partnership. What has been paramount, and the question we ask ourselves daily, is “how do we make a game that represents and celebrates every part of Cyberpunk — everywhere it has been and everywhere it is going?" That is the north star of our development."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Cyberpunk being one of the biggest media properties right now, I was curious how a brand new group could tackle such a monster IP, but despite it being a new team, the group working on the Cyberpunk TCG has worked on other large IP card games you probably have heard of. "We at WeirdCo have direct experience working on some great card games" Elliot explains. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Marvel Snap, Duel Masters, and Universus, to name a few. At our core we are disruptors, just like CD Projekt Red, and we both strive to inspire our players. We saw this in each other from the beginning, and I think CD Projekt Red saw our love for the Cyberpunk 2077 universe too. This is an IP that deserves to be explored in different and exciting ways, and we’re committed to doing this authentically with Cyberpunk TCG, side by side with the community."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of CD Projekt Red, they have been a constant ally during the game’s design and development. Elliot provides further details, "We have worked with CD Projekt Red very closely since the beginning of development. They have been the ideal partner; you may even see the same amazing artists who worked on Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and more as featured artists in Cyberpunk TCG! Every part of the TCG has the impeccable RED touch, ensuring this is a completely authentic Cyberpunk experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Cyberpunk TCG won’t be CDPR’s first collaboration in the tabletop space, with other titles like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-board-game-review"><u>Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City</u></a> and <a href="https://review/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Cyberpunk Edgerunners: Combat Zone Board Game</u></a>, but I was curious what unique joys or challenges came from working on a TCG, so I asked Patrick Mills, CDPR’s Franchise Content Strategy Lead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every collaboration is unique, and we’re lucky to work with many partners who are passionate and extremely dedicated to their crafts. While making a physical TCG is something completely new for us, we see the genuine excitement, enthusiasm, and talent in WeirdCo that act as the foundation of any successful collaboration." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Their passion for the franchise has been evident at every stage, and they’re doing an incredible job developing an engaging TCG that ensures an authentic Cyberpunk experience. On the flip side, many of us at CD Projekt Red are huge TCG enthusiasts too — so we’re thrilled to be entering this space with WeirdCo"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that is clear is that both teams at WeirdCo and CDPR are taking care to ensure that this is faithful to the Cyberpunk property that its creator, Mike Pondsmith, imagined back in 1988. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"For the initial release, our primary goal is to represent the core identity of Cyberpunk 2077"</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want Cyberpunk TCG to be authentic to the spirit and dynamic nature of the Cyberpunk 2077 universe, and wanted to create a TCG that is accessible to Cyberpunk fans who have never touched a card game.” Luohan says, “At the same time, as TCG players ourselves, we wanted our game to have the depth necessary to entertain for a long, long time. And I think we have struck that balance well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elliot continues, "The best part of this job is spending hundreds of hours with the Cyberpunk universe — whether that’s replaying Cyberpunk 2077, watching Edgerunners for the fifth time, or reading all the Dark Horse comics. Every one of us at WeirdCo loves the Cyberpunk universe, and we built the TCG bit by bit on this foundation. At each step we analyzed every little detail, constantly asking ourselves: "How do we make this more authentic to Cyberpunk?" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fan favorite characters will be making an appearance as well in this TCG and picking who would be included in this first set was a big decision. "For the initial release, our primary goal is to represent the core identity of Cyberpunk 2077 by featuring many of its most iconic and beloved characters,” explains Patrick. “We’ve collaborated closely with WeirdCo to ensure that the artwork and flavor of every card faithfully captures the essence of who they represent, providing a snapshot of their personalities and what they stand for, as well as including memorable moments players will instantly recognize. Given the complexity of our characters, we wanted to capture their many facets across multiple cards. So, players can look forward to collecting an array of unique variants of characters including V, Johnny, Panam, Judy, Adam Smasher, and more."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the WeirdCo side, Elliot shares, "We worked very hard to figure out which Legends make the most sense for players, and which ones make the most sense for the overall theme of Set 1. While some of them, like V and Johnny, are obvious hits, we have a few surprises up our sleeves too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Being a game composed of a ton of cards, artwork is pretty important in a TCG and WeirdCo is special care to make sure that what players can expect is nothing short of beautiful. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve been working for a long time with a team of over 20 talented artists for Set 1, and are excited to explore new ways of bringing the world of Cyberpunk to life through our card art. Working with artists like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itoscaresme/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ito</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vincenzo_riccardi_vinartwork/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincenzo Riccardi</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jsraphael_/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua Raphael</a>, who each bring their own unique flair to the project, makes each card more exciting than the last," Elliot continues, "We’re not sharing gameplay details yet, so there’s not too much I can say. But Cyberpunk is known for its beautiful yet tragic atmosphere — this is a major focus of ours when it comes to the card art."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Details on how Cyberpunk TCG will work remain shrouded behind CDPR's and WeirdCo's firewalls, so we have a bit yet before we have an in-depth picture of how it plays. Cyberpunk's TCG will be launching its crowdfunding campaign in 2026, which is right around the corner. WeirdCo and CDPR will be revealing more of the game soon, along with a deep dive into how the game plays, more artwork, and card reveals, with some more special reveals found only here on IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The TCG space is pretty crowded with new contenders entering the ring, it seems like every quarter or so, but few have the name recognition behind them like WeirdCo has with Cyberpunk. The fact that this project has so much support from CD Projekt Red behind it puts it in a different league from others, even before it's out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The excitement from the designers is electric, with Luohan leaving players with this, “I can’t wait for players to see how we’ve adapted the themes of Cyberpunk, like taking on gigs or building a crew, to a trading card game format. I think it is both true to Cyberpunk itself while being innovative to the TCG market as a whole; it’s a perfect combination in this way.” As far as I know, no other TCG lets you play with Keanu Reeves, so that is already a big plus in its favor. Wake up, Samurai, there's a whole new way to burn the city coming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this sounds up your alley, follow the game and get yourself a special and exclusive Lucy "Nova Rare" card free by signing up over on the game's <a href="https://www.launchoracle.com/weird-co/cyberpunk-trading-card-game/MF7J3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Launch Oracle page</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.
