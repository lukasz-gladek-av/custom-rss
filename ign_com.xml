But the studio remains determined, and wants to convince DeVito to star as a gun in High on Life 3 — should it get the chance to make it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</a> waiting in the wings, Squanch Games’ Mikey Spano and Matty Studivan told IGN in an interview at gamescom 2025 that they are going to give Danny DeVito another go when they eventually get to making what feels like the inevitable third game in the comedy first-person shooter series.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/22/gettyimages-2222393146-1755862978754.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Could Danny DeVito play a gun in High on Life 3?

But I’m hoping after this game we can try again and get him in there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have the perfect design for a Danny DeVito gun in my head that I want to see so bad!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why didn’t DeVito work out for High on Life? According to executive producer Matty Studivan, it was felt that DeVito would have been so unlikely to say yes, that it wasn't even worth the ask.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Studivan said: “I believe the response we got was, ‘We would take this to him but his agent doesn’t even know if he’ll understand what it is, and he’ll probably just say no.’ We’re gonna try really hard on the next one."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spano then issued the call: “Danny DeVito, reach out! We’re ready for ya!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether Danny DeVito appears in High on Life 3 or not, Squanch Games has a more pressing matter: High on Life 2. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-2-release-date-revealed-for-february-2026">As announced at gamescom</a>, the sequel launches February 13, 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S and Game Pass day-one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fantastic Four: First Steps’ Galactus actor Ralph Ineson plays Sheath, a new character and boss, and is joined on the cast by Betsy Sodaro, J.B.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> a soulslike? It’s a question <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-knows-what-a-soulslike-is-silent-hill-f-sparks-heated-debate-within-the-fandom">the Silent Hill fandom has been debating for some time now</a>. But in a recent interview with IGN, Konami insisted it's not, and expressed a degree of frustration with the ongoing debate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan, where we follow Hinako Shimizu, a teenager struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society. As IGN reported in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours">Silent Hill f hands-on preview</a>, its combat has a similar feel to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake</u></a>’s close-range combat. You can dodge enemy attacks with the DualSense’s circle button and activate a light and heavy attack with R1 and R2, respectively. Your limited reach and lengthy attack motions give a realistic, weighty feel to combat. Heavy attacks, especially, feel slow and need to be timed well, "contributing to the feeling that Hinako is just a teenager with limited strength."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, Silent Hill f’s combat also features timed dodges and counterattacks, with the latter particularly important in combat sequences. Enemies briefly show a sign when a counterattack can be utilized, but we suggested that "unless you have trained your reflex skills by playing games like of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice"><u>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</u></a>, you will likely have a hard time reacting." That’s where the Focus mode comes in, which can be triggered by holding L2. It allows counterattacks to last longer, while also charging up a power attack that staggers an enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talk of parries and counterattacks has come as a surprise to some Silent Hill fans, and Konami’s suggestion that Silent Hill f's combat sequences were ratcheted up because "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-is-combat-heavy-because-challenging-action-games-are-gaining-popularity-among-younger-players-nowadays"><u>challenging action games are gaining popularity among younger players nowadays</u></a>" has split the fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in an interview with IGN at gamescom 2025, Silent Hill producer Motoi Okamoto set the record straight. He insisted Silent Hill f is not a soulslike, despite the mechanics at play in its combat, and even said applying that label to the game is "disingenuous."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is one of the things that we see — the term soulslike — being thrown around on the internet quite a bit,” he began. “And I think it’s a label that’s a little bit disingenuous. Modern players will see like, oh there’s a stamina meter, there’s a dodge, and they're like, ‘Okay, it’s a soulslike.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But to be very honest, a lot of these things we actually pulled from classic Silent Hill titles. Look at Silent Hill 4 — there’s a charge meter for your attacks, kind of like our Focus meter. And even for Silent Hill 3 there's a stamina meter. You see it later on.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okamoto went on to say Silent Hill f’s combat mechanics aren’t exclusive to the soulslike genre, expressing a degree of frustration with the online dialogue surrounding the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These things aren’t new and exclusive to soulslike games,” he said. “They’ve been a part of action horror games for a very, very long time. If you have these things you’re labeled a soulslike. And we’d like to reiterate we are an action horror game, but we are not a soulslike.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f comes out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft declined to comment</a> on a <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> in French financial newspaper Les Echoes that detailed a deal between Ubisoft and Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund for additional Mirage content. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's confirmation that Mirage will soon get content set in 9th century Saudi Arabia therefore makes sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the location itself, AlUla seems a natural fit for an Assassin's Creed game, as an UNESCO World Heritage site with more than 7,000 years of history and towering rock formations that look perfect for a spot of Assassin's Creed parkour.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Assassin's Creed Mirage players, we have a surprise coming your way later this year!</p><p> 📖 New story chapter &amp; missions set in 9th century AlUla<br>🎮 Gameplay improvements for the base game and the new location<br>🎁 All for free</p><p> Stay tuned! <a href="https://t.co/8CjB3MRvfR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8CjB3MRvfR</a></p></div>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Launched in 2023, Assassin's Creed Mirage arrived as something of a palate cleanser between the epic Viking-set Valhalla and this year's similarly enormous Assassin's Creed Shadows. Mirage returned to the Assassin's Creed franchise's smaller, stealthier city-set roots for an adventure that felt inspired by the series' initial game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Ubisoft Bordeaux, the game originally began life as an expansion for Valhalla focused on its mysterious Assassin character Basim, someone who ends up playing a pivotal role in the events of that game's finale. Fans had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-developers-discuss-series-modern-day-future-basim-and-why-theres-no-new-isu-artifact">subsequently hoped to see more from the character</a>, though it's unclear if this add-on will include any new answers to his ultimate fate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Mirage was released, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creeds-wild-meta-story-might-be-getting-even-stranger-soon">players found an odd post-credits scene hidden in the game's files</a> that Ubisoft has since acknowledged, though never fully explained. Perhaps this too will finally be addressed in Mirage's upcoming new content, more details of which will follow in the weeks to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-expansion-claws-of-awaji-release-date-revealed">Assassin's Creed Shadows, meanwhile, is the game's big Claws of Awaji expansion</a>, curiously also developed by Ubisoft Bordeaux, that's due for launch on September 16.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many different ways to experience The Witcher these days. My own entry point into this world was playing through the first Witcher game back when it first came out in 2007. But it wasn't until The Witcher 3 that I really felt the depth of the story. I loved exploring the world, playing Gwent, and getting an up close and personal look at Geralt's complicated love life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I got a similar feeling with the first couple of seasons of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-witcher">The Witcher series on Netflix</a>, but now that Henry Cavill has left the show I find myself mostly just looking forward to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">next Witcher game</a> in the franchise. Since that game is still years away, however, I've been recently looking into The Witcher TTRPG as a potential new way to experience that world. It's currently only $15 for a six-book bundle at Humble Bundle and it certainly looks intriguing at that price.</p><div catalogid="af01313a-a9f9-4c39-b028-cf6df9563c2e" id="227219"><div id="227219" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Six digital books included</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Witcher TTRPG Bundle</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">What comes with this bundle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This Witcher TTRPG bundle includes a total of six books. You can get the full bundle by spending $15 or you can choose to pay more and support charity. According to the website, this bundle supports <a href="https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Children's Miracle Network Hospitals</a>. Here's all of the digital books included with your purchase:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Witcher TTRPG Core Rulebook</li><li>The Witcher: A Book of Tales</li><li>The Witcher: Tome of Chaos</li><li>The Witcher: A Witcher's Journal</li><li>The Witcher: Lords &amp; Lands</li><li>The Witcher TTRPG - Easy Mode</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Is The Witcher TTRPG worth playing?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher Tabletop RPG was created by <a href="https://rtalsoriangames.com/witcher-trpg/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R. Talsorian Games</a> in collaboration with CD Projekt Red. The core game is set somewhere between <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings">The Witcher 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> on the video game timeline. Since I haven't had the chance to play the game myself, I did a bit of digging into reviews and Reddit threads to see if it's worth playing. The <a href="https://spritesanddice.com/reviews/witcher-ttrpg-review/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most comprehensive review</a> I could find comes from a site called Sprites and Dice. The author goes into a lot of detail about the core rule book and subsequent books available while looking at it through the lens of an experienced D&amp;D player. I recommend checking that out if you need a deeper look at what you'll get with this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a pretty <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/fd9ecn/opinions_on_the_witcher_ttrpg/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helpful Reddit thread</a> I found where multiple people have given their thoughts about this TTRPG. A common theme throughout that is that those who actually played it enjoyed it overall. One user complimented the character creation involved while pointing out the imbalances in some of the classes. Basically, if you don't decide to be a Witcher or a Mage you won't get the chance to engage with the full rulebook.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Disclosure</strong></em><em>: Humble Bundle is part of IGN Entertainment, the division of Ziff Davis that includes GamesIndustry.biz, IGN, and MapGenie.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 22, 2025 11:45 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-tabletop-rpg-books-are-only-15-at-humble-bundle-right-now]]></content:encoded>
