            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-is-doing-a-fire-type-event-but-its-not-exactly-setting-the-community-ablaze<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning when I woke up I, like every other well-adjusted individual, immediately silenced my alarm and started Pokémon TCG Pocket to open my morning pack. Lo and behold, I discovered that a brand new event had been introduced to the game overnight. It's a "Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event." And it's. Fine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This fire-type event seemingly came out of nowhere as a pleasant surprise today, and it includes a few different elements. There's a new set of Missions to complete with various rewards, all largely revolving around collecting certain fire-type Pokémon. There are new event-based Wonder Picks, including one that will let you select from five desirable fire-type cards and another that rewards either a fire-type card or currency. And there's a limited-time flair you can purchase for certain cards that gives them a fiery effect. Neat!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As fun as it was to wake up to a surprise event, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gx188l/fire_event_is_now_live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reaction</a> from the community so far is... lukewarm, to say the least. This is not the most exciting event! The mission rewards aren't amazing for one, and they require players to complete them with cards obtained during the event. So, for instance, one of the missions is to obtain an Arcanine ex card. I already have one of those. But that doesn't count, because I had it before the event started. So I have to obtain a second one during the event in order to finish the achievement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obtaining those cards is supposed to be easier due to the Wonder Pick options, but the hourly free Wonder Pick only has a smaller chance of actually getting a card instead of currency, and the other Wonder Pick that includes five different cards costs a whopping three stamina. For those who don't play Pocket: this means players either need to wait for very long periods of time to get a chance of obtaining the card they want, or they have to spend real money to roll the dice more frequently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, there's the event flair. It works how all other flairs work - you need to exchange a currency called Shinedust as well as an unusable duplicate of the card you want the flair on to obtain it. That means, for instance, if you want to obtain the event flair for an Arcanine ex, you need not one, not two, but <em>three </em>Arcanine exes sitting around, and then you can exchange the spare one for the flair. Sure, your chances of getting that Arcanine ex are higher thanks to the event Wonder Pick... but, oh, did I mention that the event only lasts five days?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's admittedly hard to complain here, given that this was a totally unexpected event that really only gives players a few extra chances at some fire-type cards they might want. But in recent days, the Pokémon TCG Pocket community has been getting restless. Community members have been increasingly complaining that there's just not a lot to do after a certain point beyond waiting to open new packs twice a day. Some players are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-have-made-their-own-battle-format-that-bans-ex-monsters">inventing their own battle formats to pass the time</a>, but at the moment, event activities are the main form of entertainment in Pocket. The previous water-type event included a bunch of PvE battles with cards to earn from them, so the fire-type event not including something similar is a bit perplexing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, this seems more like a stopgap between the water-type event and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-is-getting-more-booster-packs-before-2025">upcoming expected new booster pack releases</a>. For now, we'll just have to keep opening packs while we wait for something new to happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Because the moon theory was proved true for Trailer 1. Two months before Trailer 1 came out, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/excitement-for-rockstars-gta-6-reveal-is-sending-fans-to-the-moon">Rockstar released a GTA Online image that included the moon</a> in a phase (Waning Gibbous) that ended up corresponding with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-confirms-gta-6-trailer-1-release-date">the day Rockstar announced the release date of Trailer 1</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to the start of November 2024, and Rockstar’s release of another GTA Online image, below, that - you guessed it - includes the moon in the Waning Gibbous phase. The real-life moon ends its current Waning Gibbous phase today, November 22, and from tomorrow moves on to the Last Quarter phase. And so, fans thought today would be the last possible day for either Trailer 2 itself or an announcement on when it would drop.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>GTA Online Community Update</p><p>First details on an exciting new GTA Online update coming in December — featuring clandestine operations launched from the Darnell Bros. Garment Factory.</p><p>Plus new community challenges, experience improvements, and more: <a href="https://t.co/i1vnYzVtK6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/i1vnYzVtK6</a> <a href="https://t.co/QRn4Bn71Wb" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/QRn4Bn71Wb</a></p></div>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1852350119250628835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately for its supporters, the moon theory turned out to be wrong this time. 9am Eastern, when Rockstar’s New York-based parent company Take-Two tends to make its announcements, has been and gone without a peep.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GTA community is struggling to cope with this, taking to social media, Discords, and subreddits to question their world view.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It <em>is</em> remarkable that Rockstar has gone nearly a year without following up GTA 6 Trailer 1 with any new information at all. With GTA 6's fall 2025 release window on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S still on the cards, according to Take-Two, you’d expect Rockstar to pipe up sooner rather than later. But will the moon show fans the way? Or is Rockstar just messing with its fanbase, as it’s done many times in the past?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025">the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</a>, the boss of Take-Two's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response">coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts">whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
