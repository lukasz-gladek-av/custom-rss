My gameplan for 2025 is to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-getting-epic-pulls-thanks-to-these-uk-pokmon-tcg-booster-bundle-deals">keep an eye on what cards are worth picking up for each set on store shelves</a> and get my Pokémon TCG following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-prismatic-evolutions-im-buying-these-uk-silver-tempest-deals">some bargains</a>. As much as I'd love to guarantee chase cards and pulls, that's not how it works, but what I can guarantee is more fun spending your pocket money trying to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-deals-im-grabbing-these-pokmon-tcg-etbs-before-they-sell-out">find Pokémon to add to your collection without getting ripped off</a> on the secondary market. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-company-breaks-silence-on-prismatic-evolution-shortage">Pokémon is working to get new stock out ASAP</a>, which we're already seeing the results of, albiet slowly.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">UK Deals: Find These Insane Pokémon TCG Pulls With These ETB Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The name of the UK Pokémon TCG deals game today is Paradox Rift, that's still knocking around online and in store. There's plenty of products to choose from, with Elite Trainer boxes being the best value for money right now, but why open this set in particular? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are some of my favourite pulls from Pokémon: Scarlet and Violet - Paradox Rift. This isn't about the newly coined "pokéinvesting" term; it's about showing everyone how to enjoy Pokémon cards to ensure everyone has their fair share of going in-store, ripping packs with friends and family and having fun with the hobby. Let's get into it:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Yveltal - 205/182</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/25/pcmag-shopping-cards-20-1737824691226.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to see why Paradox Rift was such an oferlooked yet, but it seems other trainers are catching on to its illustration and Secret Art Rares in 2025, This stunning Yveltal card has jumped from around £10 around October 2024 straight to around £25 looking at recent sold listings, so this would be a great card to look after on a trainers binder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Groudon - 199/182</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/25/pcmag-shopping-cards-21-1737824772234.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another epic card showing Groudon doing what he does best, teraforming Earth whilst wiping out life, Nice lad. He's currently going for around £80 right now, which is a steep climb from £39 back at the end of November. Those UK deals are looking better and better now, right?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gholdengo ex - 252/182</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/25/pcmag-shopping-cards-22-1737824846236.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Cheesestrings dude is well at home in Paldea now, so he shall now be known as Gholdengo. This card is currently going four around £25, which has gained an extra £10 from around October last year. I think this will be a slow burner alongside Ghimeghoul Secret art that has matches artwork. It's a set of art cards that trainers will want to focus on pulling regardless!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Garchomp ex - 245/182</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/25/pcmag-shopping-cards-23-1737824899335.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Garchamp is a beast, just look at that incredible artwork. The best part is that whilst the value of Garchomp ex - 245/182 is rising, it's still at a reasonable £30. It's value are more than double since October 2024, which means it's going to be a solid pull that will slowly climb up in value as Paradox Rift goes out fo print and off store shelves in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Roaring Moon ex - 229/182</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/25/pcmag-shopping-cards-24-1737824973077.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Roaring Moon ex has suprised me value wise, kicking off at around £5 mid-2024 and just about double to around £10. Personaly I think this has potenial to hits the £40 mark in 2025 thanks to the Pokémon popularity due to it being able to knock any Pokémon out in one hit and a powerful stadium card-based 220 attack. Playable or not, the artwork just rocks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's some links to the Pokémon TCG: Paradox Rift products on sale online right now.
