Essentially, it starts with DrTankHead, a now-former moderator of the Balatro subreddit and also current mod of a NSFW Balatro subreddit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The moderator had expressed no issue with AI art content, both on the NSFW and main Balatro subreddits. "We will not be banning AI art here, if it is properly claimed and tagged as such," the mod said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7nz5q/opinion_from_localthunk_on_ai_art/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a post</a>. "This has been done after discussion with the staff at Playstack."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Localthunk <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/localthunk.bsky.social/post/3ljygv23un22v" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a short reply on Bluesky</a>, saying this is not how they, nor their publisher at Playstack, felt about AI generated imagery. Then, the developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7ocoa/regarding_ai_art/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went to the subreddit to make a full statement</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Neither Playstack nor I condone AI 'art'. I don't use it in my game, I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds. The actions of this mod do not reflect how Playstack feels or how I feel on the topic. We have removed this moderator from the moderation team," Localthunk said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will not be allowing AI generated images on this subreddit from now on. We will make sure our rules and FAQ reflect this soon."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7ocoa/comment/mgyk1dj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up</a>, Playstack's communications director noted that the rules around this "should have been clearer," as a rule calling for "no unlabeled AI content" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7ocoa/comment/mgypk7k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could have been interpreted</a> as allowing or supporting the content on the subreddit. The remaining mod team is planning on clarifying this language for the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the original mod, DrTankHead <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatromance/comments/1j82g1w/addressing_the_main_subs_ai_art_ban/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> in the aforementioned NSFW Balatro subreddit, confirming they've been removed as a mod of r/Balatro. They went on to say that it is "not their goal" to make the NSFW Balatro subreddit AI-centric, but they are considering a "day of the week" situation where "non-NSFW art that is made with AI can be posted."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, one user replied: "Please just get off Reddit for a week or two."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That hasn't stopped tech companies going all in on AI, though. EA said in September that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>AI was "the very core" of its business</u></a>, and more recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-create-hundreds-of-thousands-of-unique-ideas-needed-to-build-in-game-environments"><u>Capcom said it was experimenting with generative AI</u></a> to create the "hundreds of thousands" of ideas needed for in-game environments. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">Activision recently admitted using generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assets</a> amid a backlash to an "AI slop" zombie Santa loading screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-player-discovers-trick-for-getting-an-absurdly-fast-quest-clear-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It takes some patience and poison.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In Monster Hunter, some quests can be taken down pretty quick, and others take a bit more time. But at least one <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> player has discovered a trick for getting absurdly fast clear times, using one particular quirk of Wilds' systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/monster-hunter-wilds-1-second-quest-cheese-capture" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VG247</a>, one Monster Hunter Wilds player <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9Zn-D8MkiU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted an incredibly fast clear time</a> for a Tempered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Chatacabra">Chatacabra</a> bout, thanks to what seems like a curious exploit of the poison system. The actual fight itself takes upwards of nine minutes, but the quest gets cleared in 00'01"53.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trick, it seems, is how poison triggers the actual quest start in Monster Hunter Wilds. Though the hunter in the video pelts the Chatacabra with quite a significant amount of Poison Ammo, keeping the debuff running, it doesn't actually start the quest until they stop the monster, launch the quest, and then deal the final blow.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players <a href="https://x.com/Carlos_R00/status/1899189639312757109" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have some theories</a>, mostly around poison not triggering the start of a quest as a safeguard against unwanted hunts starting in the open world. I took my own Heavy Bowgun out into the world and spent quite a while slowly toxifying a Chatacabra, and can at least report that it didn't automatically launch a quest until I started blasting it with other ammo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the case, it's an interesting little interaction. It doesn't seem to be a huge problem, as a super-fast quest clear doesn't mean much more than the actual quest clear at the end of the day. The Chatacabra dies either way, and honestly, this Poison Ammo seems both more arduous and resource-intensive than just bonking it with normal weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it proves that Monster Hunter Wilds players are still discovering weird, fun ways in which monsters can be hunted. With the open approach to the Forbidden Lands and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-gets-early-april-release-date-adds-an-endgame-hub-for-players-to-gather">more updates to come</a>, there's surely more to discover in this game as time goes on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got plenty more on Monster Hunter Wilds, including a fun story about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-players-discover-captured-monsters-will-eventually-just-exit-stage-left">how players have discovered that captured monsters will eventually just exit stage left</a>, and comments from the series producer on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-popularity-is-thanks-to-story-emphasis-immersion-and-cross-play-series-producer-says">why Monster Hunter Wilds is so popular</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help get your Monster Hunter Wilds adventure started, take a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Things_Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Doesn%27t_Tell_You_-_Tips">what Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t tell you</a>, and a guide to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">all 14 weapon types</a> in the game.
