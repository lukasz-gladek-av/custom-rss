You’ll see three labelled icons. </li><li>Click on the <strong>codes </strong>icon marked by the <strong>X </strong>symbol. It'll bring up the codes tab.</li><li>Enter your code into the code bar, being careful to make sure it’s in the right case and spelt correctly.</li><li>Click <strong>Claim </strong>and you should see the resources you unlock appear just below the claim bar.</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn’t My Pixel Tower Defense Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If your Pixel Tower Defense code isn’t working, it’s likely due to one of two scenarios. The first is that the code was inputted incorrectly. Pixel Tower Defense Codes are sometimes in standard case or entirely in upper case, so make sure you have the code inputted correctly before you hit claim. You can even copy and paste the codes directly from this article over to Roblox if you want to make sure you’re inputting them correctly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other possibility is the code has expired or you’ve already used it. If you’ve used it, you’ll get a message below the bar reminding you it has already been redeemed. If you’ve inputted it and it doesn’t recognise the code at all, it likely means it's no longer available to use. Not to worry though as Pixel Tower Defense gives out new codes often, so there’s sure to be new bonuses on the way very soon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Pixel Tower Defense Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to scout out some Pixel Tower Defense codes yourself, the easiest way is through the game’s <a href="https://discord.gg/VrYmxeCqv6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Discord</a>, which you can find here. After joining, you’ll be able to hop into the codes channel to find all the latest codes as they drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also follow <a href="https://x.com/Instance0new?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Luke (Instance0New) over on X</u></a>, where the creator frequently drops new codes for the community.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Pixel Tower Defense in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Pixel Tower Defense is a tower defence game with a simple premise. Buy units, take them into tactical scenarios where hundreds of enemies flood the screen and use them to prevent your foes from eliminating your home base. Each scenario is set across a series of rounds, with the end of each round supplying you with cash you can use to build or upgrade your current forces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although that seems simple enough, the game will frequently challenge you with harder levels and enemies that exploit your defence, forcing you to think tactically and carefully deliberate on how to spend your accumulated cash and dominate the battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.
