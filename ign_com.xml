            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games has cast Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 actor Ben Starr as a key in-game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> character, following in the footsteps of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Brie Larsen and Joel McHale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starr's turn as dashing Clair Obscur hero Verso is arguably his most famous role to date, and earned him a second nomination for best performer at both last year's Game Awards and the forthcoming BAFTA Game Awards. You may also have heard his vocal talents as Clive in Final Fantasy 16 and Prometheus in Hades 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Starr's set to star in Fortnite as The Visitor, one of the game's key NPC characters who will finally rejoin the battle royale mode's storyline (and speak!) later this month. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Visitor is one of Fortnite's heroic Seven, a band of intergalactic heroes who often turn up to save the day during its memorable live events. Indeed, the character of the Visitor was actually the focus of the game's very first live event — 2018's rocket launch — although he has seldom been heard, until now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, players were introduced to more of the Seven, including its lead member The Foundation (played by Johnson), The Scientist (McHale), The Paradigm (Larsen), The Origin (Rahul Kohli), The Imagined (Cherami Leigh) and The Order (Laura Bailey). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After being written out of the game's story in 2022, players were reintroduced to the team following the events of last year's climactic Zero Hour finale, which also featured a recap video setting up Fortnite's current Chapter 7 era — offering a quick reminder of who the Seven were and what they were up against. You can watch that again just above.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’m joining Fortnite as The Visitor.</p><p>I’m so excited to bring back this iconic member of The Seven. I imagine I’ll be very normal about it. <a href="https://t.co/cUNBkr2gWG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/cUNBkr2gWG</a></p></div>— Ben Starr (@The_Ben_Starr) <a href="https://twitter.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/2024515207775633510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, not all of the Seven are still standing, and Starr's incarnation of The Visitor is a different one to the original. In a clever twist, the game's OG mode, which offers Fortnite's original battle royale map, is considered a separate multiversal reality. It's from here that Starr's version of The Visitor will arrive in the coming days — following the OG version of that original rocket event — in order to help save the day and speak for the first time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Fortnite update included datamined dialogue lines where Starr's voice is unmistakable. Long-term Fortnite fans will also be pleased to hear the return of the Seven's AI assistant AMIE, who sounds like she is once again voiced by the prolific voice actress Erica Lindbeck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm joining Fortnite as The Visitor," Starr <a href="https://twitter.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/2024515207775633510" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> today on Twitter/X. "I'm so excited to bring back this iconic member of The Seven. I imagine I'll be very normal about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Ben Starr </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
