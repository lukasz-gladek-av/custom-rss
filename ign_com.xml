            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of EA's full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/untitled-battlefield-game">Battlefield 6</a> reveal tomorrow, a brief teaser for the game's campaign has been posted online, revealing a major conflict. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in the near future, Battlefield 6's campaign will see NATO under attack. Its base in Georgia is hit, the British territory of Gibraltar is invaded, and NATO's secretary general is assassinated inside the organisation's Brussels headquarters. The perpetrator? An organisation named Pax Armata. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A number of countries, including France, are then confirmed to have left NATO to form a new coalition, as in-universe news headlines question whether NATO itself is now a "thing of the past". Hmm...</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The teaser then concludes with Battlefield's trademark theme — you know the one, that 'dun dun dun dun dun' drumbeat — and a reminder that the game's full reveal will take place tomorrow, July 24, at 8am Pacific / 4pm UK time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eyed viewers will spot the logo for "BF Studios" on the end of the teaser — this is the coalition of developers that EA has pulled together to work on the game, including franchise founder DICE, Los Angeles-based sister studio Ripple Effect, Montreal-based Dead Space Remake developer Motive, and British Need for Speed studio Criterion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the note that "no weapon, military vehicle or gear manufacturer is affiliated with or has sponsored or endorsed this game."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Battlefield (@Battlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1948035690836447674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Pax Armata rises as NATO cracks," a message posted on Battlefield's X / Twitter account reads. "Their motto? 'Our protection, your peace.' But who’s pulling the strings and to what end?" Presumably we'll find out more tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent months, footage of Battlefield 6 from various closed playtests has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-early-battlefield-6-footage-seems-to-have-leaked-online">started leaking online,</a> showing the game's modern setting, various firefights, destructible environments, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-improvements-and-features-revealed-by-the-battlefield-6-gameplay-leaks">quality of life improvements</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-battlefield-leak-reveals-extremely-brief-look-at-the-start-of-a-battle-royale-match-as-ea-issues-takedowns">start of a battle royale match</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is currently slated to launch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-expected-fiscal-year-2026">sometime during the current fiscal year</a>, before March 2026. It seems likely we'll see that window narrowed considerably when the game is fully unveiled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
