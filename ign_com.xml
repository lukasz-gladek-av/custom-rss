What is it you desire?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Few games nowadays can make the wider gaming audience roll their eyes or jump out of their chairs excitedly. Yes, there are plenty of games that people are excited about their inevitable release, like Grand Theft Auto 6. Still, a darker, almost esoteric magic happens when the inevitable rumor mill starts to swill about games like Silksong and Bloodborne, the latter of which happens to be the Beyond! Game Club Game for April. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne is one of those experiences that can be transformative for some. At the same time, many will often play it, slaughtering their prey up until they see the credits or get fed up with it before eventually throwing in the towel. Those who overcome what lies in wait often become addicted to the challenging and precise combat of many souls’ games, while segments of that group become radicalized by the world and its lore that enthralls them as they traverse the extensive map draped in gothic and Lovecraftian themes. It’s no surprise that many of the hosts of podcast Beyond! are big fans of Bloodborne, and we look forward to our return to Yharnam once again, with it celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We hope that you will all join us in our endeavors to make our way through the numerous beasts, ghouls, and other ghastly creatures that will stand in our way to uncover the mysteries of the city of Yharnam. Be sure to check back in throughout the month as we update with our latest thoughts, triumphs, and, of course, the many, many failures that await us in Bloodborne.  </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="carousel"><p><h2 data-cy="title1">PlayStation Beyond Column</h2></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
