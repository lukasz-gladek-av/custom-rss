            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Red alert!!!!!</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Attention Everyone</strong>: Animal Crossing: New Horizons has a jump button now!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also walk backwards, and sideways!!!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why am I freaking out over this? Look. This is almost as exciting as when we all learned New Horizons would give us the ability to sit down on the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes as a part of Animal Crossing: New Horizon's 3.0 update, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-big-30-update-just-dropped-a-day-early">which dropped a day early today</a>, giving access to a new Hotel area, loads of new decorative items, some quality of life features like bulk crafting, and Dream Islands you can build alongside friends. But as players have discovered since, it's also added a subtle new feature to aid in construction and placement: essentially, a controlled way to step in the cardinal directions in very precise ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This feature is now tutorialed as part of obtaining the Construction App, though it's possible it may be available prior to that, and it's very easy to activate. You can use it any time by pressing the L button. Pressing it once will snap your character into place with a tiny little hop. Holding it down and moving the stick in a direction will let you take exactly one step in that direction, effectively the size of one "square" of space. This is ideal for activities such as precise furniture placement, or lining yourself up perfectly to hit rocks or even catch bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, sure, it's not actually a huge deal - just a fun quality of life feature. It's not like a REAL jump (and you can already jump small gaps automatically anyway). But Animal Crossing's audience has historically gotten very excited about little touches like this, such as the wave of excitement when sitting on the ground was confirmed to be in the game, or the love for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/77-amazing-little-details-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons">any number of other tiny details</a> players have found over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, if they ever add jump attacks it's over for you people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other small details in the new update worth celebrating, such as the ability to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qcmzyq/you_can_have_new_custom_design_on_slumber_islands/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">save individual custom designs to Slumber Islands</a> (effectively giving you even more slots), and the fact that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qcuyk8/former_villagers_remember_us/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former Islanders visiting the Hotel will remember you</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got a comprehensive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/ACNH_3.0_Update_and_Switch_2_Edition:_All_Details_and_Everything_New">guide to the 3.0 update</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/Kappns_Family_Hotel_-_How_to_Unlock_and_Guide">how to unlock everything</a> and what's included, as a part of our Animal Crossing: New Horizons Wiki guide.

And now, it's coming to the U.S. for a one-night-only theatrical release on February 27, 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2026/1/14/umamusume-pretty-derby-beginning-of-a-new-era-anime-film-north-american-release-date" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared by Crunchyroll</a>, the film will hit select, to-be-announced theaters in the U.S. for a one-night screening next month, and shared an English-language <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4dMQOzj-5g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a> and poster alongside the news. Tickets will be available at a later date via the <a href="https://www.movie-umamusume-newera-en.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official English website</a>, though it's unclear how broad a release this film will actually get.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/filters-quality95formatwebp-1768426269047.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not familiar with Umamusume: Pretty Derby, it's an exceedingly popular franchise from Cygames centered around a mobile game that launched in 2021. It features the Umamusume, or women with some of the features (such as ears and tails) and abilities of horses who participate in races styled after real-world historical horse races. In the game this takes the form of a sports simulation game where players train Umamusume to compete in various raises and meet certain, character-specific goals.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the mobile game, a multi-season anime, a manga, and various other spinoffs, Umamusume has covered the stories of multiple characters based on real-world race horses from the '90s, '00s, and '10s. The film, Beginning of a New Era, released in Japan on May 24, 2024 and follows Jungle Pocket, based on the real-world horse of the same name, and her rivalries with Agnes Tachyon, Manhattan Cafe, and Dantsu Flame. In the film, Jungle Pocket trains with veteran trainer Tanabe in an effort to win the Triple Crown, a series of three races that can only be competed in once in a lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umamusume: Pretty Derby launched in the U.S. in July of last year and only increased its popularity from what it already enjoyed in Japan. So much so that fans are now paying attention to the real-life horses that inspired their fictional counterparts, cheering them on, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-fans-mourn-death-of-champion-racehorse-grass-wonder">even mourning the death of one last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Punching trees might never be the same. </h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After more than 10 years in development, Hytale early access is here! If you’re just getting started, we’re writing a variety of early-game guides on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hytale/How_to_Make_a_Furnace_and_Smelt">smelting</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hytale/How_to_Play_with_Friends_and_Set_up_Hytale_Servers">setting up servers for friends</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hytale/Hytale_Progression_Guide">plenty more</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I preferred to go in blind. Hytale is quite obviously heavily Minecraft coded, but developer Hypixel is also doing its own thing in ways big and small, too. Below are seven things in Hytale's early game that surprised me, coming at it specifically from a Minecraft’s player’s perspective. Anything I missed? Have some early-game observations of your own? Leave a comment! </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>1. Punching down a single tree knocks down the entire thing at once, giving you a pile of wood, sticks, and sap along with it. No floating tree trunks here!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale is very clearly heavily Minecraft-inspired, but one area in which it does feel quite different is in that time-honored opening crafting survival game moment of punching down your first few trees. In Hytale, like Terreria and plenty of other survival games, the whole tree collapses and explodes like a little piñata of wood and resources once you disconnect it from the ground. You'll need all that sap, trust me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>2. Early overworld mobs are tankier than expected</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-11-49-25-am-1768423172423.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">How was I supposed to know this cutie would take nine hits?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Within my first few minutes in Hytale I had come across squirrels, rabbits, sheep, and even a fox. And although none of them were hard to kill at all (sorry little guys, but I need your pelts for early-game crafting recipes), I was a little surprised at how much HP they seem to have, and how many hits from my first crude sword it took to take them down. I had to chase one rabbit halfway across the plains - they're quite speedy when making their getaway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>3. Ores glint faintly in underground caves</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-42-54-pm-1768423553440.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Sweet, sweet early game Copper.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is truly a tiny detail, but still one I thought was neat. When spelunking in Hytale, if you look carefully, an otherwise pitch-black cave wall or crevasse will glint off distant light sources like your torch if there are any valuable ores present. Helpful!
</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>4. Gear Progression Is a bit more complicated</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-41-18-pm-1768423553440.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Iron upgrades will have to wait.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In my first cave I explored I found plenty of copper ore for Tier 1 armor, but I also found a stack or so of iron ore, for Tier 2 gear. I was initially a little bit disappointed, thinking maybe I could just leapfrog past tier 1 entirely. But crafting weapons and armor in Hytale actually requires a few different raw materials, which I appreciated. Copper armor requires only copper and plant fiber. But Iron requires iron, light leather, and linen scraps. So it looks like I have more mob grinding in my near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>5. There are more decorative options</strong></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-44-00-pm-1768423553440.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale’s crafting system in early access is still very basic (and a little buggy), but coming from Minecraft, I still appreciated some small crafting details like being able to turn raw wood and stone into slanted, tiled roof blocks and half-block-thick walls when building out my starter hut. You can also place shelves on our walls and stick a few decoratives like candles and books on them. By the way - huge fan of how Hytale's crafting benches can see and make use of resources stored in nearby chests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>6. There are promising secrets and surprises</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-1-19-53-pm-1768423653838.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A first look at the still-heavily-under-construction Forgotten Temple.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale is what I would describe as an “aggressively” early access game. Most of the time when you come across something interesting in the world like what looks like a dungeon entrance, or a hand-built ruin, you’ll be stopped from entering and shown a literal under construction “work in progress” sign. There is one exception though, which illustrates some of the promise of what is hopefully to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on I spotted a nearby icon on my map labeled “Forgotten Temple Gateway.” Without spoiling the details, investigating said gateway led to a fight against a unique mob and a portal to a beautiful and entirely unique, hand-crafted location, filled with its own NPCs and points of interest. Hytale for now looks to be very thin on hand-crafted Adventure content, but this tiny taste was an encouraging place to start. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>7 Farming Is a Bit More Complex</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-44-21-pm-1768423553440.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Next order of business: start my chicken empire.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although I didn’t get a chance to dive into the feature in detail because I had to go back to (grumble grumble) <em>work, </em>I did get a chance to poke around Hytale’s farming system a bit. So far it looks like, similar to most of Hytale’s other systems, it’s a bit more complex than Minecraft’s. You can craft animal caretaking buildings including chicken coops and beehives, as well as a farming aids like a watering can. Tree saplings and new crop seeds don’t come from harvesting, but instead must be created by spending “Essence of Life,” which seems a bit like a currency you receive when harvesting mature crops.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, as a Minecraft veteran - I’ve been playing off and on since there were Secret Friday Updates! - Hytale’s opening few hours are familiar enough and yet still different enough to keep me interested and coming back for more.
