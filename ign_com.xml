            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Witchers are not born. They are made."</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly a year after its debut in Poland, Andrzej Sapkowski's latest Witcher novel, Crossroads of Ravens, finally arrives in English this week. Amazon is currently selling it for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjAwy?object_uuid=9c107776-76db-4695-84a2-6e134a786c12&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$24.50 in the US</a> (18% off the $30 MSRP) and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOg4B7?object_uuid=9c107776-76db-4695-84a2-6e134a786c12&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">£19.99 in the UK</a> (20% off the £20 RRP).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crossroads of Ravens is a new standalone prequel novel in The Witcher saga. It takes place decades before either the games and the main novel saga, following a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-andrzej-sapkowskis-new-book-focuses-on-a-teenage-geralt">teenage Geralt of Rivia fresh from Kaer Morhen, and in his early steps as a Witcher</a>.</p><div catalogid="6559bbb9-3f23-4c20-b295-2b73b9d89225" id="228495"><div id="228495" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Crossroads of Ravens (The Witcher)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>English Release Date: September 30, 2025.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Amazon’s description, the prequel finds Geralt “stumbling through a world that neither understands nor welcomes his kind.” Fresh from Kaer Morhen, a rash attempt at heroism nearly ends with his execution, but he is saved at the last moment by Preston Holt, “a grizzled witcher with a buried past and an agenda of his own.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Under Holt’s mentorship, Geralt begins to learn what it really means to walk the Path, not just in battling monsters but in surviving the prejudice and politics of the Continent. Sapkowski frames this as the story of “how legends are made, and what they cost.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It makes sense for this new tale to look back rather than push forward. Geralt’s arc already reaches a definitive conclusion in the main saga, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/15-the-witcher-anniversary-cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt games</a> have effectively carried the timeline on in their own way, set just a few years after the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-books-reading-order">books</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, while Sapkowski’s novels remain the bedrock of the series, The Witcher has long since grown into something much bigger.

"Through the lens of Silent Hill f, players dive into a haunting narrative by Ryukishi07 based on a 'beautiful yet horrifying' artistic vision."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's great news for fans of the horror series, proving that the success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-hails-silent-hill-2-remake-after-hitting-2-million-sales-milestone"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake</u></a> — which similarly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week"><u>sold 1 million copies</u></a> within days but took until January to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-hails-silent-hill-2-remake-after-hitting-2-million-sales-milestone"><u>surpass 2 million sales</u></a> — was not a one-off for publisher Konami.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan, where we follow Hinako Shimizu, a teenager struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-review"><u>Silent Hill f review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: "Silent Hill f presents a fresh new setting to explore and a fascinatingly dark story to unravel, but its melee-focussed combat takes a big swing that doesn’t quite land."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-modders-add-ray-tracing-cheats-and-remove-the-hud-and-the-series-signature-fog-a-day-after-advanced-access-went-live-on-steam">Silent Hill f modders have already gotten down to business</a>. And while some help boost the experience by tweaking engine performance, add in ray tracing, or provide localization efforts and HUD removal, others add in cheats, give Hinako a Shibito-inspired makeover, and remove the game's fog.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you're wondering, no, Silent Hill f is not a sequel to any of the existing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/silent-hill"><u>Silent Hill games</u></a>, so you can play it even if you've never jumped into a Silent Hill game before. Instead, it offers a standalone story "independent from the series." And as for whether it's a soulslike?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv">Dawn of War 4</a> got a new gameplay trailer over the weekend, and while excitement continues generally for the upcoming real-time strategy game, the video has sparked a number of complaints from some within the Warhammer 40,000 community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with the voice acting, which some are saying sounds flat. The complaints here stem from comparisons to Relic’s much-loved Dawn of War, which came out in 2004. Based on the new video, the chatter from the Space Marines especially doesn’t have enough oomph, and lacks the metallic ‘vox’ texture the Space Marines usually have when speaking through their helmets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My best guess here is that the developers at King Art Games needed the Space Marines to sound sufficiently different to the Adeptus Mechanics, one of Dawn of War 4’s brand new factions. The Ad Mech are the fanatical worshippers of the Machine God of Mars, tech priests who have discarded their humanity in favor of cybernetics. Their voices have that metallic vox-ness to them by default, which may have forced King Art’s hand when it came to the Space Marines' audio. After all, on chaotic battlefield, the player needs to know which faction is saying what.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Here’s your official look into the next evolution of the iconic real-time strategy franchise with Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV!</p><p>First revealed during PC Gaming Show: Tokyo Direct, this new trailer has been captured entirely from in-engine gameplay.<a href="https://t.co/Tdy6sZQTof" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Tdy6sZQTof</a> <a href="https://t.co/SJGiQWy6g3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/SJGiQWy6g3</a></p></div>— Dawn of War IV (@PlayDoW4) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayDoW4/status/1972347455808393305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Voices for Space Marines aren't good, compared to DOW1 or DOW2,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dawnofwar/comments/1nst8b0/comment/ngpg480/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said the wonderfully named redditor KillerKanka</a>. “You know it's missing that ZEAL, the mechanical filter, the ‘COME. SHOW ME WHAT PASSES FOR FURY AMONG YOUR MISBEGOTTEN KIND’ or ‘SPESS MEHRINESS ATTAAAAACK’ or ‘STRIKE FROM THE SKIES, BROTHERS.’ It's much easier to correct, tho, but still.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Looks promising, but please fix the Space Marine voice acting,” added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dawnofwar/comments/1nst8b0/comment/ngrk15a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ImSorryOkGeez</a>. “That dude does not sound like he is ready to burn heretics, kill mutants, or purge the unclean.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Orks in Dawn of War 4, the voice work we hear in the video is nowhere near as over-the-top cockney as Warhammer 40,000 Orks traditionally sound, and indeed how they sound in Dawn of War 1. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s a growing row about the inclusion of Primaris Marines, which, well, if you’re not in the weeds on Warhammer 40,000, this one may prove to be a head-scratcher.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Firstborn” Space Marines, as they’re known, were essentially replaced within the setting by Primaris Marines. They’re bigger, tougher, stronger, and faster than the OGs, but some within the fandom absolutely hate them for their softer redesign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot to unpack here, but essentially this debate about the Primaris Marines boils down to a feeling that Games Workshop has “toned down” the Space Marines over the years so that they look a little less like the religious fanatics the lore suggests they are, and more like the poster boys Warhammer 40,000 needs to attract new fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War, which came out over 20 years ago now, leaned into the Warhammer 40,000 of that time, and so its Blood Ravens (the Space Marines chapter at the heart of the Dawn of War games) delivered on that fanaticism. Dawn of War was based on Warhammer 40,000 4th Edition (we’re now on the 10th), and so the Astra Militarum were called the Imperial Guard, the Aeldari were called the Eldar, and the Necrons didn’t speak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War 4, due out 2026, was always going to have a different feel in keeping with the Warhammer 40,000 of today, the grimdark far future we see in Amazon animations, in video games like the record-breaking Space Marine 2, and perhaps (hopefully!) in Henry Cavill’s Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe. Dawn of War 4 was always going to feature Primaris Marines, which have been the default Space Marines for almost a decade now.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not surprised by complaints around the voice work, which probably could do with a shot in the arm, or the complaints about the Primaris Marines (this is an ongoing complaint about all things Space Marines). The Warhammer 40,000 fandom, perhaps more than any other, is big on tradition. But I am surprised to see complaints about the game’s visuals, which I think look pretty detailed. King Art has spoken about going hard on sync kills, which Dawn of War 1 was famous for, and we see those in action here. Some are saying Dawn of War 4 looks too colorful, but to me it looks fine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are more extreme reactions online, some of which compare Dawn of War 4 to the critical and commercial flop that was Dawn of War 3. It’s impossible to make such a comparison based on what we’ve seen of Dawn of War 4 so far, and King Art has made it clear from the start that it’s using Dawn of War 1 as its reference point for the game with base building and big armies the focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, with each new video, Warhammer 40,000 fans will continue to have their say on Dawn of War 4, right up until launch and beyond. Heresy is at the heart of the Imperium, and so perhaps King Art knew full well it was going to have to deal with a healthy dose itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Sorry folks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games' statement doesn't sound positive for the emote remaining in Fortnite, but what's even more extraordinary is the suggestion that developer — who worked closely with DC Studios on the collaboration — was left to discover the dance's true nature alongside audiences, and was now scrambling to get an explanation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have already begun to fret over what any potential schism might mean for the future of DC's popular collaborations within Fortnite, and whether the two companies would continue to work together. IGN has contacted Epic Games for comment. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In general, fan response to the emote being pulled has been mixed, with some acknowledging the potential for the "Nazi emote," as it's been dubbed, to subsequently be misused by players to grief others. Others, however, have questioned why Epic Games has acted here but not in other similar situations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Fortnite recently raised eyebrows by adding the Tylil Dance, an emote collaboration with rapper Kai Cenat which features music by Kanye West. West, who now refers to himself as Ye, previously made numerous comments deemed to be anti-semitic and in 2022 said he identified as "a Nazi." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In another example, Fortnite has notably shied away from reselling an in-game skin, Rue, whose costume players widely likened to the design of a Nazi uniform. The skin remains within the game, though is now one of Fortnite's rarest — as Epic Games has chosen not to sell it in over five years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Peacemaker's latest episode, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-gunn-answers-our-burning-questions-about-peacemakers-explosive-sixth-episode-and-why-that-cameo-is-consequential-to-the-dcu">IGN recently chatted with Gunn about the show</a> and its other big surprise, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/peacemaker-season-2s-big-dcu-cameo-revealed-in-episode-6">cameo by Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has revealed Borderlands 4’s first of two new Vault Hunters coming to the game as part of the paid Story Pack DLCs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">C4SH, due out during the first quarter of 2026, is a playable character whose luck-based powers can make him either the best or worst character in the game, Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nfyubGFy_AE?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a panel at Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb, from Gearbox:</p><blockquote>A former casino dealer bot, C4SH is now a drifter who chases the probability-breaking highs of cursed eldritch artifacts. As luck would have it, Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned is full of cosmic horrors that harbor uncanny curios, some of which can surely bend the odds in C4SH's favor.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">C4SH has three unique Action Skills to choose from, as you’d expect, and three skill trees that each have three branches full of passives and other customization options. C4SH works differently to the other Vault Hunters, however, by having unpredictable Action Skills. Gearbox said they all involve an element of chance as part of a risk-reward playstyle that “can lead to good fortunes like buffing himself and allies, dealing devastating damage, sapping the strength from foes, and more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the panel, Pitchford revealed a work-in-progress look at C4SH’s card Action Skill, which has big Gambit vibes. Pitchford, a professional magician himself, said C4SH was “very dear to me, very personal to me.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because of chance, with luck he can be the most powerful Vault Hunter in the game. But of course, with bad luck it’s the opposite. The gameplay with cash is definitely high risk, high reward. I think it’s a lot of fun. It makes my heart pound.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“C4SH is important to me because I think he and I have a lot in common. Some of you might not know this, but I have played poker professionally, as a gambler. I have appeared on a live reality television show in America about playing Texas Hold'em Poker. And I’ve felt what it’s like to take risks and to have that work out and have extreme success from chance, but also to miss out and lose my money.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/28/g15shqnamaaijsr-1759090620762.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">C4SH is due out Q1 2026.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Another thing some of you may know about me is that in addition to being a game developer, I’m a professional magician. And I’ve mastered sleight of hand with playing cards, and we used my demonstration to help animate the character in the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford proceeded to show behind-the-scenes footage of the developer in his office at the Texas studio palming, flicking, and throwing playing cards from a first-person perspective, footage he said the animators used to help animate C4SH. Pitchford then showed a work-in-progress look at C4SH’s card action skill alongside first-person footage of himself performing the card actions.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">IN GAME ANIMATION FOR C4SH'S CARD ACTION SKILL<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Borderlands4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Borderlands4</a> <a href="https://t.co/R59KmkhFrZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/R59KmkhFrZ</a></p>— EpicNNG (@EpicNNG) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1972135452221362439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll get C4SH as soon as he’s available by owning the Borderlands 4 Super Deluxe Edition, the Vault Hunter Pack (included in Super Deluxe Edition), or Story Pack 1: Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned (included in Vault Hunter Pack).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, meanwhile, adds multiple main and side missions set in a new zone of Kairos, new gear to earn, and new cosmetics as well as C4SH.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 launched this month with four playable characters: Vex; Rafa; Amon, and Harlowe.
