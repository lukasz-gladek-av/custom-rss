Many of the negative reviews focus on MindsEye’s performance problems, which appear to be hitting PC gamers hard. There are also reports on various bugs, glitches, and NPC behavior oddities.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">My second combat encounter in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MindsEye?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MindsEye</a>... The AI has become self-aware and is now committing suicide: <a href="https://t.co/391R23S0Oa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/391R23S0Oa</a></p>— Jesse Gomez @ IGN (@ItsJesseGomez) <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsJesseGomez/status/1932526430555906123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Build A Rocket Boy issued a statement on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1l8acbd/update_on_performance/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the MindsEye subreddit</a>, saying its engineering team is “working around the clock” to improve performance. Patch 3 will be revealed soon, it added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>Thank you kindly to all of you who joined us as pioneers on day one! We understand that the current minimum spec requirements are very high, but our engineering team are working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles by integrating the performance improvements in Unreal Engine V5.6. We will provide patch 3 update timing, including these improvements, within the next 24 hours. In addition to the main campaign, we would also value your thoughts on Build.Mindseye.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye, led by former Rockstar North chief Leslie Benzies, has endured a tumultuous run-up to release. Last week, Build A Rocket Boy said fans should wait for MindsEye’s official launch rather than play it before its street date, after early copies made their way into the hands of players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want everyone to experience the story the same way at the same time on day one, without bias," Build A Rocket Boy said in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-calls-on-fans-to-wait-for-official-launch-after-street-date-breaks-a-week-early-confirms-major-day-one-update-for-physical-copies"><u>statement issued in response to early copies being played</u></a>. "This means waiting until the official release date to play through the game firsthand."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mention of bias in the studio's statement sparked speculation that the company was referring back to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments"><u>comments made by its co-CEO Mark Gerhard</u></a>, who suggested there had been a "concerted effort" to "trash the game and the studio" with negative social media posts from paid accounts or bots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye"><u>IGN subsequently put this claim to Hakan Abrak, boss of Hitman developer IO Interactive</u></a>, the company which is publishing MindsEye. His response: "I don't know. I don't believe that. I don't believe that. I just think the game should speak for itself on June the 10th."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Physical copies of MindsEye also needed a “major” update for “key improvements to ensure MindsEye plays as we intended and to meet all the characters at their best.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And just days before MindsEye’s launch, Build a Rocket Boy’s Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>confirmed they had left the company</u></a>, sparking concern from the studio’s fledgling community.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam concurrents do not tell the whole story, of course. MindsEye launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S as well as PC, so its true concurrent player count will be higher than that reported on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye carries a $59.99 price tag. At launch, there is a “tightly crafted linear story campaign,” and what’s called “single-player free roam,” but there are also a number of missions: a horde mode mission called “Destruction Site Shootout,” and two combat missions (“Honor Amongst Thieves” and “Friendly Fire”). Also at launch are six races, six checkpoint races, and three drone races. If you get the premium pass, you get an extra horde mode mission and an exotic cosmetics pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following launch, Build A Rocket Boy said it will deliver a “constant stream” of fresh premium content monthly, “ensuring MindsEye is a living, ever-expanding player experience.” This includes new missions, challenges, and game assets. “The continuous stream of studio-developed content, combined with the very best of the community’s own beautiful creations, means that MindsEye will continue to surprise and delight its players for decades to come,” Build A Rocket Boy added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy also confirmed its 2025 roadmap of content. In the summer there will be community updates, new missions, in the fall new single-player modes, multiplayer, and new missions, and in the winter free roam updates and new missions. Premium pass owners get extra missions and new packs throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

"We're deeply thankful for their contributions as they've shaped who we are, and their impact will always be part of our story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is a difficult moment for our team, but we hold immense respect for everyone who got us here.

However, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lrbil2zvis2q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting</a> 30% of its team — thought to be around 40 people — have been let go. When asked if this perhaps signalled the whole studio would be shut down in the near future, Schreier noted it's "unlikely" they'd have laid off 40 staff if management weren't fighting to keep it afloat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cuts come just months after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony canceled two unannounced live-service games that were in development at Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games</u></a>.

For the uninitiated, the Horus Heresy is the Space Marine civil war that took place 10,000 years before the current Warhammer 40,000 setting. It is the foundation of 40K’s grimdark universe, and reveals how the carrion Emperor ended up on the Golden Throne.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege of Terra: End of Ruin is a hugely exciting release for 40K lore fans (the standard edition is available to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgGjJ?object_uuid=741aa9ae-3a67-4217-a1c4-bdda8e62b07f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder on Amazon</a>), but its special edition is even more enticing. It features a leather-effect cover with gold foil details, gilt page edges, and a metal emblem of a ruined Imperial eagle.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/preorders-jun07-bl-01-eraofruinltd-nkuyovjdyk-1749632718756.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The special edition of Siege of Terra: End of Ruin. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop had signaled the special edition would be available “strictly while stocks last,” and that it would go on sale at 10am UK time on June 10. It also told fans it planned to use a queue system “to ensure fair distribution.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this queue system caused chaos, with fans desperate to pre-order the book unable to make progress. Amid frantic messages of complaint across social media, Discords, and subreddits, Warhammer.com suddenly… stopped. It was offline, and no-one knew why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anger grew as those who had carved out time to be there for the pre-order launch were left empty handed. Eventually, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WarhammerOfficial/posts/pfbid0NGLkvUafYjdsmFoK6n22Am1hjz3pYwiHczUHdvvT6dXDcF6TPqwzifqyMb2FudFBl?locale=en_GB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Games Workshop issued a statement</a> on the debacle — a rare event in of itself — to say it had brought Warhammer.com offline because it had noticed scalpers were bypassing its systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Scalpers attempted to use bots to bypass our normal safeguards,” Games Workshop said. “Our eagle-eyed Tech Priests caught this happening in real-time, so we pulled Warhammer.com offline.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/60040181337-blsiegeofterraeraofruin-1749632804963.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Siege of Terra: Era of Ruin hardback remains available. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is that the special edition of Siege of Terra: End of Ruin is currently unavailable on Warhammer.com. In its place is a page asking for an email for a notification. Games Workshop said the special edition is still coming, “we’re just absolutely determined that real fans get it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All erroneous orders are being purged,” Games Workshop continued. “This is our number one priority. Please forgive us for a delay as we sort it all out.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/gw-1749633025785.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Games Workshop's statement. Image credit: Games Workshop / Facebook.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement has gone some way to calm angry fans who had hoped for a smoother launch of the special edition. Some are calling Games Workshop’s actions here a “small victory” over the scalpers, although there is a healthy dose of skepticism about the company’s efforts to truly combat the bots. Some suggest Games Workshop to use a raffle system, as other companies do for their high-profile products, or, even better, force interested customers to pass a Horus Heresy test to prove their worth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, Games Workshop has suffered pre-order problems for years now, and special edition book launches are often plagued by scalpers who go on to sell the products at hugely inflated prices. All eyes are on Games Workshop to see how it handles pre-orders for the Siege of Terra: End of Ruin special edition when they’re eventually re-launched.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s remember that Games Workshop is no minnow. In fact, the Nottingham, UK company is doing so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-maker-games-workshop-is-doing-so-well-its-giving-27-million-to-its-staff">it’s handing out £20 million (approx. $27 million) to its staff as a bonus</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop’s main business is the sale of miniatures fans assemble and paint for use in tabletop wargames, such as Warhammer 40,000. But it is increasingly an IP business, with huge revenue from smash hit video games such as last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii"><u>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</u></a>, and animations, such as Amazon’s Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level episode. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years"><u>Games Workshop and Amazon recently finalized a deal for Henry Cavill's Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe</u></a>, which will involve the creation of films and television series. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-iii"><u>Space Marine 3 is also in development.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
