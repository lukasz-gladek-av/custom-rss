            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> will feature classic characters connected to the Raccoon City incident, Capcom has now acknowledged — while stopping short of confirming exactly who.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speculation is rife that floppy-haired fan-favorite Leon S. Kennedy will be back for Requiem, revisiting the city where he spent a fateful first day as a rookie police officer back in Resident Evil 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, to date, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-resident-evil-requiem-interview-why-the-games-monster-got-supersized-why-its-probably-not-lisa-trevor-and-a-tease-for-areas-beyond-raccoon-city-just-dont-talk-about-leon">Capcom has refused to discuss whether fans will reconnect with any familiar faces in Requiem</a>, choosing instead to focus its marketing efforts on new protagonist Grace Ashcroft, daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.well-played.com.au/chatting-the-return-to-raccoon-city-and-designing-resident-evil-requiem-with-the-games-producer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Well-Played</a>, producer Masato Kumazawa has finally confirmed that "yes, there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth stating that Kumazawa is responding here to a question which asked specifically whether other Outbreak characters, as well as Alyssa, will show up in Requiem. But Kumazawa does then go on to mention characters "involved in the Raccoon City incident" generally will appear. Here's the full quote:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I would say that yes, there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don’t over-expect or hype it," Kumazawa teased. "We can’t promise you anything about that, but the only thing I can say is that there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil: Requiem - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The debate around whether other characters — and specifically Leon — are in Requiem has dominated discussion of the game to date, though Capcom seems happy to keep the speculation going. While focusing on Grace Ashcroft in trailers and early gameplay previews, the publisher has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">never explicitly stated that she is the sole playable character</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a separate interview published online this week, Kumazawa branded a specific fan image of Leon with an eyepatch as "fake news," and suggested it was the work of AI. But again, the producer stopped short of simply saying Leon isn't in the game — which, at this point, you'd think developers would simply state in order to manage expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S. There's still plenty of time for more reveals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

As part of the sale, a whole bunch of brilliant games have already been discounted across all major retailers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday deals</a> tend to go live a week early these days, so while Black Friday isn't until Nov. 28, we've already got all the best discounts on PS5 games to check out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To make things a little easier for you, I've gathered up all my top picks and split them across the latest and greatest hits for 2025, and then the rest of the gems that have featured across the PS5's almost five-year life cycle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2025 PS5 Games on Sale for Black Friday</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Standout offers for 2025 PS5 games include a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">2025 Game of the Year</a> nominee, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6DxVj?object_uuid=0d06fd3d-07a1-4ecc-8877-3c2f14ccab18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Death Stranding 2, for $49.99</a>. That's $20 off, and matches the best deal on the game so far this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also $20 discounts on big Konami hits like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-slashes-20-off-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-in-black-friday-sales">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-drops-to-50-in-best-buys-2025-black-friday-sale">Silent Hill f</a>, both also down to $49.99 from $69.99. Both of these can be found in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-2025-black-friday-sale-is-now-live-updated">Best Buy's Black Friday sales</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I love to sing the praises of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 as well, and that's just hit its lowest price ever as part of the Black Friday sales. It's just $30 at Amazon right now, a huge $40 in savings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty more new games to check out in the sales as well, like Assassin's Creed Shadows for $34.99, Battlefield 6 for $59.45, EA Sports FC 26 for $29.99, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-hits-a-new-low-price-including-switch-2-preorders">Borderlands 4 for $47.99</a>, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also worth noting that not <em>every</em> deal is live yet, and we can see new offers go live all the way through to Black Friday proper on November 28.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More PS5 Game Deals for Black Friday</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There's some big discounts on first party PlayStation games in the sale as well, especially from the past few years. My top pick is Game of the Year 2024 winner, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ZMJWn?object_uuid=0d06fd3d-07a1-4ecc-8877-3c2f14ccab18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Astro Bot, for $39.99</a>, which is endless amounts of fun. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also pick up Helldivers 2, Spider-Man 2, The Last of Us 1 and 2, all for $29.99. Stellar Blade is down to $39.99, and you can even pick up Horizon Forbidden West for just $19.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-i-vi-pixel-remaster-collection-drops-to-all-time-low-price-ahead-of-black-friday-2025">Final Fantasy's 1-6 Pixel Collection</a> for $39.99, which has dropped to its lowest price ever, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-hd-2d-remakes-are-discounted-ahead-of-black-friday">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a> for $34.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other standout offers in the PlayStation 2025 Black Friday sale include <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8WMY?object_uuid=0d06fd3d-07a1-4ecc-8877-3c2f14ccab18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$100 off PS5 consoles</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8Omr?object_uuid=0d06fd3d-07a1-4ecc-8877-3c2f14ccab18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation VR2</a> bundles, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxx1gx?object_uuid=0d06fd3d-07a1-4ecc-8877-3c2f14ccab18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$20 off DualSense Controllers</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGrn48?object_uuid=0d06fd3d-07a1-4ecc-8877-3c2f14ccab18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Portal</a>, and up to 33% off PlayStation Plus memberships.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty more games on sale that we haven't mentioned either, so be sure to check out the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJro0q?object_uuid=0d06fd3d-07a1-4ecc-8877-3c2f14ccab18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">full PS5 sales pages at retailers like Amazon</a> as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are you planning to pick up anything in PlayStation's Black Friday sale? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Let us know in the comments, and stick with IGN as we continue to update you daily on the best Black Friday deals for 2025.</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Wait for Black Friday on November 28?</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/17/playstation-black-friday-sale-announced-ign-2025-1763398079749.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">PlayStation's Black Friday deals are now live</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Friday deals are more confusing than ever these days. Most retailers spend November teasing limited-time offers, but the reality is that the deepest discounts rarely show up until about a week before what I like to call “Black Friday proper.” Early deals can be tempting, but they often don’t beat the prices that land closer to the main event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having tracked PlayStation sales for six years, one thing is clear: once a PlayStation deal hits, it usually stays put for the duration of the sale. That means the prices you see now for consoles, controllers, and games are very likely the ones you’ll see through to December. If you’ve been holding out for a good deal, there’s no need to wait any longer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These offers are solid, reliable, and unlikely to get any better. Go ahead and grab the what you’ve had your eye on, there’s no risk of Black Friday regret, only the satisfaction of scoring exactly what you wanted at a price that finally makes sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.
