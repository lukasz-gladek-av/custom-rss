            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-wins-igns-2024-peoples-choice-tournament<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The tournament started with 64 entries and crowned one fan-voted champion.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There were some incredible games released this year, and we wanted to know which you thought was the best of the best. So with our partners at Truth, we picked 64 of 2024’s best games, put them in a head-to-head tournament, and gave you the power to vote for your favorites. After six rounds of voting and more than 1 million votes in all, one game reigned supreme as champion: Black Myth: Wukong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An action game from developer Game Science, Black Myth: Wukong is inspired by the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. You play as the Destined One, an anthropomorphic monkey based on Sun Wukong from the novel. You wield a staff with different stances, have access to several magic spells, and can transform into enemies after defeating them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc"><u>IGN’s review</u></a>, we cited its fantastic combat, beautiful environments, and well-designed bosses as the areas where it shines. While it may not be a soulslike, its combat can be quite challenging and forces you to weave together quick reflexes, smart resource management, and versatile attacks to take down its many bosses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Myth: Wukong’s popularity was obvious from the very start of our fan-voted tournament. It had a dominant run, culminating in a win over Marvel Rivals in the final with 59% of the vote. Before that, it had to get through Harry Potter: Quidditch Championship, Star Wars Outlaws, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, Stellar Blade, and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, beating all of them with at least 67% of the vote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals’ run to the final was more contested, with it barely beating out the Silent Hill 2 remake in the semifinals and Astro Bot in the quarterfinals, which was one of the closest matchups of the whole tournament. There were more than 50,000 votes cast in that matchup, and Marvel Rivals won by only 960. Before those close calls, it had to get through some stiff competition in World of Warcraft: The War Within, Batman: Arkham Shadow, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2024"><u>pick for Best Game of 2024</u></a> went to Metaphor: ReFantazio, but it didn’t make it out of the first round of the People’s Choice Tournament. Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership took it down before falling to Black Myth: Wukong in its path to the title. Indie darling Balatro, one of IGN’s runners-up for Best Game of 2024 and winner of our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-game-of-2024"><u>Best PC Game of 2024 Award</u></a>, also had a surprisingly short run. After narrowly defeating Still Wakes the Deep in the first round, it got only 26% of the vote in Round 2 against Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 had a very impressive run overall, taking down multiple big names on its way to the Final Four. In addition to its resounding win over Balatro, it also defeated Sons of the Forest, Dragon’s Dogma 2, and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, another of IGN’s runners-up for Best Game of 2024. The other member of the Final Four was Silent Hill 2, which won the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-horror-game-of-2024"><u>IGN Award for Best Horror Game of 2024</u></a>. It got to the semifinals by going through Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, Helldivers 2, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD, and Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thank you to the many people who logged votes in this year’s People’s Choice Tournament. Let us know in the comments below what you think of the outcome. If you disagree with the winner, which game would you have chosen? And here’s to another great year of gaming in 2025!</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The superhero team are sitting in the Fantasticar, and we also see the Baxter Building in the background.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/02/mr-1735838364222.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Fantastic Four's design for Marvel Rivals.

One early question fans have is whether H.E.R.B.I.E. is playable alongside the main Fantastic Four members. We'll find out soon enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that the Fantastic Four image also includes what look like bats flying across a sky lit by a blood-red moon. Could this vampiric tease suggest Blade is coming in Season 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals is a smash hit for NetEase, securing 10 million players in just three days and 20 million in two weeks. The free-to-play superhero team-based PvP shooter launched on December 6 across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, and while Sony and Microsoft do not make player numbers public, Steam makes Valve stats available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in the top five most-played games on Valve's platform. It’s the 20th highest concurrent player number ever seen on Steam, ahead of the likes of Helldivers 2, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Destiny 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals launched with Season 0, with Season 1 set for January 9, according to the in-game battle pass countdown timer. It seems likely Fantastic Four will be made available with the release of Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review"><u>Marvel Rivals Review</u></a> to find out what we think.
