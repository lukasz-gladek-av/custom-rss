            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-has-finally-released-alpha-40-after-a-much-longer-than-anticipated-development-process<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> has finally hit alpha 4.0 after what its chief developer, Chris Roberts, admitted was “a much longer than anticipated development process.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cloud Imperium Games’ space sim is considered one of the most controversial projects in all video games. Over the 12 years since its crowdfunding drive began, Star Citizen has been called many things including a scam by those who wonder whether it will ever properly launch. Its virtual space ships, some of which cost hundreds of dollars, are often the focus of criticism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Star Citizen has now raised an eye-watering $767 million, according to figures from CIG. The developer makes revenue publicly available on its <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>. CIG calls this money “funds raised.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In March this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-10-twinkles-on-the-horizon-dev-says-12-years-and-669-million-later"><u>CIG began talking about Star Citizen’s 1.0 launch being within sight</u></a>, although there’s still no release window for it. 1.0, Roberts has said, “is what we consider the features and content set to represent ‘commercial’ release.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/20371-Letter-From-The-Chairman" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter from the Chairman post</a>, Roberts said: “Long ago, lost in the mists of time before COVID, at CitizenCon 2949, we showcased the first in-game prototype of traveling from the Stanton System to the Pyro System via a Jump Point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After a much longer than anticipated development process, what was teased in 2019 becomes a reality for all players when we launch Star Citizen Alpha 4.0 to the live servers, as part of what we are calling the 4.0 Preview.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Citizen Alpha 4.0 brings with it a full wipe and reset to all accounts. All players start fresh with their account hangars and wallets +20,000 aUEC (Alpha United Earth Credits, Star Citizen’s virtual currency used during the alpha stage). Headline additions include Pyro, the second Star System added to the Star Citizen Universe, the first jump point in the persistent universe, connecting the Stanton and Pyro systems together, an economy overhaul, and much more. Check out the patch notes over on the <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/Patch-Notes/20360-Star-Citizen-Alpha-40" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roberts Space Industries website</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October, CIG said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/squadron-42"><u>Squadron 42</u></a>, the standalone, single-player story game set in the Star Citizen universe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-dev-confident-of-releasing-standalone-single-player-story-game-squadron-42-in-2026">launches at some point in 2026</a>, which, if it makes that release window, would be an incredible 14 years after CIG first launched Star Citizen's crowdfunding drive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roberts, known for creating the Wing Commander series, has said Squadron 42 will offer 30-40 hours of gameplay. It stars Gillian Anderson, Henry Cavill, Gary Oldman, and Mark Strong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
