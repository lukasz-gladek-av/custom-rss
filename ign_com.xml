            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Some original stock is still up for grabs, though.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sonic the Hedgehog crossover with Magic: The Gathering's boutique Secret Lair drops went live yesterday, and it was predictably popular. Eager fans swarmed the site, and now, scalpers are already selling some of the product online at a mark-up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Secret Lair is Magic: The Gathering's special collection of rare and unique cards, with either brand-new designs or special reprints of classic cards. For Sonic, the Blue Blur <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-magic-the-gathering-crossover-spoilers-secret-lair">got three different sets of cards</a>. The Friends &amp; Foes collection featured new cards that could, presumably, be Commanders for Sonic-focused Commander decks, like Knuckles, Amy, Dr. Eggman, and Shadow. Turbo Gear and Chasing Adventure, meanwhile, were reprints of cards like Lightning Greaves and Unexpected Windfall with Sonic-styled card art.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering – Secret Lair x Sonic: Turbo Gear</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When the set went live at 9am PT yesterday, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sonic-x-magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-drop-saw-eager-fans-running-headfirst-into-long-waits-and-queues">queue formed and quickly ramped up</a>. There were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1lyxqmh/sonic_secret_lair_to_be_limited_to_2_of_each_item/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">limits in place</a>, presumably to prevent people from mass-purchasing and flipping the goods. Still, it shouldn't be a surprise that a few card sets have found their way onto eBay already, at a marked-up price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Turbo Gear Foil Edition, for example, is <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/317084478781?_skw=sonic+secret+lair" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being listed at $70 (or best offer) on eBay</a> with a preorder/presale marker, as the actual Secret Lair cards have not shipped yet. For comparison, the Secret Lair shop price for this foil set is $39.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=sonic+secret+lair" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive options</a>, like the entire Sonic collection sans foil, are going <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/197530527514?_skw=sonic+secret+lair" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for $349.99 (or best offer)</a>, and some listings put individual collections like the Friends &amp; Foes at $80 or more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The strange part is that while the Secret Lair vault will eventually run dry, and some parts of the collection have already gone down to low or no stock, other card sets are still available. As of this writing, the Friends &amp; Foes Foil Edition is <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/en/product/1161305/secret-lair-x-sonic-friends-foes-foil-edition" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still available for $49.99</a>. It won't <em>always </em>be available, but it's somehow both surprising and not surprising these sets are already getting flipped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who'd rather chase after other cards, the next <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preview-everything-announced">Magic: The Gathering set Edge of Eternities</a> is officially out on August 1, with pre-release starting on July 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-scalpers-are-already-selling-the-sonic-secret-lair-at-a-mark-up]]></content:encoded>

It's being published by HypeTrain Digital, and it's due out on PC in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bizarre occult city is ruled by the Traum Family, whom you'll need to go undercover with and infiltrate after these overconfident aristocrats were foolish enough to open the Forbidden Red Door, after which they weren't the same when they returned. Sever says you can play as a "spy, saboteur, charlatan, revolutionary, loyalist — or something far darker. No path is fixed. No mask is permanent." Watch the debut trailer above and check out the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Agent of Strange - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sever promises that no two playthroughs will be identical, and that everyone in this living world will have their own agendas and make their own choices. You'll need to build alliances, delve into conspiracies, and choose your words and actions carefully, as the game will adapt based on your choices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In sum, Sever says they aim for Agent of Strange to deliver "a surreal, story-rich experience blending deep player agency, systemic storytelling, and dark immersive worldbuilding." <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3855850/Agent_of_Strange" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a> it on Steam if you're interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus more on DK's redesign.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 2 blockbuster <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> will be something of a template for the character's future 3D games, Nintendo has said, splitting DK's appearances in 2D and 3D titles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to how Mario still appears in both 2D and 3D installments — the most recent of each being Super Mario Bros. Wonder and Super Mario Odyssey, respectively — Nintendo now sees a similar delineation in its plans for its most prominent ape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expanding on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-exists-because-yoshiaki-koizumi-asked-the-mario-odyssey-team-for-a-3d-donkey-kong-game">comments previously made to IGN about Bananza's origins</a>, producer Kenta Motokura has said that the game's development began when Nintendo legend Yoshiaki Koizumi asked his 3D Mario team to work its magic making a 3D DK game instead.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"With an eye to expanding the Donkey Kong franchise further, I'd like the team that's been working on 3D Mario games to create a 3D Donkey Kong game," Motokura quoted Koizumi as saying, as part of a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2025/July/Ask-the-Developer-Vol-19-Donkey-Kong-Bananza-Chapter-1-2871377.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ask the Developer</a> Q&amp;A. It was this instruction, combined with ongoing experimentation into voxel-based destruction, that led to Donkey Kong Bananza's genesis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked how Bananza sits alongside other Donkey Kong games, Motokura continued by saying that the 3D Mario team considered this project to epitomise a new 3D Donkey Kong "branch", separate to the DK's 2D platformers — leaving the door open to both kinds of games still existing in future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In a long-running series, novelty and continuity are both important, but we wanted this title to fully convey the appeal of Donkey Kong as a character," Motokura said. "Meanwhile, we thought that by creating something new, leveraging our experience developing 3D Mario games, we'd have the opportunity to create two separate branches – 2D Donkey Kong and 3D Donkey Kong – just as we did with Mario games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, keeping in mind that this game will come to symbolise 3D Donkey Kong, and with the theme of bringing Donkey Kong's strengths and new actions to the forefront, we thought the concept of 'destruction' would be a good fit."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Direct Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Motokura discussed Nintendo's recent Donkey Kong redesign in more detail, and said that it was the development of Bananza which spearheaded the company's search for a new DK look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Donkey Kong Bananza sparked the creation of a design which I think better conveys the new Donkey Kong," Motokura said, noting that Nintendo's new 'standard' DK was actually another attempt to recapture the character's original design, drawn by Shigeru Miyamoto for the Donkey Kong arcade game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Outside of this game, Donkey Kong has recently appeared in The Super Mario Bros. Movie released in 2023 and in Mario Kart World, but there's a basic character design which provided the foundation for those versions of Donkey Kong," Motokura concluded. "That basic Donkey Kong design has been completely revamped. While overhauling the design, we returned to where it had all started. We took Miyamoto-san's original Donkey Kong as the basis, adding design elements from Donkey Kong Bananza here and there."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's next for Donkey Kong? Well, it certainly sounds like the door is being left open for the character to reappear in further 2D games in future. And then there's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-has-filed-a-copyright-notice-for-an-untitled-donkey-kong-motion-picture">intriguing copyright listing for an unannounced Donkey Kong movie</a>, spotted by Nintendo fans earlier this week. It seems like there's plenty in store for DK to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
