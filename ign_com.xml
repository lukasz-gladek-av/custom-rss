            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> developer Gearbox has released the biggest update to the looter shooter since launch, adding a Field of View (FOV) slider on console, various performance improvements, and various Vault Hunter and gear buffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The September 25, 2025 update adds new Weekly Activities, stability and performance improvements, adjustments to some rewards/progression, and further refinements across UI, audio, visuals, and gear. Check out the patch notes, from <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Borderlands website</a>, below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of particular note is the addition of a FOV slider on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-confirms-its-exploring-how-to-add-fov-sliders-to-borderlands-4-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-amid-complaints-from-console-players">something players had asked for</a>. Gearbox chief <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/randy-pitchford-addresses-borderlands-4-console-fov-slider-complaints-theres-some-dreams-i-have-where-an-fov-setting-might-affect-fairness">Randy Pitchford had responded to the complaints to suggest fairness might have had something to do with the lack of a FOV slider in Borderlands 4</a>, although all that comment did was confuse fans given the PC version has it and there’s crossplay at launch. While its arrival is welcome, Gearbox warned console players that increasing the FOV past the default could cause some dips in performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative director Graeme Timmins had flagged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-says-its-prioritizing-the-first-round-of-buffs-over-patching-out-instakill-knife-builds-but-it-will-eventually-address-unintended-interactions">Gearbox was more interested in buffing than nerfing Borderlands 4 in the short term</a>, leaving broken builds alone for the time being. And today's update reinforces that approach, with no nerfs to speak of. Indeed, Timmins <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971250703239901643" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to say Gearbox had too many buffs to fit into today’s update, so it broke them up into their own balance update that’s due out early next week.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The update also includes fixes for the high-profile memory leak issue for Borderlands 4 on console, which causes the framerate to degrade the longer you play. But there’s more to come. “We believe we've made significant improvements there, but we're still investigating data to make sure any remaining issues continue to be resolved,” <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971251482692669832" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timmins explained</a>. “We're confident that today's update makes a big difference though, and we're excited to get feedback/data on it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance improvements on PC are also welcome. Borderlands 4 is still on a mixed Steam review rating, with most of the negative comments revolving around PC performance. The tech experts at Digital Foundry have said their <a href="https://youtu.be/2v1ST5qMoaY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>initial analysis of Borderlands 4 on PC</u></a> shows significant stutter problems, and have advised against running the game on its ‘Badass’ graphics setting, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting"><u>which suggests there are indeed problems with the Unreal Engine 5 title</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without an updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 3 is not in any plan developer Arrowhead has right now, the studio’s CEO has confirmed. Instead, it wants <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> to keep going for years and years, like veteran MMO RuneScape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jagex’s fantasy MMO RuneScape began life as a browser game an incredible 25 years ago. It’s had over 300 million accounts since, and is still going strong today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, rather than follow Helldivers 2 with Helldivers 3, as the video game industry would perhaps expect, Arrowhead wants to follow RuneScape’s lead.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-boss-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-a-forever-game-like-runescape-that-can-keep-improving-with-no-plans-for-a-sequel/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani clarified the studio’s plans in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1420521613207535647" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on Discord</a>. “We have no plans for HD3,” he said, “just HD2 for as long as it can go. Think RuneScape.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of a Helldivers 3 had come up recently when Jorjani said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-about-a-destiny-style-social-hub-for-helldivers-2-its-on-the-feature-list-for-the-next-one-dev-says">a social hub space like the Tower in Destiny was “on the feature list for the next one."</a> But he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nbmucr/comment/nd46h3l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later clarified</a> that he was talking about Arrowhead’s next game, not a Helldivers 2 sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His latest comment is consistent with prior statements on the studio’s plans. Jorjani has in the past said Arrowhead hopes to build upon Helldivers 2 to such an extent that it basically becomes a Helldivers 3, but that was clearly figuratively speaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Myself and the directors agree we would love this to be a forever game,” Jorjani added in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1420498034395054172" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another Discord post</a>. “Assuming we get a grip on the performance and dev practices we can keep expanding it for a long time. PlayStation is super supportive.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2 Review Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jorjani’s comments shouldn't come as a surprise. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-around-for-years-and-years-and-years-to-come-and-what-about-a-warhammer-40000-collab"><u>The studio has indicated it plans to support Helldivers 2 for years to come</u></a>, and only recently launched the Sony-published game on Xbox Series X and S and the Into the Unjust update, which added Hive Worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In April, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-around-for-years-and-years-and-years-to-come-and-what-about-a-warhammer-40000-collab">Helldivers 2 production director Alex Bolle told IGN</a> "we want it to be around for years and years and years to come."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And it's almost like, how do we stay true to the Helldivers 2 fantasy, challenging enough that we keep making amazing new features and new systems and all that while we stay true to who we are?" he continued. "And I think it's something that is so motivating for the years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The more we figure out how to thrive in a live environment, and we still have a way to go to figure out a lot of things around that, the more we can let creativity loose on new systems that we would've never thought about a year ago when we released. I've worked on live games before and it's where you feel like you have something you can figure out: what if I would do this cool thing I've seen in other games and adapt it to our sauce, that still makes it true to ourselves? I'm looking forward to this moment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, while Helldivers 3 isn’t happening, more Helldivers stuff very much is. In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-helldivers-2-film-in-production">Sony announced that <u>Helldivers 2</u> was being adapted into a film</a> as part of a collaboration between Sony Productions and Sony Pictures. No other details were offered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. Check out IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review-update-now-on-xbox-series-xs"><u>review of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X and S</u></a> to see what we think of the game as it is today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
