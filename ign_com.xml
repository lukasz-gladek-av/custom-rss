            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For me, I don't think I've ever been more excited about Magic: The Gathering since Wizards of the Coast brought out the Lord of the Rings expansion. Not only are we currently enjoying <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6DDKd?object_uuid=8fc3c3e0-98d6-41a9-8e9a-c8d8d71d2def&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marvel's Spider-Man</a>, but we've got <a href="https://zdcs.link/9211y5?object_uuid=8fc3c3e0-98d6-41a9-8e9a-c8d8d71d2def&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> next month and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqqX8?object_uuid=8fc3c3e0-98d6-41a9-8e9a-c8d8d71d2def&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> in March next year.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro and co. haven't forgotton about it's core audience either. Aswell as bringing in new faces to the massive TCG, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp44lD?object_uuid=8fc3c3e0-98d6-41a9-8e9a-c8d8d71d2def&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lorwyn Eclipsed</a> is releasing in January, and will have players reminicing about Shadowmoor. MagicCon: Atlanta revealed some cards and new mechanics, with <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/planeswalkers-guide-to-lorwyn-eclipsed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planeswalker letting players in on the lore behind the new set</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's all very exciting, but the main worry for players new and returning is the price of entry. Don't worry, ive got that covered below. Here's where to get upcoming, new and legacy Magic: The Gathering sealed products at the best prices:</p><p id="mtg-cheapest-at-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG: Cheapest at Amazon">MTG: Cheapest at Amazon</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a handful of booster boxes available for slightly less at Amazon this week, but it's a bit of a poor turnout for Magic: The Gathering players. Most of the listing on Amazon are above MSRP and higher than secondary market values, but the carosel above are good deals when compared to TCGPlayer.</p><p id="mtg-cheapest-at-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG: Cheapest at Amazon">MTG: Cheapest at TCGPlayer</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer's sellers are keeping away from the sneaker-heads and crypo bro mentality that's hit Magic and Pokémon TCG is 2025 and is keeping prices down. Market value for MTG sealed product goes off what people are willing to pay, and it shows. There's so much here that's at a lower price than big box retailers it's embarassing. But, it's great for your pocket!</p><p id="blaziken-ex-volcanion-ex-premium-c"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Blaziken ex &amp; Volcanion ex Premium C">Blaziken ex &amp; Volcanion ex Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="688f638e-8444-4126-a204-e1320f401009" id="229712"><div id="229712" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blaziken ex &amp; Volcanion ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Trainers and collectors will get five Destined Rivals Boosters and five Journey Together Boosters in this bad boy, so that's about the right kind of ball park for ten booster packs, plus you're getting the promo Volcanion ex and Blaziken ex promo card and a jumbo version of Blaziken ex. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think these promo's would work great together in a fire-themed deck. Use Blazikens Seething Spirit to grab fire energy from your discard pile to build up Volcanion. In the meantime Volcanion can burn opposing Pokémon then use Scorching Cyclone for 160 damage then transfer all it's energy to a benched Pokémon. So many possibilities here.</p></div><p id="pok-tcg-mega-evolution-in-stock"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Poké TCG: Mega Evolution In Stock">Poké Price Check: Mega Evolution In Stock</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Evolution seems to be a well-printed start to the next era of Pokémon TCG. I'm seeing boosters in convienience stores and some products on physical shelves, not to mention the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLM8mm?object_uuid=8fc3c3e0-98d6-41a9-8e9a-c8d8d71d2def&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Bundle ($52.89)</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxADp?object_uuid=8fc3c3e0-98d6-41a9-8e9a-c8d8d71d2def&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gardevoir ETB ($88.81)</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxA8p?object_uuid=8fc3c3e0-98d6-41a9-8e9a-c8d8d71d2def&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Three Booster Blister ($28.90)</a> available on Amazon.

Like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/lego-toys">LEGO</a>, Hallmark has ventured into licenses and partnerships with companies that make fun things: video games, movies, TV shows, etc. One of the latest new Hallmark Keepsake ornaments for 2025 is one that will have Xbox fans (both current and lapsed) excited to put up their Christmas trees this year. It’s a small, yet intricately detailed, re-creation of the Xbox 360 console. It even plays the Halo theme song when you press the button. It’s available now, for $28.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxAOY?object_uuid=5ff7e42f-d01e-4cdc-a4c3-963e2aa2a1c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>).</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox 360 Console with Light and Sound - Hallmark Keepsake Christmas Ornament 2025</h2><div catalogid="00e470b9-e4a4-43fd-9cb6-de849ef7e38e" id="229617"><div id="229617" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xbox 360 Console with Light and Sound (Plays Halo Theme Song)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox 360 console ornament is 3.25 inches tall. It’s an almost perfectly scaled-down model of the iconic white console that was first released in 2005. The ornament has the console standing up, with a white Xbox 360 controller leaning against it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As indicated by the higher-than-usual price, it’s a “With Light and Sound” ornament. The power button on the console glows green when you press it. It then emits the familiar Xbox 360 startup sound, followed by about 20 seconds of “Behold a Pale Horse,” a song from the Halo 3 soundtrack. You can watch a video of it on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxAOY?object_uuid=5ff7e42f-d01e-4cdc-a4c3-963e2aa2a1c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon listing page</a>.</p></div><div catalogid="00e470b9-e4a4-43fd-9cb6-de849ef7e38e" id="229615"><div id="229615" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Halo 3 - Master Chief Xbox 360</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of, also new this year in the Hallmark Keepsake line is an awesome <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-3-hallmark-christmas-ornament-amazon-buy-2025">Halo 3 ornament</a> that features the game’s box, with Master Chief actually emerging from it, 3D-style. It’s one of the coolest ornaments I’ve ever seen. Both of these are like a blast of nostalgia for anyone who had an Xbox 360. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to pick, but the Xbox 360 is in the running for my favorite console of all time, and these ornaments bring me right back to those golden days of gaming. The Xbox 360 paved the way for so many things we take for granted these days, from easy online play to huge open-world games. And even though the console came out 20 years ago, that’s the platform Grand Theft Auto V debuted on, a game that’s still relevant today in the lead-up to the sequel. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">More New 2025 Hallmark Keepsake Ornaments</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of other new ornaments to choose from, including this awesome (yet pricy!) <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-new-100-star-wars-hallmark-ornament-requires-a-separate-power-cord-purchase">Star Wars ornament</a> that requires a power cord that's sold separately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.
