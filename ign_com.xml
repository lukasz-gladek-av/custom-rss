It’s an artifact that can be sacrificed for mana to bring your Commander into play, and was expected to be unbanned… except that didn’t happen.</p></div><div id="235659"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235659" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Biorhythm</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QW6dXW?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Biorhythm</u></a> <em>was</em> unbanned, though, despite being quite frankly a little scary. It swaps players’ life totals to the number of creatures they control. Play it after a board wipe that leaves you with even one creature, and you might be the only player left standing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s ramped up to around $30 from being less than a third of that a few weeks ago.</p></div><div id="235660"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235660" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nurgle's Rot</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm82vy?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Nurgle’s Rot</u></a> is from the Ruinous Powers deck from the Warhammer 40K set of precons, and it essentially gives you a stream of demons if you keep applying it to monsters you slay.

The card is now worth around double what it was two weeks ago, sitting around $18 at the time of writing. Tyvar gives your Elves deathtouch when attacking, and bulks up your board with mana abilities. Oh, and it’s a 5/4 for good measure.</p></div><p id="crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers">Crashers</h2></p><div id="235663"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235663" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Stoneforge Mystic</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l8wMR?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Stoneforge Mystic</u></a> is a big part of equipment decks that can host White cards, and for good reason.

It’s a 0/5, and makes creatures with more toughness than power cheaper to cast. Then, whenever a creature attacks or blocks, it gets +X/+X until the end of turn, where X is the difference between the two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s being sold for as little as a dollar right now, and you it’ll slot handily into the Abzan Armor precon.</p></div><div id="235667"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235667" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Colossal Grave-Reaver</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9gX3e8?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Colossal Grave-Reaver</u></a> is a personal favorite card of mine, just because it’s frankly ridiculous if you can get it online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now up to $7 from $4 at the end of 2025, it’s a 7/6 dragon that mills cards and can put a creature into play from the graveyard.</p></div><p id="sealed-product-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Product Deals">The Best MTG Sealed Product Deals Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-where-to-buy-updated-2026"><u>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set</u></a> arrives next month (with prerelease even sooner), but Amazon isn’t waiting to drop the price of booster boxes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After some price fluctuations, the retailer has finally confirmed that the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB8dVV?object_uuid=36ee9818-963b-45f3-b556-cc9a8810d9e9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TMNT Play Booster Box will be sold for $125.99</u></a>, which is only a dollar more than its all-time lowest price of $124.99 that we saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-preorders-drop-to-new-record-low-price-amazon-just-weeks-after-last-discount"><u>a few weeks ago</u></a> as a sale item.</p><div id="235624"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235624" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TMNT Play Booster Box</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With 30 packs per box of Play Boosters, you’re getting each one for $4.19, a discount that adds up and should give you a sizeable collection of TMNT cards right from the jump.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a reminder, the set’s rarest alternative treatments will more likely be found in Collector Boosters (more on those in a moment), but Amazon setting this price means it should be relatively easy to get up to speed and build something playable for your next Magic night.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.</p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-market-watch-february-20-2026]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Nier: Automata "to be continued..."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nier: Automata, Yoko Taro and PlatinumGames' 2017 action RPG follow-up to Nier and the Drakengard series, has officially sold 10 million copies nine years after its release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a tweet/X post and YouTube video shared by the official accounts for Nier and publisher Square Enix respectively. The post includes a celebratory piece of Nier: Automata art:</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— NieR公式PRアカウント (@NieR_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/NieR_JPN/status/2024798275728212166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In a press release, Square Enix confirmed that in addition to this milestone for Automata, Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139, the remake of Nier released in 2021, has sold two million copies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The six-minute-long YouTube video provides a recap of everything Nier: Automata-related from the last decade, and unless you're a superfan, the sheer volume is probably a lot higher than you'd expect. There's the game itself and its various re-releases and ports, plus multiple concerts, stage presentations, written works, animation, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It ends on a teasing note, with text reading: "Nier: Automata to be continued..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tantalyzing as it sounds that this may mean another game is in the works, Nier fans have been here before. A number of the Nier works shown in that video have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoko-taro-reportedly-teased-nier-3-with-repent-concert-message">seemingly teased more Nier to come</a>, but it's never quite been the AAA video game rendition fans wanted. The story has been told and sequelized through many different mediums at this point, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-mobile-game-shuts-down-in-april">no-longer-available mobile game</a> that's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-3-has-been-in-front-of-us-all-along-per-series-creators-tease">effectively a direct sequel</a>, but no full-blown PC/console game has emerged in the last nine years. Maybe other fans feel differently, but it's left me a bit jaded at the idea. Even Yoko Taro sounded a bit weary when he was last asked about it, saying that he was trying to make new projects, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-creator-yoko-taro-is-still-working-on-games-they-just-keep-getting-canceled">but they kept getting canceled on him</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is a shame, because Nier: Automata rules. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review">gave it an 8.9/10 when we reviewed it in 2017</a>, saying it's "a crazy, beautiful, and highly entertaining journey full of nutty ideas and awesome gameplay. It may not include the most sensical story or compelling characters, but its frenzied combat -- coupled with beautiful visuals and a stunning soundtrack – make it too much fun to pass up."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
