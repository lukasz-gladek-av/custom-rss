On it are locations in the Fallout map style which, when accessed, lead you to behind-the-scenes information on the show. For example, The Vault 33 outer door, from which Lucy first steps foot into the wasteland, is on the south of the map. The Caswennan, the airship that serves as a soaring fortress for the Brotherhood of Steel, is to the east. And, ahead of the debut of the Fallout Season 2 finale, in the top right was a locked point of interest alongside a timer pointing to February 4.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/04/fallout-main-1767786059781-1770198248593.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Amazon's website had a locked node with a countdown pointing to the end of Season 2. Image credit: Amazon Prime Video.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That got some fans’ hopes up that the countdown was leading to the reveal of the heavily rumored Fallout 3 Remastered, or the equally heavily rumored Fallout: New Vegas Remastered. It turned out to be neither. Instead, it’s yet another interactive node, this time for ‘The Penthouse’ at the top of the Lucky 38 casino, the lair of antagonist Mr. House.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/04/screenshot-2026-02-04-093255-1770197610415.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Amazon's interactive Fallout website is updated to unlock the countdown. Image credit: Amazon Prime Video.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once the private domain of Mr. House, it overlooks the Strip with a commanding view of New Vegas, equal parts luxury suite and control center,” reads the official description. “Step back in time to this intersection of decadence and authority!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clicking through leads you to a 3D interactive representation of the Penthouse, which includes a short video interview with Mr. House actor Justin Theroux about the genuinely impressive set, photos of the Strip, and even a creature gallery. This is all great if you’re after some extra Fallout information, but not the best if you’d hoped for a new Fallout game. In truth, some had suspected this would be the case. At best, some had said, it would contain a tease for Season 3 of the show.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/04/screenshot-2026-02-04-092438-1770197530256.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sorry, no Fallout remaster announcement today. Image credit: Amazon Prime Video.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which leads us to the next obvious question: what’s going on with these Fallout remasters? They’re still coming. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-3-remaster"><u>Fallout 3 remaster</u></a> that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>leaked back in 2023</u></a> is still in the works, and is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-3-remaster-still-on-the-way-report-claims">expected to be a similar effort to last year’s The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>. Then there’s Fallout: New Vegas Remastered, which is also reportedly still on the way, although we don’t have any indication when either game will release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5">a recent interview with IGN</a>, we asked Bethesda development chief Todd Howard if the success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which has seen over 4 million players since it shadowdropped last year, was a repeatable trick for a Fallout 3 Remastered. Howard kept his cards close to his chest, and reiterated a point he’s been making a lot in interviews lately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will just say that the Oblivion Remaster, we're really, really pleased with how well it did, it was a very long project too, and not just in how it was received, the ability to shadowdrop it, and the response to doing that,” he said. “I like to do that with games as much as possible. I love the moment that you find out about a game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline single-player Fallout game was Fallout 4, which came out in 2015 and recently saw the release of its Anniversary Edition. The multiplayer focused Fallout 76 followed in 2018, and while fans slowly flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG, it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as remasters, we know Bethesda wants to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>. Back in June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing Fallout 5 out the door</u></a>. Then, in December last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-5-will-exist-in-a-world-where-the-stories-and-events-of-the-show-happened-or-are-happening-todd-howard-confirms">Howard confirmed that Fallout 5 would indeed take into account the canon events of the Fallout TV series</a>. "In short, yes," Howard told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC Newsbeat</a>. "Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening. We are taking that into account."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out about new Fallout video games, check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-finale-review-episode-8">Fallout Season 2 finale review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The post-credits scene at the end of Fallout Season Two teases something huge from the games.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you just finished watching the finale of Fallout season two, hopefully, you hung around until the end for its post-credits scene. That’s because within it hides the blueprints for “Liberty Prime Alpha” — a name that will excite you if you’ve played the Fallout games, but may confuse you if you haven’t. Rest assured, though, because we’re here to tell you exactly why you <em>should </em>be eagerly anticipating its apparent arrival in Fallout’s third season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To cut to the chase, Liberty Prime is a giant robot originally built by the United States Army in the years before the Great War that turned America into the wasteland it is today. A 40-foot-tall metal monster packed with extreme power, including highly destructive head-mounted energy cannons and a seemingly endless supply of throwable explosives, it's quite the weapon of mass destruction. Think the Iron Giant, but nowhere near as friendly.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/03/fo4-liberty-prime-concept-art-1770135733764.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Liberty Prime concept art from The Art of Fallout 4 book.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Initially conceived in 2072 and planned for deployment against the communist forces of China in Alaska, Liberty Prime never actually made it into battle, despite being fully constructed, as a sufficient power source was never obtained. That doesn’t mean it would never see any action, though, as this colossus appears in both Fallout 3 and Fallout 4. Let’s take a look at what it got up to in those games, as well as theorise a little about how it could be deployed in season three of the show.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fallout 3</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Liberty Prime would sit dormant for many, many years after the bombs dropped, until it was rediscovered in 2255 amongst the ruins of Washington, D.C., the setting of Fallout 3. For over 20 years, the Brotherhood of Steel worked away on restoring the war machine with mixed results, until its eventual revival in 2277. Its first taste of action would come in a battle against the Enclave, where it destroyed many of the shadowy faction’s forces as the Brotherhood laid claim to the fallen capital’s Jefferson Memorial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Brotherhood would repeat this tactic for another couple of weeks, with Liberty Prime too strong a foe for the Enclave to handle. But soon this tactic would prove predictable, and the giant robot would eventually be lured into a trap that would see orbital weapons descend upon it. Following its destruction, the Brotherhood attempted to rebuild it, but to no avail. Instead, its shattered remains would be left to rust deep in storage until the next person was bold enough to build it again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fallout 4</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A decade later, in 2287, someone would try to do exactly that. This time, a chapter of the Brotherhood headquartered in Boston decided that it needed the power of the walking superweapon to turn the tide in its battle for the Commonwealth. This effort would take many years to come to fruition, as Liberty Prime’s components had to be airlifted along America’s East Coast and pieced together in Massachusetts. Such a mammoth effort was required to combat the newly risen synth threat — an AI lifeform created by the scientific faction called the Institute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A newly improved Liberty Prime MK II, packed with a laser capable of carving tunnels down into the earth and the ability to deploy mini nukes,  then took to the streets of Boston. Depending on your actions at the end of Fallout 4, Liberty Prime can either be destroyed again or live to fight another day as it roams the Commonwealth in the service of the Brotherhood.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fallout: Season Three</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So, this brings up the curious case of how Liberty Prime will be deployed in the Fallout TV show. Set in 2296, nine years after Fallout 4, the show could directly tie into the events of the Brotherhood’s Boston bust-up by having Elder Quintus claim components for Liberty Prime from the Commonwealth. However, considering his civil war antics and the death of Paladin Harkness, it seems unlikely his Boston brothers will consider Quintus an ally anymore. It’s also worth considering that the blueprints are for “Liberty Prime Alpha”, which is presumably a model that pre-dates the MK II version deployed in Boston, and perhaps even the original robot created for the Alaskan front. It seems possible that we’ll be seeing a brand new version of the iconic robot, designed especially for the show.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Declaring himself “Quintus the Destroyer”, it seems like the Knights of San Fernando chapter will be on a nuclear warpath next season. But who will be in his crosshairs? Will his mission be to wipe out the other chapters, or will the violence see The Brotherhood put on a collision course with the New California Republic?. Will season three’s apparent Colorado location be the backdrop for their war? The potential imagery of a looming Liberty Prime walking a warpath towards Denver could well be on the horizon. A mile-high robot in the mile-high city? We wouldn’t say no.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you think we’ll see a fully rebuilt Liberty Prime in Fallout season three? Or do you think the showrunners have different plans for The Brotherhood’s iconic massive robot? Let us know in the comments!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

"Fan out and move up. Good shooting! That was clean, girl." My roommates are probably used to me talking to myself when I'm playing video games at this point, but it speaks to how engrossed I got in this turn-based interplanetary war that I was already developing that kind of relationship with it.

Why is it called that? How long have these other humans been here? There are references to some kind of in-game lore encyclopedia, but it doesn't seem to have been implemented yet. At the end of the day, none of this really gets in the way of my ability to shoot at things. But it does make the early game feel a bit aimless, and I find the setting interesting enough that I'd like to know more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not like Menace completely doesn't care about story, either. There is clearly something brewing here, as unfinished as it is, with tension between the Wayback factions and the marines playing out in voice-acted cutscenes every few operations. It's just unclear where it's going or what I'm ultimately building up to other than harder missions, better gear, and upgrading my ship. In about 35 hours, I didn't run into anything that seemed especially like the main plot. There is a steady escalation of stakes and difficulty, though, which at least does a good job of helping me feel like I'm not just spinning my wheels.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hit the Ground Running</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As a squad-based tactics game, man, I really like Menace. The pacing and action economy are so cleverly crafted to encourage you to play in more active and interesting ways. You can't just set everyone on ov erwatch and creep forward, for example, which is a rut I tend to fall into in similar games. There aren't a lot of passive or reactive abilities, so victory comes from making proactive choices. Moving up the field requires thinking about who still has turns left to spend, and how you can make sure your advance elements have adequate support if they run into trouble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Suppression is a huge deal, at least when fighting other humans, and this adds a feeling of authenticity to  every firefight. In actual warfare, they say hundreds of rounds get fired for every one that hits a target, and that's exactly how Menace works. It's often far more important to keep every enemy in line-of-sight pinned down than it is to inflict casualti es. That gives your second wave safety and freedom of movement to either charge in or flank and win the fight, and this creates a constantly engaging tactical loop. Your own squads who get suppressed will have their action points and accuracy penalized, but will also hunker down or hit the deck intelligently depending on the amount of heat they're under, further making them feel like real soldiers.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">This blends nicely with the fact that every squad is led by a named character you can recruit, level up, and customize. They all have distinct personalities and backstories along with a unique ability that defines them. There's sort of an over-the-top Jagged Alliance vibe, though a bit less goofy. Jacques, a private security contractor I hired from the Wayback, can regain action points when he's under heavy fire, so he thrives at the tip of the spear. Marta begins every mission with a major debuff that turns into a strong buff the more turns that pass, making her a clutch asset for closing out a long mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And unlike in, say, XCOM, these flagship characters only die if their entire squad is wiped out and you can't get anyone over to them to render medical aid, so it doesn't feel like playing a little bit risky will rob you of your beloved blorbos. On the othe=r hand, accompanying each of them (excluding vehicle drivers, which are their own thing) are up to eight renameable squadmates with no dialogue or special abilities. And these guys are… kind of expendable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Manpower is a limited resource you have to manage on the strategic level, so you can't just go throwing background extras into the meat grinder all the time. But especially as you get more advanced medical facilities online that can rehabilitate casualties, the grunts kind of become a wager you can afford to risk by making aggressive plays. And this is such a clever way of getting me to command more actively and break out of my usual, turtle playstyle.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Alien Menace</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Encountering the alien bugs changes things up quite a bit. They're much harder to suppress, though heavy losses can force them to flee. And especially later on, some of them are so heavily-armored that your standard assault rifles are all but useless. They don't really take cover, and a lot of them only have melee attacks. But simply holding your ground and grinding them down at range isn't always an option. Having to switch up my gear and my thinking depending on what I was fighting, in addition to the wide variety of mission types, made me come up with new tactics constantly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Squad customization is also deep and satisfying. There is no standard currency in the Wayback, so all gear is either a mission reward or purchased using the barter system on the black market. But even once you do build up enough scrap bombs and alien guts to trade for the best stuff available, there's a supply budget on each mission that takes into account every piece of equipment and keeps you from simply buying your way to victory. I think this  could use some tuning, since it currently feels like the missions are getting harder a bit faster than my supply budget is increasing. It's almost there. Maybe just a nudge is all it needs.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Favorite Turn-Based Tactics Games</h3><p>Some of my favorite turn-based tactics games, in no particular order.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/LeanaVanadis/lists/lens-favorite-turn-based-tactics-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems like a lot of thought has gone into the various veterancy upgrades squads can earn from promotions, as well. They're pretty well-balanced, feeling powerful enough to be meaningful but not so game-changing as to trivialize combat on their own, like increasing evasion based on how many tiles you moved. Each has a clear role in mind, and almost none feel like they wouldn't be at least situationally useful. It's an area of progression where I can really tell developer Overhype Studios has a strong footing in what works and what doesn't about this genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The strategic layer is not quite as well-developed yet. There are a few different things you can buy with the components gained from completing each multi-mission operation. You have ship upgrades like the med bay and the recruiting office for managing manpower, along with armaments that can be deployed from orbit a limited number of times per mission. Then you have loyalty tracks with each of the three major Wayback factions that can unlock their unique buildings, which can do things like give you an extra chance at post-mission loot or allow you to call in supplies in the middle of a mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They can be neat, but still feel a bit limited in both scope and depth. It's a good first iteration, but this is for sure somewhere I'd like to see more love  given to over the course of Early Access. There are also only three planets so far, which can start to feel a little samey after a while. More are in the works. Technical bugs have been relatively sparse, though my main file is afflicted by a fairly annoying one right now where my manpower counter seems to be permanently broken.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Menace is off to more than a running start already. The turn-based tactical action is some of the best I've played lately, and I love the distinct, voiced squad leaders, as well as both the variety of missions and enemy factions. The biggest missing piece is really story and context. It's hard to get too invested in what's going on in the Wayback when I'm not even really sure why we're here yet. But for Early Access, this is a truly impressive effort, and there's plenty of fun to be had already.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/menace-early-access-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players aren't happy after EA and Battlefield Studios' changes to two of its most controversial cosmetics failed to live up to expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-to-alter-2-controversial-cosmetics-after-fans-accuse-ea-of-ai-generated-content-and-call-of-duty-ghosts-inspiration"><u>promises to address fan feedback</u></a> last week, the Battlefield community was quick to see how update 1.1.3.6 adjusted the Objective Ace skin and Winter Warning sticker when the patch went live this morning. The problem is the changes are almost too small to notice.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— DETONATED (@DETONATEDcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/DETONATEDcom/status/2018712937670627367?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s first take a look at Objective Ace. The skin drew criticism through Season 1 when players noticed it bore a striking resemblance to the Call of Duty: Ghosts logo, with both sharing even a few finer details, such as cracks and paint streaks. The Assault skin also caught flak related to the large white armor piece located on its chest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The updated version of the cosmetic received the more noticeable facelift of the two impacted, with its updated look now featuring new details and a slimmer design overall. Still, it’s not enough for the players who were expecting more significant changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“[I] think the damage has already been done,” one <a href="https://x.com/BABYBLUBERRYZ/status/2018723941251256755?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player commented</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Why did they copy COD in the first place?” <a href="https://x.com/Negan259/status/2018713351526748283?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another added</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">AI Sticker Before VS After Patch <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Battlefield6</a> <a href="https://t.co/Srfjhp7ZHj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Srfjhp7ZHj</a></p>— Battlefield Intel (@BattlefieldInte) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldInte/status/2018666389972902043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Winter Warning sticker, on the other hand, was the center of controversy when players noticed details that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-fans-accuse-ea-of-selling-ai-generated-image-after-spotting-what-looks-like-an-m4a1-with-two-barrels"><u>suggested it may have been created using generative AI</u></a>. Battlefield 6 update 1.1.3.6 seems to have brought no change to its design, with its soldier finger placement and double-barreled M4A1 still plainly in view despite being two of the bigger talking points amongst fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been cause for concern for those who feel EA and BF Studios may have misled fans. However, the developers have since <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2018746377569013844?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stepped in</a> to say the timing relayed in last week’s patch notes, which promised to adjust Winter Warning with the February 3 update, was “incorrect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The latest update notes communicated that a change would be made for the Winter Warning Player Card Sticker to bring it more in line with Battlefield’s visual identity,” a message shared today says. “This timing was incorrect. Winter Warning will be updated when Season 2 launches on February 17th.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear what the new version of the sticker will look like when it launches with Season 2 in about two weeks. For now, players have taken to social media to call attention to both the delay and the relatively small changes to the cosmetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Show what ur doing with it," one <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/2018746669802692706?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fan suggested</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Stop using AI generated Art and cosmetics and we will trust this statement and future ones," <a href="https://x.com/LordVonTiger/status/2018747014855430637?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another added</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-was-the-best-selling-console-of-2025-in-the-us-and-is-still-outpacing-the-nintendo-switch"><u>a strong start</u></a> when it released October 10, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S but has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/losing-steam-3-months-after-launch-its-time-for-a-check-in-with-battlefield-6-and-its-community"><u>faced backlash in recent weeks</u></a> as players hope for fundamental changes to how BF Studios is handling post-launch content. The fallout from a disappointing end to Season 1 reached a boiling point in early January, with the team eventually announcing that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1"><u>Season 2 had been delayed</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following an extended Season 1, Season 2 will launch February 17.
