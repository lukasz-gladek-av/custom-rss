Marcin Momot, Global Community Director at CD Projekt, <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1866151943736897724" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say ‚Äúthe team still has some gas in the tank.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That‚Äôs all we know for now, although CD Projekt teased big things, saying: ‚ÄúGet ready, chooms!

Nor is New Game Plus coming to the game. Momot confirmed in a subsequent <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1866161075281863141" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>: "A lot of questions about whether PS5 Pro support and NG+ are coming with Cyberpunk 2077 Patch 2.2. The answer is no. We do have some other cool stuff in the oven and we‚Äôll talk about it tomorrow during the stream ‚Äî we hope you‚Äôll like it too! Appreciate the patienceüôè"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, CD Projekt said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-enters-full-scale-production-cyberpunk-2077-hits-30-million-copies-sold"><u>The Witcher 4</u> had entered full-scale production</a>, with Project Polaris - the first instalment in the new Witcher trilogy - progressing from preproduction to full-scale production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production ‚Äì the most intensive phase of development,‚Äù commented joint CEO Micha≈Ç Nowakowski. ‚ÄúWe are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase," game director Sebastian Kalemba <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a>. "With new challenges just around the corner, it‚Äôs the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what‚Äôs on the other side of the coin!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt currently has 400 developers working on Polaris, the majority of its 650-person total development staff. That's down from the 410 reported at the end of July. 64 are working on Orion, the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, 42 on Sirius, The Witcher game developed by The Molasses Flood, and 18 on Hadar, CD Projekt's brand new IP. It seems that the developer also had a few members of staff tucked away making this new Cyberpunk 2077 update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news comes as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077"><u>Cyberpunk 2077</u></a> hit an astonishing 30 million copies sold, with the Phantom Liberty expansion selling over eight million. CD Projekt pointed to ‚Äústrong sales‚Äù of both as well as The Witcher 3 during its recent third quarter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúIn less than four years since release we‚Äôve already sold 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077, and as for Phantom Liberty ‚Äì in just over a year it has sold over eight million copies,‚Äù Nowakowski added. ‚ÄúThese are impressive figures. I‚Äôm very happy to see a large, dedicated community coalesce around our Cyberpunk games. In the coming year the base game, along with its expansion, will be released to a new group of users: owners of Mac devices powered by Apple Silicon chips."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
