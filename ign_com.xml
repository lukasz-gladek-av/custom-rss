            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This is the third round of layoffs at EA this year.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Electronic Arts is canceling its planned Black Panther game and shutting down developer Cliffhanger Games, IGN has learned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an email sent to staff from EA Entertainment president Laura Miele, Miele said that these changes, alongside other recent cancellations and layoffs, are being done to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to closing Cliffhanger and canceling Black Panther, EA is also laying off some individuals on both its mobile and central teams. When asked for an exact number of individuals impacted, EA declined to comment. IGN understands the total number of affected individuals in this wave is less than the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn">roughly 300 roles cut last month</a> across Respawn and EA's Fan Care teams - but cannot confirm by how much. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These decisions are hard," Miele wrote. "They affect people we’ve worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We’re doing everything we can to support them — including finding opportunities within EA, where we’ve had success helping people land in new roles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with past rounds of layoffs, EA is endeavoring to place affected individuals in other roles across the company. The company has made use of this placement program with each round of layoffs in recent years, an effort that remains possible despite the constant team cuts likely due to EA seemingly drastically increasing headcount on other teams at the same time. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Per Game File's reporting</a>, EA employed 800 more people as of March of this year than it did the same time in 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Miele's email continues, the company is focusing on a small handful of franchises going forward: Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends. Miele also reassures EA will continue to invest in its Iron Man game at Motive and the third Star Wars: Jedi game, as well as it maintain its mobile business despite today's cuts, while Bioware works on the next Mass Effect. Additionally, last year, CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/continuing-to-evolve-our-business-and-teams" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced the company would be</a> "moving away from development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The email doesn't mention EA Sports, but this is due to Miele running EA Entertainment, while EA Sports is a separate division. IGN understands that the sports division is unaffected by these changes for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Marvel and EA's agreement for Black Panther was part of a three-game deal that included Iron Man and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-and-ea-sign-three-game-deal-starting-with-iron-man">a third, unannounced title</a>. IGN understands this partnership will continue, with Motive Studios leading future Marvel titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Little has been shown of Black Panther so far since its announcement in 2023, though we know from a job listing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eas-black-panther-appears-to-be-an-open-world-sandbox-based-on-job-posting">it was to be a single-player, action-adventure, open-world game</a>. Black Panther was being developed by the newly-formed, now-closed Cliffhanger Games, which was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-ea-studio-dedicated-to-open-world-action-adventure-will-be-led-by-former-monolith-studio-head">formed in 2023</a> with some former developers of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-announces-black-panther-game-from-some-of-the-developers-behind-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">headed up by Kevin Stephens</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cuts come on the heels of multiple other rounds of layoffs and cancelations at EA over the last few years and especially in 2025. Just last month, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn">laid off roughly 300 individuals</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted">around 100 at Respawn, while canceling an in-development Titanfall game and another incubation project</a>. Earlier this year, EA restructured BioWare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">moving some developers to other projects</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">laying off others</a>. In 2024, there was a massive restructuring at EA that resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">670 workers</a> laid off company-wide, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-hit-by-layoffs-amid-eas-ongoing-reductions">around two dozen workers at Respawn.</a> And in 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">50 jobs were cut at BioWare</a> and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs">unknown number were cut at Codemasters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, EA recently implemented <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">mandatory return-to-office for all workers,</a> a move that some employees told IGN has left many currently remote workers with concerns about what will happen to their roles long-term.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked for comment on the exact number impacted, the reasons for these repeated cuts, or if more cuts are expected in the near future, EA referred IGN back to Miele's email. Marvel has not yet responded to IGN's request for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/does-the-new-playstation-vr2-deal-finally-make-it-worth-buying<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">PSVR 2 is back down to its all-time low price.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The PlayStation VR2 headset has dropped to match its all-time low price thanks to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-days-of-play-sale-2025-live">PlayStation Days of Play sale</a>, so if you've been considering picking one up for yourself, right now would be the time to do so. But the question is: Should you actually buy one in 2025? The PSVR2 originally launched for a whopping $599, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-psvr2-headset-price-cut-deal-is-now-live">Sony dropped the price</a> down to just $399 back in March. The latest discount brings that price all the way down to only $349 for both the stand-alone headset and the Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The PlayStation VR2 Headset Is On Sale at Amazon Today</h2><div catalogid="f4357a55-1b57-400c-ac5d-2dc92766936f" id="221877"><div id="221877" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PSVR 2: Horizon Call of The Mountain Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The new $50 discount on the PSVR2 bundle is certainly tempting if you've been wanting to get into VR, but there are a few things to consider before you buy. This is likely the lowest price we'll see on this headset for quite some time and it is the only VR option for PS5 owners. If you want to play Horizon Call of The Mountain, owning a PSVR2 is currently the only way you'll be able to do that. Just last year Sony also released the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-review">PSVR2 PC adapter</a> that allows you to connect it to your PC and play VR games there as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-cuts-investment-in-vr-development-only-two-first-party-vr-games-currently-in-development-report">Sony isn't really investing </a>much into first-party VR games anymore. And with the price drop back in March and the release of the PC adapter, it definitely seems like PS5 owners aren't going to be seeing a slew of new and exciting VR games any time soon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Is It Worth Buying a PSVR 2 in 2025?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that the PSVR 2 is cheaper than the standard Meta Quest 3 <em>and</em> has PC compatibility, it's worth considering if you're looking to get into VR. Since it is really the only VR option for PlayStation, this price definitely makes it worth it if you have both a PS5 and a PC that can handle VR games. You do have to purchase the PC adapter if you want to access your SteamVR library, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-connect-ps-vr2-headset-to-a-pc">connecting to PC is a fairly simple process</a> overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't own a PS5 and are just looking for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-vr-headsets-for-pc">decent VR headset for PC</a>, the PSVR 2 probably isn't worth your money. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a> is still cheaper and doesn't require any sort of extra adapter to start playing games. Since the PSVR 2 isn't a standalone VR headset, you'd also be better off going with the Quest 3 if you don't have either a PS5 or a PC to connect to.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 28, 2025 5:55 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
