            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> update 2.3 launches on July 17, CD Projekt has confirmed, across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S — but not Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a livestream, CD Projekt developers said the studio needs more time to work on patch 2.3 for the Switch 2 version of the game. No release date was mentioned, but it was said it will release "soon after." Patch notes, per <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Cyberpunk website</a>, are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paweł Sasko, Cyberpunk 2 Associate Game Director, said this patch focuses on vehicles and customization. Adrien Jouannet, Lead Designer at support studio Virtuos, which has helped CD Projekt with Cyberpunk 2077 updates, confirmed 2.3 adds three new cars (including the brand-new Yaiba Semimaru from the Cyberpunk 2077: Kickdown comic) and one new motorcycle, which is the first customizable motorcycle in the game. The new vehicles are each unlocked by completing a small quest. Sasko said it will be "intuitive" to trigger the quests. The new quests do not contribute to 100% completion for achievement hunters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, update 2.3 adds the new AutoDrive feature, which lets you drive vehicles hands free. In-universe, AutoDrive hits all the vehicles in the game via a software update. You can set a marker, sit back and let the car drive there for you. It's worth noting to use AutoDrive you have be driving on a road, and it follows traffic rules, so expect to stop at red lights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're attacked, AutoDrive stops automatically so you can deal with combat. Sasko said CD Projekt has fine-tuned the feature to make combat unlikely, so it sounds like you'll need to actively drive into combat to trigger it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a wandering mode, where the vehicle will drive automatically endlessly in free roam, which sounds fun for explorers. Helpfully, the Delamain AI taxi company can be hired for AutoDrive, so he can just drive you around if you'd like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, accompanied with the cinematic camera you can activate while driving, will let you see Night City in a much more cinematic way. This, Sasko said, was inspired by fan-made videos of driving around Night City for hours on end. You can use Photo Mode while using AutoDrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Photo Mode, there's a lot of new features with 2.3. You can now change the time of day and the weather for the scene. There are 27 new NPCs for Photo Mode, too, as well as new outfits and natural poses for the main characters. CD Projekt teased a new Photo Mode contest for fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the technical side, PC gamers can expect AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.1 (FSR 3.1) Frame Generation and Intel XeSS 2.0 support from the release of 2.3 tomorrow. Cyberpunk 2077 <em>will</em> support FSR 4, Sasko said, but it will arrive alongside a future AMD driver release. HDR10+ gaming is now properly supported, however. VRR is coming to the console versions of Cyberpunk 2077, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, CD Projekt talked about the already-announced Mac version of Cyberpunk 2077, which launches alongside 2.3 tomorrow, July 17. There was no mention of the much-wanted New Game Plus, nor are there significant new quests or characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is 2.3 the final update for Cyberpunk 2077? CD Projekt has said previously released patches drew a line under the near five-year-old game, so perhaps there is more to come. During the livestream, Sasko didn't say either way. Could Cyberpunk 2077 go out with a bang this December with a new update to coincide with its five-year anniversary?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the longer term, CD Projekt recently confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cyberpunk-2-enters-pre-production-and-yes-cd-projekt-is-officially-calling-it-cyberpunk-2-now">Cyberpunk 2 has moved into the pre-production phase of development</a>. But don’t hold your breath — the developer has suggested it won't release until late 2030 or even early 2031.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.3 Patch Notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Vehicles</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Added 4 new vehicles, including several Side Jobs tied to acquiring them:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete <em>The Hunt</em> and <em>The Beast In Me</em>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An additional side job unlocks the CrystalCoat™ feature for it.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred"</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete <em>The Beast in Me: Badlands</em>, <em>The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo</em>, <em>Transmission, </em>and <em>Search and Destroy</em>).</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Reward from a new side job (to unlock, purchase 1 Yaiba vehicle, purchase at least 3 vehicles through AUTOFIXER, and complete <em>Reported Crime: You Play with Fire...</em>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you fail the side job, the vehicle can later be purchased through AUTOFIXER.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Available for purchase on AUTOFIXER.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Introducing AutoDrive!
