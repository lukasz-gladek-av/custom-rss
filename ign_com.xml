            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent years, Square Enix has made quite an effort to remaster or remake some of its most beloved games and bring them to modern platforms. We've seen the incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, SaGa Frontier 2 Remastered, and Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles in 2025 alone!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, one game that continues to be left out of that conversation is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a>, which released alongside the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-gifts-2025">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in June. If you're a recent Switch 2 owner and are looking for a new RPG to play, look no further than the fantastic game that is Bravely Default.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster for $29.99</h2><div catalogid="681de1aa-cde5-4374-8e89-64521fd58645" id="233911"><div id="233911" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>BRAVELY DEFAULT FLYING FAIRY HD Remaster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has discounted Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster to $29.99 with a limited-time deal, which marks the lowest we've seen this game to date. Originally released in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS, Bravely Default follows four heroes across the world of Luxendarc as they attempt to reclaim the world's four crystals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bravely Default is a fascinating game for many reasons. It initially was set to be a Final Fantasy game, but it shifted mid-development into its own game despite retaining key elements of the series. Revo, best known for his work as Linked Horizon for Attack on Titan, composed the soundtrack, which is still, to this day, an incredible RPG soundtrack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaster brought new minigames, a refreshed UI, and other solid quality-of-life features like fast-forward, encounter rate adjustments, and more. While this is unfortunately a Game-Key Card, the download is only 11GB, so you will not need much space available on your Switch 2 to download this one. This is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">best Switch 2 games</a> you can buy right now, so don't miss out on this deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology. He co-founded Final Weapon, an outlet focused on nonsense-free Japanese gaming (in 2019) and has contributed to various publishers writing about the medium.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 29, 2025 10:47 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/save-on-bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster-today-at-amazon]]></content:encoded>
