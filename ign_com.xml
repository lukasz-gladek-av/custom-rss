            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's latest financial results are notably silent on the sales performance of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which has not appeared on the company's list of million copy-selling games for either Switch 1 or Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest earnings from the company, released this morning, show that Switch 2 exclusive Kirby Air Riders sold 1.76 million units since its arrival on November 20. But there's no mention of how well Metroid Prime 4, which launched just a couple of weeks later on December 4 — and for both Switch and Switch 2 — has performed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, there's no word on sales for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which launched on November 6. This, however, was a Switch 2 exclusive, a spin-off (from The Legend of Zelda), and an entry without the franchise's lead character (Link).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of its financial results, Nintendo includes lists of its first-party games that have sold over 1 million copies, divided by platform. Metroid Prime 4 is not on either the Switch or Switch 2 list — though could still have passed the 1 million sales figure via combined sales from both platforms. If it did, however, there's no mentioned of it doing so from Nintendo in any of its accompanying notes — and barely any mention of it having released at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment also did not make Nintendo's Switch 2 million-seller list, though its sales performance is likely to cause less concern among fans than the slow start for Metroid Prime 4. (Curiously, Age of Imprisonment's Japanese publisher <a href="https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/e/ir/docs/ir6_20260126e.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koei Tecmo has indicated the game has now hit 1 million sales</a>, though Nintendo has not acknowledged this.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Metroid Prime, after years in the wilderness, a long and troubled development, and no other games for the franchise yet announced, it remains to be seen how or when we'll next see another entry — or whether players will ever get to see more of Prime 4's baddie Sylux, whose story remains unfinished. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-producer-reportedly-leaving-nintendo-after-40-years-unsure-if-there-will-be-another-game-to-wrap-up-syluxs-story">Metroid Prime series producer Kensuke Tanabe abruptly announced that Metroid Prime 4 would be his last game for Nintendo</a> after four decades of service. When contacted for more detail by IGN, Nintendo did not comment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not surprising," wrote one fan, DarkLegend64, in a lengthy thread on the main Metroid <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/1qult0l/facts_about_the_sales_data_is_from_apr_1stdec_31st/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> that laments the latest game's sales. "The marketing for the game was horrendous, giving the feeling Nintendo just sent the game out to die. On top of that, the massive criticism the game has received from the fanbase has ensured it won’t bring in new fans from the word-of-mouth aspect. This game’s release has been a total disaster and I once again fear for the future of the Prime series."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Metroid Prime 4 wasn’t the best Metroid Prime, but it wasn’t a bad game," said TarnishedOctorok. "It was fun. It looked and sounded fantastic. It had some great bits, epic showcase elements, and standout special moments. At least I thought so. The massive collective s*** that was taken on it by WAY too many loud-mouth influencers and other people that didn’t get EXACTLY why they wanted, seriously hurt the brand, and will likely doom any chance for another Prime game. Perhaps another Metroid game of any kind."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other fans, however, pointed to comments from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-dread-end-future-storylines-nintendo">Metroid co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto who previously suggested to IGN in 2021 that another 2D Metroid game was planned</a>, to follow the better-received Metroid Dread.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Switch 2 launch title Mario Kart World is now on an astonishing 14.03 million copies (including those sold in console bundles). This means that only 3 million of the Switch 2's 17.37 million-strong userbase do not have a copy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends Z-A has shifted a combined 12.3 million copies across  Switch and Switch 2 (including 3.89 million physical Switch 2 copies sold). Switch 2 exclusive Donkey Kong Bananza has now passed 4.25 million copies sold since July. Nintendo's Switch ports of Super Mario Galaxy (2.28 million) and Galaxy 2  (2.42 million) have also performed well since their launch on October 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Metroid Prime 4 only arrived at the start of December, the game had been highly-anticipated by core Nintendo fans following a near-decade in development. Unfortunately, reviews were less stellar than those of the franchise's beloved original trilogy, and there was notable criticism prior to launch for its chatty AI companions — a departure from the series' trademark of lone exploration. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reading between the lines, it feels like Nintendo anticipated the game's reception somewhat. It has admitted that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/backtracking-development-again-was-out-of-the-question-nintendo-says-metroid-prime-4s-open-world-hub-was-a-victim-of-the-games-lengthy-development">it knew the game's open world concept might feel outdated by the time the game finally launched</a>, while an unnamed source within the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">reportedly blamed weaker Switch 2 console sales in some regions this past holiday on the lack of a major Western game</a> — a role Metroid Prime 4 should have performed.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming first-party Switch 2 games include Mario Tennis Fever (February 12), Pokémon Pokopia (March 5), Super Mario Bros. Wonder Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park (March 26), Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream (April 16), and Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, which has a vague "spring" launch window. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply listed for 2026 are Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave, Rhythm Heaven Groove and Pokémon Champions, while Splatoon Raiders has a "TBA" launch date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Third-party games include Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties (February 12), Reanimal (February 13), Resident Evil Requiem (February 27), Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake (March 12), Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection (March 13), Pragmata (April 24) and 007 First Light (May 27).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Nintendo hardware, the company today confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-becomes-nintendos-best-selling-hardware-ever-while-switch-2-has-already-outsold-wii-us-lifetime-total">Switch was now its best-selling console family ever</a> — and just shy of the PlayStation 2's record-breaking total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam has quietly withdrawn under fire MMO <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ashes-of-creation"><u>Ashes of Creation</u></a> from sale after its director and leadership team quit just weeks after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ashes of Creation was funded by a hugely successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1791529601/ashes-of-creation-new-mmorpg-by-intrepid-studios" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>$3.2 million Kickstarter campaign back in 2017</u></a>. It finally released in December as a $50 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Early Access game on Steam</u></a>, but by the end of January, the game's director, Steven Sharif, and "much of" the senior dev team quit "in protest," claiming that its management board had asked him to do things he "could not ethically support." According to Sharif, the Board then issued WARN Act notices — layoff warnings, in other words — to the remaining staff. It's unclear how many employees remain employed or who sits on this mysterious board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Sharif posted a brief statement explaining why he quit in the game's Discord community, he has not posted anything since. Given the comments, memes, and inappropriate comments flooding every channel, the Discord itself seems wholly unmoderated now. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Head over to the Ashes of Creation page on Steam now, however, and you'll see that the button to buy has been quietly removed. Conversely, the game's website is still live and accepting payment for cosmetics, but a notice at the top reads: "delivery of cosmetic purchases may be delayed on certain realms. Items will appear in your in-game mail once processing completes." While the site is typically updated several times a month, only one update was posted in the whole of January, and that was alluding to a developer diary livestream coming up on February 13, although it's unclear who will host that, given most of the familiar faces fans have seen in prior streams seem to have left.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Reddit and Discord communities are full of people asking if anyone's successfully convinced Steam to give them a refund. While anyone with less than two hours on the clock should get one automatically, those with more time are having mixed results, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1qu659x/comment/o38513r/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>some reporting success</u></a>, others being <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1qu659x/comment/o38yz7s/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>denied</u></a>, and the rest asked to wait while Steam "investigates" the issue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most successful requests seem to be via human checks, so<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AshesofCreation/comments/1qtwfd3/comment/o35udls/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> players are suggesting</u></a> that those looking for a refund should not check the box to "request a refund," but instead contact Steam via the "I have a question about this product" option. That way, your request will be routed to a member of customer support, and not an automated service. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unlikely Kickstarter donors will secure any refunds, given the nature of crowdfunded programs.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/03/screenshot-2026-02-03-at-09-26-31-1770114874090.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, without any context or introduction, a standard member, Karen L. Boreyko, addressed the community earlier today (February 3) across several Discord channels, writing: "Hello everyone — my name is Karen L. Boreyko, and I want to take a moment to speak directly to this community as we begin a new chapter for Ashes of Creation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Intrepid Studios is moving forward with a renewed long-term vision for the game, including continued development in China and a transition to a subscription-based model supported by optional daily battle passes, a new in-game gold shop, and expanded skill point progression systems. Our goal is to ensure the project’s sustainability while accelerating development and delivering a live service experience that can grow for years to come. We know change brings questions, and we’re committed to open communication as we move ahead together."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At this time, because her account isn't tagged as an official team member, it's impossible to determine who Boreyko is or how she is involved in the game's development, if at all. A Leanne Boreyko is attached to a multi-level marketing wellness company called Vemma, and, coincidentially enough, a different wellness company called 310 Nutrition and <a href="https://310nutrition.com/pages/about-us" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">run by a man called Tim Sharif</a> who has just <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?me=AXG4R53RTUQJ3&amp;marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropped a load of Ashes of Creation merch onto Amazon.com</a>. Make of that what you will.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've a feeling February 13's livestream is going to be very well attended indeed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
