            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">October was an incredible debut month for Battlefield 6: it's officially the best-selling title in franchise history in the U.S., and the best-selling game in the U.S. as of last month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Circana's monthly report, which states that Battlefield 6 is the best-selling game of 2025 on both Xbox and PC, and the second best-selling on PlayStation so far, behind NBA 2K26. It<em> also </em>says that Battlefield produced the highest single month tracked full game dollar sales total of any video game in three years. That means it sold more than the last few Call of Duty games did in their debut months, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II in October of 2022. Is this troubling news for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when the November report comes out? We'll see.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is followed by Pokemon Legends: Z-A, which is the second best-selling game of October and, per Circana, the best-selling physical game year-to-date. Notably, because Nintendo does not share digital sales data, its second-place spot is entirely based on physical sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other debut games for October included The Outer Worlds 2 at No.7, Little Nightmares III at No.8, and Ninja Gaiden 4 at No.11. Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake didn't make it to the top 20, but it was No.6 on Nintendo platforms for the month. There weren't any other major outliers in the charts this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hardware spending was up 36% year-over-year to $351 million, with the Nintendo Switch 2 offsetting declines in the other three major consoles: Nintendo Switch (sales down 52% year-over-year, wonder why?), Xbox Series (down 37%), and PlayStation 5 (down 22%). The Nintendo Switch 2 sold approximately 328,000 units in October, 68% ahead of the original Nintendo Switch's pace and 3% ahead of the PlayStation 4, which was the previous record-holder.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to Battlefield, the Nintendo Switch 2, and a good month for mobile, overall game hardware, content, and accessories spending was $4.9 billion for the month, up 3% year-over-year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">October 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Battlefield 6 (NEW)</li><li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A (NEW)*</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>Madden NFL 26</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2 (NEW)</li><li>Little Nightmares III (NEW)</li><li>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</li><li>Borderlands 4</li><li>Ninja Gaiden 4 (NEW)</li><li>EA Sports College Football 26</li><li>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2*</li><li>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</li><li>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</li><li>Silent Hill: f</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Helldivers II</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.
