            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-dev-firaxis-says-theres-hope-for-gandhi-yet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> is out in the wild, and veteran fans of the strategy series might be left wondering: where’s Gandhi?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indian leader Gandhi has been in every Civilization base game since the franchise’s first release in 1991. He is inexorably linked with Civilization, and spawned one of gaming’s most infamous bugs: Civilization's ‘Nuclear Gandhi’ — <a href="https://youtu.be/Ur3SdgkW8W4?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a bug that turned out to be a myth</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Gandhi is nowhere to be seen in Civilization 7. So what gives? That’s a question I put to Civilization 7 lead designer Ed Beach, who gave Gandhi fans a clear ray of hope that eventually he’ll make it in as DLC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/13/gandhi-1739448996241.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sounds like Gandhi is upcoming DLC for Civ 7. Image credit: Firaxis.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I would say we haven't forgotten about anybody who's been in our game before,” Beach said. “Certainly civilizations, there's a lot of consternation right now about where's Great Britain or England, why aren't they in our game?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Carthage and Great Britain join Civ 7 as part of The Crossroads of the World Collection DC in March 2025, followed by Bulgaria and Nepal.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But there's sort of a big, longer picture roadmap that we have, and some pieces fit better in the long picture roadmap they do in the short picture one,” Beach continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beach went on to explain a bit of Firaxis’ thinking when it came to which Civilizations to add for Civ 7. “One thing I always think about is, we've had the same situation where iconic civilizations haven't been in our base game before,” he said. “We had both Mongolia and Persia missing from the base game of either Civ 5 or Civ 6, and both of those were just massive conquerors who ruled huge chunks of Asia during their time period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we always have to leave somebody out. There're just too many popular choices and we always want to have a few fresh ones that sound really new and exciting to people. So things are getting left behind, but we always are looking at the big picture, when we're going to bring leaders or civs into the fold. So there's hope for Gandhi, yet.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There you have it: there’s hope for Gandhi.</p><div id="best-civ-7-leaders" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Leaders</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps in the shorter term, Firaxis will be working to address Civ 7’s ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, which stems from various community complaints around the user interface, a lack of map variety, and a feeling that the game has launched without a number of key features fans have come to expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN ahead of the release of its third quarter financial results, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-legacy-civilization-audience-will-eventually-come-around-on-civilization-7-amid-mixed-steam-user-reviews"><u>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledged that Civilization 7 had received some negative reviews from press and players</u></a>, but insisted that the “legacy Civ audience” will come around the more they play, and called Civilization 7’s early performance “very encouraging.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for tips to help you take over the world?

Embracer said Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 did particularly well on Steam, where it saw over 250,000 peak concurrent players. For context, the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance hit a peak Steam concurrent player count of 96,069 seven years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s actual peak concurrent player count will be bigger, given the game launched on console as well as PC. However, neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer, which owns Warhorse Studios via its subsidiary, Plaion, said Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 “has been initially successful, not only in terms of player and critic reception, but also in terms of performance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This reflects the dedication and hard work of our development studio, Warhorse Studios, and our publisher, Deep Silver,” Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is our strong belief that the game will continue to generate substantial revenues over the coming years, highlighting the exceptional quality, immersion and appeal of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Warhorse Studios has a robust roadmap, including updates and new content over the next 12 months, ensuring an engaging and continuously evolving experience for the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are immensely proud of the teams involved in the successful release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, which has significantly outperformed our expectations so far,” Wingefors added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Embracer has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> due out later this quarter (January to March 2025). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer said it has more than 5,000 game developers working on its upcoming games, with 10 triple-A games due out over the next three financial years (FY 2025/26, FY 2026/27, and FY 2027/28). Eight of these are from internal studios, two from external studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In FY 2025/26, Embracer has two triple-A games scheduled to be released towards the end of the financial year. Mid-size releases include Gothic 1 Remake, REANIMAL, Fellowship, Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, Titan Quest II, Screamer, Echoes of the End (working title), Tides of Tomorrow, Satisfactory (console) and the full release of Wreckfest 2, alongside a similar number of mid-sized games yet to be announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer has endured a tough time in recent years, laying off thousands of staff and selling a number of its studios, including Borderlands maker Gearbox and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive. It still owns Metro developer 4A Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metro-developer-makes-clear-playstation-vr2-game-awakening-isnt-next-mainline-metro-game"><u>which is working on a brand new game in the series</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting started in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?

While the teaser shown during yesterday's Sony's State of Play 2025 gave fans a glimpse of an Ape Escape monkey in the jungle wilds of Snake Eater on PlayStation 5 and PC, fitting neatly with the PS2 original, Xbox Series X and S players will take on a different threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although we've yet to see any in-game footage, Konami's Xbox teaser, below, closes not with Snake vs. Monkey but Snake vs Bomberman. Yes. Really.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original mode unlocked two items for Snake that carried over into the main game: first-view-perspective Monkey Mask and his Banana Camouflage, which made even rotten food edible.

But the company stressed that sales of all PS5s now brought its latest console in-line with its projected 18 million sales by the end of March 2025, and just 1.5 million units behind predecessor PS4, which had sold 76.5 million units at the same point in its production cycle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monthly active users across its service are also up to 129 million, up 5% year-on-year and marking a new milestone, with overall sales of games and consoles also up by 16%. 42% of PS5 sales were to new PlayStation Network users. Sony's big release during the quarter was Astro Bot, which has sold 1.5 million copies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With "significant increases" reported during its games and network services segment for the quarter, Sony raised its profit forecast by 2%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony did not comment on its wide-reaching outage last week, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-psn-down-february-2025"><u>took its PlayStation Network service offline for almost a full day</u></a>.
