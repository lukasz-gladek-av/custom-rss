            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Highguard is out now following its high-profile showing at last month’s The Game Awards — and its developers have said a full year of post-launch content is already “deep in development.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play PvP raid shooter is live on PC, Xbox Series X and S, and PlayStation 5, with full crossplay. Development studio Wildlight is made up of former Apex Legends, Titanfall, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare staff, and promises “a new competitive structure that blends siege warfare and territory control in an evolving match where power levels escalate until only one base is left standing.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Highguard Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Here’s how Highguard works, according to Wildlight:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Players step into the boots of Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent where magic, gunfire, and siege warfare collide:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Teams of three select a unique base and fortify their defenses, then ride out across vast, uncharted lands to loot, harvest resources, and upgrade their gear while clashing with a rival Warden crew. </li><li>As magical storms roll in, teams battle over the Shieldbreaker, a powerful sword required to breach enemy defenses. Carrying the Shieldbreaker to the opposing base triggers a full raid — forcing teams to attack, defend, adapt, and escalate in power as the match continues.</li><li>Most of the time, victory doesn’t come with a single raid. When that happens, the enemy base shields repair, the siege tower dissipates, and the fight escalates as loot, gear, and weapons all upgrade in the field, and a new Shieldbreaker forms in a different location in the world. From there, the fight for control continues — until only one base is left standing.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each Warden is built specifically for Highguard’s PvP Raid Mode. Wardens combine guns, raid tools, and arcane abilities, each designed to support raiding, destruction, defense, infiltration, resource acquisition, and open-world combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mounts allow teams to move quickly across massive maps, fight on the move, and transport the Shieldbreaker. Magical abilities supplement combat, but Highguard is still a gun game at its core. Gunplay remains central, with abilities and tools adding tactical depth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At launch, the game features a wide array of content: five large-scale maps, six distinct bases, eight Wardens, three mount types, ten weapons, three raid tools, eleven weapon and raid-tool mods, and a wide range of lootable items. More content will be added via seasonal updates.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/highguard-launch-content-1769451647066.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wildlight hadn’t said a word about Highguard since its announcement at The Game Awards, opting to launch it cold. Today, now the game is out in the wild, wildlight said it was built “with long-term play in mind.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Wildlight brings decades of experience operating live-service shooters at scale, applying those lessons to Highguard’s launch and beyond, with a full year of post-launch content already deep in development,” the developer said. “Highguard’s live service is built around Episodes — each lasting roughly two months and split into two parts — with new core content arriving each month throughout 2026, including content such as maps, bases, modes, Wardens, weapons, mounts, raid tools, and additional loot items.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Core gameplay content — including new maps, bases, Wardens, and modes — will always be free, delivered through regular updates, with the first wave arriving in two weeks following launch, Wildlight insisted. The studio added that all in-game purchases are cosmetic only, direct purchase only, with no effect on gameplay and no loot boxes or RNG.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/highguard-2026-roadmap-1769451620817.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Wildlight Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Launch is a huge moment. But our team builds franchises that stand the test of time, and we’re in this for the long haul,” said Dusty Welch, co-founder and CEO of Wildlight. “Success for us is a healthy, growing global community that’s enjoying the game — and a team that’s energized by engaging with players and surprising them with new experiences over time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All players receive the Episode One War Chest free forever, featuring 44 items, including 11 legendary skins and emotes for Wardens, weapons, and mounts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know there’s a lot of eyes on us after our Game Awards trailer debut, and today is finally the time to show the world what we mean by a PvP Raid Shooter. We built Highguard around a loop that doesn’t really exist anywhere else,” commented Chad Grenier, co-founder and game director at Wildlight. “Every match is about escalation: fortifying, venturing out, clashing, then mounting coordinated raids and defenses until only one base is left standing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/top-10-riftbound-origins-cards-to-pick-up-before-spiritforged-comes-out</link>
            <guid>1416685</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Riftbound's second set, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-games-reveals-new-riftbound-spiritforged-cards-and-details-at-pax-unplugged">Spiritforged</a> on the horizon, the meta is about to experience a huge shake-up. We've seen this in practice already, since the set has been out in China since December 12. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They recently had their first Regional Qualifier in Fuzhou, and the new meta is slowly shaping up into a Draven-filled wasteland, but it's far from solved. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are still plenty of cards from the previous set, Origins, to keep an eye on as things evolve that will still be big players when the new cards come out. Spiritforged releases February 13. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Top 10 Riftbound Origins Cards to Get Before Spiritforged Is Out</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Nocturne, Horrifying</h2><div id="234682"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234682" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nocturne, Horrifying</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have been trying to make Nocturne work in decks like Teemo, Strategist and Yasuo, Unforgiven thanks to cards like Stacked Deck since the game came out. It sadly hasn't been the most consistent, but there are a few Spiritforged inclusions that could make this guy the real deal. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Viktor, Innovator</h2></div><div id="234683"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234683" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Viktor, Innovator</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The newest boogeyman of the Spiritforged meta is easily Draven, Glorious Executioner. With Spiritforged, there are a handful of great new Yellow and Blue tools to make a unitless Viktor control deck viable, and it has a decent match up into Draven. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Stacked Deck</h2></div><div id="234684"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234684" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Stacked Deck</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Stacked Deck has been, and will continue to be, one of the best cards in the game. It's currently sitting under $4 on TCGPlayer, so I'd recommend picking up a playset now before it goes again, especially since Purple is poised to likely warp the format around it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Fiora, Victorious</h2></div><div id="234685"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234685" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fiora, Victorious</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Legend Fiora, Grand Duelist recently placed second in the over 500-player Fuzhou Regionals in China, and Fiora, Victorious was that player's Chosen Champion. Not only does it have a good rate with its cost and Might, but it also synergizes well with the rest of the deck and helps ramp with the Legend. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Salvage</h2></div><div id="234686"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234686" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Salvage</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You may already have a few Salvages in your collection since it's an uncommon and less than a buck, but with Spiritforged bringing tons of new equipment cards into the mix, gear removal is at a premium. Drawing a card is nice, too. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Divine Judgment</h2></div><div id="234687"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234687" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Divine Judgment</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another card that slots nicely into that unitless Viktor deck mentioned earlier, as leaving your opponent with reduced resources while you can still develop a boardstate is crucial. I can see Divine Judgment seeing more play as time goes on, especially since it continues to drop in price. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Whiteflame Protector</h2></div><div id="234688"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234688" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Whiteflame Protector</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Master Yi, Honed was the other top deck during the Origins meta, thanks in part to cards like Whiteflame Protector. With Spiritforged, Master Yi continues to put up good numbers, and our favorite shiny white dragon is no longer in the $80+ range. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Sabotage</h2></div><div id="234689"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234689" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sabotage</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I've included Sabotage for the same reason as Salvage, as it may prove invaluable to remove equipment early. But Spiritforged is bringing along a host of new spells that aim to disrupt your game plan, so you should disrupt theirs first with this. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Brynhir Thundersong</h2></div><div id="234690"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234690" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Brynhir Thundersong</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players got wise to how good Brynhir is a bit late during the Origins meta, but I wouldn't be shocked if people are packing one to two of this tempo-breaking card once Spiritforge drops. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Seal of Discord</h2></div><div id="234691"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234691" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Seal of Discord</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no secret that, even in Origins, Purple was the best color. With the release of Spiritforged, the color gets a ton of new powerful cards the synergize well with this unassuming little gear. Cards like Ezreal, Prodigy and Called Shot take advantage of the semi-free Power cost, and some Draven lists are running the maximum number of Seal of Discord to elevate their gameplan. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Riftbound Spiritforged Products</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Click the items below to get your Riftbound Spiritforged cards from TCGPlayer, although unfortunately at a significantly inflated price compared to MSRP. You can get single booster packs, booster boxes, and the two new Champion decks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"He was probably hunting for sport..."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Embark Studios is launching into new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> content when the Headwinds update brings a solo vs. squads matchmaking option, a Bird City map condition, and more to the experience tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a few social media teases and a month of waiting, Embark confirmed plans to deliver the first real content drop of 2026 with a tense teaser trailer and release date of January 27 just moments ago. The announcement has the Headwinds update set to bring a set of smaller additions to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S tomorrow, as fans wait to really get the ball rolling in February.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the next new map, new Arc threats, and major map conditions won’t arrive for a few more weeks, the January update sets Arc Raiders up for all of its future plans. Solo vs. squads matchmaking is probably the biggest addition here, with Embark describing the new queue option as a way to let the more skilled players really test their mettle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where players thus far had been pitted against squads of equal count, solo vs. squads is only available to those over level 40, allowing them to match as a solo Raider against teams of as many as three people for extra XP. Players will also benefit from quality-of-life changes with open parties, which allow players to join between matches, and expanded squad invites, which lets squadmates invite additional players directly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders players can also look forward to a rather bizarre new minor map condition for Buried City called Bird City. It’s more than a cheeky play on words, as it sees the population of topside birds swarming as they leave better loot on top of buildings. Other highlights from the Headwinds update include an Arc Trophy display, a new long-term player project, new quests, the Sandwalker cosmetic set, and what Embark describes as “a range” of gameplay updates and adjustments.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders Headwinds Update 'Bird City' Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Headwinds is about opening up new ways for the community to approach ARC Raiders and additional challenges for advanced players,” Embark design director Virgil Watkins said in a statement. “Between the expanded matchmaking options, new map condition and new player project, we’re excited to see how Raiders adapt and experiment — and we can’t wait to see the unexpected, funny moments and short clips the community starts creating as the update rolls out.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Headwinds is the first of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026">a four-phase roadmap</a> that has content scheduled out through April 2026. Next on the docket is the Shrouded Sky update, which adds a new map condition, Arc threat, player project, map update, Raider Deck, and more sometime in February. Flashpoint will then arrive in March with another map condition and Scrappy update, with Riven Tides rounding things out with a new map and a new large Arc in April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X | S October 30, 2025.

The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the RCC process has to be voluntary and has to be based on terms agreed by employees and trade unions, there's no word today on next steps if the company does not achieve the reduction in headcount it is expecting through this scheme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft's Parisian offices have previously been the sight of protests against the company's previous return-to-office stipulations. Last week, Ubisoft said its company reorganization would also reintroduce five-day office work as standard (albeit with an annual pool of remote working days). Still, IGN understands the decision to propose an RCC to its Parisian workers was made some time ago, before the five-day mandate was decided.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Ubisoft said it was completely shuttering its Stockholm studio that previously collaborated on Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, alongside mobile studio Ubisoft Halifax.
