            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has been dropping some very nice gaming deals recently to start off 2026. The latest offer to catch our eye is on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> for <a href="https://zdcs.link/av8Px2?object_uuid=b1f0f738-ab4a-4a9e-9cc1-28425d8f0bfd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D187PJHJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YRrdj?object_uuid=b1f0f738-ab4a-4a9e-9cc1-28425d8f0bfd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D18PNXNL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>, which have both dropped to $19.99 for a limited time. This marks a return to the lowest price for both <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D187PJHJ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS5</a> and <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D18PNXNL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Series X</a> versions at Amazon, so this is a great opportunity to grab it. And why not spend these next few winter months journeying to a galaxy far, far away?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Star Wars Outlaws (PS5 and Xbox Series X) for $20</h2><div id="234225" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="b60d2672-d5e2-45da-94c2-d03afc9b244c"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws - Limited Edition (Amazon Exclusive), PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><div catalogid="b60d2672-d5e2-45da-94c2-d03afc9b244c" id="234226"><div id="234226" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws - Limited Edition (Amazon Exclusive), Xbox Series X</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Amazon Exclusive limited edition release of Star Wars Outlaws comes with some extras alongside the game. This version will set you up with The Rogue Infiltrator Character Pack, which features cosmetics for Kay and Nix that you can use in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still wondering if this is the game for you? Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">review</a> from IGN's Tristan Ogilvie called it a "fun intergalactic heist adventure with great exploration," though he noted at the time that it was "hindered by simple stealth, repetitive combat, and a few too many bugs at launch." However, since launch, it's received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-patch-cuts-stealth-objectives-improves-ai-and-more-in-huge-title-update-140">updates</a> to give it a bit of a boost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned before, this isn't the only video game deal to cross our radar over at Amazon. The retailer has had quite a few surprises up its sleeve recently, including a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-slashes-50-off-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-as-a-little-new-years-treat">very big discount on Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-delightful-astro-bot-for-ps5-is-back-to-its-best-price-at-amazon-and-walmart">Astro Bot</a>. Outside of Amazon, Walmart's even offering a great <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-dropped-to-just-40-in-the-new-year-sales">deal at the moment on Battlefield 6</a>, if you've been waiting for a good time to add that to your library.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite"><u>Fortnite</u></a> South Park trailer is (officially) here, revealing an all-new short as Butters, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny all drop in for five-player battle royale matches – a.k.a. Quints.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games published the full trailer for its South Park crossover content following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-park-fortnite-gameplay-trailer-leaks-showing-cartman-and-the-gang-in-action-and-yes-you-can-buy-towelie-as-a-pet"><u>a leak</u></a> that wormed its way online earlier today. While the low-quality, unofficial version of the footage did show the Fortnite content in its entirety, there were a few key details saved while players wait for the event to launch this Friday, January 9.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic’s official trailer comes in at about two-and-a-half minutes longer than the leaked trailer, with the vast majority of that runtime filled with fresh scenes set in that iconic animated South Park style. The short sees the show’s main quartet back at their computers to play some video games while leaving Butters to sit alone in a lobby, all because he “lowkey” sucks at Fortnite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Actually, you just suck at Fortnite,” Cartman quips. “It’s not even lowkey.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Butters, donning his tinfoil Professor Chaos costume, then uses the power of the Stick of Truth to transform the South Park school bus into a proper Battle Bus that whisks the group away into the world of Fortnite (and Cartmanland). It’s here the group is forced to add Butters to their squad, making for a pretty natural segway for Epic to introduce its big new feature: Quints.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the fourth graders have proper battle royale mech suit skins built around them, Epic has used the trailer’s description to confirm that Quints is a five-player playlist for players to enjoy until the event concludes February 5. It’s an update that finally brings bigger party sizes to Fortnite after years of calls for increases, though additional details currently remain under wraps.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fortnite x South Park Trailer - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for other changes the Fortnite x South Park event brings to the table, the studio has confirmed the crossover’s Born in Chaos pass will be free. This departure from previous mini passes, which typically cost players and included new skins, will now not include the new South Park outfits, instead allowing players to purchase them in the Shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fortnite South Park event comes to Chapter 7 for one month starting this Friday. While we wait to see how Towelie fits in as a Sidekick and what Easter Eggs Cartmanland has in store, you can see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/top-five-most-played-games-on-playstation-and-xbox-in-2025-in-the-us-were-the-same-as-in-2024"><u>where Epic’s long-running battle royale landed in the list of top-played PlayStation and Xbox games in 2025</u></a>.
