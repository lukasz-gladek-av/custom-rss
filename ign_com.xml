It’ll set you back $123.98 (that’s a lot of Eddies), and it’s a pretty packed set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 10 episodes are split across a trio of discs, there’s a storyboard booklet from director Hiroyuki Imaishi, another booklet, and three animation cel sheets alongside a poster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Preorders are open now, with shipping expected from October 23, 2025.
