            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-spring-festival-event-is-already-being-compared-to-overwatchs-lcioball<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase Games has revealed the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> Spring Festival event, which adds a handful of new hero skins and a soccer game mode that might look familiar to Overwatch and Rocket League players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind the hero shooter hit announced its latest update with a trailer, below, promising to kick off the new year with the Clash of Dancing Lions game mode as well as the Fortune &amp; Colors Gallery Card customization event starting January 23 at 9am UTC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s not beat around the bush: Clash of Dancing Lions looks an awful lot like Overwatch’s long-running summer event, Lúcioball. The standard version of both modes sees players compete in 3v3 soccer matches with a few unique twists that capitalize on their heroes’ abilities. Both obviously rip elements from Psyonix’s massively popular Rocket League, though, and it looks like the Marvel take on the blown-up soccer experience comes with a few differences, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, the limited-time mode seems to focus on at least three characters – Star-Lord, Iron Fist, and Black Widow – instead of just one hero. The soccer ball also seems to be the size of your average, real-life ball, too, as players can be seen carrying it around the competition and to the goal. Marvel Rivals and Overwatch already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-doesnt-stray-far-from-overwatch-but-its-super-fun-regardless">share more than a few things in common</a>, but it will be hard to say just how similar Clash of Dancing Lions and Lúcioball are until the Marvel event drops in a few days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Marvel Rivals Spring Festival event allows players to complete tasks for rewards, including the Star-Lord Lion’s Mane costume seen in the trailer. Additional details remain under wraps, but NetEase tells players that they’ll be able to earn other goodies, such as a nameplate, spray, and more, as part of the event. While the Iron Fist Lion’s Gaze and Black Widow Lion’s Heartbeat outfits were also shown off in the new video, the developers only tell fans to expect to see the three skins arrive in-game “in the coming weeks.”</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Marvel Rivals news, players are still looking forward to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-gets-suit-from-playstations-spider-man-2-later-this-month">Marvel’s Spider-Man tie-in skin</a> set to arrive later this month.

This new set takes Wizards of the Coast's legendary card game into uncharted territory—the world of professional racing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with any new Magic set, players will have new tools and mechanics to explore and build decks around. In <em>Aetherdrift</em>, these come in the form of “Speed” and “Exhaust.” First to the starting line is “Speed,” a new resource that players can accumulate when they play a card with “Start your engines!” which sets your speed value at 1. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can then increase their speed value once on their turn when they deal damage (combat or non-combat) to an opponent up to a maximum speed of 4. By reaching max speed, these cards will gain additional effects, but perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Speed is that, according to Wizards, once you gain it, it won’t decrease and you can’t lose it. While it takes at least three turns to reach max speed, getting a card with “Start your engines!” onto the battlefield as early as possible will be crucial. Additionally, while no specific cards were revealed, Wizards mentioned that some cards gain effects at different speed levels, not just max speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A good example is the new card <em>Far Fortune, End Boss</em>, which deals one damage to each opponent whenever you attack. However, if you are at max speed, it gains an additional ability: “If a source you control would deal damage to an opponent or a permanent an opponent controls, it deals that much damage plus 1 instead.” Since <em>Aetherdrift</em> features many artifact vehicles, <em>Mendicant Core, Guidelight</em> might inspire some deck ideas. Its max speed ability reads: “Whenever you cast an artifact spell, you may pay {1} (colorless). If you do, copy it (the copy becomes a token).” I can already think of a few artifact decks that could benefit from a card like that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Preview - Key Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up is “Exhaust,” which is more straightforward but arguably more powerful. These one-time-use mana abilities compensate for their limited use with incredible versatility and game-changing effects. One of the previewed cards, <em>Redshift, Rocketeer Chief</em>, has the Exhaust ability: “{R}{G} and {10}: Put any number of permanent cards from your hand onto the battlefield.” Its default ability allows you to tap it to add X mana of any single color, where X is equal to its power. Considering that green is known for boosting creature power, you could easily empty your hand onto the battlefield with little trouble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real trick to maximizing the Exhaust mechanic will be in blink- or copy-heavy decks, allowing players to reuse these phenomenal abilities more than once. For example, recasting your commander with Exhaust or bouncing a card back to your hand will let you activate the ability again. Equipping an Exhaust creature with <em>Helm of the Host</em>, which creates copies with fresh uses of their abilities, could also lead to some truly devastating plays. However you approach it, I foresee plenty of headaches dealing with Exhaust in competitive games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Aetherdrift</em> sets itself apart from other original Magic sets with its unique art style and theme. Love it or hate it, the team has done a commendable job of making the set—and its mechanics—feel cohesive. I’m eagerly anticipating the full list of spoilers so we can get a better idea of just how versatile and widespread the new Speed and Exhaust mechanics will be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many decks will benefit from these abilities, but as with any new mechanic, it remains to be seen how much they will be incorporated into future releases. Sets like <em>Bloomburrow</em>, <em>Duskmorne</em>, and now <em>Aetherdrift</em> have redefined what an “original Magic plane” can be. While the racing aesthetic may seem odd or out of place to some players, for others, the bombastic visuals and vehicle-heavy theme might be exactly what draws them in. <em>Aetherdrift</em> releases on February 14—because nothing says romance like a new MTG set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.
