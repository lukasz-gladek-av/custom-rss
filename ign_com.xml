            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-plus-games-for-april-2025-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has revealed RoboCop: Rogue City (PS5), The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (PS4, PS5), and Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory (PS4) as its trio of PlayStation Plus Essential titles for April 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gaming giant unveiled next month's service additions in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-april-robocop-rogue-city-the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation.Blog post</u></a> today. Each joins a catalog of titles available to subscribers of the cheapest PlayStation Plus tier at no additional cost and will remain available until the next batch of games rolls out come May 5. Every game in today’s list is available starting April 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Plus users will note the April 2025 lineup has a little something for everyone. Teyon and Nacon’s brutally accurate ‘80s love letter, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/robocop-rogue-city"><u>RoboCop: Rogue City</u></a>, is likely the biggest headline for players this month. This first-person shooter puts players into the hulking metal shoes of Alex Murphy himself as he works to save a crime-riddled Detroit from another murderous threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-gets-new-game-plus"><u>its more recent and substantial updates</u></a> arrived in January of last year, granting players access to a much-asked-for New Game Plus mode. With or without a reason to revisit its story mode, we felt RoboCop: Rogue City was worth checking out at launch and gave it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-review"><u>a 7/10</u></a> in our review.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Plus subscribers looking to scratch that bloody action itch with friends can check out Sumo Digital and Gun Media’s asymmetrical multiplayer adaptation, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre"><u>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</u></a>. Players work to survive – or kill – others in a set-up that pits survivors against the bloodthirsty Slaughter Family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an experience not for the faint of heart that aims to simulate what it might be like to hear Leatherface rev up his iconic chainsaw just feet behind you. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review"><u>6/10 review</u></a> at launch, we said it offered “a few entertaining, technically challenged hours of fun.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">RoboCop and Leatherface will no doubt get your blood flowing, so it’s nice that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory"><u>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory</u></a> is here to bring down the tempo just a bit. Bandai Namco expanded on the already massive digital world of digital monsters with this turn-based monster collector offshoot back in 2018. It’s got more than 320 Digimon to meet and collect as players look at the events of the original Cyber Sleuth story from a new perspective.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As RoboCop, Leatherface, and Agumon make their way onto PlayStation consoles next week, players should make sure to download <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-months-after-launch-dragon-age-the-veilguard-headlines-playstation-plus-march-2025-lineup"><u>the March 2025 titles</u></a> while they still have the chance. It was a particularly strong lineup that included Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Sonic Colors: Ultimate, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection. So, if you’re a subscriber or a non-subscriber who has been looking for a good opportunity to sign up, make sure to add all three games to your library before the offer goes away March 31.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

These Scarlet &amp; Violet sets have been MIA for weeks, and now they’re back at retail prices. I already added a couple to my cart, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> Booster Bundle, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-shrouded-fable-preview">Shrouded Fable</a> ETB and Paldean Fates Booster Bundle. Trainers need to snap these up quick. If they’re gone by the time you get there, that’s on you.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PlayStation Slim Disc Edition (Import) for $367.94</h2><div catalogid="36a3b9f5-2ced-42c2-8fd0-f4fa3b4e7cdd" id="215847"><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for the least expensive PlayStation 5 console you can your hands on?

This is a brand new and retail boxed product that is stocked in a US warehouse and qualifies for local delivery, which means it ships free and arrives within about 1-2 weeks.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Deals For Today: Pokémon TCG - Surging Sparks Still In Stock and Cheap Power Banks+</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also spotted a couple of power banks on sale from INIU and Anker. If you’ve ever watched your phone die mid-flight or mid-text, you know why I’m excited. These things are cheap, fast, and less annoying than asking strangers for a charger at an airport. Do with that information what you will. Oh, and while we’re on the topic of things I absolutely don’t need but definitely want: the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/gamera-double-feature-gamera-guardian-of-the-universe-gamera-2-attack-of-the-legion">Gamera: Attack of Legion</a> action figure is up for preorder at the IGN Store for a cool $560, and Humble Bundle just dropped a massive <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/world-dragonlance-wizards-coast-books" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragonlance book bundle</a> that practically dares you to add 25+ fantasy novels to your backlog for the price of lunch.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217537"><div id="217537" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I want this bundle purely for the thrill of cracking six packs in a row and pretending I’m building a deck for Worlds. The Surging Sparks expansion is still new enough to feel fresh, and at $45.02, it’s a decent value compared to scalper prices that make you question your financial decisions. If you just want to dip into the latest set without going full collector mode, this is it.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-pald"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Pald">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217538"><div id="217538" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shiny Pokémon are back, and apparently so is my addiction to them. The Paldean Fates bundle gives you six chances to pull something sparkly, and while $69.94 isn’t exactly pocket change, I think the potential dopamine hit is worth the gamble. It’s in stock, it ships fast, and I’ve made worse choices at 2 a.m. on eBay.</p></div><p id="the-world-of-dragonlance-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The World of Dragonlance Bundle">The World of Dragonlance Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217539"><div id="217539" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The World of Dragonlance Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>26 item bundle, pay more for donations to charity "Room to Read".</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not saying this is the nerdiest thing you can buy today, but it’s definitely on the leaderboard. Humble Bundle just dropped a massive Dragonlance collection; 25+ books for about the cost of lunch. If you’ve ever wanted to get lost in magical twin drama, cursed artifacts, or the politics of dwarves (because who hasn’t), this is your sign. Plus, part of your purchase supports Room to Read, so now your TBR pile can come with good karma.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-shro"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shro">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217540"><div id="217540" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, this is the one to grab if you're all-in on the set. Nine booster packs, a Pecharunt promo, themed sleeves, dice, and an actually-useful storage box? For $54.96? I’ve spent more on less at Taco Bell. Plus, it's still Prime eligible, which means you don’t have to sell your soul for free shipping. Win-win.</p></div><p id="gamera-attack-of-legion-action-f"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Gamera - Attack of Legion - Action F">Gamera - Attack of Legion - Action Figure</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217541"><div id="217541" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gamera - Attack of Legion - Action Figure</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Preorder. Release Date: October 2025</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is what happens when you give kaiju collectors exactly what they want: a 9.5-inch figure of LEGION from <em>Gamera 2</em>, complete with flying parts, glowing bits, and articulation that would make Spider-Man jealous. Sure, it’s $560, but I’ve seen statues half as cool go for double that. If you’re the kind of person who rearranges shelf space for something before buying it, I totally get it.</p></div><p id="iniu-portable-charger-225w-20000ma"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Portable Charger, 22.5W 20000mA">INIU Portable Charger, 22.5W 20000mAh</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217542"><div id="217542" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Portable Charger, 22.5W 20000mAh</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This thing charges your phone like it’s got something to prove. At $26.98, it gives you a full week’s worth of backup power and a built-in flashlight just in case you drop your phone and your dignity under your car seat. I want it purely because it has an LED readout that makes me feel like I’m operating a mission control panel instead of just charging my AirPods.</p></div><p id="anker-power-bank-powercore-10k"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Anker Power Bank (PowerCore 10K)">Anker Power Bank (PowerCore 10K)</h2></p><div catalogid="0b2e6c81-0c20-41d1-8ea4-1fe90a9f909c" id="217543"><div id="217543" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker Power Bank (PowerCore 10K)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this is the best deal of the day, and not just because it’s $17.99. It’s slim, light, and can survive a drop better than my will to stay off social media. Anker knows what it’s doing, and this charger just works. No random overheating, no mystery ports, just plug it in and keep scrolling through whatever app is currently ruining your sleep schedule.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hulu + Live TV Free Trial</h2></div><div catalogid="77f3624c-3861-436e-b835-55c123112a11" id="216770"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hulu + Live TV <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-get-hulu-plus-live-tv-free-trial">offers a three-day free trial</a> that allows you to take the live TV streaming service for a spin.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-returns-to-call-of-duty-warzone-here-are-all-the-biggest-changes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> is bringing back the battle royale map that started it all: Verdansk. It’s been just over three years since players last dropped into the beloved location’s iconic POIs, so we’ve taken the time to highlight its biggest changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verdansk is nothing without each individual building that players spent hundreds of hours dodging (and taking) bullets through – and Activision knows it. That’s why veterans who played the OG Warzone map back when it launched in 2020 will find that its Ukraine-inspired streets, rivers, and structures have been brought back almost completely unaltered. It’s the map you know and love, built from the ground up to suit the updated playstyle introduced with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> and squash a few of the more notable issues players have harped on through the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This version of Verdansk has been painstakingly rebuilt from the ground up to give you the very best battle royale experience possible,” Activision explained today in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-warzone-verdansk-map-return-intel-drop" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. “That experience balances the immersion, adjusted movement mechanics, and the signature gameplay you remember from the original Call of Duty: Warzone with one overriding goal: To relive the classic and nostalgic Verdansk map we all remember.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Kitted Out</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher behind Call of Duty says its return to Warzone’s roots includes a version of Verdansk that is “95%” accurate to its original launch build. It’s been more than three years since the map was retired in late 2021, so naturally, the team felt it was due for at least a few tweaks that shouldn’t interfere with that nostalgic design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One general rule of thumb, of course, is that Verdansk will benefit from improved lighting that falls more in line with the visuals seen in last year’s Black Ops 6. Upgraded visuals on a finer detail level will also be found in locations like Grazna Bridge and those common fire stations, which feature slightly more weathered paint jobs and chunkier bricks. Another example of cosmetic changes to Verdansk’s iconic locations can be found in a weed problem on Storage Town’s roofs, more reflective puddles, and added electric pipework.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your average Call of Duty fan isn’t going to notice the extra blades of grass added to a random field next to the northwest side of Stadium, but what they will notice are some surface-level design tweaks to a few individual POIs. Storage Town Building 3 is one example of a structure that’s been touched up, with Activision explaining that it’s been gifted a ladder in order to nerf its previous spot as an “unfair power position.” As more than a few similar structures have also invested in ladder additions, players will find that other locations, such as the Hangars, now feature repositioned vehicles and additional cover.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdansk Reheated</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you’ve lived one hundred lifetimes in Verdansk’s original incarnation, none of these aforementioned changes are true gamechangers. However, to accommodate things like Black Ops 6’s omnimovement and swimming mechanics, Verdansk needed to receive a few more alterations that are a bit more than skin deep.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Verdansk, a traditionally very snowy map, has had its temperature turned up ever so slightly, resulting in the melting of rivers that were previously frozen. That means you’ll be able to swim in some of the deeper bodies of water like the Kastovian Sea – and make more noise when sprinting through some of the ankle-deep rivers polluting the map. Undrivable vehicles have also been given a facelift to ensure there’s no confusion about whether or not they can be used for a quick getaway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, those steep, rocky trails and cliffsides that you and your friends have almost certainly died at once before have been tweaked to be more forgiving to players on the run. You’ll also notice that tall structures like telephone poles have been slightly shortened, making for less annoying descents into the Warzone. If you find yourself questioning tree placement come April 3, just know that, yes, the team at Activision has made a few minor adjustments to tree placement to shake things up, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, doors react much more dynamically to the action around them, as bullets and explosions can cause them to swing in either direction depending on where impact occurs. Ascenders, which were previously featured in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 but added post-Verdansk removal, have also been retrofitted to make some of those harder-to-access rooftops easier to reach.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Heads-Up</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While these changes may seem like a lot when all spread out, Activision reiterates that the “vast majority” of Verdansk 2025 has been revived as a “one-to-one duplication.” Examples of areas that remain largely untouched are Karst River Quarry and Superstore, which look and play the same inside and out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the video game-y aspects of Call of Duty: Warzone’s nostalgia play also seek to return to the feeling players had when dropping into the battle royale mode back in 2020. This can be seen in a complete overhaul to Contracts, Public Events, Field Upgrades, vehicles, and even Killstreaks, which have all been reverted to fit the offerings found in the 2020 Verdansk build. That means everything from the OG helicopter to the hum of a nearby chest to that classic loading screen is back.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As other experiences like Fortnite deliver updated takes on classic offerings, it looks like Call of Duty is here to offer its own version of one of its most popular moments in time. So, while something like a lighting tweak may seem inconsequential at first, Activision wants players to know that these changes were made with that infamous Roze skin, for example, in mind. Should everything play out as expected, Verdansk’s reintroduction may provide the definitive way to experience that map ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Warzone brings back Verdansk April 3, 2025. It will launch one day after the introduction of Black Ops 6 Season 3 and following a one-day down period for players. When users boot up Warzone on Verdansk launch day, they’ll be able to enjoy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-drops-back-into-verdansk-with-limited-time-mode-exclusive-rewards-and-black-ops-6-free-trial">a special, limited-time event called Return to Verdansk</a> that comes with unique cosmetics, sprays, Operators, weapons, and much, much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
