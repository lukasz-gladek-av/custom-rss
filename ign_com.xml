His wife Kim Johnson then phoned the hotel and security eventually got in with emergency medical technician crews who struggled to find a pulse.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/31/wes-1738327737741-1738328047708.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Bethesda voice actor Wes Johnson is in recovery.

It was very close, very close. But I'm still here," Johnson said. "I'm still here because my wife decided to call the hotel where I was staying, doing announcing for the Alzheimer's Association, and had my son call security, and find out I was nearly dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They took me to the hospital, put me in a coma. I was in there for five days before I found out that my wonderful friends Bill Glasser and Shari Elliker and Kim had put together this GoFundMe, where I found out there's a lot of love in this world that I didn't know was out there and I'm grateful to each and every one of you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johnson thanked the National Alzheimer's Association for flying his family down to see him and putting them in hotels, thanked the chairman of the Washington Capitals parent company Ted Leonsis for donating $25,000, and he thanked Glasser and Elliker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johnson also thanked Bethesda, who posted on social media to show support after news broke of his illness. "You say that I'm your friend. I am," he said. "Always will be. Love you guys." He then thanked fans, both those who've donated and those who've showed support otherwise. "I love you all. I'm not going anywhere," Johnson said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's going to be a while as I work my way back but I'm coming back. I look forward to seeing and having you all hear me then. Cheers."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Johnson has also appeared in myriad film and television roles but his video game work is mostly in Bethesda titles, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/iconic-voice-actor-from-oblivion-fallout-3-and-other-bethesda-games-returns-in-starfield">having most recently played Ron Hope in Starfield</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-debuts-to-mixed-steam-reviews-amid-serious-pc-performance-problems<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"To say this is rough is an understatement."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Spider-Man 2 on PC was shaping up to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-swings-onto-steam-with-forgiving-pc-specs"><u>surprisingly performant</u></a> once its system requirements were revealed. However, the Nixxes-developed port has debuted to a 'mixed' Steam user review rating, with many players complaining about technical issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, 55% of Spider-Man 2's Steam reviews are positive. “Despite having a high-end GPU and running the latest Nvidia drivers (5.66.36), the game frequently crashes,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/neodemio/recommended/2651280/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said one RTX 4090 user</u></a>. Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041082525/recommended/2651280/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>read</u></a>: “The game is completely unplayable on PC. The game crashes to desktop every five minutes. I have already requested a refund.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hold off on buying until they get a couple of stabilization patches out because holy hell," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047951793/recommended/2651280/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one reviewer added</a>. "To say this is 'rough' is an understatement. Lighting doesn't load in some cutscenes, those same scenes run at seconds-per-frame, audio desync issues up the wazoo, freezing, stuttering, and just about every other performance issue I can think of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm gonna get a refund for now because frankly, there's other stuff I could use $70 for right now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main issue appears to be that the game’s graphics controller crashes frequently, even with users on higher-end PCs. According to one reviewer, the error <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199237301221/recommended/2651280/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reads</u></a>: “A problem has occurred with your display driver. This can be caused by out of date drivers, using game settings higher than your GPU can handle, an overheating GPU, or an error with the game. Please try updating your graphics drivers, or lowering your in-game settings.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other users have complained that features like DLSS and ray tracing are not working properly, while <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2651280/reviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>others</u></a> have mentioned long loading times, missing textures, and audio issues. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Several players <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047951793/recommended/2651280/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>alleged</u></a> that performance can also stutter after several hours of gameplay, before leading to a hard crash. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2651280/reviews/?browsefilter=toprated&amp;snr=1_5_100010_" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Some</u></a> believe a memory leak could cause the problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nixxes has responded to the reported crashes on the Steam forums, stating to one user: “Sorry to hear you are experiencing issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Please refer to the troubleshooting guides on the <a href="https://support.nixxes.com/hc/en-us/categories/23822841857181-Marvel-s-Spider-Man-2-PC/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nixxes Support website</u></a> and contact us if the problem persists. Make sure to include your logs and crash dumps as outlined on the support website, so we can troubleshoot as quickly as possible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Nixxes was made aware of other bugs that can occur during the photo-op missions in Spider-Man 2. “We are aware of a bug that can occur if your framerate is very low during this scene (below 20 FPS). As a workaround, try lowering your graphics settings and or resolution to pass this point.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech &amp; hardware.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-love-and-hate-heartbreaking-time-space-showdown-art<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> received its Space-Time Smackdown expansion yesterday, January 30, and players have expressed shock and heartbreak at one specific card's artwork that depicts a particularly brutal scene for Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The card in question is Weavile ex, and while this comes in three separate forms, it's the 2 Star full art card that has fans in an uproar. In the artwork, below, a group of Weavile are hiding in the treetops with claws at the ready, preparing to prey on an innocent Swinub.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"No Swinub," look up! Look up!" reads a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1idjisv/no_swinub_look_up_look_up/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> post featuring the artwork with nearly 10,000 upvotes. "Always got to be one card per set that shows Pokémon in the process of straight up killing each other," one user replied. "Leave the lil guy alone," said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The ecology of Pokémon is always so crazy to imagine," another fan added. "Like these are still animals, some smarter than others. Just they have the ability to fire laser beams."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are choosing to believe the full art card for Mamoswine, the final evolution of Swinub, depicts a happy ending though, as it shows the mammoth pocket monster looking up while protecting a handful of Swinub.time</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hey, Mamoswine protected his baby. Don't worry. He most definitely saw those Weaviles," said one desperate fan. "The Mamoswine alt card already looks above. He saw them. He saw..." said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-space-time-smackdown-expansion-today-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Space-Time Smackdown arrived as a Pokémon Diamond and Pearl themed set</a> bringing the likes of Weavile and Mamoswine alongside Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, and more. It includes a total of 207 cards and is therefore significantly smaller than Genetic Apex's 286. That being said, 52 of these are the alternate art, Star and Crown rarity cards, and as Genetic Apex had 60 of these, there is a higher percentage of rare pieces to collect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. still hasn't commented on<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-trading-today-and-players-absolutely-hate-it"> the controversial trading update which arrived the day before</a>, with its social media accounts and the game itself only really focusing on Space-Time Smackdown. It also failed to respond to IGN's request for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A "Trade Feature Celebration Gift" did arrive with 500 Trade Tokens and 120 Trade Hourglasses (the former of which is enough to trade a single ex Pokémon), but the developer has otherwise remained quiet on fan complaints.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
