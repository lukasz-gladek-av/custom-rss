            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom's upcoming space adventure Pragmata was back at The Game Awards today with some pretty significant news after years of delays. It has a release date at last: April 24, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, we learned today that a gameplay demo is now available today on Steam. <em>And</em> in addition to previously-announced platforms PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, it's <em>also</em> coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in a pretty significant get for the new console.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pragmata follows an astronaut named Hugh stranded in space, aided by a friendly artificial intelligence named DI0367, who he refers to as Diana. She takes the form of a little girl who rides on Hugh's back as he fights his way through hostile space alien-robot things, and hacks them so that they're vulnerable to his abilities. Together, the two take on a lunar station AI that's trying to keep Hugh from returning to earth. Based on today's trailer, it looks like the pair might visit a city somewhat like New York City, though it seems to be located on the moon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pragmata has been around the moon a few times in the last few years. It was first announced<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pragmata-capcom-release-date-2022"> back in 2020</a>, with a pretty cryptic trailer showcasing the two main characters, with a 2022 release date attached. Later, it was  <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-delayed-2023">delayed until 2023</a>, and then put on hold <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-delayed-indefinitely-as-capcom-apologizes">with an apologetic trailer</a>. It <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcoms-pragmata-reemerges-at-sony-state-of-play">resurfaced at Sony's State of Play</a> earlier this year looking far more ready for primetime. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-aims-to-break-the-rules-of-third-person-shooters-gamescom-2025">we got to preview it</a> at Gamescom this year, too. Not long after, I <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-developers-say-they-couldnt-predict-real-life-ais-growth-when-they-first-conceived-the-games-story">chatted with the game's developers</a> about how their game about artificial intelligence relates, or doesn't, to current real-life discussions of the technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Working with Red Dead Redemption's lead designer and writer.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Davide Soliani, the lead creator behind the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle">Mario + Rabbids</a> games, has revealed Bradley the Badger — his first new project since leaving Ubisoft and forming a new studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bradley the Badger mixes classic platforming gameplay with fresh twists and a rather meta-feeling story that sees players helping the video game mascot through its creator's unfinished work. Tonight's trailer, shown during The Game Awards 2025, featured obvious nods to Bloodborne, Cyberpunk 2077 and The Last of Us, and... Marvel star Evan Peters as Bradley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game is the first from Day 4 Night Studios, Soliani's new outfit founded alongside Red Dead Redemption, Shadow of Mordor and Perfect Dark veteran Christian Cantamessa. The pair are joined by a trio of other former Ubisoft employees — Cristina Nava, Gian Marco Zanna and Luca Breda — who previously worked on publisher's the Mario + Rabbids, Just Dance and Ghost Recon franchises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploring the team's new game as Bradley, you'll visit numerous work-in-progress creations and have to traverse through them using an in-game Developer Kit. There will even be a few live-action scenes, framing your progress as you help Bradley's creator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Bradley the Badger is a love letter to games, creativity, and everyone who has ever felt stuck in their career or artistic journey," reads an official blurb. "The experience will expand beyond the game worlds with brief live-action moments, exploring various tropes, genres, and styles drawn from contemporary popular games and media."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soliani found fame and captured the internet's heart as the lovable creator behind Mario + Rabbids, an unlikely but thoroughly enjoyable strategy game mash-up released for Nintendo Wii. Soliani's emotional response to seeing the game announced to a warm reception back at E3 2017 became legendary, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-rabbids-chief-davide-soliani-leaves-ubisoft-after-25-years">the creator left Ubisoft in 2024 after 25 years</a>, following the launch of the game's sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope">Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</a>, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-boss-wishes-hed-waited-for-nintendo-switch-2-to-release-mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot later said he regretted launching too soon</a>, rather than waiting and making a bigger splash on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What we are crafting at Day 4 Night is a reflection of everything I’ve ever wanted to experience as a player - joy, adventure, poetry, action, wonder, and the pleasure of working with friends," said Soliani. "It’s a lullaby for my soul and a serenade to our industry, to the magic and the madness of creating worlds from nothing. It’s a story about triumphs, challenges, dreams, to light the path we walk together."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

This puts South of Midnight in good company with a number of other Xbox Game Studios games that have gone onto rival platforms, including Pentiment, Grounded, Sea of Thieves, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remake. A remake of the original Halo was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one">announced earlier this year</a> for both Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">South of Midnight might have flown under the radar for some, but it's worth checking out. Our reviewer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-review">gave it an 8/10</a>, saying it's "a straightforward but well-executed action-adventure game elevated by the artistry and heart of the American Southern culture that’s wrapped around it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
