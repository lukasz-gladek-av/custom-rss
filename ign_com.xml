And while some one-off, full-price titles were continuing to be successful, these had become "a few notable exceptions" to the wider trend, it continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remarks come amid a continued period of uncertainty for Ubisoft, which has suffered layoffs and a sizable corporate restructure in the past year. The Paris-headquartered company — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-now-operated-by-vantage-studios-ubisoft-and-tencents-new-business-group-with-full-autonomy-on-creative-direction-and-business-plans">whose biggest franchises are now operated by an independent subsidiary backed by Tencent</a> — has struggled to find its next big hit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-flopped-because-the-brand-itself-was-in-choppy-waters-ubisoft-ceo-says">disappointing sales for Star Wars Outlaws</a> and continued attempts to crack the increasingly-saturated live-service game market, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-chief-quits-industry-entirely-claims-ubisofts-doomed-call-of-duty-rival-had-very-little-marketing-or-the-right-resources-to-make-content">such as with doomed shooter XDefiant</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">pre-emptively cancelled The Division: Heartland</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Assassin's Creed, the company has gone all-in on its biggest brand — though was forced to slow its production line of upcoming games and remakes to give this year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> more time. Still, a slew of upcoming other titles in the franchise are expected over the next few years (including the witchcraft-focused Hexe, a multiplayer spin-off, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stop-removing-the-modern-day-assassins-creed-fans-react-as-black-flag-remake-reportedly-cuts-everything-outside-the-animus">long-awaited Black Flag remake</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Ubisoft dramatically halted trading of its company shares and postponed the wider firm's latest financial report mere minutes before a scheduled shareholder call was due to go live. Days later, Ubisoft is yet to provide more context for the move, as fans of its games — and the vast majority of its staff — wait to hear more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
