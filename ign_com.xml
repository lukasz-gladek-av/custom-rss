            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-explains-how-cooking-works-in-the-seamless-world-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Food has been depicted as an important part of the Monster Hunter series from the start, whether it comes to defeating enemies or depicting its world. In the games up until now, you could order a tasty meal from a Felyne before heading out on a quest, or hunt an herbivorous monster in the field and roast it until it's well-done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Food remains as important as ever in the newest installment in the series, Monster Hunter Wilds. Hunters can use the Portable BBQ Grill to cook up a meal with their Palico, wherever and whenever out in the fields. Once it's ready, you can scarf down some hot and fresh meat. Seeing this gives the powerful sense that the hunter, which is to say the player controlling that hunter, is really living within the world of the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Depicting the act of eating, a central part of life, is more important than anything when giving a sense of reality to the ecosystems of these monsters and the world that they share with hunters. That belief has been also held by the development team ever since the very first Monster Hunter.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">First we dine</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Kaname Fujioka, Executive Director and Art Director for Wilds as well as the Director of the first Monster Hunter game, tells IGN: "Ever since the first Monster Hunter, we've put a ton of focus in our designs on what it means to live in its world. Even the monsters drink water, and they hunt prey to eat. Humans also feel hungry if they move around a lot, and they get sleepy if they're tired. We thought that maybe we could make a game that makes you feel like you're living in it if we did a good job of incorporating these elements based on real-life senses."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Food remains as important as ever in the newest installment in the series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The concept goes that being able to eat a delicious piece of meat when you're hungry makes you happy. And if that piece of meat is gigantic, you feel all the happier. The element of eating in the series, something so filled with primitive desires, became a part of the gameplay as time went on, buffing a hunter's stats.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Tokuda likes meat, so meat plays a pretty central role in any titles he's involved in, says Fujioka, referring to Wilds Director Yuya Tokuda. “We put fruit and vegetables on the menu as well in the past, but it's become pretty meat-centric ever since Monster Hunter: World." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You just want to feel stronger before you go hunting, right?” adds Tokuda. “I thought it'd be intuitive to eat meat and become stronger.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Tokuda says he has absolute confidence in Fujioka's guidance as someone who has been involved in the series from the start, it seems that at times, he'll sometimes advise him when it comes to meat. "It might be more exciting if you made that meat a little bigger..." and so on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are of course difficult elements when it comes to depicting eating in a game, but Fujioka, as the game’s Art Director, says he creates graphics that are entirely focused on what looks delicious. If a piece of food shows up in Monster Hunter that makes players think it must taste good, you can be sure that the development staff has already felt the same way. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The art director says he creates graphics that are entirely focused on what looks delicious.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Something isn't necessarily going to look delicious just because it's realistic,” he says. “We have to think quite a lot about what kind of depictions we need to use to make it look tasty. We have paid close attention to lighting and effects in particular since World, and we may exaggerate the food's appearance too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, during the November 2024 open beta test of Wilds, so many food videos flooded social media that they even reached demographics who don't normally play Monster Hunter. The sound of sizzling fat and the golden shine of honey dripping on top of cabbage were filled with detail that would make anyone's mouth water. Was that delicious-looking meat and cabbage based on real footage of something actually cooked by the development team?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"While I'm not aware of the fine details, we don't cook dishes for real and use them as-is as models,” says Fujioka. “Simply recreating something that exists in reality wouldn't actually look that tasty when placed inside a game. We do of course create high-resolution meat textures and so on, but what we want to focus on in the end is how we depict it, which means essentially creating it from scratch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that sense, it seems that creating tasty depictions of vegetables, like those similar to cabbage in the game, was far more difficult than with meat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After a great deal of research, we created an exaggerated depiction where the cabbage puffs up for a moment when the skillet's lid is popped open in-game,” says Fujioka. “That doesn't happen in real life, and while it is a small detail, that feeling of it expanding makes it look incredibly delicious."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, it may be a lie if you're comparing it to a real-life depiction. But as an artistic expression, it just looks so delicious. Fujioka and the development team studied every depiction of food that they could, from how food scenes are exaggerated in anime to the lighting used when food is shot for commercials.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Depicting eggs is incredibly difficult too,” he says. “Creating the feeling of the white being cut from a dripping soft-boiled egg was so hard, but our designers drew on all their knowledge to make it work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka continues, "My ambition is for Tokuda to hopefully see something aside from meat as delicious. That's why the staff making the food models also say they get hungrier and hungrier as the game nears completion. We've prepared quite a lot of different dishes this time as well, so I hope players enjoy each and every one."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The unique food system in Wilds</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Wilds, a game where the situation in the field changes in real-time, the buffs and enhancements provided by food have gone from being quest-based to time-based. Hunters also no longer eat inside a canteen run by Felynes, but rather inside camps or with the Portable BBQ Grill set up on their own, allowing them to now prepare a meal whenever and wherever. This change apparently is the result of changes to Wilds' gameplay loop.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The buffs and enhancements provided by food have gone from being quest-based to time-based.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"In World and the games before that, lots of different elements were decided based on your quest, so you would eat an appropriate meal before you went on one,” says Tokuda. “Since this game focuses more on a seamless experience, hunters will have time to freely play around in all kinds of different ways, especially after completing a quest. As players choose one target to hunt after the next on a seamless map, we decided that food should be time-based, not quest-based. When doing this, we considered amounts of time that would keep it from feeling too much like a chore while also tuning it to seem realistic."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunters will receive rations from the Felyne at the Ingredient Center found in the base camp, then use them to make food in the field. Tokuda explains that if you have rations, you can use them as meat, fish or even vegetables. "If we separated them into items like vegetables, meat and fish, we wouldn't be able to avoid tendencies toward one or the other, so you could end up with something like too many vegetables,” he says. “That's why we've made it so that you can use rations as meat, vegetables or fish so that there's no waste and players can choose according to their preferences."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dishes made by hunters use both main ingredients based on the rations provided by the aforementioned Felyne as well as spices and other additional ingredients. These can, for the most part, be acquired while in the field. Meanwhile, it's interesting that the rations delivered by Felynes to the hunter's base is differentiated by having a long shelf life, like smoked meat or pre-cleaned fish. In the cutscene where Quematrice is encountered, you can even see Felynes who refuse to let go of their meat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We ask Fujioka if Felynes are natural-born cooks. "They cook food in the canteen because they're creatures with an incredible sense of curiosity, and because they become so engrossed in their interests, absorbing so much about them,” he replies. “While some Felynes may follow the path of cuisine, others may look up to hunters and pursue the path of supporting them. I think they're a species where you can still see that strongly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After hearing all this talk about the effort the team has put into food, a long-held question pops into my head. In Monster Hunter, you hunt herbivorous monsters, get their raw meat, and cook it until it's well-done. But do they have any plans to ever let us hunt a large carnivorous monster for its meat to eat? Or is using large monsters as ingredients not a part of the food culture in the world of the series?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It comes up during the planning stages of every game,” replies Tokuda. “We talk about how it'd be interesting to hunt a monster and also get an ingredient of sorts as a bonus, but the world is already full of so many attractive ingredients that it makes us wonder if you'd really go so far as to make a meal out of portions of a monster that can be used as valuable materials (for equipment). It's possible that if you could get all the food you need from large monsters, and if that food had incredibly powerful effects, there would be no need for anything else, making the game's loop less attractive. That's why we discard the idea. We are trying a lot of different things, though, like Motley Mixes in World would let you hand over extra monster tails to get well-done steaks and other special items." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mr. Fujioka adds to this, saying, "In the game's lore, at least, there are legendary chefs of a sort. We haven't depicted them yet, but there should of course be some people in its world who pursue that kind of field."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Cultural connection of cuisine</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the food that you can make inside a pop-up camp, there are dishes you can find in villages you visit all around Wilds. Tokuda explains that food in the game belongs to two major categories: camping meals and village feasts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We wanted to design the game in a way that you could keep on playing it without interruption within an environment that continues to change in real time,” he says, comparing the meals you can create yourself with portable ingredients and the sumptuous feasts you can eat when invited to a village. “That's why we decided to add a feature where hunters could prepare very simple meals from an early stage. In contrast to that, we also looked into a way to add meals that let players understand the relationships between people and local food cultures. We thought of a kind of meal that could only be possible now that the game loop is based on time and not quests, as well as one that provides different in-game benefits." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Interacting with the different species that live in the Forbidden Lands and coming to understand one another is an important part of the game's world and its story to us,” adds Fujioka. “We're putting a ton of work into depicting those interactions."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you progress through the story in the Windward Plains, your hunter will be invited to a meal in the village of Kunafa, where those who live in the desert reside. These villagers who know nothing of hunting and haven't even seen weapons before treat you to a dish that resembles a freshly baked cheese naan. As you bite into its crispy surface with charred spots, both steam and melted cheese come pouring out. The meal is an unbelievable feast for a hunter from the outside world, making it a scene that shows just how much you're welcomed by these villagers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As you bite into its crispy surface with charred spots, both steam and melted cheese come pouring out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers filled this short yet memorable food scene with attention to detail, as close care is paid to how it helps form the game's world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We spent quite a lot of time coming up with what those villagers eat,” Fujioka explains. “Since they aren't a hunting people, what could they normally be eating? When we thought about how they get animal-based nutrients, we decided that they must raise livestock and eat dairy-based foods. You're able to get a grain similar to wheat when you go out to a more wide-open part of the map, right? So maybe they make something like naan using that grain. On top of that, we wanted it to be something made from simple ingredients, and not too complicated. We thought that a dish like cheese naan would be simple yet possible to depict in a delicious way, and so we put a good amount of effort into that." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So while it may appear to be a casual dining scene, it seems that a lot of labor went into showing this dish similar to one that exists in real life, cheese naan, in a delicious and meaningful way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's actually incredibly difficult to depict something that's crispy on the surface but springy on the inside using CG,” says Fujioka. “We'd been making attempts at the food scene in Kunafa from early on in development, even at the prototype stage, and we just couldn't get it to look the way we wanted. Still, the Wilds development team is incredibly talented, and I was shocked to see them ultimately reach the way it looks in the released version after a lot of trial and error. It really does look tasty..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Serious motion capture technology was used in the development of Wilds, and it seems that this change in the development environment helped broaden the range of expression when it comes to the game's food.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"While we of course wanted to focus on the food itself, we also wanted to put effort into depicting the way someone eats and their expression as they do so, which is why we used facial capture and other technologies as well,” says Fujioka. “It's not as if we used all of the data we filmed, but we did have actors eat actual food like bread during motion capture sessions. It's not easy to rely on your imagination alone to come up with the expression of someone who just finished eating or someone savoring the aroma of food through their nostrils. We had the actors think about these details as they performed in our attempt to depict everything, even the act of eating, as delicious."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We did have actors eat actual food like bread during motion capture sessions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These thoroughly created food scenes do add a dramatic effect to the Wilds experience. Hunters can see just how much the villagers care as they show you incredible hospitality, sensing the way they live in the unknown Forbidden Lands while also feeling as though you've become a part of the land despite being a foreigner. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can continue to deepen your relationships with people in settlements even after you've completed the main story,” adds Tokuda. “Being offered food by them isn't a one-time thing, and they'll come to invite you to eat every now and then. Accepting these invitations will provide you with powerful food buffs that last for a long time, so even from a gameplay perspective, you'll receive more frequent offers by creating stronger bonds with villages. Also, while it is possible for you to gather local ingredients yourself, trading with locals can allow you to get lots of cheese. We've intentionally designed the game so that changes in your relationships that take place through food help deepen the world."  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">IGN First Monster Hunter Wilds Oilwell Basin Artwork</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By the way, the game has settlements aside from the one in the Windward Plains, and Tokuda says that they will treat you to food as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are villages in lots of different areas this time around where locals live their lives,” he says. “Each of those peoples eat different things, and there are rather unique monsters in Oilwell Basin. The dishes made with those monsters are pretty novel, so we hope you'll see them for yourself and be surprised."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even after hearing all of this about food and eating, I still find myself with one question. In that case, is there nothing like a canteen where Felynes show off their culinary skills in this game? Not being able to stop by a place where Felynes enjoy serving you food so much would feel a little sad. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Monster Hunter Wilds Screenshots - State of Play September 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When I ask this, Tokuda replies, "You're right about that. We are aware that this may weaken the sense of everyone gathering together, exchanging vouchers for food, and enjoying a meal as a means of communication, that players have experienced in the past. I hope you'll wait for further information when it comes to that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>For more on Monster Hunter Wilds, check out our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-exclusive-oilwell-basin-ajarakan-and-rompopolo-gameplay-ign-first"><em>exclusive 4K gameplay videos</em></a><em> battling Ajarakan and Rompopolo in the new Oilwell Basin area, and our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evolving-monster-hunter-how-capcoms-belief-in-the-series-made-it-a-worldwide-hit-ign-first"><em>interview with the development team</em></a><em> on how Monster Hunter has evolved over the years.

"There's a lot that has to go with it. You have to cut the helmet in a certain way and it's got to come off, you have meat caps to the bottom where the flesh is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had systems for all of that and it turned into a big rat's nest. All these things you have to count for now with all these crazy hoses on the helmets and all that kind of stuff that we added. Or now you could change the body size significantly. The character creator had evolved quite a bit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans lamented that Starfield, which was the first full single-player role-playing game from Bethesda in eight years, didn't have the gore and dismemberment mechanics that were present in Fallout 4. Mejillones said these mechanics make more sense in Fallout than in Starfield, however, given their "tongue in cheek" humor. "It's part of the fun," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield arrived in September 2023 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-hits-15-million-players-as-patch-adds-achievement-friendly-creations-new-land-vehicle-and-quest-and-more">in the time since has reached more than 15 million players</a>. "Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review">IGN said in our 7/10 review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, another former Bethesda developer revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-starfield-dev-surprised-by-how-much-loading-the-game-launched-with">his surprise at the sheer amount of loading Starfield ended up launching with</a>, particularly in the city of Neon.

Discussion on this topic has only ramped up since Season 1 introduced Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman last Friday, but the hero additions brought more than changes to the current meta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As players began to tap into what made these new Fantastic Four characters tick, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hytkrh/invisible_woman_hidden_op_new_tech_discovered/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>barky1616</u></a> shared a video showing an off-the-wall use for Invisible Woman’s trademark ability. The clip shows Sue Storm turning invisible and, somehow, blocking the path of half of the enemy team by simply standing in front of them. They don’t try to walk around or fight her until she is booted out of invisibility mode, at which point the battle continues as you’d expect. It’s a bizarre video that many are using as additional evidence to suggest that bots are quickly becoming a bigger issue for Marvel Rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea is that, because the other team is supposedly made up of bots, they are unable to realize their path is blocked by this new hero. Your results may vary if you choose to try this Invisible Woman trick on your own, but it’s still a strange clip that has the community scratching their heads at best and fearing a more substantial bot problem at worst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without confirmation from NetEase, it’s unclear if AI enemies are truly sneaking their way into Marvel Rivals matches or if there’s something else going on.
