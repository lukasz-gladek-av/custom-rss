            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Love them or, more likely, hate them, Minecraft's Creepers are now an iconic part of Mojang's beloved sandbox game. But the explosive creatures probably wouldn't be included today, the developer has said, if it were to design them from scratch now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a new developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBTJIYzJDJw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> discussing game balance and fairness, chief creative officer Jens Bergensten said that Mojang now followed a strong principle when adding any new item, biome or enemy to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> that could cause players grief. In a nutshell, if anything causes the player to suffer, it should be because players brought it on themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want to avoid treating players in a way that feels unfair," Bergensten said. "So we have this guiding principle that bad things [can] happen, but they're technically the players' fault. What we mean by that is either the player caused it, or the player had a chance to prevent it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That means enemies have to feel fair — so players can choose to take them on if they want or have a decent chance of mitigating the danger if not. Situations that negatively impact a player should also never feel too random.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bergensten listed various examples of things that have been added in the past that haven't felt as fair as intended — such as Iron Golems protecting villages by attacking Creepers (and getting said villages blown up), or Endermen randomly stealing blocks that could have some pivotal signifiance (such as a painstakingly-built Redstone circuits).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This doesn't mean that Mojang won't add in tougher challenges, though the developer said it was now careful to make difficult content feel like something players were opting into — such as when actively making the choice to enter The End and take on the game's climactic Ender Dragon. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/the-biome-that-broke-minecraft-00-05-53-1760547479174.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mojang chief creative officer Jens Bergensten. Image credit: Mojang.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But how about the Creeper? It can be encountered from the very beginning of the game, it can instantly kill players and destroy builds, and it sometimes feels like it appears at random. So why does it still exist like it does?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even to this day, it's one of the monsters in gaming that I'm still a little bit afraid of," Bergensten admitted. "If you would follow the rules that we have today, we would probably not add the Creeper because it would actually be so controversial to have a monster just show up and destroy what you've built."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Creeper is very iconic though," Bergensten concluded — which is true enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
