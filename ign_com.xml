            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> developer DICE has said it‚Äôs working on a "substantial" increase in server capacity for the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, after the early access launch was met with huge Steam concurrents and equally huge queues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At time of this article‚Äôs publication, the Battlefield 6 open beta had over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam alone, making it the third most-played game on Valve‚Äôs platform behind only Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2. We don‚Äôt have concurrent player figures from Sony or Microsoft, so the open beta‚Äôs true concurrent figure will be much higher.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But not all those players are actually playing. Those with early access were met with huge queues (we've seen 250,000 in screenshots posted to social media) as the servers hit max capacity. In response, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953383562289299732" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DICE issued a statement</a> to say it was working to improve matters:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúThe team is now working on a substantial increase in server capacity, which will reduce your time in the queue,‚Äù DICE said. ‚ÄúThank you for your continued patience as we work to get as many of you into the game as soon as possible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe're looking forward to seeing you experience Battlefield 6, and we appreciate your patience!‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That statement followed <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953364983057662181" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a message</a> in which DICE explained why it was using queues in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe will use queues to protect the player experience but expect this impact to be minimal,‚Äù DICE insisted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúYou may encounter this during high peak moments, such as the start of servers going live. The team is working constantly to reduce any queue that takes place.‚Äù</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Holy sh*t ü§£<br>More than 270.000 players are waiting in server queue!</p><p>If you manage to join the Open Beta, you better don't leave game. <a href="https://t.co/x9lGfpyRAd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/x9lGfpyRAd</a></p></div>‚Äî Battlefield Bulletin (@BFBulletin) <a href="https://twitter.com/BFBulletin/status/1953377379180593285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion here is that the open beta is peaking now as the early access kicks off, but the queues will ease. Given the open beta has gone live in early access form ahead of the U.S. waking up, it seems likely the player count will grow in the coming hours, and again when the open beta goes live for all this weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We‚Äôve got plenty more on Battlefield 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-forces-pc-gamers-to-mess-about-with-their-bios-to-enable-secure-boot-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-next">how it requires PC gamers to enable Secure Boot</a>, how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-producer-admits-2042-was-missing-the-excellence-of-predecessor-battlefield-bad-company-2">it was inspired by the much-loved Battlefield: Bad Company 2</a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you‚Äôre trying to play the Battlefield 6 Open Beta on PC, you might have run into a problem: ‚ÄòSecure Boot is not enabled.‚Äô</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You are not alone. PC gamers hoping to play DICE‚Äôs latest now open beta early access is live have no choice but to enable Secure Boot on their PC. And a cursory glance at social media, subreddits and IGN‚Äôs own comments suggest some are having trouble with it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/07/screenshot-2025-08-06-214819-1754555745386.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 forces players to enable Secure Boot on PC.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA has published a user guide for how to enable Secure Boot on PC</a>, and promoted that guide across social media. It‚Äôs a guide I myself had to use to boot the Battlefield 6 Open Beta. But it certainly requires a degree of confidence, as it involves tinkering with a part of a computer not all PC gamers will be instantly familiar with: the BIOS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are things like TPM‚Äâ2.0 (which must be turned on) to deal with, and you need to make sure your Windows‚Äâdisk‚Äâis‚ÄâGPT‚Äâand‚Äânot‚ÄâMBR (not everyone will know what these are). All this before you can even enable Secure Boot ‚Äî and then you may not be able to enable it anyway, which then means you need to refer‚Äâto‚Äâyour‚Äâmanufacturer‚Äâfor‚Äâguidance (gulp!).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, this won‚Äôt be a problem for more experienced PC gamers, but it will be an intimidating process for many others. And if you think this is something isolated to Battlefield 6, you‚Äôd be wrong. Just yesterday, Activision announced the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will require the exact same thing: Secure Boot enabled.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what‚Äôs all this in aid of? Strengthening game security using built-in Windows PC features. It‚Äôs no secret that cheating in competitive multiplayer games is a huge problem for publishers. Activision has spent millions trying to reverse the narrative for Call of Duty. EA will be mindful of Battlefield 6 getting overrun at launch. It seems TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are the new reality for PC gamers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Activision's explanation, from a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> published yesterday:</p><blockquote>TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) is an industry-standard, hardware-based security feature built onto CPUs or motherboards that verifies the PC‚Äôs boot process has not been tampered with. Secure Boot makes sure a PC can only load trusted software when Windows starts. </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">When Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 releases later this year, TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot will be required to play on PC. "These hardware-level protections are a key part of our anti-cheat efforts, and we‚Äôre asking all players to get compliant now," Activision warned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to Battlefield 6, and the open beta Secure Boot process has certainly caused some people to panic, and others to find themselves with additional problems they didn‚Äôt have before. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-huge-queue-to-get-in-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-before-its-even-out">Early indications suggest there‚Äôs huge interest in the Battlefield 6 open beta</a>, so it will be interesting to see how this one develops over the course of the weekend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
