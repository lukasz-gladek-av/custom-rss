            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Matt Firor, the former studio head and founder of ZeniMax Online Studios, has confirmed his resignation from the company as a direct result of the cancelation of the studio's unannounced game, Project Blackbird.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn post today</a>, Firor reflected on the last year and confirmed his departure back in July, which had already been rumored <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unannounced-mmo-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-dev-canceled-veteran-studio-head-steps-down-amid-microsoft-layoffs">after he stepped down from his leadership role last year</a>. "Project Blackbird was the game I had waited my entire career to create, and having it canceled led to my resignation. My heart and thoughts are always with the impacted team members, many of whom I had worked 20+ years with, and all of whom were the most dedicated, amazingly talented group of developers in the industry."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firor also made clear he is not involved in any of the projects that have been started by former ZeniMax Online members who were laid off from the company around this time. He added that he is advising some of them "informally" and confirmed they were "in good hands."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He concluded by stating that while he doesn't know what he'll do next, he's currently both advising some projects and startups unofficially, as well as investing in some small teams. "But I have not yet seriously contemplated spinning up a new development studio."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Blackbird was an unannounced MMORPG that was in development at ZeniMax Online Studios, but was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unannounced-mmo-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-dev-canceled-veteran-studio-head-steps-down-amid-microsoft-layoffs">canceled by Xbox</a> in the summer of 2025 as a part of the layoff of hundreds of individuals at Xbox Game Studios, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">thousands Microsoft-wide</a>. Blackbird would have been a brand new, sci-fi IP that had been in development since 2018. In July, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say">sources speaking to IGN</a> told us that the project was going well and was about to move into full production with Xbox's approval to scale up the team. Blackbird's cancelation led to the layoffs of every member of the team.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Firor founded ZeniMax Online Studios under ZeniMax Media in 2007 after 10 years at Mythic Entertainment, where he was a founding employee. There, he oversaw the creation of The Elder Scrolls Online, which launched in 2014 and continues to be supported, with the most recent major expansion Gold Road releasing in January 2024. Firor was also in charge when parent company ZeniMax Media was acquired by Microsoft in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the cancelation of Blackbird, ZeniMax Online Studios remains in operation, continuing work on The Elder Scrolls Online under the leadership of Joseph Burba, a 13-year veteran of the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-meat-boy">Super Meat Boy</a>, the hard-as-nails platforming classic where dying dozens of times per level comes as standard, has now been played from start to finish in a perfect run. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been 15 years since Super Meat Boy originally released for Xbox 360, and it has taken all of those 15 years for someone to pull off this frankly astonishing feat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Step up <a href="https://youtu.be/zb7bnhmqT3s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shredberg</a>, a Nintendo speedrunner with a particular soft spot for Super Meat Boy, who livestreamed his deathless completion of the game just before the end of 2025. The achievement quickly drew congratulations from Edmund McMillen, the game's co-creator, who dubbed shredberg as "awesome" for being the one who finally managed it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For anyone who's played and struggled with Super Meat Boy over the years, particularly its later levels which simply look impossible when you first see them, it's hard to not watch the full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb7bnhmqT3s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> of shredberg's run and be impressed at the calm way he leaps, slops and slides around each level just pixels away from sawblades, meat grinders and explosions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let's go," shredberg said calmly, upon completing Super Meat Boy's final level after more than 2000 attempts and over 1000 hours of gameplay. "Let's go dude! I cannot believe it, I've been doing this too long. I got to go to work tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'll be honest, I'm not going to say I wasn't nervous, because I was very nervous at the end there... but I was way more nervous just in Dark Cotton," he continued, referencing an earlier level. "Once I got past Dark Hell 2, I was relatively fine. I got super nervous whenever I had any minor slip-up."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 25 Xbox 360 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm going to be emailing everyone," shredberg added. "Kotaku, IGN, CNN, Chef's Illustrated, they're all going to hear about it. I will unironically email IGN."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, Super Meat Boy has launched on every major console from Nintendo Switch to PlayStation Vita, though no one else has managed this feat — something many players thought was impossible. A sequel to the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-meat-boy-forever">Super Meat Boy Forever</a>, launched in 2020. Next up for the series is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-meat-boy-3d">Super Meat Boy 3D</a>, due for launch early this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for shredberg? The second he completed his run, one viewer had a suggestion for what he should play next. "I have to play Silksong now?" shredberg said, reading the inevitable comment. "Yeah... I'm so glad it's over. Not even in a 'this wasn't even fun' kinda way, because it was. But, man."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
