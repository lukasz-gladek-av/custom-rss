            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey, fellow Undertale and Deltarune fan. Did you know there was a Deltarune ARG going on? Did you know it's technically been going on for three years now? Yeah, neither did I!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I first learned about the Deltarune ARG (Alternate Reality Game) earlier this week, when a video about it surfaced in my YouTube recommendations. I started out just mildly curious, but I quickly fell down a rabbit hole that had me digging through massive spreadsheets, scouring Reddit threads, and pouring over weird corners of the official Deltarune website. And now, I'm going to infect you with it too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In order to fully unpack the entire ARG in a way that covers every little bit of what's happened and what it could mean, I would have to spoil all four chapters of Deltarune, probably some bits of Undertale, and dive into a deep, deep, <em>deep </em>pit of Deltarune fan theories. So I'm going to try to keep the explanation as high level as is possible while still making sense. But as a warning ahead of time: <strong>this will contain spoilers for Chapters 1 and 2 of Deltarune, especially the "Weird Route", and some very light allusions to characters and events in Chapters 3 and 4. Read on at your own risk:</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Deltarune ARG actually began in September 2022, during an event called the <a href="https://deltarune.com/sweepstakes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spamton Sweepstakes</a> celebrating Undertale's seventh anniversary, which raised money for the charity Child's Play. Most of the event was fun, silly, and non-ARG-related, themed around the eccentric Chapter 2 character Spamton and including a lot of fun new merchandise courtesy of Fangamer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, at the time, the ever-vigilant Deltarune community stumbled upon some unusual hidden content within the pages on the Deltarune website dedicated to the sweepstakes. At the time, most of it consisted of fun Easter Eggs, and I don't want to get into it all, but it was the first major sign that something was up. It wasn't until May of 2025 (two and a half years later) that things really kicked off. Fans suddenly noticed that there were <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5RKswkbmF_Jp7BaCuJ75ei5Xieu_yPMcMP5gEcaonQ/mobilebasic#h.iky9p49ddxoo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even more secrets</a> on the Deltarune website dedicated to the sweepstakes. There were a number of new <a href="https://deltarune.com/chapter5/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hidden pages</a>, all of which made reference to the game's deeply eerie and hidden "Weird Route", but the one that matters most to the ARG was <a href="https://deltarune.com/chapter4/thankyou/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deltarune.com/chapter4/thankyou</a>. At the time, the website consisted of two very small blanks where users could input text, and a blank button that allowed them to submit it. There were no clues as to what needed to go into the blanks, save for a single question:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>"How long did it take her to smile?"</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune fans very quickly guessed that the "her" being referenced was Noelle, a beloved character and the childhood best friend of Deltarune protagonist Kris. She's also the focal point of the aforementioned Weird Route, in which the player (a separate character from Kris) manipulates Noelle into doing something terrible in the interest of becoming stronger. Fans also figured out that the first blank was looking for an email address, with the second blank being for the actual "answer" to the question. Unfortunately, the form was only open for a day, before being replaced with text that just said "Thank You." Those who had submitted their email in the form began receiving effectively a confirmation email that just contained "You answered [THEIR ANSWER]." No further explanation. Nothing! For months!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, when all this happened, Chapters 3 and 4 weren't out yet. Those released earlier this year, and with them, more Weird Route content and a couple of horrifying, hidden scenes focused on Noelle in particular. Then two weeks ago, those who had received the confirmation email the first time received a new email that just said, "Second chance," and found that the form had been reopened. The community efforts were more coordinated this time, with people experimenting with different combinations of time amounts in days, seconds, years, as well as other textual responses they felt made sense. A number of community members tried to document submissions to avoid duplications, though given the short notice and short time period the form was open, this was once again difficult to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The form closed again, and once again, participants received emails. But this time, they were different. Individuals were getting one of a collection of different responses that seemed to be based on what they submitted. For instance, those who said "1 Day" received back "Then, 'The next day you'll see her smile.'" People who inputted very small numbers, such as 4 seconds, got back, "So, 'she never stopped smiling'". There are a bunch of other creepy answers, like "Do you think that means she still can?" and "Then, 'It was the first time she ever smiled in her life.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many emails ended with another sentence: "Move forward with this answer," seemingly indicating the submission was on the right track.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/08/screenshot-2026-01-08-144646-1767905239635.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Screenshot from FlamingLily's spreadsheet: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That was two weeks ago, and the form has been closed ever since. There's no indication of whether anyone got the right answer, what the next step is, or if the form will ever open up again. In preparation for a third attempt, a number of content creators have been rallying fans into communities to track what answers garnered what responses, and piece those responses together to try and figure out a "correct" answer if the form reopens. There are <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple massive spreadsheets</a> out there cataloging confirmed responses, as well as others assigning different answers to each participant ahead of time, so no one wastes an answer on a duplicate.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/08/screenshot-2026-01-08-144601-1767905276669.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Screenshot from Flaming Lily's spreadsheet: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what does it all mean? We're...not exactly sure. The general consensus is that all this has something to do with where Chapter 4's "Weird Route" leaves Noelle, and speculation about what's to come in Chapter 5 at the "festival" event we know is going to take place during it. But even though that's the most likely context, it's a pretty unusual one: the Weird Route is extremely hard to figure out without assistance from the internet, and its dark consequences make it unlikely that the vast majority of players would ever see it or understand what any of this is about. If this ARG is going to reveal some deep lore, or even impact the game somehow, it's likely that very few people will understand or even care about the result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That may be by design, though. Critically, the second time the form opened, only people who participated and received feedback from it the first time were able to use it again. If you're just learning about this (as I am), you may be entirely too late to participate at all. It's also possible there's no progress on whatever this is for months, even years. We've already waited along time just for this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm really just scratching the surface here, and probably sound like I'm completely crazy. If you've played Deltarune and didn't know about any of this, you probably had a pleasant time with a cool, well-written RPG with funny, lovable characters, and left it at that. That's an extremely normal way to enjoy this game, and probably will be most people's experience! But since Deltarune's Chapter 1 release, there's been a whole ecosystem of secrets, fan theories, and conspiracies surrounding the question of what this game actually <em>is, </em>how it relates to Undertale, and what the implications of its hidden, darker narrative might be for the game's lighter side. It's complex, weird, and fun as hell to dig into, and we probably won't know the full scope of it for years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is all to say, good luck to the secret hunters, and I'm genuinely sorry I can't help. I've inadvertently gotten invested in this mystery even though I will not personally touch the Weird Route with a ten-foot holiday pencil. Deltarune chapters 1-4 are out now and combined make a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">very good place to jump in</a> if you've been holding off thus far. Chapter 5 is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapter-5-release-date-likely-second-half-of-2026-toby-fox-says-thats-not-a-surprise-right">expected to come out this year</a>, likely in the second half.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Reports of cheaters seem to be increasing in recent weeks, as players share clips and stories of others shooting them through walls and from unreachable areas.

The message also comes with a promise specifically for streamers, saying the team is “introducing tools for streamers to help mitigate stream sniping.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you for your valuable feedback and for helping us make ARC Raiders a fair and fun experience for everyone,” the message concludes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 30, 2025.

Now Hot Toys is finally giving that costume its due with a truly stunning 1/6 scale figure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out the slideshow gallery below for an early look at Hot Toys' Batman: Arkham Origins figure:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hot Toys Batman: Arkham Origins 1/6 Scale Figure Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This figure stands an impressive 12.7 inches tall and features a detailed recreation of the character model from the game.

In the past, they've released figures based on Batman's Arkham City and Arkham Knight designs, along with several of the alternate suits from those games and villains like Joker and Harley Quinn.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> sales over the holidays reportedly fell short of those recorded by the console's predecessor back in 2017, during its first end-of-year season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As revealed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_NUBDTG8_4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a>, Switch 2 sales in the US and within key markets in Europe fell behind the equivalent pace of Switch 1 — something an unnamed senior Nintendo source blamed on a "complicated" economic climate today, and the "absence of a major Western game" during the year-end period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That particular analysis will likely raise eyebrows among Nintendo fans, as the company launched the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> during the period — albeit to a more muted critical response than the franchise's beloved original trilogy. Nintendo has so far made no announcement on how that game has fared.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Business reports that US Switch 2 sales over the holiday period were down around 35% versus the Switch 1's sales performance back in 2017. In the UK, a similar comparison saw Switch 2 lagging Switch 1 by 16%. Even in Nintendo's homeland of Japan, Switch 2 holiday sales couldn't match Switch 1, and were down by 5.5% over the year's final nine weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In France, 2025's final tally of Switch 2 sales was down by "over 30%" versus the amount Switch 1 notched up back in 2017, meanwhile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While these numbers may take some of the shine off of a successful first year for Switch 2 overall, it's not all doom and gloom. Switch 2's lifetime sales in Japan are still above what Switch 1 managed in its first year, with less time on sale. And in the UK, Switch 1 continued to sell well enough that it made up Switch 2's holiday sales deficit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking ahead, Nintendo has a smattering of first-party games already planned for 2026, including Mario Tennis Fever, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book and Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave, as well as Switch 2 upgrades for Super Mario Wonder and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. There's also the FromSoftware exclusive The Duskbloods to look forward to, and the promising-looking Pokémon Pokopia life sim.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But as the Switch 2 prepares to celebrate its first anniversary in June, all eyes will be on Nintendo to roll out a truly new blockbuster entry in one of its biggest franchises. Back in 2017, Switch 1's first year was marked by the launch of both Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo has not released a major new 3D Mario platformer since, while it will soon be three years since the arrival of 2023's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 1's other top-selling titles include Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Animal Crossing: New Horizons — and for now, there's no suggestion a big new entry in either franchise is forthcoming. Smash Bros. series boss Masahiro Sakurai has only just finished work on Kirby Air Riders, while Nintendo is opting to update New Horizons for Switch 2 this year, as previously mentioned. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could we see a new 3D Mario in 2026? Nine years on from Super Mario Odyssey, now feels like the right time. And then there's Pokémon, which celebrates its 30th anniversary next month. Could we get a glimpse soon of the series' long-awaited 10th generation? The arrival of these titles would certainly help Switch 2 keep its momentum, following last year's explosive launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
