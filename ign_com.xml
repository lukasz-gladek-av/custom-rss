It's normally $150 but there's a 50% discount for Black Friday that drops it to only $74.99. MEGA is similar to LEGO, but the brand (which is owned by Mattel) creates sets for IPs that don't have a relationship with the other famous big block company. Some past and present examples include Pokemon, Star Trek, Halo, and, in this case, Microsoft Xbox. This would make an incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gifts-for-gamers">gift idea for any gaming fan</a> who loves working on complex building block kits like LEGO.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MEGA Showcase Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set</h2><div catalogid="71c42985-9d8c-4c5d-a28d-7485a219d539" id="211751"><div id="211751" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MEGA Showcase Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The MEGA Microsoft Xbox 360 Collector Building Set is a buildable 3:4 scale replica of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/12/02/xbox-360-the-launch-review">Xbox 360 console</a> with a brick count total of 1,342 pieces (5.5 cents per brick). The details in this build are, frankly, incredible, and include interactive elements, lighting effects, and the coolest accessories. Here's a rundown of the biggest highlights:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Xbox console exterior is well represented with details like a removable hard drive, ventilation holes in the rear, text in the right places, and lighting effects. Unfortunately, there's no option to swap in a red ring of death.</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Xbox console internals are just as faithfully reproduced as the exterior. There's a tray to pop in the supplied Xbox game disc (we'll get to this later), the motherboard, various heatsinks and doodads all connected by wires, and even a fancy little Cortana chip. It's also easy to get into the console (just press a little green button).</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The set includes an authentic looking mini <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/09/23/halo-3-review">Halo 3</a> game disc complete with a detailed Halo game box that looks just like the real thing. That's not even the best part. You can place the Halo disc into the console's internal disc tray and it will light up the Cortana chip inside. How cool is that!?!</li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Xbox controller has a removable battery pack. When you slide in the battery pack, the controller's guide button lights up. That's because the light brick is installed in the battery itself.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">So why the big price drop? According to the user reviews, the fit and finish of the bricks is not as good as LEGO sets, so the build process won't go as smoothly (you might even need to whip out the Kragle). But once you're done, I'm sure you'll appreciate the incredible amount of authentic features that the designers put into this set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">LEGO Sets Are Also on Sale for Black Friday</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to keep your building block collection strictly LEGO, check out our guide to all of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-deals-black-friday-2024">best LEGO Black Friday deals</a> available right now.

While the Nintendo eShop has its own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-digital-video-game-sale-live">digital game sale</a> underway, some of the best Switch games have reached lower prices at select retailers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-black-friday-sales-2024">Best Buy</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamestop-black-friday-sale-2024">GameStop</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-target-black-friday-sales">Target</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-walmart-black-friday-deals-2024">Walmart</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s lineup of game discounts is one of the best I've seen, featuring major price cuts to popular Switch games that typically cost upwards of $50 at any other time of the year (looking at you, Zelda).

Usually retailing for a full $69.99, this 56% discount from Walmart is an unprecedented deal for a first-party Nintendo game, let alone <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">one of the best games ever</a>. Keep in mind, this deal is limited to the digital version (but is $20 cheaper than <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bgMq?object_uuid=6dc64e3a-d0b6-4509-9179-8a2f1b248c6b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the deal available in the eShop</a>). </p><h3 data-cy="title3">9 More Switch Games Under $30: </h3><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Switch Game Under $20 - Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection </h2></div><div catalogid="ddb149a2-d46b-4935-838f-af1cd363d65f" id="211585"><div id="211585" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This might kind of be cheating, but if you want the most bang for your buck, Konami's <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6nRZ?object_uuid=6dc64e3a-d0b6-4509-9179-8a2f1b248c6b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 is over 50% off</a>, making it my top pick for the best Switch game under $20 right now.

Those who purchase will save a total of $155 as opposed to purchasing the console, year-long NSO subscription and video game separately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Black Friday is also a great opportunity to stock up on some new controllers in preparation for a holiday season filled with multiplayer gaming sessions. Gamers can purchase the red and blue wireless <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVPpq?object_uuid=6dc64e3a-d0b6-4509-9179-8a2f1b248c6b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Joy-Con controllers for 25% off at Target</a> or get a hold of a <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDVqMo?object_uuid=6dc64e3a-d0b6-4509-9179-8a2f1b248c6b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pro controller for $49.99 at Best Buy</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you’re planning on taking advantage of Walmart’s $30 Tears of the Kingdom deal, you’d be remiss to disregard Amazon’s abundant deals on memory cards. A regular Nintendo Switch holds only 32GB of internal storage, and the Legend of Zelda entry takes up about half of that space. But don’t fret!

In Nintendo’s case, some games saw price cuts as early as the first of the month, but November 24 was when many of the company’s top-selling items received big discounts at retailers. If you’re looking to expand your game library, now is the time to do so, with many popular titles being sold at the lowest price of the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not a Switch gamer, there’s plenty of other video game deals to take advantage of this holiday season for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024"><u>PlayStation</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals-black-friday-2024"><u>Xbox</u></a>.

It’s an event filled with distractions to keep competitors busy with additional quests, daily rewards, a shop, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">V6.4 also introduces a few other changes to keep players bouncing back. Crown Clash, for example, is a game mode that can be voted for every five rounds and sees players trying to survive while carrying a crown for as long as possible. Win Streaks are another addition that will allow users to show off their win streak with a counter above their heads. Of course, developer Wiggity also introduced a few bug fixes and balance adjustments, including nerfs for Dragon Spirit and Phantom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Blade Ball Thanksgiving Event started on November 23 and runs for two weeks.
