            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-uk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Go bananas with this promo code for an added discount.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The expensive price tag on its new games is one of the drawbacks of the Nintendo Switch 2, of which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-uk">preorders</a> have already been going live early (Amazon included). Luckily, ShopTo is taking the sting off for UK customers by allowing you to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXgxO?object_uuid=6f43f13b-ec4d-4f5b-8fc8-aa89900590a9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">get Donkey Kong Bananza for only £63.50</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is still more than the £58.99 RRP for digital copies, it's the best price possible right now for those who want to <em>actually</em> own their games, and hold them in their hands like a newborn bab. This handy bargain comes as the result of using ShopTo's "SPRING" coupon code, which allows you and other future Nintendo Switch 2 players to knock 5% off various games, consoles, gift cards, and more across your order on the website. </p><div catalogid="4bd4b2ff-6a98-4c94-af67-60348d747390" id="218174"><div id="218174" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Release Date: July 17, 2025.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you use the code at checkout, £3.35 will be taken off so you'll only have to pay £63.50 instead of  £66.85. There is a catch, however. While you can preorder <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> to pay at dispatch normally, you'll only be allowed to use the discount code if you pay right away. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, if you currently don't have the funds and weren't planning to pay until DK Bananza's 17th of July 2025 release date, this preorder deal sadly won't be ideal for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, if you manage to free up some cash, you can use the "SPRING" discount code also works for <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN4m83?object_uuid=6f43f13b-ec4d-4f5b-8fc8-aa89900590a9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>, which is also for sale at ShopTo. Currently at £74.85, you can get £3.34 knocked off so you'll only have to pay £71.10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We know that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> bundled with a code for Mario Kart World is a great deal, essentially getting you a digital version of the game for around half the price, but any discounts on the game from retailers is also great for you physical collectors out there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The discount also works for the upcoming <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qd7wpv?object_uuid=6f43f13b-ec4d-4f5b-8fc8-aa89900590a9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> over at ShopTo, but is currently sold out at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nevertheless, we'll be keeping an eye on it incase the retailer happens to add any more stock, so you can take advantage while the coupon's still active. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

They pointed to the lack of a price in the Direct itself as a "deliberate" omission that caused confusion and misinformation as fans scrambled to find out pricing confirmation elsewhere.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 and Mario Kart World pricing was “intentionally omitted from the Direct for a reason,” Yang claimed, “but handled poorly in terms of the information being in all these different places and you’re expecting the fans or the consumer to piece it all together.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellis added: “It just shows some disrespect to the consumer, where, ‘oh, you just saw the Direct you’re so excited, you’re just gonna throw your money at us blindly, you’re not going to even ask the question of how much it cost because you’re so excited, aren’t you?’ "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s a little bit degrading almost to the intelligence of the consumer,” Yang said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The former NOA communications staff then went on to discuss Nintendo’s failure to address the pricing concern, either with a public statement or in interviews with the press. This, they said, was causing rampant speculation to fill the void with misinformation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They are enabling the story to get out of hand, out of control,” Yang said. “They have lost control of this,” Ellis added.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what went wrong? Ellis and Yang suggested Nintendo now lacks the consumer mindfulness it once had, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/21/nintendos-reggie-fils-aime-retires-replacement-named">former NOA boss Reggie Fils-Aimé’s retirement</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/nintendo-ceo-satoru-iwata-has-passed-away">the tragic loss of former Nintendo head Satoru Iwata</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s communications team will now be recommending the company release an official statement, Yang said, but the approval process will be painful, with many people involved before it even gets to current Nintendo boss Shuntaro Furukawa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo will also be out of practice because it hasn’t spoken to its community or press in such a long time, the pair said, nor has it had to deal with this sort of negativity since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/03/nintendos-apology-for-3ds-price-cut">the Nintendo 3DS price debacle of 2011</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now there is concern for staff manning demo stations at the public-facing Switch 2 hands-on sessions. Fans will have reasonable questions at these public events and might put those to staff who are manning demo stations. If they respond with any sort of answer, that could end up online and framed as Nintendo’s official response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What happens next? It remains to be seen, but neither Ellis nor Yang expect a price drop of either the Switch 2 or its games before launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>what the experts have to say about the Switch 2 price and Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
