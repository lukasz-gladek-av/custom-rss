Fans wondered if they would be the natural fit to handle The Dark Ages’ score creation, but evidently, id has gone in a different direction with Finishing Move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom’s gunplay has always been inextricably linked to its metal soundtracks, with Bobby Prince’s original 1993 score one of the most iconic to have ever been created. Finishing Move will be eager to join the legendary ranks of both Prince’s and Gordon’s score when The Dark Ages releases later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom: The Dark Ages is a single-player only first-person shooter campaign that arrives on Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and PC on May 15, 2025. For more, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2025-everything-announced">everything announced during Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editorial Producer who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

Rather it focuses on a group of complicated, messy people who all are brought together to defeat that which is a threat to all of them. There's a focus on the relationship between the characters, and while it can get introspective, there are also NPCs whose stories and mechanics are somewhat lighter. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As we've seen in past trailers, the UI and battle menus are exceptionally stylish, channeling Persona a bit in their big energy. The world itself is inspired by French art deco style, with art director Nicohlas Maxson-Francombe explaining in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Xbox Wire post</a> that he wanted to avoid doing the same kinds of environments he's seen a million times before. "I just wanted to get out of the stuff that we’ve just seen a million times, – science fiction, to space, or zombies, all that kind of stuff. I just wanted to get my head out of there and see what I can try to come up with that was original for me personally."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we also got a look at unique character mechanics and customization via skill tree  in the trailer, and what seems to be a massive colletion of possible equippable passive effects. There are far more details in the same<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Xbox Wire post</a> about the combat system and some of the characters' specific moves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also revealed that Clair Obscur will follow in the steps of old-school RPGs and have an actual, navigable world map from which you can access various areas and towns. The world map will also include secrets and even hidden bosses.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-from-sandfall-interactive-announced-for-2025">first announced last summer at the Xbox Games Showcase</a> from Montpellier-based Sandfall Interactive and came as a complete surprise to most. It takes place in a world where an entity known as the Paintress "repaints" the world each year, during which time she also paints a cursed number on a monolith that causes everyone of that age and older to turn to smoke instantly and disappear. Every year, that number ticks down by one, with younger and younger generations dying each time. With the number "33" up next, a group of individuals led by a man named Gustave sets out to try and stop the Paintress once and for all in a turn-based RPG with incredibly stylish battles and real-time elements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything shown in today's Xbox Developer Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2025-everything-announced-so-far">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
