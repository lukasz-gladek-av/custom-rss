            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I've said it a ton over the last few weeks, but interest in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game">Magic: The Gathering</a> is at what feels like an all-time high. With the recently released Final Fantasy Universes Beyond crossover set, new players that may have never picked up a card are now inching ever so slowly towards one of the most addicting and time-consuming hobbies around. If you're one of these people, or someone looking to dip your toes into the wonderful world of hundred-dollar cardboard, IGN has you covered with our Magic: The Gathering beginner's guide.</p><p id="where-to-play"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to play">Where to Start Playing in Person</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">For newcomers, the best place to start playing in person is with what we call "kitchen table" Magic. No formats, no banlist, no meta, just good old fashioned vibes. Find a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-in-stock">starter kit</a> you like, grab a friend, sleeve them up, and jump in. These starter decks are great ways to learn the rules. I'd also highly recommend picking up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-foundations-preorders-are-live-right-now-on-amazon">MTG Foundations</a>, as this set is specifically designed with brand new players in mind. </p><div catalogid="1ef3abe4-e9f2-4d29-a4d2-35077c9aeb4b" id="223131"><div id="223131" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Find in-person events and stores to play Friday Night Magic</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wizards Event Locator</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that you've learned the rules, found the colors you like, and learned a strategy that suits you, you probably want to move up to playing at a local game store (LGS) in your area. Your mileage will vary, as some stores' player bases favor certain formats over others. But for the most part, many LGSs will run the Standard format as their primary Friday Night Magic (FNM) event. To find an LGS near you, use the <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wizards Event Locator</a> to enter your address and distance you want to check.</p></div><p id="formats"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Formats">MTG Formats</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every store is different, and not everybody enjoys playing the same formats all the time. Here's a quick breakdown of some of the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular formats</a>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Standard:</strong> This is the most entry-level 60-card, best-of-three format in Magic. You can use cards from the last two years, and cards will rotate out every Fall.</li><li><strong>Limited:</strong> Limited formats are 40-card events where you don't show up with your own preconstructed decks. The two options are <strong>Booster Draft</strong>, where pods of eight players will open booster packs and pick a card one by one, passing their pack to the next player until three packs have been drafted. <strong>Sealed</strong> is where you get six booster packs, open them, and build your deck from this pool. </li><li><strong>Pioneer: </strong>Pioneer is the next step up in terms of power level from Standard. This format is non-rotating, and only cards from Return to Ravnica to current sets are legal. No supplementary sets are allowed, like Commander decks or sets like Modern Horizons.</li><li><strong>Modern: </strong>Easily the most popular format among competitive players, Modern allows you to use cards from Mirrodin onward, save for Commander deck cards. Direct-to-Modern sets like Modern Horizons are legal, and are big contributors to the format's current meta.</li><li><strong>Legacy: </strong>Every Magic set is legal in Legacy, including Commander decks. This means it has some of the most powerful decks in the game, the most expensive, and is the most difficult to learn. If you're starting out, you likely will not touch Legacy any time soon, if ever. </li><li><strong>Pauper: </strong>One of my personal favorite formats, Pauper is essentially Legacy Lite. Every set is fair game, but you can only use common rarity cards. Many of Legacy's strongest cards are common, like Brainstorm and Ponder, so Pauper is a great format to learn when you're curious about these interactions. </li><li><strong>Commander:</strong> Commander is the format most new and casual players are familiar with. Commander is a format where up to four players battle it out with 100-card decks, where each deck is built around their Commander (a Legendary creature of their choice). You can only build your deck using your Commander's colors. </li></ul><p id="where-to-buy-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy cards">TCGPlayer Is a Great Place to Buy Cards</h2></p><div catalogid="1ef3abe4-e9f2-4d29-a4d2-35077c9aeb4b" id="223134"><div id="223134" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>TCGPlayer is one of the biggest online TCG storefronts</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TCGPlayer</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All Constructed formats have a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of banned cards</a> to help balance out the meta and remove insane combos from their respective formats. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the best place to pick up singles to round out your decks or find sealed product, I recommend <a href="https://www.cardkingdom.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Card Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCGPlayer</a>.

Taking visual cues from games like Hearthstone, Arena is my preferred way to play the Standard and Pioneer formats - Modern, Legacy, and other older non-rotating formats aren't present on Arena. You can still do booster draft and sealed, however. Arena also has a handful of its own bespoke, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/mtg-arena/mtg-arena-formats" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital-only formats</a>. Aside from Standard, Pioneer, and Limited, here's what's exclusive to Arena:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Alchemy: </strong>This is essentially standard. It has the same rotation schedule and relatively the same card pool. However, Alchemy versions of preexisting cards have digital-only mechanics that wouldn't be possible in paper, like Conjuring cards into your deck. </li><li><strong>Historic: </strong>This is a non-rotating format, similar to Pioneer, that leans way harder into the client's digital only mechanics. Conjure, Seek, and giving cards perpetual buffs or debuffs are the main draw. </li><li><strong>Historic Brawl: </strong>Brawl is a less popular Standard variant of Commander, and Historic Brawl is exactly what you'd expect: Digital-only cards are available to build your Brawl deck with.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Where To Go From Here</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There you have it!

Splitgate 2 saw a peak concurrent player count of 25,785 on Steam, well below Splitgate’s 67,724 peak concurrent player count. Steam user reviews remain on ‘mixed.’</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam stats do not paint the whole picture, of course, given Splitgate 2 launched across consoles as well as PC. Indeed, 1047 Games has said Splitgate 2 has had over 2.5 million players. But clearly, things have not gone as well as the studio had hoped. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">an interview with IGN shortly after launch</a>, Proulx said he was “surprised” by the reaction, admitting “we didn't expect this to be nearly as controversial as it was and we didn't intend for it to be.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, 1047 Games has suffered a round of layoffs, which it characterized as “a small group” of staff in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/1047games_today-we-parted-ways-with-a-small-group-of-activity-7341958451004088321-0q4q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAJnrdMBkTuB_VYNNnFKqq9kwmzjliqcGN0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>. Also in the post came confirmation that co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have opted not to take salaries, as the studio aims to improve the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>Today we parted ways with a small group of valued 1047 Games team members. We’re still perfecting the Splitgate 2 gameplay experience in response to community feedback, and we are redirecting resources to build the best game for our players. We are sad to see our teammates go, and we are actively working to help them secure new opportunities. Further, our co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have opted not to take salaries as we lock in to deliver the next phase of the project. Thank you to those who’ve built alongside us — we are sad to say goodbye and would not be here without you.</blockquote><blockquote>To everyone who’s playing Splitgate 2, we’re continuing to work hard to deliver more things we know you’ll love. We are committed to building this game for the long haul.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">While 1047 did not specify how many were let go, or who exactly, a number of key staff have announced their departures across social media platforms. Meanwhile, Splitgate 2 had a 24-hour peak concurrent player count of 10,059 on Steam, with 4,437 players on Valve’s platform at the time of this article’s publication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-review">Splitgate 2 secured a 7/10 in IGN’s review</a>.
