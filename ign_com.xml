This has caused some to have to scramble to find childcare and pet care arrangements that were previously not needed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mandatory overtime is in service of finishing an internal demo in time for a review by Sony, after said demo missed multiple deadlines. Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet does not currently have a public release date or window set, but Bloomberg's report suggests internally it is targeting mid-2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The report concludes that the mandated overtime ended this week, and Naughty Dog will return to just three days a week mandated in-office ithrough the end of January, with a more detailed schedule to come.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Naughty Dog has been notorious for crunch over the years on series such as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/were-definitely-at-the-point-where-somethings-gotta-give" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncharted</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Last of Us</a>, with the studio even openly hiring for individuals who would be willing to crunch. In 2021, studio co-presidents Evan Wells and Neil Druckmann addressed the issue in an <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2021/08/28/naughty-by-nature-naughty-dog-leadership-reflects-on-the-studios" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Game Informer</a>, saying that while they wanted to prevent burnout, they didn't want to impose a one-size-fits-all restriction on employee passion and creativity. That same year, the studio <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-07-22/sony-s-naughty-dog-video-game-studio-finally-has-a-team-of-producers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hired a number of producers</a> specifically tasked with alleviating workload. However, many of those producers have reportedly since left the company, and some employees have apparently already worked long hours to finish Intergalactic's first trailer, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-heads-to-space-with-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-the-game-awards-2024">debuted at The Game Awards last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-most-expansive-and-maybe-the-most-expensive-game-the-studio-has-ever-made">referred to Intergalactic</a> as the most "ambitious" "expansive" and "expensive" game Naughty Dog has ever made. "What can I say and not say? I can tell you we’re in the thick of it. We’re making it, we’re playing it. We’re firing on all cylinders."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?
