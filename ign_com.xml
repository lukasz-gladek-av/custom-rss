"That’s how bad this is. I can’t even bring myself to play it in this state because it’s so distracting."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Several other games are affected by this similar shimmering issue too. "I love my PS5 Pro for the most part, most games look wonderful, but there seems to be an issue with some games," said Chaystic on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-ps5-pro-has-shimmering-aliasing-issues-in-some-games.1037280/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "There's this weird shimmering, aliasing, whatever you wanna call it. One big example is Black Ops 6, I thought my Pro was faulty or something, but it turns out I'm not the only one who noticed it. I've seen several social media posts who reported the same."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fellow PS5 Pro owners in the comments pointed it out in Spider-Man 2, Stellar Blade, and Alan Wake 2 as well, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9iM1N9Bz8&amp;t=406s&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> discovered what it called "severe image quality problems" in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. "There are severe image quality concerns when elements like foliage interact with ray tracing," it said. "The end result is a strobing image quality downgrade that makes this Pro patch difficult to recommend."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 Pro arrived November 7 as Sony's now standard mid-generation upgrade. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-among-over-50-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-confirmed-by-sony-to-be-ready-for-launch">More than 50 games received PS5 Pro specific patches</a> upon its launch but, as this list includes Alan Wake 2 and Black Ops 6 among others receiving complaints, it's worth proceeding with caution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-pro-review">In our 7/10 review of the PS5 Pro</a>, IGN said: "The PlayStation 5 Pro is an impressive console with noticeable boosts in performance and graphics for games that take advantage of its powerful hardware. But for $700, you’ll need to think twice about whether or not the upgrade is worth the price tag."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

"We wanted to take this occasion to clarify that all the rewards available in the Animus Hub will be entirely free."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The post went on to clarify "there are no paid subscriptions or paid battle passes featured in the Animus Hub" and "players will have access to regular content and missions at no extra cost." More details will be revealed closer to the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">was recently delayed from November to February 14</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Assassin's Creed Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is also ditching its main paid content model of releasing a Season Pass with two main, paid expansion drops in the year after launch. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-price-drops-50-amid-cancelled-season-pass-and-early-access">The faux "early access" period</a> that sees publishers charge players more to play on the actual release date instead of three days later has also been scrapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Releasing myriad pieces of downloadable content for free will perhaps bring some Assassin's Creed fans back on-side in what's otherwise been a particularly rough pre-launch campaign for Ubisoft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Issues began as some fans expressed frustration with inaccuracies in the game's depiction of Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">leading the development team to issue an apology</a> and say the game is not intended to be a factual representation of history but instead "a compelling, historical fiction." This despite art director Thierry Dansereau telling IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Ubisoft looked to make Shadows as "authentic as possible to match historical events"</a> just two months prior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concern was also raised when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission. Ubisoft apologized for doing so but refused to remove the artwork from the aforementioned and presumably already printed artbook available in the Collector's Edition. The historical re-enactment group said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says">this was not good enough</a>, but Ubisoft hasn't publicly acknowledged it since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes as fans are already frustrated by the delay to the game, which puts Assassin's Creed Shadows in more direct competition with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">PlayStation's Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei</a>. This is also expected in 2025 and is another open-world action adventure game set in Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained confidence</a>, however. "There's a lot of space for very high-quality games, and those two games can sell very well," he said in the company's latest earnings call. "The focus is to really make sure that we deliver a fantastic experience with this dual protagonist approach and two different and complimentary gameplays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassins Creed Shadows indeed features two protagonists, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-brings-back-double-assassinations">stealthy assassin Naoe</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained">savage samurai Yasuke</a>. The game's story will weave between the two but players can otherwise switch between them at will as they explore Ubisoft's open-world take on Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will also begin a new modern day story, perhaps linked to the Animus Hub, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-begin-a-new-modern-day-story-after-the-series-post-desmond-blues">Ubisoft admitted it's "struggled to find its footing" with that aspects of Assassin's Creed</a> in recent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-players-react-to-developer-starbreeze-saying-it-will-make-a-significantly-lower-level-of-investment-in-year-2-content<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a> developer Starbreeze has sparked backlash after confirming plans to make a “significantly lower level of investment” in the game’s second year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starbreeze’s struggle with Payday 3 after last year’s disastrous launch is well-documented, but its recent series of year one anniversary updates were well-received by players who had hoped for similarly significant updates during the co-op shooter's second year. Indeed, Payday 3’s recent Steam user reviews are on ‘mostly positive’, with all reviews on ‘mixed.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, that goodwill may now be under threat after comments from Starbreeze acting CEO Mats Juhl in a <a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial report</a> caused some Payday 3 players to express concern that the studio was now prioritizing its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-announces-dungeons-dragons-co-op-multiplayer-game">Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a> instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The backlash revolves around Juhl’s comment on Payday 3’s level of investment for year two versus year one. It is below, reproduced in its entirety.</p><blockquote>During the quarter, both the third and fourth DLCs for Payday 3 – “Chapter 3: Houston Breakout” and “Chapter 4: Fear &amp; Greed” were released. In conjunction with both launches, a lot of free content was also released to all players, including a new free heist. Both DLCs received a very positive reception from the player base and the game's rating on Steam, among others, has taken significant steps upwards. The game's MAU (monthly active players) is holding steady considering that we in September left Xbox GamePass. The level of investment during Payday 3's first year on the market, both through launched DLCs and "Operation Medic Bag", has been at an elevated level. Ahead of year two, we are confident in being able to continue delivering amounts of value to our players with a significantly lower level of investment.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That last line (“significantly lower level of investment”) is the one causing all the damage here, and players are blaming it on Starbreeze shifting focus onto Project Baxter, its in-development Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. Elsewhere in the financial report, Juhl said production on Project Baxter had ramped up (along with the payment of licensing fees to Wizards of the Coast), and that as Payday 3’s game-saving Operation Medic Bag updates ramp down, the game will enter year two “with a smaller team focused on continuously updating the game with new content.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disgruntled players have taken to Steam reviews to let their feelings about this be known. “Dead game,” reads one negative review, “like this time for real.” “Dropping this game as soon as it started to show promise is insane,” said another. “Significantly lower,” another review reads. "I've tried defending this game for so long, but it is really frustrating seeing the company executives kill this game before it has a chance to fully recover just to fund their next project that will more than likely flop, just like Payday 3," another reviewer said. "Save your money and the headache; Payday 3's future is genuinely grim."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar outcry over on the Payday subreddit, where fans are already hitting out at Starbreeze and Project Baxter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, Starbreeze sounds like it still believes in Payday 3, even if some of its players do not. “Starbreeze remains financially strong, with a healthy balance sheet almost free of debt and a cash position to execute our strategy,” Juhl said. “Sales of Payday 3 still have great potential to improve, which is offset somewhat by continued relatively stable sales of Payday 2 and third-party publishing of, among other things, Roboquest. During the same period last year, we booked the revenue attributable to Payday 3's launch, which makes the revenue in the comparison period uniquely high.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Payday 2, significantly more people are playing that game on Steam (27,553 24 hour peak) than Payday 3 (1,314 24 hour peak), despite the former being over a decade old. In September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-director-steps-down-after-disastrous-first-year">Payday 3 director Miodrag Kovačević stepped down to work as a designer instead</a>. Lead producer Andreas Penninger and global brand director Almir Listo were put in place to act as the "creative force" behind the game "in the interim."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starbreeze is still hiring for Project Baxter, meanwhile, as work on the game “continues at full speed.” “Internally, we have weekly playtests of Baxter, and active discussions with a number of industry-leading players regarding potential collaborations around Baxter's development and launch,” Juhl said. Starbreeze said it has 191 total employees, most of which are based at its head office in Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
