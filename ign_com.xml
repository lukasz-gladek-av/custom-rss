It was actually Warhammer 40,000 owner Games Workshop, which took issue with an image of a shoulder pad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ftl-in-a-warhammer-40000-skin-game-pulled-from-steam-after-what-may-be-a-nuisance-dmca-takedown-from-a-troll-claiming-to-be-games-workshop">IGN reported on Void War</a>, a strategy game dubbed ‘FTL in a Warhammer 40,000 skin,’ after it was pulled from Steam. At the time, its developer, Tundra Interactive, suggested it may have been on the receiving end of a nuisance DMCA takedown from a troll claiming to be Games Workshop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Void War is often compared to both indie darling FTL and Warhammer 40,000, Games Workshop’s tabletop wargame set in the grim darkness of the far future — and it’s easy to see why. The gameplay looks incredibly similar to Subset Games’ hugely popular 2012 ‘spaceship simulation roguelike-like,’ and the aesthetic is very Warhammer 40,000. The voidships look like Imperial Navy Vessels. Some of the characters look like Space Marines. There’s an actual Psyker that’s called a Psyker. There are “Imperial Shrineworlds.” There’s even a mention of “Imperial astrogation authorities.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Void War Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the takedown, IGN asked Tundra Interactive for comment, and it responded with something quite unusual. It said that it had received a takedown notice from Valve stating that Games Workshop itself had claimed copyright infringement. But here’s what made this one odd: the claiming information came from Games Workshop’s public-facing infringements inbox and the name “Mal Reynolds.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mal Reynolds is a name that will be instantly familiar to Firefly / Serenity fans, because that’s the name of the main character, played by Nathan Fillion, in the beloved but short-lived sci-fi show. At the time, it was thought that it was unlikely that Games Workshop would have someone on its books named Mal Reynolds. But, well, it turns out Games Workshop really was behind the takedown, according to Tundra Interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tundra Interactive told IGN that Games Workshop eventually replied to the developer to confirm it was their notice, and that the concern was limited to a specific shot from one of the trailers on the Steam store page that it said could give the impression that Void War was associated with Games Workshop. The company specified that the element in question was “the oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim.” And, well, yeah, that Void War trailer did indeed have an image of a character who looked a lot like a Space Marine, complete with "oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/cover-art-1769428932329.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This isn't a Space Marine, it's a character from Void War. Or, was.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tundra Interactive told IGN that it disagreed with Games Workshop's assessment here, but in order to get Void War back on Steam and to avoid a drawn out DMCA fight, it pulled the trailer. It may re-upload it in the future after making an adjustment, but its priority is getting back to work on Void War, the developer insisted. And, to that end, Void War is now back on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Tundra Interactive’s statement in full to IGN:</p><blockquote>To recap, the initial takedown was triggered by a DMCA notice attributed to Games Workshop. At the time, we could not independently verify the submitter beyond the name and contact email Valve included. The contact email was GW's public infringements inbox, and the name listed was “Mal Reynolds,” which is also a fictional character from the sci-fi TV show Firefly.</blockquote><blockquote>After over a week of no response, Games Workshop eventually replied to our email and confirmed the notice was theirs. They said their concern was limited to a specific shot from one of the trailers on the store page, arguing that certain elements could create the mistaken impression that Void War is associated with Games Workshop, specifically what they described as “the oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim.”</blockquote><blockquote>All of the artwork in the trailer is original work created by our artists. While we disagree with their assessment, the simplest way to get the game back up and avoid getting bogged down in DMCA process was to remove that trailer and move on. We may re-upload an updated version later after we find time to adjust that shot, but for now our priority is shipping content and finishing multi-language font support so we can finally deliver proper translations.</blockquote><blockquote>Thanks for your patience, and thank you for the overwhelming support. o7 commanders.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All’s well that ends well? Perhaps. Certainly this case shows that Games Workshop and “Mal Reynolds,” who I’d love to meet one day, are keeping a close eye on video game characters and their shoulder pads. Perhaps it shouldn't come as a surprise, given Games Workshop's history of stringent IP protection. Be warned! The Inquisition is always watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

But, the way I see it, that's <em>excellent </em>news, especially for anyone on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-budget-gaming-pc">budget gaming PC</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since the RE Engine came to prominence starting with Resident Evil: Biohazard, Capcom has been impressing me with just how good it can make games look, without making them too demanding. Now, obviously, I haven't had the chance to test Resident Evil: Requiem performance yet myself, but just looking at both the system requirements and the Switch 2 trailer, it seems like Capcom is continuing this trend. </p><div><div><p>Resident Evil: Requiem Minimum PC Requirements</p></div><div><div><p>Processor</p><p>intel Core i5-8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</p></div><div><p>GPU</p><p>Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT</p></div></div></div><div><div><p>Resident Evil: Requiem Recommended PC System requirements</p></div><div><div><p>Processor</p><p>Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500</p></div><div><p>GPU</p><p>Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super / AMD Radeon RX 6600</p></div></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom hasn't revealed what resolution and settings either of these spec sheets are targeting, but even if that recommended build is just for 1080p Ultra at 60 fps, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/02/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-super-review-and-benchmarks">Nvidia RTX 2060 Super</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review">Radeon RX 6600</a> are very attainable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-graphics-card">graphics cards.</a> That's not to mention only requiring a Core i7-8700 or Ryzen 5 5500 and 16GB of RAM, which is a very low bar to clear. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">What Kind of Performance Can I Expect?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, because Capcom hasn't revealed any specific settings that the system requirements are targeting, I can't say for sure, but from my time testing <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/resident-evil-village-pc-performance-the-almost-perfect-pc-port-we-all-needed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resident Evil Village for TechRadar</a> when it came out, I was able to get nearly 60 fps at 4K with an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/evga-rtx-3060-xc-black-review">RTX 3060</a> – and the 3060 is very much not a 4K graphics card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, it's important to note that the requirements for Requiem are a bit heavier than they were for Village. The biggest difference is that instead of asking for a Radeon RX 5700 or a GTX 1070 for Village, Requiem is asking for an RTX 2060 Super or a Radeon RX 6600. And while the performance gap between these graphics cards isn't huge on its own, the key difference is that Requiem is recommending a ray tracing-capable GPU – Village didn't. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">That makes a lot of sense, given the visual quality of some of the trailers that have come out for the game, but it may leave some folks with older GPUs out in the cold. It's very likely that with an older non-RT GPU, the game will look a lot like the Nintendo Switch 2 footage. The bright side here, though, is that the GTX 1660 and Radeon RX 5500 XT sneak in the minimum specs, so you'll still be able to <em>play</em> the game, it just might not look too great. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Nintendo Switch 2 Equivalent</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's important to highlight that the Nintendo Switch 2 is able to run Resident Evil: Requiem, even if it wouldn't <em>quite</em> meet the system requirements if it were a PC. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tech-analysis-is-4k-actually-realistic-updated">The Tegra T239 SoC in the handheld is roughly the equivalent of a mobile RTX 3050</a> – which is weaker than the desktop-class GTX 1660 Capcom is requiring. I wouldn't get too caught up in this detail, though. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Primarily, that's because the Nintendo Switch 2 is a console and every single unit will be running the exact same hardware. That means when Capcom was porting Resident Evil: Requiem over to the Switch 2, it was able to fine-tune the build to the exact hardware, likely finding optimizations that wouldn't be there for the PC version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, just going by the Switch 2 trailer earlier this week, it does seem like Capcom just barely managed to squeeze the game onto the handheld. But even if it is rough, I'm looking forward to seeing just how well it runs on the Nintendo console. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.
