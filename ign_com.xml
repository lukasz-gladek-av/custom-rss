            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Zero Parades is an exploration of failure,” explains Jim Ashilevi, writer and VO director at ZA/UM. “What it means to lose everything and then keep going regardless. And then, since it's such a painful question, it inevitably becomes an exploration of what it means to be human. How uncomfortable and strange it is to exist in a body that has thoughts and feelings and responsibilities, and a past that they can't go back and fix.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is why I love working here,” says ZA/UM’s head of studio, Allen Murray, with a smile. “I never had these conversations making Halo games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> was, of course, never going to follow up its 2019 “disaster cop” RPG with a game about heroes saving the world. That’s not to say that it hasn’t moved into <em>slightly</em> more traditional video game territory, though. Its new game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/zero-parades-for-dead-spies">Zero Parades: For Dead Spies</a>, is an espionage spy thriller set in a dark, almost psychedelic reflection of the Cold War’s closing years. Global powers conspire, enemy agents lurk in the dark, and the entire world sits on the doorstep of the end of history. But while that could theoretically be the elevator pitch for any number of mainstream, combat-forward RPGs, ZA/UM is doing spycraft the only way it knows: Disco style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the one North Star that we have is that we have to be genuinely interested in the stories that we are choosing to tell,” says Ashilevi. “If we were to start mimicking someone else, or go bigger and more expensive and add production value and fighting mechanics and multiplayer, I think we would just destroy ourselves in the process.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This “North Star” means that, on the surface, Zero Parades looks almost identical to Disco Elysium. It’s another dialogue-centric, introspective, isometric RPG with striking art direction. But that’s not to say it’s the exact same game dressed up in a John le Carré skin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think you can see the team has really wanted to exceed their production chops with Zero Parades,” explains Murray, “in terms of having the world seem more reactive, more lived in. There's more action, more people walking around doing things.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While ZA/UM had no intention of creating a “traditional” video game RPG, it did want to dig deeper into the genre’s more crunchy elements. This time around there are more skill checks, alongside a mental and physical health system that can be exerted to increase the chances of passing those checks. There’s further emphasis on multiple solutions to individual problems, the very foundation of BioWare’s celebrated Infinity Engine games. By pushing the depth of choice available and enhancing the world’s reactivity to those choices, the team saw the opportunity to create something that stood distinct from Disco Elysium.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sophomore efforts are really challenging,” Murray admits. “You don't want to repeat your first hit, nor can you really.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It took a lot of time for the team to come to terms with that. During the years following Disco Elysium’s release and subsequent “Final Cut” version, ZA/UM experimented with a number of concepts – some were effectively direct sequels, while others explored “a completely different direction,” according to Ashilevi. The path to Zero Parades arrived with the decision to “not fully reinvent the wheel.” The goal, Murray says, was to “expand on what we know how to do, and make a bigger game, both mechanically and in terms of production scope, and do it well.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mission Control</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Murray acknowledges that there were “years of drama” before the studio got to that point. For many fans of Disco Elysium, that will mean only one thing: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-developers-involuntarily-left-zaum-responds"><u>the firing of several key creatives in 2022</u></a> and their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-directors-accuse-zaum-shareholders-of-fraud-as-the-company-says-they-were-fired-for-misconduct"><u>subsequent accusation</u></a> that ZA/UM’s executive management had seized control of the company through fraud. It’s a complicated chapter in the studio’s story, in which those exorcised from the company – including game director Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov – are characterised as either toxic disruptors or the victims of corporate conspiracy, depending on your source. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s more to ZA/UM’s troubled recent history than those controversial dismissals: this is a studio that has repeatedly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaum-reportedly-cancels-disco-elysium-expansion-at-risk-of-lay-offs"><u>cancelled projects</u></a> and, in early 2024, made 20 of its staff redundant. It all paints a picture of an inexperienced studio struggling to adapt to life after releasing an unexpected mega hit on the first attempt, with the workers caught in the crossfire. Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ZA/UM’s UK-based workforce unionised last year</u></a>. </p><p>The artistry comes first, the storytelling comes first. It still feels like the whole video game development side of things is just like a happy accident.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while collective bargaining is undoubtedly important, those workers also need strong leadership to avoid the woes of the past. Maybe they’ve found that in Murray, a 20-year veteran of the video games industry with previous tenures at Microsoft, Bungie, PopCap, and Private Division. He was appointed as ZA/UM’s new head of studio shortly after news broke about those painful redundancies, and over the past two years his goal has been “coaching the people in the studio, maturing our processes, helping people to really focus on what we're making, how we're making it, and why we're making it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was easy to have a lot of things sort of floating around,” he admits. “But how are we <em>actually </em>going to animate this, or how are we going to light this? What does this story really mean? What are you really trying to get across to the player?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, ZA/UM is made up of around 90 members of staff. Several of them have, like Murray, been recruited from established developers such as Rocksteady in order to arm the studio with specialist video game experience. But the remaining members of the Disco Elysium team, which makes up approximately 35% of the studio’s total roster, plus many of the new recruits, “come from a background that has nothing to do with game dev,” says Ashilevi.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a studio, we still view ourselves pretty much as a collective of artists,” he explains. “The artistry comes first, the storytelling comes first. To me personally, it still feels like the whole video game development side of things is just like a happy accident.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Price of Power</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings us back to Zero Parades, which tells the story of Hershel Wilk, codename “Cascade”, who’s pulled out of retirement for the all-time classic spy trope, One Last Job. By moving into the espionage genre, ZA/UM has been able to work at a notably different scale than it did with Disco Elysium. While Zero Parades takes place in a physical space not too dissimilar to that of the studio’s previous game, by stepping into the shoes of a spy rather than a local detective, the story naturally explores a much grander stage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You do have to contend with world powers,” Ashilevi reveals. “It's not just wallpaper, or stuff that you read from notes that people leave in drawers, or newspapers left on tables. You do have to come into close contact with some of the big players as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This global stage is explored through Hershel’s very personal lens, so while the stakes are certainly heightened this time around, your actions are still conducted at street level. You may be able to turn the cogs of a mega corporation and shift the balance of worldwide politics, for instance, but to do so may require betraying your closest friend. Hershel’s own pain will be tangible, whereas those rotating cogs will feel distant, perhaps even unimportant, to her own life. Such is the toll of espionage.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/09/zero-parades-format-fetishist-1770647663407.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hershel will encounter people obsessed with niche corners of pop culture. | Image credit: ZA/UM.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To create something that reflects Disco Elysium’s triumphs, though, you can’t just tackle issues of the human condition. You’ve got to get at least a little eccentric. And that’s where Hershel’s hobbies come into play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“She's deeply fascinated with comic books, music, you name it,” Ashilevi reveals. “So the story is also an exploration of pop culture and what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>soft power</u></a> means. Why is it important for us to be obsessed with pop artists and cartoons, and films and pulp novels, and things like that? Why are people so deeply obsessed with retro tech and bootlegged media, like underground forbidden films? What does it do to your soul, and how does it define your identity?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While music, fashion, TV shows, and retrofuturistic music formats all contribute to the city of Portofiro’s vibrant texture, there is a dark side to it all. What is a consumer as a political entity? How do tiny decisions, like tuning into a particular show or buying a certain magazine, tie into the movements of the big powers? These are potential avenues for Hershel – for you – to investigate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle for soft and hard power, waged between international banks, imperialist states, and communist unions, is something that goes beyond just Hershel’s current mission. “We need to come up with an inspiring enough sandbox so that whatever we choose to do with those characters or this universe next, we can just jump right into it and keep telling stories because the groundwork has been laid,” says Ashilevi. Zero Parades is the starting point for something bigger, then. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least that’s the hope. The world of Elysium was also envisioned as a space for multiple stories, but it seems that book is now eternally closed. And while Zero Parades may not necessarily need to be as significant a breakout hit as Disco Elysium was to unlock the potential for sequels, it does need to stand tall in a world where the “Disco-like” is a rising genre, made up of games developed both by fans inspired by that RPG masterpiece and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick"><u>new studios set up by the scattered former members of ZA/UM’s original creative team</u></a>. But by following their own creative North Star, the team behind Zero Parades hopes to captivate players once more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have no clue what kinds of games or stories people are hoping to get out of ZA/UM,” Ashilevi says. “The only thing we can control is whether we're staying true to our own vision and voice. And that's what we have done with Zero Parades.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/power-comic-books-and-zero-parades-for-dead-spies-how-zaum-found-its-disco-elysium-successor]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has reportedly partnered with Korean gaming giant Nexon for yet another crack at turning StarCraft into a shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While unconfirmed by Blizzard itself, the project is the subject of an article in <a href="https://www.dnews.co.kr/uhtml/view.jsp?idxno=202601301526154230994" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Korea Economic Daily</a>, the country's largest business newspaper. The report states that Nexon has a development team dedicated to the project within its shooter division, with a StarCraft modder installed as its project lead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has long held ambitions to launch a shooter spin-off from its sci-fi real-time strategy series, while Nexon has recently found Western success within the shooter space as the owner of Swedish development studio Embark Studio — the outfit behind The Finals and Arc Raiders.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the report is cautious on the project's development — noting that Nexon previously partnered with Square Enix to develop a Final Fantasy spin-off that faltered in the planning stages. A note of caution here is likely wise, too, considering Blizzard's own track record on abandoned StarCraft spin-off projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starcraft-ghost">StarCraft Ghost</a>, announced in 2002, was Blizzard's first attempt to expand the series beyond its real-time strategy origins. Planned as a tactical-action console game in which you played as a deadly Ghost operative in the employ of the Dominion, it was canceled in 2006 after a series of delays. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A second StarCraft shooter attempt, codenamed Ares, was canceled in 2019 so Blizzard could focus on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>. Ares was reportedly "like Battlefield in the StarCraft universe," but, like Ghost, fell by the wayside. Finally, in 2024, Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier shared word of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">third StarCraft shooter project then in development within Blizzard</a>, with former Far Cry executive producer Dan Hay, who joined Blizzard in 2022, leading the charge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Nexon's shooter be the same project as the one Hay had been leading, or a new iteration of it? This remains unclear, especially since Hay's project had apparently been in development two years ago, whereas Nexon's game sounds more recent — and developed on a different continent. IGN has contacted Blizzard for more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sports are foundational to gaming as a medium. From Pong to NES Baseball, the infancy of the medium was littered with just-about-recognisable renditions of real-life sports in an attempt to conjure a degree of familiarity to this fledgling form of entertainment. But in the mid ‘90s, the developers at Nintendo collectively had a light bulb appear above their head housing an idea that would change gaming forever – what if Mario and his friends <em>played tennis?</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The greatest Mario sports games are a perfect blend of those two words: Mario and sports. It has to be a simulation worth its salt, giving you a reasonable adaptation of what it’s truly like to play the sport in question. However, just as vital is the Mario part, splicing the sport with the Mushroom Kingdom’s trademark personality. In the decades following 1995’s Mario’s Tennis, Nintendo’s sports games evolved from simple sims to wacky adventures, before retreating back to a steady, if uninspiring, run of titles. The early days of Camelot Software’s handheld RPGs and chaos-inducing console sims are seemingly long gone, and today many of Mario’s sporting outings are greeted with more of a shrug than with anticipation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> releasing this month on Nintendo Switch 2, we could be about to enter a new era. So in celebration of a joyful future (or just a magical past) here’s the top 10 Mario sports games, ranked. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Mario Sports Games</h3></div></span></output><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Mario Hoops 3-on-3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-hoops-1770302985415.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">If many modern Mario sports games are poisoned by a lack of personality, games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-hoops-3-on-3-mario-slam-basketball">Mario Hoops</a> are the antidote. 3-on-3’s unique presentation blends 3D models with excellent sprite work, a striking approach that bridges the graphical styles of the GameBoy Advance and Nintendo’s then-new DS handheld. Nothing represents this mix better than the character select screen, the single greatest in all of Mario history, which lays the groundwork for a charming basketball romp. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hoops could easily claim to be the best use of the DS’ touch screen. Tapping in different areas sees Mario and his friends dribble around the court, keeping the ball away from opponents and collecting coins and items. It’s an intuitive motion, and that use of the stylus extends to all the basics of basketball, like shooting and passing. Regrettably, Nintendo has rarely returned to the idea of basketball in the Mushroom Kingdom, but even if it did try again, few consoles would execute the idea better than the DS… well, as long as you’re not left-handed, that is. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Mario Tennis (Game Boy Color)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-tennis-gbc-1770303000447.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The early days of handheld Mario sports games produced some of the most unusual oddities in Nintendo’s history, and their lack of Mushroom Kingdom whimsey and focus on regular human characters is often looked back upon with a raised eyebrow. However, actually dive into the Game Boy Color’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis-gbc">Mario Tennis</a> and you’ll find that eyebrow is put firmly back in place. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Tennis features a wonderful RPG “Tour” mode that nails the genre’s basics. Being locked into three-set matches with a far more powerful opponent is akin to boss battles in a more traditional RPG. They become challenges that you relish, always pushing you to move more quickly after a serve or time your smashes to perfection. Working through the tour sees you levelling up your original character via a very satisfying process, with the grind required to improve specific skills never feeling like a chore. The graphics and controls are inherently limited by the console, but that simplicity lends Mario Tennis a lovely rhythmic quality that encourages repeat replays even a quarter of a century later.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Mario Golf: World Tour</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-golf-world-tour-1770303082047.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">For as slow and ponderous as the sport of golf can be, it’s a miracle that it consistently dovetails so beautifully with the chaotic and colorful world of Mario. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf-world-tour">World Tour</a> nails the balance between both sides of the Nintendo sports coin, offering a quick and snappy way to execute precise and considered rounds of golf. With no need for complicated button schemes or deep systems, World Tour gives you a great sense of control that allows you to cut through the fiddly stuff and get to work on the eternal quest of improving your swing, just like a real casual golfer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 3DS and Wii U era was a difficult one for Mario sports titles, but World Tour stands out from a lacklustre crowd thanks to its personality-packed game modes like Point Tourney, Star Coin challenges and Speed Golf. Castle Club also adds a story mode centred on your Mii, complete with a fun upgrade system with stat-boosting cosmetics like clothes and clubs, which is reminiscent of Camelot’s handheld glory days. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Mario Superstar Baseball</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-superstar-baseball-1770303206159.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like basketball, Nintendo has barely paid any attention to baseball across the past couple decades, despite knocking it out of the park on the first try back in 2005. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-superstar-baseball">Mario Superstar Baseball</a> is a wonderful marriage of addictive baseball mechanics and Mushroom Kingdom chaos, played out in iconic Mario locations that have been contorted into baseball fields. Only in Wario Palace could a barrage of environmental hazards turn a home run into a devastating out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Superstar Baseball boasts one of the Mario sports series’ most engaging story modes  thanks to its “chemistry engine”. The relationships between your teammates dictates the speed and accuracy of their passes, meaning you won’t want to pair Mario with Wario and Bowser, but he’ll combine beautifully with Luigi and Peach. It’s a simple and effective way to bring depth to an already smooth experience that belongs in the Nintendo big leagues.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Super Mario Strikers</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-super-mario-strikers-1770303339338.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s amazing what a little pop of 2D animation and a few guitar riffs can do to make a subset of Mario sports games feel completely unique. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-strikers">Super Mario Strikers</a>, the jumping plumber’s first foray into the world of soccer, has always had a rebellious edge. Anyone who was glued to their GameCube in the mid-2000s will  look back on it with a special kind of fondness, especially in the light of its disappointing revival on Switch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nostalgia for Strikers isn’t just due to its bold presentation, though: its gameplay is perfectly calibrated. Each character controls just loosely enough to invite exactly the right amount of chaos into each and every match. If the dial was turned too far towards clean passing and shooting, Mario Strikers would be nowhere near as fun. Instead, developer Next Level Games created something aggressively competitive, wholly chaotic, and vibrantly unique – everything a Mario sports game should be. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Mario Golf: Advance Tour</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-golf-advance-tour-1770303536951.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Golf: Advance Tour is one of the Game Boy Advance’s true gems, launched during a time when developer Camelot was proving itself as a Nintendo sports powerhouse. Compared to its predecessors it is genuinely beautiful; the GBA was an absolute haven for bright and colorful adventures and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf-advance-tour">Advance Tour</a> benefits greatly from the system’s then-advanced capabilities. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those vibrant visuals are just the face of a game that takes the proven and perfected RPG structure from Camelot’s previous sports games and introduces even more Mario characters and locations to the mix. On the gameplay front, despite only having two face buttons available, Camelot designed a great-feeling, tight control scheme that ensured each shot you took felt measured and clean. That sharpness became a design philosophy that continues to stick around throughout every installment in the Mario Golf series. Advance Tour remains special to this day, though, thanks to its unique pixel art rendering of otherworldly courses, and the GBA’s form factor making it the perfect game to pack for on-the-go strolls through the Mushroom Kingdom’s premier golf courses. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Mario Tennis (Nintendo 64)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-tennis-n64-1770303675344.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The moment you play your first shot in the Nintendo 64 version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis">Mario Tennis</a>, something just <em>clicks</em>. The responsive gameplay, smooth animations, and freeing analog control creates an indescribable sense of elegance. Long rallies become like trances in which you find yourself less determined to win the point and instead simply addicted to the sensation of knocking the ball back and forth. Well, until you completely mistime a shot, Toad falls flat on his face, and you’re suddenly a couple sets down, that is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in the year 2000, Mario Tennis is another example of deep gameplay that requires just two face buttons and directional controls, representing Nintendo at its most simple and effective. Subsequent tennis games went on to add ideas, gimmicks and modes that undeniably helped them surpass the offerings of this N64 title. But the bones of modern Mario Tennis are all here, a timeless gameplay loop perfected 26 years ago that endures throughout Nintendo’s history.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-golf-toadstool-tour-1770304306552.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of what we expect from modern Mario sports games originated back on the GameCube, and the brilliant Mario Golf formula established by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-golf-toadstool-tour">Toadstool Tour</a> is one that Nintendo has defaulted to over the last couple decades. Its use of normal and power shots, manual or automatic swinging, and approach to camera control are all now staples of 3D Mario Golf titles for good reason: the simplicity just <em>works</em>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That simplicity gives Toadstool Tour plenty of space to carry out an overwhelming charm offensive. There are so many different ways to play, especially in multiplayer, from the conventional Doubles and Tournament modes to the more eccentric Coin and Ring attacks, giving Toadstool Tour a shot at being the best party game on this list. It’s also the Mario Golf game that does the sport itself the most justice while still feeling quintessentially Mario. It’s simply a great bit of goofy, golfy goodness. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Mario Power Tennis</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-mario-power-tennis-1770304379782.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything that made Mario Tennis on the N64 so brilliant is preserved and built upon with the GameCube’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-power-tennis">Mario Power Tennis</a>. The console’s extra horsepower is used to add wild flourishes to the courts and characters, allowing the established, excellent 3D tennis formula to thrive alongside a deep collection of crazy Mario-isms. Smartly, developer Camelot decided against making full use of the GameCube’s iconic multi-button controller, understanding the enduring appeal of a simple control scheme, while still finding a way to add deeper mechanics, such as offensive and defensive skill shots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with fun challenge courts that test specific tennis skills and Item Battles which create chaos over the net, Mario Power Tennis boasts feats of creative genius like Artist on the Court, a mode in which you use your tennis skills to paint a mural.These may not be flagship modes, but they add the kind of personality and flavour that you can’t get from anyone else but Nintendo in today’s gaming landscape.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Super Mario Strikers Charged</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/best-mario-sports-games-super-mario-strikers-charged-1770304475821.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like how Power Tennis and Toadstool Tour benefited from the excellent foundations of their predecessors, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-strikers-charged">Super Mario Strikers Charged</a> takes every beloved detail from the original Strikers and advances them several steps further. Its refined design places increased emphasis on tactics; each character now has stats and special abilities, which makes playstyles and team composition as vital to victory as actually kicking the ball. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes Strikers Charged the very best game in this list, though, is how that tactical play is enhanced through Super Abilities and Mega Strikes, AKA the greatest gimmicks ever introduced to a Mario sports game. Abilities like Yoshi turning into a giant egg and flattening people across the pitch, or Bowser setting players on fire, or Petey Piranha spraying mud in every direction provides a variety of incredibly silly, yet highly tactical opportunities. The Mega Strikes, meanwhile, increase the level of hype around the proceedings, triggering a cut scene and allowing you to score up to six goals in one go. This is a great arcade soccer game, but Super Mario Strikers Charged is also completely out of its mind, and it’s that wonderful blend that makes a Mario sports game truly great. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And those are our picks for the very best Mario sports games. Did we get a hole in one, or have we suffered a triple bagel?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Creative Director/EP Nick Herman and AdHoc CEO Michael Choung also discuss the "miracle" behind making a video game. </h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a million things that have to go right for a video game to be a success. Well, maybe not a million. But a lot. Michael Choung, the CEO of AdHoc Studio – which released the popular superhero workplace comedy game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-review"><u>Dispatch</u></a> last year – admits as much. Choung says that there were “probably 20 decisions in the last seven years” that aligned to make the game a huge success. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-video-game-performances-of-2025"><u>casting Aaron Paul</u></a> as Dispatch’s protagonist, Robert Robertson/Mecha Man, was one of those decisions. </p>I spoke exclusively with Choung and Dispatch Creative Director/Executive Producer Nick Herman ahead of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-ghost-of-yotei-rule-the-annual-dice-award-nominations"><u>DICE Awards</u></a> (Dispatch is nominated for six, including Game of the Year) on February 12 to break down everything that had to go right in order for Dispatch to see the light of day. Herman says that, although they had “pretty decent” temporary tracks out of the  stand-in actors they hired before the main cast got into the studio, Paul’s performance pushed the entire development of the game in a new direction. <p data-cy="paragraph">“Once we cast Aaron Paul and brought him into the booth, he brought a lot more gravitas,” Herman says. “He brought a heaviness to the character that started to allow us to take him more seriously. You can actually feel that he's got this burden on his shoulders and this weight from his past, and the game got a little bit more serious. When we were working with him we realized that was a good thing. We wanted that depth to show up in the game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Paul, perhaps best known for his Emmy-winning turn as Jesse Pinkman on Breaking Bad, is nominated for a DICE Award for Outstanding Achievement in Character, a nomination he shares with Herman and Dispatch’s other Narrative and Creative Directors. Laura Bailey, Paul’s co-star in the game who plays Courtney/Invisigal,  is nominated for the same award. Herman says that assembling an all-star cast – which also includes Jeffrey Wright, Matthew Mercer, and Ashley Johnson – was both a creative and strategic decision. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We knew that we wanted to have some big talent that when people see the name, they’d go, ‘Oh I know who that is. I know that actor and I like them,’” Herman says. “Aaron just read the script and he liked it. So we were very fortunate. We needed that tier, especially when you're going into rooms with a lot of suits who have a lot of money and make decisions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think there's a desire for people to want there to be this puppet mastery strategy around this stuff,” Choung adds. “But we just like these voices. You want it to be creatively compelling. (But) then you have these other additional bonuses: (the actors) having a huge audience, they (come from) different worlds. A lot of them were friends. They were people that we'd worked with before. So it’s years and years of experience just coming to bear.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/27/dispatchthumb-1761592135786.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Invisigal (voiced by Laura Bailey) in Dispatch</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that Dispatch has become both a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-review"><u>critical</u></a> and commercial success, both Herman and Choung are reflecting on the intense reaction to the game. I asked them each if they could point to a single thing they were most proud of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can dislike it, but the tone is unique and the result of countless numbers of decisions,” Choung says. “It’s a very strange alchemy that results in a tone like this. I'm proud that we stuck to our guns and we were okay with something a little off the beaten path.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We had a lot of bold ideas that people told us were maybe a little too risky,” Herman adds. “People were saying there's no money in narrative experiences. This stuff is dead. Removing freewalk, not having exploration, focusing on having one core main mechanic. All of these things are things we wanted to try for for a very long time. And we've treated Dispatch like this is our one shot, like this might be the last time we ever get an opportunity to make something on our own together. I think all of those things combined is the reason Dispatch is successful. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dispatch Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“The fact that it worked and that people were responding to it is awesome. I hope other people learn from this. Just go fucking nuts if you can. I'm proud that we went as hard as we did and we took as big of a swing as we could. Whether it's an indie game with one developer or it's a larger studio, it's hard and it's a miracle when a game gets made every time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to catch IGN’s exclusive broadcast of the 29th Annual DICE Awards on Thursday, February 12 at 8pm PT. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Michael Peyton is the Senior Editorial Director of Events &amp; Entertainment at IGN, leading entertainment content and coverage of tentpole events including IGN Live, San Diego Comic Con, gamescom, and IGN Fan Fest.
