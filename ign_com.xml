            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dune-awakening"><u>Dune: Awakening</u></a> developer Funcom said it is aware that "players are reporting being cut out of the endgame due to the extremely competitive nature of the Deep Desert."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-developer-is-formulating-a-plan-to-improve-pvp-and-toxic-deep-desert-experiences"><u>Funcom assured players in an AMA it was already "formulating a plan" to improve PvP in the Deep Desert</u></a>, which players have previously branded as "toxic" due to griefing even after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-patches-out-orni-squishing-in-pvp-by-completely-removing-the-ability-to-damage-players-and-npcs-with-vehicles-and-not-all-fans-are-happy-about-it"><u>patching out the ability for players to squish other people with their Ornithopter</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>candid letter</u></a> from the creative director, Joel Bylos said: "So let me start by stating this unequivocally — we want PvE players to be able to play the endgame and have access to the content of the endgame. Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert — an endlessly renewing location that resets every week and creates an activity loop for great rewards. The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe, Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert. But as Stephen King says, 'Wish in one hand, sh*t in the other, see which one fills up first.' One of my hands is overflowing right now and sadly not with wishes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bylos admitted that the "extremely competitive nature" of the Deep Desert was forcing players to engage when they may prefer PvP, and consequently, some areas of the Deep Desert will now be flagged as "Partial Warfare (PvE)" where players can grab rare resources without getting ambushed. The largest spice fields, shipwrecks and Landsraad control points will remain "War of Assassins (PvP)" as "high reward, high risk" areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the whole game is balanced around guilds and groups, so if you prefer to be a lone wolf, you can expect it to be "grindy if [you] play solo."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Orni griefing? "Thopters will always be incredibly important for crossing the desert, but they shouldn’t also be the dominant force in actual battles," Bylos said, adding that the following will be implemented "shortly": </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Scout Ornithopters with rocket launchers attached will have their speed maneuverability reduced</li><li>Rockets fired from Scout Ornithopters will have increased heat generation</li><li>Thrusters will provide a max speed bonus regardless of wings, ensuring that thruster equipped scouts will be the fastest vehicles in the game </li><li>A new T5 infantry rocket launcher will be added to help improve the dynamics of vehicle/ground combat </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the Landsraad. Bylos defines it as "an umbrella for all endgame activities," such as dungeons, contracts, and "more specialized delivery tasks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As a system it is an activity driver that is designed to promote the conflict between the factions, internal politics between the guilds, while providing goal thresholds for individuals and groups to work towards getting personal rewards," the director explained. "And the Landsraad should be doing that for everyone who wants to participate in the elder game, be they PvEer or PvPer. The Landsraad should be giving you things to do every day and every week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s nothing new, from a design perspective, we’ve seen daily/weekly quest systems in games for a long time. Our approach was to try and frame this system around the greater politics of the Dune universe, by having players engage in activities to earn the votes of the various Landsraad houses." Consequently, Funcom will shortly be addressing "key flaws" in the Landsraad design, too, including stockpiling, which is currently rewarded but was not designed to be that way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Once a live game launches, it becomes a collaborative effort between the developers and the players to make it something amazing," Bylos concluded. "We appreciate your feedback on what we hope is the beginning of a long journey together. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Bear with us — our intention is to be clear and open in our communications and to make Dune: Awakening a game that everybody can enjoy."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-dev-working-on-pvp-and-deep-desert-issues-as-new-concurrent-user-peak-record-is-set"><u>Dune: Awakening a Great 8/10 in our review</u></a>, writing: "Dune: Awakening is an excellent survival MMO that captures Frank Herbet’s sci-fi world incredibly well, mostly to its advantage and occasionally to its detriment. The survival climb from dehydrated peasant to powerful warlord of Arrakis is a joy almost every step of the way, and the story and worldbuilding filled this nerd with absolute joy.

That's a good sign for anyone looking to pick up a few chase cards standalone rather than ripping open more packs than your bank account can handle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRB6b?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lightning, Army of One</a>, for example. Her Borderless variant was sitting around $90, but has now dropped to around $50. Will it climb again? It’s hard to say, but we’ll keep an eye on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/92x2ZE?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rhystic Study, dubbed ‘Stay with Me’</a> and featuring gorgeous full-art of Tidus and Yuna is also down to around $100, having been over $230 not long ago. It's one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-through-the-ages-most-expensive-cards">most popular cards from the "Through the Ages" collection</a>, so well worth keeping an eye on right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Borderless version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObj5n?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</a> is also down to around $50 now, a drop of around $60 from launch week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w6D5?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi is also still <strong>rising</strong> in value this week</a>, but it’s still a sharp drop from the $100 market demand last time we looked at him. He can be found for around $55-60 right now, so keep an eye on this one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z624d3?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sephiroth, Fallen Hero’s Extended Art version</a> has crash-landed from around $100 to just $7 since the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-selling-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">pre-release day pricing</a>, that's a big ol' drop, and a good example as why it's good to wait and see on how the market will fall post-release of a big set like this.</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">Magic: The Gathering - Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/climbers-june-23-mtg-3-1750680503265.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Wizards of the Coast / IGN</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As we covered recently, Final Fantasy’s cards have bizarrely given some syngizing Doctor Who cards a mega boost in value. For starters, Danny Pink’s ability to draw cards from counters makes him an ideal pickup for your Tidus Commander Deck, but the price has climbed steeply from <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAg8Jw?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$4 to over $12 already</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, Barbara Wright might not be the first card you think of when playing Final Fantasy cards, but her Read Ahead ability means she can manipulate Summons from the new set to get to the best effects more quickly. <a href="https://zdcs.link/a037rA?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">She’s still going for around $4</a>, so she isn’t as pricey as Danny, but she was a dollar not long ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Tidus synergy, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRn7RE?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tekuthal, Inquiry Dominus</a> is a Phyrexian Horror that, admittedly, wouldn’t look out of place in a Final Fantasy battle. He can double your proliferation of counters, which is ideal for Tidus’ deck. He’s gone from $6 not long ago to over $14 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from our Blitzball star, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w6D5?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi Ornitier</a> is getting plenty of love from players (I packed one myself, hooray!). One card that works well with him is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoGJjl?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Flame of Anor</a>, an instant with a trio of effects you can pick one of. If you control a Wizard (like our adorable friend), then you can pick two. It’s up to around $3, with the foil going for over $4. Not big numbers, sure, but not long ago it was a $2 card and it could climb yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever wanted to upset pals in a casual game of Commander, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWY6rx?object_uuid=fbfa278a-3e09-49ac-9b28-e9361fb86824&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mesmeric Orb</a> can pair nicely with either Final Fantasy’s The Water Crystal or if someone at your table is playing the Mothman Fallout deck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of those combos will get your friends milling themselves endlessly, while the latter can spread so many Rad counters that it could end up being the shortest game of Commander in history. Mesmeric Orb just hit $24 and could climb higher, a $7 increase week-on-week.</p><p id="sealed-sets"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Sets">MTG Sealed Sets</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything else Final Fantasy is pretty hot right now, so if you manage to find anything in stock, it might be worth picking up ASAP to avoid disapointment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more TCG discussion and market watch?
