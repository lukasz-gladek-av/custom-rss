            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As much as I love a good "heavy" game, one that fills my tabletop with decks of cards, a sprawling board, and colorful assortment of components, I also appreciate a small games that I can bust out at a moment's notice, that I can teach in just a minute or two, and have a great time with. The newest game in my collection that fits that role spectacularly is Flip 7, a card game we've featured as one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games"><u>best cheap games you can buy</u></a>. It was also nominated for the prestigious <a href="https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spiel des Jahres</a>, and won Board Game Geek’s Party Game of the Year during their <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3508413/19th-annual-golden-geek-winners-for-2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Geek Awards 2024</a>. It’s very good.</p><div catalogid="961f4751-8bef-40f8-8fd0-b1332007da05" id="218255"><div id="218255" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Flip 7</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Designed by Eric Olsen and published by the OP Games, Flip 7 at its core is a push-your-luck game where players race to be the first to reach 200 points by playing cards blindly from a deck of cards that range from 0 to 12. For all the numbered cards (except zero), each card has as many copies as its value – there's a single 1-value card, two 2s, etc. A player's turn immediately ends if they ever pull a duplicate value card, they choose to pass their turn and take the points they have earned in that round, or if they manage to flip seven value cards, which also earns the player bonus points. Rounds continue until one player has reached those 200 points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being a simple game, Flip 7 is visually striking with an Art Deco aesthetic and cards featuring bright colors and large numbers. Each number has its own color, with the modifier cards a bright honey-yellow that contrasts with the more tan-centric backgrounds of the number cards to avoid confusion. As a pleasant added touch, some of the frills and decorations on the cards connect seamlessly to one another, allowing you to create a lovely, rainbow-like collage of cards with each one you pull.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Flip 7 has such a low barrier of entry, really only requiring at least one of the players to be able to do simple math (even that you can mitigate somewhat thanks to the free tracking app), and with games only taking maybe 15 minutes, it makes it an easy recommendation for basically anyone. It’s a game that I could just as easily recommend for my friends I play heavy board games with, or my mom, who is more comfortable in the land of solitaire, and know that both audiences would have fun with it. The fact that this game scales up incredibly well, too, for parties is just an added cherry on top. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Flip 7 may be a bit of a turn off for some folks comes from the fact that this game is, at its core, a game of pure luck, with the only strategy coming from whether or not you'll risk drawing another card to try for more points. Ideally, I would have loved if there was a smidge of a hint of an element that lends itself to strategy in here. Flip 7 fills very much the same spot as, say, an UNO or Skip-Bo, simpler games that appeal to a far broader market – but in those games, players have more choices they can make, as opposed to Flip 7’s only real choices it provides players is to either to draw a card or not play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among my collection, I have a very elite selection of games, my Glove Box Collective. These are games I like to keep in my car’s glovebox so that I always have them on hand when I go places. These are games that I can bust out at a moment’s notice, when I have a few minutes to kill, when I’m meeting friends at a local brewery, or am simply visiting family. Flip 7, thanks largely to its quick-to-teach and easy-to-play nature, has earned its spot among this most prestigious collection of mine. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do wish that there was a bit more player choice involved but the tense “should I or shouldn’t I” nature of the game has led to some great moments of celebration where taking that risk has resulted in me winning a game, and those of frustration where I blew through all of my extra chance safety cards back-to-back only to still lose. But such is life in games of luck.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgZNG?object_uuid=2debdc3f-2f82-4286-a53c-3da72adc525b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aebrD5?object_uuid=2debdc3f-2f82-4286-a53c-3da72adc525b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 17, 2025 6:06 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Flip 7 is an easy recommendation regardless of your experience with card games, the size of your collection, or even your age. This is an excellent option for a stocking-stuffer around the holidays, a gift for a friend, or something to snag if you are planning a party with some friends.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/flip-7-card-game-review]]></content:encoded>

Current reigning champion Scott Riccardi just completed an insane 10-day streak on the beloved game show — and it turns out he’s an active Super Smash Bros. competitor online. Can we get a W in the chat for Scott, please?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riccardi has <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2025/07/16/nj-native-scott-riccardi-leads-jeopardy-winners-this-season/85243090007/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amassed a whopping $262,101</a> over the course of his streak so far, and it seems he isn’t showing any signs of hitting the breaks in the competition. He beat the record for the most wins in season 41 back on July 15 when he hit his 9-day streak, so he’s really giving his other competitors a run for their money at this point. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/s41-28659-riccardi-home-1752768694584.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Smash player Scott Riccardi is also smashing Jeopardy. Image credit: Jeopardy Productions Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for his Super Smash Bros. life, Riccardi is an active competitor and his most recent bout was posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGMPumDNGCc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on YouTube</a> — under his competitor name Biscotto — just four months ago. <a href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2025/jul/17/smash-bros-jeopardy-scott-riccardi/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eventhubs.com</u></a> noted he’s not “winning major tournaments per se” but that he is currently playing competitively. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly enough, Riccardi’s earnings so far <a href="https://liquipedia.net/smash/Portal:Statistics/Ultimate" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exceed the competition earnings</a> of Super Smash Bros. legend LG|MkLeo by $100,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to hitting day nine on Jeopardy, Riccardi beat out Laura Faddah, who was the reigning 8-day champ. Before that, three contestants were able to hit the six-day mark since the season began in September 2024. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, Riccardi is one of only 18 who have managed to make it 10 days on the iconic game show, but in order to make his mark on the all-time leaderboard, he has to hold on for at least another week. If he hits 17 days, he’ll knock contestant Ryan Long from the top 10 with 16 days, but that alone might prove difficult. Speaking of records, host Ken Jennings holds the No. 1 spot with a 74-game streak. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if Riccardi never meets the heights of Jennings, though, he’s still killing it — and there will be tons of time for Smash Bros. when it’s all over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Jeopardy! / </em><a href="https://youtu.be/7AckNaur4t4?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>YouTube</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lex Briscuso is a film and television critic and a freelance entertainment writer for IGN.
