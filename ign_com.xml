            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Like UFOs, ball lightning and bigfoot, one of the great mysteries of our time is that Superman is apparently Kryptonite to good videogames. There's yet to be a truly great Kal-El game in the vein of Batman: Arkham Asylum or Spider-Man, but as you can see from the list below, many have tried. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest developer to try is Epic Games, as the Man of Steel has landed as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-arrives-in-fortnite-battle-royale-during-star-wars-live-event-as-death-star-detonates-and-destruction-rains-down">Fortnite X Superman</a>, the latest crossover event for one of the world's biggest games. But what does his inclusion in Fortnite involve? Our list takes a look at that, as well as taking you through a history of Superman in pixels. Discover where you can find Superman as a hero, a playable guest character or just a cheeky Easter Egg in the words below. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Official Superman Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">These are "true" and "proper" Superman games, experiences where you embody the Man of Steel himself. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman (1978)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-1978-1752064304232.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This Atari 2600 release marks Superman's debut to gamers, all four kilobytes of him. It might not seem much to look at today, but won positive reviews for its action and graphics back in ye olde 1970s. In the role of Superman, players have to rebuild a bridge at the Metropolis waterfront damaged by Lex Luthor, capture your evil nemesis, and return to the Daily Planet as quickly as possible. Complicating things are the fact that Lois Lane has been kidnapped, Luthor has released Krytonite satellites that can deactivate your powers, and there are henchmen waiting to take you down. Using your powers, you can see beyond the area you're in with X-ray vision and then fly in to grab and drop Lex and his goons into jail. Just remember to use phone booths to change back into your Clark Kent clothes before stopping by the Daily Planet. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman (1987)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-1987-1752064384942.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Jump forward almost a decade and our favorite alien adoptee found his way to the NES, and got a cute 8-bit makeover in the process. For this outing Superman gets a bunch of abilities including super hearing, x-ray vision, heat vision, super spin, and not one but two types of super breath. He needs them to take on not just Lex Luthor but also Kryptonian bad guys Ursa, Non and General Zod. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman (1988)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-1988-1752064802318.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A year later, Superman leveled up for the Taito arcade game. Notable for having its own original villain Emperor Zaas, this time around Kal-El also got to use his fists, his feet and a Sonic Blast ability. A mix of sidescroller, action adventure and fighting game, it had a mixed reception, but snapping up one of these arcade machines today will set you back around $4,000. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman: The Man of Steel (1989)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-the-man-of-steel-1752064919125.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in 1989 on both the ZX Spectrum and Amiga, Superman: The Man of Steel was split into flying levels, a side scrolling beat ‘em up, and a vertical scrolling battle in battle in space. The story that linked those levels was told with cute comic book page panels. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Death and Return of Superman</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-death-and-return-1752065289255.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1994, a pre-Warcraft Blizzard Entertainment released The Death and Return of Superman, a beat ‘em up featuring five playable flavors of the Man of Steel; the vanilla original, Superboy, Steel, Cyborg Superman, the Eradicator. Doomsday is the opening act’s big bad, and bio-genetically engineered monster Clawster also makes an appearance. The action was focused on melee combat and airborne projectile attacks. Fun fact: one of the game’s artists and producers, Samwise Didier - who just retired in 2023 - was later responsible for the addition of the Pandaren race to World of Warcraft in 2010.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman 64</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-64-1752065562597.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Also known as Superman: The New Superman Adventure, this Nintendo 64 Supes game is infamous among retro gamers for its terrible execution. Created as a spin off from Superman: The Animated Series, it was the first time our blue boy scout has appeared in a 3D game, though he probably should have skipped the opportunity. It was called out for visual flaws like its Kryptonite fog (which crudely disguised a very short draw distance), terrible controls and a bizarre race mode.  IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/06/03/superman-2">reviewed it</a> in 1999, and we weren't fans. "With horrible control, unforgivable framerates and more bugs than can be counted, [developer] Titus should be absolutely ashamed of this awful game, and the company should be doubly ashamed for pissing all over such a beloved license," said our reviewer. "Do not buy this piece of garbage."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman: Shadow of Apokolips</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-countdown-to-apokolips-1752065647548.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Luckily Superman 64 wasn’t the end of the road for Kal-El’s adventures in video games, and the PlayStation 2/GameCube third person action game Shadow of Apokolips was better received than its predecessor. Its story saw Lex Luthor team up with Darkseid and the Intergang crime syndicate, and featured voice acting from Malcolm McDowell, Michael York and Lori Petty. "It's a thrill to finally play a Superman game that's handled with this much care and keen observation, with regard to control and special abilities," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/26/superman-shadow-of-apokolips-ps2-review">said our reviewer</a>, before branding it a "a slightly better-than-decent action game."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman: The Man of Steel</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-the-man-of-steel-1752065722366.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on the events of Superman: Y2K and featuring Brainiac 13, Xbox’s alternative to Shadow of Apokalips, released in the same year, was another disappointment for Superman fans. "Superman: The Man of Steel is, at the very best, a weekend rental. It'll take about 10 hours to complete, mainly because it's so impossible to beat the missions thanks to the controls," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/08/superman-the-man-of-steel-review">wrote IGN's reviewer</a>. "Someday someone is going to get Superman right and make a killer game. But not today."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Superman Returns</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/superman-returns-1752065805859.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">2006 was the last time Superman got to star in his very own game, but unfortunately it was a game where the final boss was a tornado, rather than an exciting supervillain. Very loosely based on the Bryan Singer movie, star Brandon Routh actually leant his voice to the game, although he "sounds about as interested in saving Metropolis as he is in deciding on a ripe melon at the market," according to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/28/superman-returns-review-2">IGN review</a>. "Punching out bad guys becomes about as fun as taking out the garbage, and the “epic” battle between Superman and the forces of evil is as simple and dull as a day of chores."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Super Playable Characters</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">These games are not <em>about</em> Superman, but they do <em>feature</em> Superman... and you can play as him, too. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Justice League Task Force</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/justice-league-task-force-1752065910131.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It's 1995. You've fired up your SNES, eaten your Honey Frosted Wheaties and your best friend is coming over to play your new fighting game. Justice League Task Force, developed by Blizzard Entertainment (wow, these guys sure loved DC before they got into orcs and elves) featured Superman alongside characters like The Flash, Wonder Woman, and Green Arrow battling mechanical clones of the DC heroes. Despite rocky reviews, the Justice League fighting series would get another three games, and Superman is a playable fighter in them all. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/mk-vs-dc-1752066011837.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In a world where Leatherface is a guest character in the Mortal Kombat series, a mash up between MK and a comic book universe looks positively tame. This 2008 crossing of the streams is the result of not just a canny guy in the licensing department at DC, but because Raiden and Superman accidentally create big bad Dark Kahn, who threatens both their universes. Superman has moves like Soaring Knockout, Ice Breath, and the Heroic Brutality finishers where he hammers his opponent into the ground like a rusty nail, or freezes them before shattering their bodies to pieces. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lego Batman 2: DC Superheroes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/lego-batman-2-1752066181998.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman gets a mention in the first Lego Batman game, but in Lego Batman 2, Lego Batman 3 and Lego DC Super-Villains he's a playable character. You get most brawn for your buck in the second Lego Batman game, where he's a big part of the story (and comes complete with his signature theme tune, taken from the classic Christopher Reeves films). He rescues the Dark Knight and Robin, takes on a large Joker robot, and helps his Bat Buddy defend Wayne Tower. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Injustice: Gods Among Us</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/injustice-1752066301942.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Superman appears on the roster of NetherRealm’s fighting game, Injustice, but as it's set in Earth-49 he's the spicy bad version, driven mad by the death of Lois Lane, and so gets to be a villain. He brings all the tricks you'd expect to the 1v1 matches; heat vision, Ground Tremor, and freezing Super Breath. His Super Move - the Kryptonian Smash - is brutal, he literally punches his opponent into space before punching them back down to Earth. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Injustice 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/injustice-2-1752066325552.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And Super(bad)man came back for the sequel, with a new Final Flight Super Move that again sees him punching his opponent upwards, this time giving them a few wallops in the sky before slamming them into the ground. You can also add Meteor Drop to that too, where you introduce your opponent to the wonders of geology at close quarters. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lego Dimensions</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/lego-dimensions-superman-1752066392988.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2015 game that used a Skylanders-style mix of real world figures and in-game content added the “Superman starring DC Comics fun pack” in 2016. By grabbing the Superman minifigure, players could get access to his Hoverpod and the DC Comics World in-game, opening up the glittering city of Metropolis. Admittedly, it’s a version of Metropolis that The Lord of the Rings villain Sauron has installed one of his creepy sky eyes into, but that’s about on par with the many other evils the city has had to contend with over the years.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MultiVersus</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/multiversus-superman-1752066523612.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. free to play fighting game MultiVersus was shut down just this year, but while it lived it was a fever dream where an eclectic mix of WB franchise characters faced off in platform-based, Super Smash-like combat. Superman was there along with his DC compadres Black Adam and Wonder Woman, but then so was Velma from Scooby-Doo, Gizmo from Gremlins, Arya Stark from Game of Thrones, Jake The Dog from Adventure Time, and Looney Tunes pin-up Lola Bunny. Oh, and you could dress them in skins, so Ugly Sweater Superman was a real thing that existed in the world for a short, beautiful time. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This category is for the games where there's the barest whiff of Superman spandex. Little details hidden in the game world, special skins, or if you're lucky, an evil cameo. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/scribblenauts-unmasked-superman-1752066652770.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This super cute 2013 spin off has you help Superman with a Lex Luthor problem and lets you summon him to help you in other battles, too. Using the right words you can call on a bunch of different Kal-El variants, from Cyborg Superman to Kingdom Come Superman, and you can even borrow a Superman costume to grant main character Maxwell heat vision and ice breath attacks. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">DC Universe Online</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/dc-universe-online-1752066785472.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The DC Comics MMO lets players create their own personalized brand of superhero (or supervillain) but Superman makes an appearance as a mentor for new superhero players, taking them through tutorial missions. He can also be found in the in-game Metropolis and appears as an ally to support players with his skillset. If you choose to be a villain you'll need to battle him as you level up. You can also try out a Superman avatar in the game's PvP mode, Legends. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Batman Arkham Knight </h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/arkham-knight-1752066855218.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While you won't catch a glimpse of the hench hero in Rocksteady’s fantastic Batman Arkham series, there are multiple references to him in the third game's world. There are posters for flights to Metropolis, a few LexCorp buildings dotted around Gotham City, and the NPC thugs seem to enjoy gossiping about Superman on the regular. They call him "that freak from Metropolis," and "the other guy in the cape" and speculate on his alter ego. ""Next thing you know, someone's gonna tell me Superman's really a janitor. Or no, a journalist." Oh, if they only knew.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/ss-superman-1752066974221.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Evil Superman makes a dramatic entrance in Rocksteady’s ill-fated 2024 follow up for the Arkham series, appearing just in time to grab a nuke, laugh maniacally, and take on the Suicide Squad in a boss fight. He delivers some pretty weak sauce villain banter until you can bring him down to Earth with Gold Kryptonite assisted violence. The poor guy doesn't even get to play the top boss in the game; that role is taken in the finale by one of many Brianiacs. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">LittleBigPlanet 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/lbp-superman-1752067193664.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A tiny Sackboy Superman skin and outfit based on the iconic hero, complete with adorable Superman forehead curl? Perfect. No notes. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Minecraft</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/minecraft-superman-1752067292896.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To celebrate the release of the new James Gunn Superman movie, Minecraft has added a bunch of free Superman skins, featuring Lois Lane, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, Mr. Terrific and of course, the old red cape and shiny suit. Previously, players could add some super to their world with the Superheroes Unlimited mod, which was first released in 2012. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fortnite</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/fortnite-superman-1752067417284.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Fortnite X Superman event, launched to coincide with the new James Gunn movie, adds a Kal-El themed battle pass that culminates in a skin based on David Corenswet’s version of the iconic superhero. There’s also an in-game item that will unlock Supes’ heroic abilities, allowing you to wipe the floor in a battle royale match. While this is the most prominent use of Superman in Fortnite to date, it’s not actually his first appearance: back in 2021, Chapter 2, Season 7 featured a Superman skin that had two styles; one featuring the suit and cape, and another that transformed you into the more civilian-looking Clark Kent, complete with glasses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blitz Royale, Fortnite's biggest new mode in years, just got a four-week extension — as speculation mounts over whether Epic Games will make its faster-paced battle royale offering a permanent addition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a just-posted in-game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> news update, as seen by IGN, developer Epic Games has confirmed "4 More Weeks of Blitz," beginning next week on July 15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was the date that the mode's current month-long roster of content had been set to end. Already, fans are celebrating that the mode isn't going anywhere — at least, not for few weeks. But will Blitz now become permanent? While no confirmation has yet been given, there are some promising signs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-has-a-hit-new-mode-and-for-once-the-games-main-battle-royale-option-is-no-longer-the-most-popular">Blitz Royale launched last month as a quickfire take on battle royale</a>, with matches designed to last just five minutes. Initially aimed at Fortnite's smartphone audience, the mode instead quickly found popularity across all platforms, and has since become the game's most-played experience — consistently beating even the main Battle Royale and Zero Build playlists in publicly-viewable player numbers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To a large degree, Blitz Royale has been a huge success for Epic Games, after a string of previously-released new modes that haven't captured the same audience as the game's core battle royale offerings. Surely, you would then think, Blitz Royale becoming permanent is a safe bet. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/09/ff315cfe-e252-4ae9-8ce5-2f8a0bbfd703-1752073265972.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite confirms more Blitz Royale is on the way. Image credit: Epic Games/IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are likely to be other considerations here — a need to keep the mode updated with content regularly enough that it never becomes stale, a need to balance development time with work on other modes, and, perhaps, a sense that the mode becoming permanent risks robbing it of some of its novelty. Consider the millions who originally tuned in when Fortnite ran its time-limited OG throwback season, compared to the (mere!) tens of thousands who play it today in its guise as a permanent mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In typically teasing fashion, Epic Games held a social media poll last week asking fans what they would most like to see within Blitz in the future. "We've seen a lot of 'make Blitz permanent'," Epic wrote, "but what should we change?" Options included new POIs, more collab items, new boons and powers, and "more Megalo Don plz," referencing the villain of Fortnite Chapter 5, and his Nitro fuel that enables Blitz players to run faster.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We've seen a lot of "make Blitz permanent", but what should we change?</p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1940848241895203051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The past three weeks have seen Blitz Royale revive classic weaponry and gameplay-changing modifiers from past Battle Royale seasons, and even previous collaboration items — such as the airbending powers of Avatar — across week-long sprints. Currently, the (now no longer final) Blitz week features items from the game's previous Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles crossover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no word yet on what Blitz will focus on for its second month in the game — but at least now players know it is sticking around a while longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been playing video games since about 1982, and Primal Planet stands out among the most charming I’ve ever encountered. While there’s not a lot about it that’s especially new, the components are so lovingly tuned and crafted that I could barely bring myself to stop playing. The designer injected Primal Planet with an inexhaustible reservoir of creativity, color, motion, and wonder, and the combination delivers an absolutely captivating play experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its charm starts with the hugs. I’ve been in love with superfluous embraces in games since the WayForward remake of A Boy and His Blob deployed a deeply rewarding hug button. With a tap, you could reach out as the Boy and squeeze your best friend the Blob to your heart’s content. The sweetness of the animation and sound design compelled me to hug my little extraterrestrial friend whenever he succeeded, and often to comfort him when he failed. Primal Planet operates from the same emotional playbook. It doesn’t give you much manual control over displays of affection, but works in plenty of opportunities to warmly embrace and interact with your wife, daughter, and the adorable Sino the Dino. It’s deeply committed to integrating utterly unnecessary but deeply rewarding moments of humanity, where your little pixel people feel truly human. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Primal Planet - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The caveman protagonist has a family of bot buddies accompanying him on his journey, and thankfully these AI companions are genuinely helpful. They follow you without getting lost and contribute meaningfully to combat. You can opt to carry your daughter or put her down for support, and your wife is a menace to enemies with her bow and arrow. They’re also deeply emotive characters, enough so that you get attached to them... an emotional hook that Primal Planet finds plenty of opportunities to exploit.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Yes, you can hug the dinosaur.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all my friends and family, I bonded most with Sino the Dino, a baby dinosaur that acted as a sort of friendly attack dog fighting alongside me. Some of that attachment is that Sino really is useful, and part of it is that the poor little guy is an orphan and I feel a bit responsible for him. I also love that unlike my caveman, Sino can eat small enemies to restore his health on the fly, making him remarkably durable. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The day and night cycles dynamically alter the visibility and danger in the sprawling world. Locales that at dawn are gorgeous vistas transform after dark into menacing hunting grounds. The backgrounds are absolutely crammed with visual splendor. Almost every pixel has a sense of motion to it, from blades of tall grass blowing in the wind to the gentle breathing of immense, sleeping dinosaurs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the dinosaurs: they’re undeniably awesome. Look, dinosaurs are simply the coolest creatures to ever walk this earth, and Primal Planet knows that, presenting these astronomical ancient avians with a Jurassic Park-like level of enthusiasm. The dinos are diverse in appearance and behavior, deeply colorful and behaviorally distinct. Compys scurry about like the little scavengers they are, raptors attack in packs and from hiding, and the big fellas are genuinely terrifying. The pixel art style and careful color choices richly infuse these colossal beasts with grandeur, beauty, and terror.    </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mechanically, Primal Planet is rock solid. It’s a side-scrolling Metroidvania that gets platforming, combat, and exploration right. The levels are artistically lush but also cunningly designed to hide (and tease) secrets, alternate paths, and environmental puzzles. Curiosity is always rewarded, sometimes with jarring (but terrific) surprises. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a world of quick death and constant twists and turns, but it doesn’t feel brutal or unfair, instead merely challenging. You’ve got a potent dodgeroll to keep you out of harm’s way, and your little dude is delightfully agile. Whether you’re battling dinos, rival tribes, or space aliens, encounters feel thoughtfully designed and balanced.   </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Primal Planet includes well-designed progression and crafting systems. XP gathered through battle and exploration fuels Skill Points, which in turn can be used to unlock double jumps, weapon proficiencies, and more. You share your Skill Point pool and XP with Sino, and can considerably upgrade his mobility and combat abilities as the game goes on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resources found can be crafted at bonfires into weapons, tools, and medicine. The resources are neither too abundant nor too scarce... distribution feels just right. And some items double as equipment. Craft a spear from flint and wood and you’ve got a decent melee and ranged weapon, but you can also toss it against walls and use it as a climbing platform, or dip it in a fire to create a torch useful for clearing thorns that block your path. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the campaign continues, you meet new allies that help you unlock more crafting abilities, allowing you to create potent traps and weapons to scale with the ever-escalating threats. Resource gathering never felt like a chore, but rather as a reward for exploring and following hunches to hidden areas where rare items and components waited to be found. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I feel like Primal Planet was designed especially for me. It combines several of my favorite reagents in gaming into one glorious magic potion. When I boot up Primal Planet I arrive at an intersection of prehistoric beasts, science fiction, excellent exploratory platforming, incredible art, a light progression system, and a dash of the feels. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The beating heart of Primal Planet is the incredible attention to detail and environmental storytelling.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The beating heart of Primal Planet is the incredible attention to detail and environmental storytelling. Show-don’t-tell is the name of the game in Primal Planet, and it’s splendidly executed. Whether it's UFOs beaming up dinosaurs in the background or your family stopping to create a cave painting together after a major story beat, Primal Planet just keeps intriguing and surprising. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though Primal Planet doesn’t really do anything revolutionary, I have rarely enjoyed a game more. Its creator seems to have surveyed the spectrum of components that make up a compelling video game adventure, and fine-tuned them into a deeply rewarding experience that evokes great Metroidvanias while feeling new and distinct. I absolutely cannot wait for the full release. Don’t sleep on Primal Planet. </p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p><em>Jared Petty really, really, really likes dinosaurs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> finally has a new update with much-needed performance improvements and tweaks to the difficulty settings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda said update 1.2 focuses on fixes for quests, gameplay, and performance, and includes new damage settings. 1.2 won’t roll out to all platforms just yet, Bethesda added, but it will be released today, July 9, on Steam Beta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A performance patch was much needed. Oblivion Remastered has enjoyed a hugely successful launch, with over 4 million players and a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam (although that's since fallen to 'mostly positive'). However, if there’s one issue that continues to crop up, it’s performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-revisited-profound-problems-have-yet-to-be-addressed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> found Oblivion Remastered on consoles to have significant problems across the board. DF’s Thomas Morgan said of Virtuos’ Unreal Engine 5 overhaul:</p><blockquote>No platform is spared of issues: whether it's PS5, PS5 Pro, or either Xbox Series machine, all struggle with traversal hitches while roaming the open world. Secondly, there's major sub-60fps frame-rates, where I've also discovered that performance slowly degrades with more playing time — quite possibly down to a memory leak. And finally, software freezes are the icing on the cake, with all PlayStation and Xbox platforms crashing to the system menu on loading a save one too many times.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">How does this manifest itself in-game? According to DF, a “charged” playthrough with more continuous play time behind it performs worse than a fresh boot. Cycling through saves also introduces bugs in the charged playthrough, Morgan revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And this is particularly curious: this also leads to the camera position being too high while riding horseback. You can fix this by resetting the game. The update 1.2 patch notes, below, include "Fixed player character height scaling," which may be a fix for this specific issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a dire position for any remaster to be in and developer Virtuos needs to address the game's stability - the crashes - as a priority,” DF continued. That’s a damning assessment of Oblivion on console, but what about PC? DF called PC performance “dire.” It’s worth checking out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-is-one-of-the-worst-performing-pc-games-weve-ever-tested" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DF’s analysis in full</u></a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>.
