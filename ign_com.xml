Until next Friday, July 25, you can grab every Borderlands game, as well as Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, for just $16. If you're unfamiliar with how Humble Bundle works, the more you pay, the more you get. So while $16 gets you all eight games, you can choose to pay less to get only some of the games on the list. Conversely, if you pay more than $16, not only do you get all of the games, but you also contribute to charity and video game publishers.</p><p id="borderlands-x-wonderlands-collection"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Borderlands x Wonderlands Collection">Borderlands x Wonderlands Collection at Humble Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="7da98a53-91b8-4423-94f8-77aa2bf9f45d" id="225456"><div id="225456" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands x Wonderlands Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle (a $279 value) includes all of the mainline Borderlands games, the VR version of Borderlands 2, the Telltale games, and more.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-board-game-review.1246698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war-themed board games</a>, Osprey Games’ Undaunted series is arguably one of the best in the current board game generation. These games' unique deck-building mechanics, mixed with historical theaters of war, including Normandy, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-stalingrad-board-game-review"><u>Stalingrad</u></a>, or North Africa, have helped grow its fanbase. And the release of last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-2200-callisto-board-game-review"><u>Undaunted 2200: Calisto</u></a> took the series from the fields of World War II and into space with a futuristic science fiction entry. Now, the team at Osprey has distilled the experience of the series into a solely deck-building experience with the release of Line of Fire: Burnt Moon. And they've done so with a surprising level of success.</p><div catalogid="57e7fdb8-1a14-4bf5-9012-6e9be9f29749" id="225455"><div id="225455" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Line of Fire: Burnt Moon: An Undaunted 2200 Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ditching the modular tiles or fold-out boards of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-board-game-buying-guide">Undaunted games</a>, Line of Fire gives two players a set of five identical location boards, each with an assigned point values. Once all five get randomly placed out for both players, each side deploys forces to the various spots in an effort to hold eight points' worth of locations, or destroy all of the oppositions land-capturing units, claiming victory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turns begin with both players drawing four cards, and secretly selecting one of those to offer up in a bid to gain that round’s initiative. Whoever offers the card with a higher value gets to play first. Both of those cards are then discarded and the first player takes their turn placing out their hands of cards, followed by the second player, and once they are finished, new hands are drawn and the the process starts over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set on Jupiter’s moon, Io, in the world of Undaunted 2200, Line of Fire has a science fiction motif. So, instead of troops on the ground, you deploy ROVs – Remote Operated Vehicles – into the warzones. ROVs are composed of four different varieties, divided into A and B forces. Each ROV type has special actions it can take. For example, the MOSS units allow you to capture locations, while the DaCU units can build fortifications that can only be activated by playing an identical unit card on a previously deployed card. Players also have access to a small selection on personnel cards which provide benefits including adding cards to your deck or disabling an opponents ROVs, further adding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> elements to Line of Fire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For players who are familiar with Osprey's Undaunted titles, many of Line of Fire’s mechanics will feel identical, from the initiative bidding to removing casualties. When a unit is destroy in Line of Fire, players first try to remove a copy of that card from their hand. If none are in their hand, they then search their discard, then their deck, then the reserve, and lastly remove the unit on the board that is being attacked. I personally love this approach, as I find searching for hold cards and seeing your supply slowly dwindling away to be far more of a tense experience than simply removing the card that was attacked. It's also through this method that if ever all of you or your opponent’s MOSS ROVs (the only unit type that can capture) are gone from the deployed regions, you lose. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the box’s small footprint, Line of Fire provides a riveting strategic experience in a fairly short time frame. The matches I played rarely took even a half hour to complete, with games taking even less time the more experience both players have, as you can quickly play your three cards and be done. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The matches I played rarely took even a half hour to complete.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with both choices of cards being identical, there is still a good bit of strategy required in Line of Fire. Knowing what cards to add to your deck, where to deploy them, and when to retreat when a battlefield is lost are all key decisions you have to make. Being a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building game</a>, there is still some aspect of luck involved, as the cards you have in hand dictate what actions you can take on your turn – but I never found that luck overpowered solid tactics and decision making. That said, I did find that some of Line’s design direction made it harder to get into than I feel it really needed to be, with much of that coming down to the card designs and naming. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admittedly, I have not yet played Undaunted 2200: Callisto, so this may be less of an issue for some folks, but the naming of the ROVs threw my friends for a loop and never made sense. Terms like “infantry”, “tank”, and “sniper” I can grasp at a glance, but if you were to ask someone which of “MOSS”, “TIR”, “xED”, or “DaCU” was your heavy artillery unit, they would probably look at you and walk away. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the random names and various symbols that make almost as little sense as the names, it just makes the cards harder to decipher than they need to be, even with the handy reference cards that both players have. I get that Line is set in the future and leans into the science fiction element, but sometimes it’s just easier to say “my tank is attacking your plane”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a visual and component standpoint, Line of Fire is a striking game, with artwork and designs that evoke classic science fiction book covers with blocky-square robots. Both players also have unique artwork for their units, that are also clearly denoted by heavy use of either redish-pink colors or blues for their respective side. This extends even into the storage solution with each player’s cards, fortifications and location tiles all fitting snuggly into a color-coordinated box, that both then are carried in a magnetically sealed box roughly the size of a VHS tape. I’m a sucker for games with good storage solutions, and Line of Fire’s does it’s job splendidly, making it quick and easy to set up and break down, and small enough to fit in your bag to take with you.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 17, 2025 7:34 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Line of Fire: Burnt Moon offers fans of both deck-building and strategy games a new game to add to their collections. It manages to bring much of the same tense tactical decision making of Osprey’s larger Undaunted series in a small box and only taking about a half hour to play. For those who enjoy playing games at their local coffee shop or brewery, or just likes to have a game or two with them when you have some downtime, Line of Fire may be worth checking out. I wouldn’t mind if Osprey releases official rules to allow for more players if you have multiple boxes, or a solo mode down the road. Regardless, Line of Fire: Burnt Moon has earned itself a place in my backpack, and wetted my appetite to dive into the Undaunted series proper.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/flip-7-card-game-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/flip-7-card-game-review.1246647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As much as I love a good "heavy" game, one that fills my tabletop with decks of cards, a sprawling board, and colorful assortment of components, I also appreciate a small games that I can bust out at a moment's notice, that I can teach in just a minute or two, and have a great time with. The newest game in my collection that fits that role spectacularly is Flip 7, a card game we've featured as one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games"><u>best cheap games you can buy</u></a>. It was also nominated for the prestigious <a href="https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spiel des Jahres</a>, and won Board Game Geek’s Party Game of the Year during their <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3508413/19th-annual-golden-geek-winners-for-2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Geek Awards 2024</a>. It’s very good.</p><div catalogid="961f4751-8bef-40f8-8fd0-b1332007da05" id="218255"><div id="218255" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Flip 7</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Designed by Eric Olsen and published by the OP Games, Flip 7 at its core is a push-your-luck game where players race to be the first to reach 200 points by playing cards blindly from a deck of cards that range from 0 to 12. For all the numbered cards (except zero), each card has as many copies as its value – there's a single 1-value card, two 2s, etc. A player's turn immediately ends if they ever pull a duplicate value card, they choose to pass their turn and take the points they have earned in that round, or if they manage to flip seven value cards, which also earns the player bonus points. Rounds continue until one player has reached those 200 points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being a simple game, Flip 7 is visually striking with an Art Deco aesthetic and cards featuring bright colors and large numbers. Each number has its own color, with the modifier cards a bright honey-yellow that contrasts with the more tan-centric backgrounds of the number cards to avoid confusion. As a pleasant added touch, some of the frills and decorations on the cards connect seamlessly to one another, allowing you to create a lovely, rainbow-like collage of cards with each one you pull.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Flip 7 has such a low barrier of entry, really only requiring at least one of the players to be able to do simple math (even that you can mitigate somewhat thanks to the free tracking app), and with games only taking maybe 15 minutes, it makes it an easy recommendation for basically anyone. It’s a game that I could just as easily recommend for my friends I play heavy board games with, or my mom, who is more comfortable in the land of solitaire, and know that both audiences would have fun with it. The fact that this game scales up incredibly well, too, for parties is just an added cherry on top. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Flip 7 may be a bit of a turn off for some folks comes from the fact that this game is, at its core, a game of pure luck, with the only strategy coming from whether or not you'll risk drawing another card to try for more points. Ideally, I would have loved if there was a smidge of a hint of an element that lends itself to strategy in here. Flip 7 fills very much the same spot as, say, an UNO or Skip-Bo, simpler games that appeal to a far broader market – but in those games, players have more choices they can make, as opposed to Flip 7’s only real choices it provides players is to either to draw a card or not play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among my collection, I have a very elite selection of games, my Glove Box Collective. These are games I like to keep in my car’s glovebox so that I always have them on hand when I go places. These are games that I can bust out at a moment’s notice, when I have a few minutes to kill, when I’m meeting friends at a local brewery, or am simply visiting family. Flip 7, thanks largely to its quick-to-teach and easy-to-play nature, has earned its spot among this most prestigious collection of mine. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do wish that there was a bit more player choice involved but the tense “should I or shouldn’t I” nature of the game has led to some great moments of celebration where taking that risk has resulted in me winning a game, and those of frustration where I blew through all of my extra chance safety cards back-to-back only to still lose. But such is life in games of luck.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgZNG?object_uuid=2debdc3f-2f82-4286-a53c-3da72adc525b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aebrD5?object_uuid=2debdc3f-2f82-4286-a53c-3da72adc525b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 17, 2025 6:06 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Flip 7 is an easy recommendation regardless of your experience with card games, the size of your collection, or even your age. This is an excellent option for a stocking-stuffer around the holidays, a gift for a friend, or something to snag if you are planning a party with some friends.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/flip-7-card-game-review]]></content:encoded>
