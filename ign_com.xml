He had served more than a decade at the company, and six years as Nintendo of America's final boss, following the departure of previous president Reggie Fils-Aimé. Bowser's time at the company was notable as he oversaw the success of Nintendo Switch and then the record-breaking launch of Switch 2, while gamely acknowledging all the jokes about his surname. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's former chief will be joined as a newly-installed member of the Hasbro board by Carla Vernón, CEO of The Honest Company.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/20/gettyimages-2218005352-1768920542806.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doug Bowser.

In addition, Satoru Shibata has joined NOA in the vacant role of CEO, while continuing his roles as Managing Executive Officer and Corporate Director, Member of the Board at Nintendo Co., Ltd.

He goes up against the monstrous Tyranids in a campaign that can be played with up to two friends. But there are a number of PvE and PvP modes to keep you busy after.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-reboot-concept-art-points-to-large-open-world</link>
            <guid>1410901</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Concept artwork for Microsoft's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable">Fable</a> reboot has been shared online, showing what looks to be a large open world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The images, originally highlighted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MP1st</a>, reportedly originate from an unnamed artist who previously worked on the project at British development studio Playground Games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than two dozen images show brooding fantasy landscapes that stretch off into the horizon, dilapidated thatched cottages in pastoral scenes, and familiar-looking towns with spired roofs. Several images also make reference to "Bloodstone" — suggesting we'll see locations from past Fable games return.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Fable | Concept Art<a href="https://t.co/OuQzqybQut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/OuQzqybQut</a> <a href="https://t.co/ci23N0n0xW" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ci23N0n0xW</a></p>— Klobrille (@klobrille) <a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/2013499425688039483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, the images offer a slightly darker color palette than seen in Lionhead's original Fable trilogy, with moody skies and a rugged world that's reminiscent of Hogwarts Legacy. How big is Fable's new world? That remains to be seen, though perhaps it featuring large open spaces shouldn't be too surprising, since it is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-is-being-developed-using-the-forza-engine">being built on the same open world engine that powers Forza Horizon</a> (albeit likely with fewer cars).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another set of art showcases a dank dungeon-like area, where water pours down through sewer-like tunnels as cages hang above. One particular image sees the hero confront a werewolf-like creature, as bodies hang in chains nearby.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While concept art naturally shows a work-in-progress look at a project, this werewolf encounter has popped up in a previous trailer. The hero figure used throughout the concept art also matches the character seen in trailers released over the last couple of years. The suggestion, then, is this vision of the game likely isn't too far off the finished article — though of course we'll be seeing much more of it later this week to find out for ourselves. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft's annual Xbox Developer Direct showcase will air this Thursday, January 22 at 10am PT, and include gameplay footage of Playground Games' long-awaited new take on Fable, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, Game Freak action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/beast-of-reincarnation">Beast of Reincarnation</a>, and more. You can watch it live here on IGN or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/ign" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN's YouTube channel</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
