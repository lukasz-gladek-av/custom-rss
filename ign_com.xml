            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Our first multiplayer product launch was technically successful."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Remedy Entertainment's CEO has resigned, leaving the new CEO of the developer of Control and Alan Wake to reassure investors after weak sales of FBC: Firebreak left the company significantly lowering its revenue expectations for the year and writing off the game's development costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its quarterly earnings report issued today, Remedy revealed that it recognized a €14.9 million ($17.4 million) impairment charge representing most of the development costs as well as purchased publishing and distribution rights for FBC: Firebreak.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In total, Remedy's revenue decreased 32% year-over-year, to €12.2 million ($14.2 million). Remedy says this was largely driven by lower development fees coming in than last year at this time, during which it received revenue from Annapurna related to development work it did on Control 2. Remedy also revealed that it was revising its revenue expectations for the year: while previously Remedy expected revenue and operating profit to increase year-over-year and be positive, it now expects revenue to increase, but its operating profit to decrease and be negative. No exact numbers were shared.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside this, CEO Tero Virtala has stepped down after nine years in the position. He is succeeded in the interim by board chairman Markus Mäki, who has stepped down from his chairman role and been replaced by Henri Österlund.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In comments by Mäki shared with investors, he stated that while Remedy would continue "working on features which enhance player value" and would keep true to its shared roadmap for Firebreak, the studio has moved development resources elsewhere going forward. Mäki also attempted to reassure investors that Firebreak was not a total loss:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have also found positive sides from FBC: Firebreak," he said. "Our first multiplayer product launch was technically successful in a cross-platform environment, and our publishing team has built capabilities which support the releases of our future self-published titles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FBC: Firebreak was Remedy's first ever self-published game, and while the studio claims it technically succeeded, it also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-admits-fbc-firebreak-underperformed-commercially-we-were-unsatisfied">admitted last quarter</a> that it "underperformed" on Steam and that the company was "unsatisfied" with its commercial reception. In today's earnings, Remedy stated that Breakpoint improved the game's sales only "marginally."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-review">gave FBC: Firebreak a 6/10</a>, saying that it was a "compelling co-op shooter that, despite its good looks, doesn't have the depth to keep things interesting long-term."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“This is not why I bought Battlefield 6.”</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA just introduced its new, destructive take on battle royale with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-redsec">Battlefield REDSEC</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> base game players are already slamming it with “Mostly Negative” Steam reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PC users who head to Steam to check out the standalone Battlefield experience, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-launches-alongside-battlefield-6-season-1-with-battle-royale-gauntlet-and-portal-modes-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">launched across PC and consoles for free yesterday</a>, will be met with a flood of negative <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3028330/Battlefield_REDSEC/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam reviews</a> across the board. At the time of this piece’s publication, just 35% of REDSEC Steam user reviews were positive, with positive reviews in all languages fairing just slightly better at 39%. Both measurements result in a dark red, Mostly Negative label.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A wave of negativity for Battlefield’s latest crack at battle royale arrives as Battlefield 6 players continue to express their dissatisfaction with the premium experience. Calls for changes to the base game reached a boiling point with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-trailer-highlights-blackwell-fields-and-eastwood-maps-ahead-of-next-weeks-launch">the launch of Season 1</a> yesterday, and now, criticism is spilling into REDSEC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Battlefield 6 and REDSEC exist as separate multiplayer offerings, both EA and Battlefield Studios games share unlocks tied to many challenges, cosmetics, and battle pass unlocks. Where this has evolved into a problem is how one experience might affect another, with many Battlefield 6 players complaining of weekly challenges that require them to play battle royale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I wouldn't hate it so much if I wasn't forced to play it for challenges in the main game,” one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/SirDoombox/recommended/3028330/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>negative Battlefield REDSEC Steam review</u></a> says. “But I am. So I do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is not why I bought Battlefield 6,” they add.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Oh, but you just can reroll the challenges!" another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197986653939/recommended/3028330/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">negative review</a> says. "Yeah and 3 of them are sill for the BR because they are pushing it hard on people that would not touch it even once..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other PC players agree that challenges granting large amounts of Battlefield 6 battle pass XP shouldn’t be tied to another experience, but dissonance isn’t the only thing tanking REDSEC Steam reviews. Some base game players are using Valve’s digital storefront to air out grievances related to multiplayer map sizes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield REDSEC Launch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Early Battlefield 6 adopters have called for larger multiplayer maps as far back as the August beta tests, with the October 10 launch only adding fuel to the fire, as launch locations failed to live up to expectations for the community. At least a few negative Steam reviews even praise REDSEC’s exclusive battle royale map, Fort Lyndon, with their frustrations mostly summed up with one question: Why does the free-to-play game get the map sizes that premium players are asking for?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oh wow a nice big map with lots of POIs and flanks,” another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/idiedonetime/recommended/3028330/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>negative REDSEC review</u></a> says. “If only we could get something like this for the main game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's trying to be too much all at once,” another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/JC_3223/recommended/3028330/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam user review</u></a> adds. “The map in this Battle Royale is so good it's criminal that it's not being used for Conquest right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Battlefield 6 players aim to leave their mark with REDSEC Steam reviews, there are plenty of comments actually related to the new standalone experience itself, too. Many are positive, applauding how BF Studios blends classic Battlefield mechanics with other popular battle royale experiences, like Call of Duty: Warzone. Launch also ushered in a spike in activity, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steamdb</u></a> recording a 24-hour peak of 549,766 Battlefield 6 players yesterday.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">REDSEC, which encompasses Gauntlet and Portals modes in addition to its battle royale mode, is getting love in the Battlefield community, but there is still a general feeling that the experience is incomplete. Specifically, it’s the lack of a solo queue option and battle royale fatigue that many are calling out – both in negative and positive reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No solo Mode... When will they learn the overwhelming majority of players play solo?” one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/koiruus/recommended/3028330/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>negative review</u></a> asks. “It doesn't feel good to play with randoms against premade coordinated squads.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fun update, the battle pass is not half bad,” a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZedAway/recommended/3028330/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>positive review</u></a> adds. “Only problem with me is not having a solo battle royal mode.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">REDSEC is just 24 hours into its time in the public’s hands. Seasonal updates will continue to offer shared experiences between REDSEC and Battlefield 6. Season 1 launched yesterday, introducing the new Blackwell Fields map for multiplayer, with more mid-season maps and guns set to follow in November and December.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-recently-patched-conquest-mode-to-make-the-matches-shorter-the-community-complained-and-now-the-developers-have-reversed-the-decision">addressed fan feedback</a> in the past, with the latest update <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-won-battlefield-6-fans-rejoice-as-ea-tones-down-bright-colors-on-monster-energy-skin">introducing fixes for a controversial green skin</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/flashbang-battlefield-6-lighting-is-so-bright-that-players-feel-like-they-have-to-fight-the-sun">some of the bothersome lighting effects</a> that have distracted players since launch.
