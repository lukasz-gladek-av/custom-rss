Many fans blamed the uneven final season on the series' creators running out of book material to adapt, while others have suggested the series simply tried to do too much in too few episodes. Regardless, it has become a model that other series, clearly, do not want to follow.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think everyone was pretty worried, honestly," Wolfhard said.  "The way that Game of Thrones got torn to shreds in that final season, we're all walking into this going, 'We hope to not have that kind of thing happen.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not that Wolfhard is suggesting Stranger Things will wrap up its own run with a similarly polarizing finale — far from it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Then we read the scripts," Wolfhard continued, saying that the show's cast now felt reassured. "We knew that it was something special."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Stranger Things: Everything We Know About the Upside Down</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stranger Things' fifth and final season will launch on Netflix with four episodes on November 26, before a further three episodes arrive on Christmas Day, December 25. The series' feature-length finale will then release on New Year's Eve, December 31, wrapping up the show's supernatural saga after almost a decade. No pressure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After all that, will this really be the end of Stranger Things? Of course not. Netflix already has plans for animated series and at least one spinoff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, fans learned that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-we-have-to-now-stranger-things-season-5-will-finally-explain-the-series-biggest-mystery-showrunners-confirm">Stranger Things' final episodes will wrap up one long-standing mystery</a> around the series — what the Upside Down actually <em>is</em>.

As initial steps, we are working on the following changes to progression and how it feels as you play:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The XP gained from match completion and the daily bonus are being increased by 10% and 40% respectively.</li><li>The XP needed to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks is being reduced, so you’ll start earning useful attachments almost twice as fast.</li><li>Please Note: For weapons that are already being progressed, the UI might display something abnormal at first, but this should resolve itself once a match is played while using that weapon.</li><li>The assignments that required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 to begin will now require career ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively.</li><li>While this allows these assignments to be started sooner, we are aware of the frustrations regarding the challenges themselves and are actively working on reviewing them, but it will take more time to develop, test, and implement these changes.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield Studios said its goal is to make the progression experience “feel smoother and more rewarding while still keeping that sense of achievement when you complete a milestone like fully mastering a weapon.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer then went on to address “community experiences.” This relates to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-xp-farming-via-portal-lobbies-explodes-as-players-complain-of-sluggish-progression-system">Battlefield 6 players farming XP via Portal lobbies</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Over the past week, many of you noticed that we reached maximum capacity on community servers,” Battlefield Studios said. “After reviewing the data, we found that a large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots. We completely understand the motivation behind this, like faster progression and a way to test setups without pressure, but it’s led to some unintended side effects. With so many servers focused on farming XP rather than active play, it’s become noticeably harder for players to create and find experiences to play with other people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Experiences in the Community section is a key part of what makes Battlefield 6 special. It’s meant to be a space for creativity, experimentation, and connection, where you can easily find and enjoy great modes with your friends and squadmates. Our goal moving forward here is to reinforce the player-driven experiences that bring people together, while still keeping room for custom setups, creativity, and new ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are developing adjustments that are intended to diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences. Implementing this will require some maintenance on the backend. After the update is live, we expect all experiences, both custom and verified, will need to be republished by players before they can create an active server."</p><div id="every-battlefield-game-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Battlefield game, ranked.</h3><h3>Every Battlefield game, ranked.</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Battlefield Studios said more updates are coming within the next week, maybe even sooner.

Instead, it stated that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embattled-ubisoft-forms-subsidiary-for-ips-like-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-with-the-help-of-116-billion-tencent-investment">Vantage Studios, the new Tencent-backed business unit overseeing Assassin's Creed</a>, needed a leadership team "aligned" with its core goals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN previously reported that Côté was offered, but declined, another role within Vantage Studios' leadership, something Côté's new statement also mentions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave Assassin’s Creed after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it," Côté wrote last night. "The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ubisoft decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise to someone closer to its new organizational structure. A different position was mentioned, but it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work I had been entrusted with in recent years.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/gettyimages-2205394104-1760694391243.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Marc-Alexis Coté.

"Ubisoft has been my home for all my professional life, and I will always be grateful for the people, the projects, and the belief that together we could create worlds that inspire millions. But I also owe it to my teams, past and present, to say this plainly: I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As someone who grew up inspired by Star Trek (TNG!), in the later years of my career I came to see myself as the captain of the Assassin's Creed ship, someone who leaves only once every soul on board is safe. And that is exactly what I have done for as long as I could."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Côté joined Ubisoft in 2005 as a software engineer, and began working on Assassin's Creed series in time for Brotherhood. Subsequent projects saw Côté take on increasingly senior roles for Assassin's Creed 3, Black Flag DLC Freedom Cry, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, and then Assassin's Creed Odyssey, for which he served as senior producer.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In March 2022, as Ubisoft sought to re-establish the series under a more singular vision, Côté stepped up to lead overall development. It was Côté who laid out plans for a string of Assassin's Creed projects (including Shadows, the upcoming witchcraft-focused Assassin's Creed Hexe and a fresh multiplayer project), and Côté who spoke out last December to defend the series and its developers amid a firestorm of discourse surrounding Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is expected to hire a new Assassin's Creed franchise boss in the coming months, ahead of a busy 2026 filled with further additions to Shadows, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stop-removing-the-modern-day-assassins-creed-fans-react-as-black-flag-remake-reportedly-cuts-everything-outside-the-animus">highly-anticipated reveal of a Black Flag remake</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Andrej Ivanov/AFP via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> releasing today for Nintendo Switch 1 and 2, excitement has been building among Pokémon fans on social media. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends: Z-A is taking us back to a revamped Lumiose City. Of course, you can catch Pokémon, battle them and do quests, but there’s also time for relaxing. One aspect of the game that some Japanese fans have been getting excited about is simply chilling with your Pokémon outside an in-game cafe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">YouTuber and blogger Koiwa Hawawa posted on Twitter / X: “What I’m most looking forward to in Z-A is having tea with Pokémon. But could it be that your Pokémon is just staring at the desserts? Is there anything more cruel?”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ZAで一番楽しみにしているのがポケモンとお茶することなんだけど<br>もしかしてポケモンはただお菓子を眺めているだけ？🥺<br>そんな酷いことある？ <a href="https://t.co/cHq5AplYtF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/cHq5AplYtF</a></p>— 小岩井はわわ (@chandelure115) <a href="https://twitter.com/chandelure115/status/1977699248234774685?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">What Hawawa noticed is that while the trainer relaxes over a cuppa and cake, their Pokémon just sits on the other chair with nothing on the table in front of it. As evidence of possible Pokémon cruelty, Hawawa posted screenshots. The last image highlights Totodile, whose wide eyes and open mouth make him look like he is salivating at the thought of some sweet treats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This post quickly attracted views (1.3 million at the time of this article's publication) and comments from other users, with many questioning whether or not Pokémon can eat sweets meant for humans without getting <a href="https://x.com/Holstein1382/status/1977994594228015224" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>some serious indigestion</u></a>. However, as many pointed out, Pokémon have a history of eating <a href="https://x.com/dragoodin12/status/1977942828396495096" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>all sorts of things</u></a>, even curry and sandwiches (in Generations VIII and IX respectively). One user even posted <a href="https://x.com/MfmmKPcPlp19684/status/1977972421962707411" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an image</u></a> of Meowth and Rocket Team members stuffing themselves with ramen.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ロケット団は一緒にラーメン食べてるのに！ <a href="https://t.co/iTV6ul0CCk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/iTV6ul0CCk</a> <a href="https://t.co/7xpbQFrvM3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7xpbQFrvM3</a></p>— プルプルマン (@MfmmKPcPlp19684) <a href="https://twitter.com/MfmmKPcPlp19684/status/1977972421962707411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">One thing fans were in agreement with was that the Pokémon should also be snacking on something alongside their trainer. “Whether it's a Poké Block, Poké Puff or Poffin, just give it something delicious,” one <a href="https://x.com/yana_piyo/status/1977968594396008456" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user</u></a> implored. Another added: “The only food on the table is the protagonist’s, so for me that’s a bit of a negative.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But maybe the Pokémon are content with just watching you eat? Discovered cafes in Legends: Z-A serve as fast travel points, and visiting them has several benefits. Firstly, sitting with a particular Pokémon strengthens your bond, which could be helpful for evolving them later on. Plus, buying drinks at a cafe restores your entire party’s health and removes status effects, so maybe your Totodile is sneaking a sip when you are not looking? </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have already picked up Pokémon Legends Z-A and are wondering which initial Pokémon to pick, see our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/pokemon-legends-z-a-which-starter-should-you-choose"><u>tips for choosing from the game’s three starters</u></a>.

It’s an issue affecting every class from Engineers to Recon, especially when exiting a building or, even worse, aiming down sights (ADS) while looking outside from the inside of a structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's my main issue right now,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o40tn9/comment/nizcris/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one Reddit user commented</u></a>. “It actually gives me a headache.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Footage of the issues plaguing Battlefield 6 players is hard to ignore, and we here at IGN have experienced them, too. Simply walking around on outdoor maps rarely presents any issues, but the instant you try to leave a building, nearly the entire screen turns white from the sheer power of the sun. It’s the kind of thing that would be annoying for any game, much less a relatively competitive military shooter where every bullet counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear if bright lights in Battlefield 6 affect more players on PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox, or if the issue is present across all versions of the game. While few have tried to argue the bright light adjustment effects are realistic and should stay, the vast majority of players seem to disagree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I got people sledge hammering drones riding up to the sky hitting 500m shots but my operator forgot sun protective glasses? The harshness and lighting imbalance from indoors to out is horrific,” content creator and 100 Thieves founder <a href="https://x.com/Nadeshot/status/1978234377222971617" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Matthew “Nadeshot” Haag said in a post</u></a>. “This realism argument is out of control.

More information for fixes in this regard are said to arrive “in the near future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until an official fix arrives, players are left to fend for themselves as Battlefield 6’s sun launches its attacks anytime they leave a building, which, of course, is quite often. In the meantime, some believe they’ve found a Band-Aid solution that might make ADS more manageable – no sunglasses required.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Battlefield 6 sun glare tip:</p><p>If you are experiencing the awful glare from the sky and looking out at the distance from inside a building. Turning on HDR on my monitor and in windows (HDR 1000 to be exact) completely eliminated all glare.</p></div>— MurkTweaks (@MurkFPSHub) <a href="https://twitter.com/MurkFPSHub/status/1977843866867802421?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It appears there’s no one-size-fits-all fix, but some players recommend toggling HDR on or off depending on your monitor of choice. There’s also a World Brightness setting in-game, set at 50 by default, which can be tweaked. Here’s your warning, though, that turning this notch down too far may have the opposite effect, leaving a player with environments that are too dark. Others report altering other graphics settings, such as Performance Preset modes on consoles, has helped, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, these aren’t sure-fire fixes and could change depending on each player's setup, but it’s at least something to try while EA and BF Studios work on a more official, permanent solution.
