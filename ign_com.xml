Times are tough all over - Let's find these incredible people new jobs, because we all need to eat, right? :D”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video game development community reacted with a mix of shock and anger to the cuts, given Marvel Rivals’ explosive success. The free-to-play hero shooter has seen over 20 million downloads since launch in December, and huge peak concurrent player numbers on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Sasser’s LinkedIn profile, his team focused on game and level design work for Marvel Rivals, “offering guidance, strategy, and design direction over the last couple of years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase issued IGN a statement confirming the layoffs, but failed to specify how many people were cut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We recently made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game," NetEase said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those affected and will be treating them confidentially and respectfully with recognition for their individual contributions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But NetEase was keen to stress that the layoffs won’t impact ongoing support for Marvel Rivals, whose primary development team is based in China.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to reassure our fanbase that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which continues to be led by Lead Producer Weicong Wu and Game Creative Director Guangyun Chen in Guangzhou, China, remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience,” NetEase continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game. We’re excited to deliver new super hero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live service experience for our worldwide player base.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the latest round of layoffs at NetEase, which has pulled back from a number of overseas investments and closed studios in the U.S. and Japan, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/visions-of-mana-dev-reportedly-being-shut-down-by-netease">Visions of Mana developer Ouka Studios</a>. In November, Worlds Untold, headed by Mass Effect alumni Mac Walters, announced a pause of operations after a split with publisher NetEase. And in January it cut Jar of Sparks, founded by Halo and Destiny 2 veteran Jerry Hook in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

And while you might think a group of three players would pose a challenge for board game night, you'd be wrong. Three is actually the perfect number for many games. It allows for more interesting dynamics than strictly two-player, and it affords a quick tempo with little downtime between turns. In many ways, it’s the best qualities of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two player</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four player format</a> merged together.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR: The Best 3-Player Board Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The challenge is in finding the right games. That’s why we’re here with this list offering a series of titles that provide an exceptional experience at the three-player count. No need to fret when your fourth cancels as game night can still be salvaged. Or if everyone brings a date, explore the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">best 6-player games</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Contributions by </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/samanthanelson"><em>Samantha Nelson</em></a><em> and </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/ctheel"><em>Charlie Theel</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="clankcatacombs">Clank!

Catacombs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clank-board-game-buying-guide">games in the Clank! series</a> are dungeon-crawlers where you move through the maze using a deck of cards that you build and expand as you play, giving you an extra degree of strategic control. That’s fun enough, but if you move too fast you also add noise cubes to a bag, making it more and more likely that it’ll be you who wakes a sleeping dragon and suffers its wrath, adding a great element of tension to ever step. And that’s fun enough, but Catacombs ups the ante by having a modular map for maximum variety and a real feeling of exploration. All of them work well with three: two players feels like too much of a head to head, and four takes a little too long. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like the style of this game, we also recommend you check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">best dungeon-crawler board games</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215446"><div id="215446" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">An odd but brilliant civilization game without a map, this sees you shepherding your nascent culture from its roots in the Bronze Age all the way up the technology tree to the present day. All the resource management and population pleasing you’ve come to expect from the genre is there, enlivened by a tense conveyor belt of upcoming upgrade cards that you’re always tempted to overpay for in order to snaffle them before your opponents. There are also plenty of military engagements that face off one player’s forces directly against another, and the lack of a map not only makes these fast and easy to resolve but prevents dogpiling, ensuring that it’s a great game for three, staying a well-balanced test of tactical and strategic decision making.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Star Wars: Outer Rim</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215447"><div id="215447" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: Outer Rim</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From its weird crescent-shaped board to its striking art, you know that this is going to be a great re-creation of the Star Wars universe. Each player steps into the shoes of a galactic ne’er-do-well trying to make a name for themselves by trading, hunting and smuggling through the systems of the rim. You’ll gain skills, upgrade your ship and, likely as not, run into some famous faces from the franchise during your epic escapade to become (in)famous across the wider galaxy. It plays perfectly with three, giving you enough interaction to enrich your shared adventure, but not dragging this admittedly random and narrative-rich game past its welcome point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are interested in more from the franchise, there are actually quite a few <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">great Star Wars board games we recommend</a> outside of this one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="gloomhaven">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215448"><div id="215448" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Gloomhaven has really created a stir the last several years.

This fantasy adventure game has players cooperating to work through dungeons and defeat an array of enemies. Each character possesses a unique deck with a distinct playstyle. Players must leverage each character’s strengths and manage their hand of cards to optimize each action and defeat each challenge put before them. This is a campaign game that requires a lengthy commitment, but the achievement and rewards are much sweeter when experienced with a couple of friends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gloomhaven is currently at the top of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-board-games">our list of the best RPG board games</a> you can play right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="dune-imperium">Dune Imperium: Uprising</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215449"><div id="215449" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dune: Imperium - Uprising</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Many leaving the theater after seeing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-part-two-review-timothee-chalamet-zendaya-denis-villeneuve">Dune 2</a> will want more. We are fortunate that one of the most beloved board games of the past few years is set in this universe. This game has players balancing military strength with political power by building a personal deck of cards from a public market. You must also acquire resources and build alliances by placing your workers on a myriad of spaces on the board. Both of these systems combine to create a powerful game loop of improving your engine to yield greater rewards. The payout is tremendous in this nuanced game that rewards strategic play and deeper exploration. Three players works wonderfully as it creates just the right amount of competition over spaces on the board and forces you to adapt to an ever-changing landscape.

The birds come to life with over 170 beautiful illustrations alongside delightful components such as small eggs and attractive resource tokens. Each bird offers a unique ability which interfaces with the rest of your sanctuary to create an emerging combination of effects. This is a very inviting and warm game visually, but it also has some heft to it as a game, offering a satisfying strategic foundation for players to repeatedly return to. Three players is the ideal count, as it creates some healthy competition by pushing each other to thoughtfully expand your group of birds without hurting the tempo of play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about this board game, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review">my hands-on review of Wingspan</a> as well as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wyrmspan-board-game-review">dragon-themed Wyrmspan spin-off</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="anachrony">Anachrony</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215451"><div id="215451" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anachrony: Essential Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">An asteroid is going to hit the Earth and you have a limited amount of time to prepare to save humanity – but you want to be the one who’s in charge when the dust settles. The complex game lets you gather resources by deploying workers with their own abilities, including some that will be piloting mechs. You can also speed up your progress by using Time Rifts to grab resources from the future so long as you pay them back before time anomalies form. With many paths to victory and different factions to try, there’s plenty of replayability.

Each player is working to form the most beautiful mosaic by drafting tiles from the central market to place on their board, scoring points based on how many you can connect. Full rows, columns and sets of the same type of tile earn big bonus rewards. The beautifully detailed pieces are satisfying to play with as you slide them into place, carefully considering the best move of the moment but also what other players are likely to pick so you don’t lose points from getting stuck with tiles you can’t use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about the game, check out my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/azul-board-game-review">hands-on review of Azul</a>. There are also quite a few <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/azul-board-game-buying-guide">versions and expansion for Azul</a> worth a look.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="cascadia">Cascadia</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215453"><div id="215453" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cascadia</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This soothing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games"><u>family board game</u></a> challenges players to build a thriving ecosystem based on the Pacific Northwest. Each session is different thanks to the variety of scoring goals, which reward points based on the relative placement of animal tokens. In one game you may try to ensure red tailed hawks are flying solo and in another that they have an unobstructed view to their potential mate. The tiles you draft not only represent where each type of animal can live but different terrain types, and building unbroken expanses of mountains, wetlands and forests can be worth just as much points at the end of the game as having the right animal patterns. Add in pinecones that can be used to mix up the token and tile pairs during drafting and you’ll have plenty to think about each turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about this game, make sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cascadia-board-game-review">my Cascadia board game review</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="cthulhu">Cthulhu: Death May Die</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215454"><div id="215454" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cthulhu: Death May Die</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most games based on Lovecraftian horror are about preventing Elder Gods from setting foot on Earth, but it’s already too late for that in Cthulhu: Death May Die. Instead your goal is to arm yourself well enough to be able to shoot the monster in the face. There’s a high level of replayability to the cooperative game thanks to the variety of investigators players can control and the threats of the different Elder Gods and their minions, who are represented through impressively detailed miniatures. Three players gives you a nice variety of character archetypes without making the game take too long, which can happen when there are five people choosing the best way to take their actions. You still need to be careful though, since the game ends if a single investigator is eliminated before the Elder is summoned.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="waterdeep">Lords of Waterdeep</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215455"><div id="215455" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lords of Waterdeep</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Lords of Waterdeep provides an excellent introduction to the worker placement genre and is especially fun for D&amp;D players who will recognize the references to the Forgotten Realms. Players take on the roles of secret Lords of Waterdeep, each with their own strengths, and will try to establish influence over the City of Splendors by recruiting various types of adventurers to send on quests. Some quests provide powerful boosts that will make it easier for you to gain more resources throughout the game while others are worth a huge amount of points, so you’ll have to think carefully about your priorities as the rounds progress. Players can also build new locations on the map that they can use themselves and they’ll rake in rewards when a rival takes advantage of them. If you prefer a more competitive experience or want to play with a bigger group, pick up the <a href="https://zdcs.link/0bZ55?object_uuid=7bc1a34d-8d2b-472d-b9fc-2e229e140ff2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Scoundrels of Skullport</u></a> expansion.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="lost-ruins">Lost Ruins of Arnak</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215456"><div id="215456" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lost Ruins of Arnak</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fusing worker placement and deckbuilding, Lost Ruins of Arnak tasks each player with learning the secrets of a mysterious island. There are so many ways to earn points that it’s a real challenge to figure out which is best to pursue, especially since you’re directly competing with your opponents to be the first to nab bigger rewards. You can focus on exploring new areas and fighting fearsome guardians, conduct research, try to improve your deck, or recruit assistants that will make your work easier. The game board is tailored based on the number of players so it’s as well balanced for three as it is for two or four. There’s a solo variant if you want to play alone or are looking for a good way to practice strategies.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="raiders">Raiders of the North Sea</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215457"><div id="215457" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Raiders of the North Sea</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Be a Viking with this worker placement game, where you’ll need to put together a crew and gather enough resources to successfully raid increasingly well-protected settlements. You’ll collect silver to hire crew members, who will help determine your strategy since they can give you bonuses when attacking specific targets. They can also die and become Valkyrie that will earn points you need to win. You also have to take the time to convert your plunder into offerings for the chieftain, though the amount of favor you’ve earned is kept a secret until the end of the game. Choose your actions wisely as the game can end quickly as players rush to make offerings and launch their boats deeper into the territories at the bottom of the board.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="splendor">Splendor</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215458"><div id="215458" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Splendor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This fast game is easy enough for kids to learn but satisfying for players of all ages, making it a good <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">board game for families</a>. Compete to build a thriving jewelry business by gathering gem tokens which can be used to purchase developments and win the favor of nobles. You’ll want to try to take actions as efficiently as possible, keeping track of what resources your opponents are gathering and when they are likely to purchase a development so you don’t miss the opportunity or get stuck waiting for them to stop hoarding a key resource. You also should plan long term, looking at the bonus gems needed to attract each noble since you can only pick up one per turn and their high point values can be the difference between winning or losing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="viticulture">Viticulture</h2></div><div catalogid="2b626ccd-e241-48af-adbb-5e28cf9d4d99" id="215459"><div id="215459" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Viticulture</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve inherited an unimpressive Tuscan vineyard and you have to build it up into something to be proud of in this charming strategic game that takes place over a series of seasons. In summer you’ll deploy workers to plant vines, build structures and sell grapes, while in winter you’ll harvest crops and start aging your wines. You can develop more complex and valuable varieties based on the types of grapes you grow and how much work you’ve done in your cellar, which you can then use to fulfill orders and earn more money to make additional improvements to the vineyard. Pop open a bottle of wine and settle in to learn a bit about how it’s produced as you play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.
