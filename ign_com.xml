It’s a message that thanks fans for trying out Pokémon TCG Pocket since its launch a few weeks ago, and more importantly, it tells players what they can expect if they stick around. Update plans not only include new cards but even new, mysterious features that have yet to be announced.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone! Today, I'd like to share a brief statement by the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonTCGPocket?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PokemonTCGPocket</a> Team about more immediate updates coming to the game in the next few months.</p><p>I look forward to sharing more details with everyone as they become available! <a href="https://t.co/eaN35vRpSw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/eaN35vRpSw</a></p></div>— Pokémon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1856819952713453683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket will receive at least one “major update” in the near future, with the team saying that the plans is to release new booster packs before the end of the year. Those who have picked up the Pokémon mobile game so far have been treated to three packs – Genetic Apex Mewtwo, Charizard, and Pikachu – with three pools of cards to choose from. It’s unclear exactly how many more packs will release in the next few months or which creatures they will feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How and when the card roster will grow remains a mystery, but one feature that has been on everyone’s minds is currently slated to arrive early next year: trading. The ability to trade cards with other players is a Social Hub menu option that’s been grayed out since launch, and in January, Pokémon TCG Pocket will finally make it available to use. It’s worth noting that today’s message clarifies that only “certain cards” will be available to trade at release, with the team promising to “expand the selection of cards that are able to be traded” over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the message keeps more than a few details hidden, rest assured that more features will come to Pokémon TCG Pocket down the line. “Also, we have other new features in development outside of the trade feature introduced here,” the message says. “We plan to announce more details about the update as the dates for the addition of these features are finalized, so please look forward to it.”</p><div id="best-pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Pokemon TCG Pocket Cards Tier List</h3><h3>Best Pokemon TCG Pocket Cards Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This mobile version of everyone’s favorite pocket monster trading card game has taken the world by storm since it launched late last month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-patch-notes-details-complete-update-list-and-how-its-handling-bots<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Treyarch has published patch notes for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 1 ahead of its launch on PC and consoles tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-november-8-patch-further-nerfs-recon-as-10v10-goes-live">a string of smaller updates</a> delivered throughout the last few weeks, today’s <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>patch notes</u></a> tease an update that is (unsurprisingly) the biggest yet. It’s got everything from weapon balance adjustments to details on Warzone, and while most of the news focuses on changes to Multiplayer and Zombies, the team made sure to iron out some Campaign wrinkles, too. There’s a laundry list of fixes for players of every shape and size, including those worried about players who want to cheat their way to the top.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/13/bo6-s1-sevhero-01-1731530923478.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone get Season 1 patch notes targeting cheaters and weapon balancing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One specific area Treyarch took aim at with its Black Ops 6 Season 1 update revolves around what it calls “disruptive behavior.” The team has adjusted ping thresholds to tackle VPN abuse and enhanced AFK detection in hopes of extinguishing boosting in lobbies. These are changes that should help ward off the use of popular exploits like bot lobbies, with additional tweaks to the anti-cheat measures sure to come as more updates arrive. Players will also be required to win 50 match-made Multiplayer matches before they’re allowed to dive into Ranked mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's all about making every aspect of the Black Ops 6 experience authentic, so it’s not shocking to see a bevy of weapon tweaks coming to Multiplayer in Season 1, too. While assault rifles like the XM4, GPR 91, and AMES 85 received general damage buffs across the board, their headshot multipliers have also been reduced. Shotguns users were handed some changes, too, including increased damage multipliers and even more general damage improvements for the Marine SP and ASG-89.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Omnimovement comes to Warzone</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 Season 1 alone comes with a long list of additions that will surely only change more as more content rolls out. Warzone, meanwhile, is an entirely different beast, but the team as Raven Software made sure to go over all of the details in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-01-patch-notes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its own post on the Call of Duty website</a>. While things like Area 99 and omnimovement are sure to give fans of the long-running battle royale mode an entirely new hill to climb, there are plenty of other smaller changes here to help iron out the mode, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those same Ricochet anti-cheat measures from Multiplayer will be carried into Warzone, for example. Warzone UI is also getting a massive facelift, which includes a legacy tab for previously unlocked Modern Warfare 2 and 3 customization options, an option to change your mini-map type, and a legacy content filtering system. Treyarch says it also brough back some original Warzone elements, such as equipment icons and armor plate shape.</p><div id="black-ops-6-tier-list-best-guns-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3><h3>Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More Multiplayer maps, modes, skins, and much, much more are coming with Season 1 when it arrives tomorrow.

Most weapons sit quite closely in both performance and pick rate, with no weapons dominating in both areas. As such our first round of Season 01 tuning changes will not be introducing any major shifts to the current state of weapon balance, and instead focus on elevating some of the weapons at the bottom of the pack. We are also addressing feedback regarding Assault Rifle damage in Hardcore and completing our adjustments to the shotgun slug attachment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reminder: We're using a new Weapon Damage Adjustments tables to identify post-patch damage changes when possible.

The Swat 5.56 has a slower fire rate within each burst and more recoil, making it better suited for mid-range engagements. Meanwhile the AEK-973 has better stability and precision, but a longer burst delay makes it a riskier pick when playing aggressively. We are also significantly reducing the power of the AEK-973 Rapid Fire, which was too strong not to take. </em></p><strong>Sniper Rifles</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We have been monitoring feedback on Sniper Rifles and are making some changes to promote more build diversity and improve the sniping experience before gaining access to a complete attachment set. We are lowering the baseline flinch on all Snipers and reducing the Flinch Resistance given by stock attachments. The resulting received flinch values are much lower up front and just a bit lower overall after equipping the stocks. We are also increasing Aim Walking Movement Speed bonuses on stock attachments to make those choices more valuable.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lastly, we are improving the ADS Idle Sway delay by default on all Snipers, meaning that on average there will be less deviation from your point of aim when entering ADS. Our goal is to support the various sniping playstyles you all enjoy through several viable weapon builds. We will continue to monitor weapon and attachment data as well as your feedback to ensure that all sniping playstyles are fun and rewarding in Black Ops 6. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sniper Rifle Class Adjustments</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>All snipers now have 1 second of 50% Idle Sway scaling at the beginning of Aim Down Sight </li><li>All snipers have had base Flinch Resistance improved by 17% </li></ul><strong>Gunsmith  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Various updates to weapon descriptions. </li><li>Addressed an issue where stickers would appear in the Decal slot. </li></ul><strong>Perks</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li> Slight reduction to Ninja footstep volume.<ul data-cy="list"><li>Additionally we’ve made a slight reduction to default footstep volume.</li></ul></li><li>Addressed an issue that prevented Gearhead from being able to booby-trap enemy Care Packages.</li><li>Addressed an issue that prevented Equipment from replenishing with the Scavenger Perk.</li></ul><strong>Scorestreaks </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Archangel </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where the rocket would sometimes explode immediately when firing near a wall. </li></ul></li></ul><strong>Challenges </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where some Daily Challenges were not tracking properly. </li></ul><strong>Movement Updates </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed a bug causing player to be slowed when shot while mantling. </li></ul><strong>Theater </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added Nuketown and Private Match recordings. </li><li>Addressed various stability issues when viewing matches. </li></ul><strong>UI </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to equip Operators they had not unlocked. </li><li>Addressed an issue where the AAR could close when entering the Scoreboard tab. </li><li>Addressed an issue earned and unearned medals would not display correctly in Collections. </li><li>Addressed an issue where the option to select an attachment skin would not be visible for some players. </li></ul><strong>Graphics </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where some weapon effects would persist on the character after changing weapons. </li></ul><strong>Stability </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added numerous stability fixes. </li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>ZOMBIES</strong></h3><strong>Maps </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Terminus </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Addressed an issue where defuse progress was sometimes not saved if the player stopped defusing during the Apocalypse Protocol Main Quest step. </li><li>Addressed an issue where entering a Kazimir after completing the Main Quest would teleport the player to the boss arena and down them. </li><li>Addressed an issue where loading into a saved game after unlocking the Pack-A-Punch machine could cause some doors to have inconsistent collision. </li><li>Addressed an issue during the Main Quest where connecting both Node Connectors at the same time would cause overlapping voice lines. </li><li>Changed the location of the Ammo Cache on the Seaside Path. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Liberty Falls </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Updated the first Mangler whose arm is blown off to always drop a Mangler Cannon instead of only the first Mangler that spawns. </li><li>Resolved an issue where Blanchard would not be present during some dialogue. </li></ul></li></ul><strong>Weapon Adjustments </strong><p data-cy="paragraph">The recent changes to Assault Rifles in Zombies were an unintended carryover from a global weapon tuning pass.

Dive into Warzone with these powerful additions, now available alongside fan favorites from previous titles.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At launch, Black Ops 6 weapons in Warzone will share similar values to their Multiplayer counterparts such as ADS speed, sprint to fire, and recoil. However, damage profiles for a number of weapons have been modified to establish a baseline for Warzone. We encourage new and returning players to study their favorite weapon’s details in the Gunsmith. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the integration of Black Ops 6, we also now have new tuning options for weapons that weren’t previously available, allowing us to adjust aspects like handling (ADS speed and sprint to fire), magazine sizes, recoil, and more. For instance, while the AS VAL has a default magazine size of 20 in Multiplayer, we’ve set it to 30 for Warzone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our goal is to make weapon adjustments faster to keep the available selection dynamic and engaging, without making any weapons feel obsolete. With these new tuning options, we aim to refine each weapon’s identity and role specific to their use in Warzone, such as emphasizing Assault Rifles as strong long-range options. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, all bolt-action snipers and pump-action shotguns (while aiming down sights) from Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, and Black Ops 6 will have a one-shot headshot potential within their respective max damage ranges. Additionally, in order to incentivize intentional aim, all shotguns will fire 5 pellets while ADSing versus 4 when fired from the hip. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We want players to feel that weapons from Modern Warfare II and Modern Warfare III continue to remain solid, viable choices in Warzone. Our goal is to create a unified combat system that makes each gun enjoyable to use, regardless of its origin. We’ll continue to improve legacy weapons and attachments throughout the coming year to further support this vision. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>Black Ops 6 Weapons</strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 weapons have a unique Warzone damage profile, which includes specific base damage, range, and location-based modifiers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve adjusted several Black Ops 6 attachments to function differently in Warzone: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>CHF Barrel </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>For Assault Rifles, LMGs, DMRs, SMGs, and Pistols: This now grants an increased neck multiplier rather than a head multiplier. </li><li>For Sniper Rifles and Shotguns: This now provides increased leg modifiers instead of arm modifiers. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Flip Magazine </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The magazine capacity penalty from Multiplayer has been removed. In Warzone, flip mags match the base weapon's ammo capacity. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Rapid Fire </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>This attachment now applies a base damage penalty in Warzone, along with greater penalties to bullet velocity and range. </li></ul></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>Modern Warfare II &amp; III Weapons</strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A visual recoil reduction pass has been applied to Modern Warfare II weapons, enhancing their feel and control while shooting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barrel and stock attachments from Modern Warfare II have also had their penalties reduced. Additionally, a significant balancing pass has been completed for underbarrel and muzzle attachments from both Modern Warfare II and III. All cons have been removed from these attachments, meaning they now only provide stat boosts, with each subcategory of underbarrels and muzzles functioning identically except for cosmetic differences. AMP attachments in these slots, however, retain their unique functionality and balancing. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Muzzle Enhancements </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Suppressors:</strong> Boost velocity and damage range. </li><li><strong>Comps:</strong> Improve recoil control. </li><li><strong>Flash Hiders:</strong> Increase damage range and firing aim stability. </li><li><strong>Breacher: </strong>Enhance melee damage and recoil control. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Underbarrel Enhancements </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Angled Grip:</strong> Increases hipfire and tacstance accuracy and aim walking steadiness. </li><li><strong>Handstop:</strong> Improves sprint-to-fire and ADS speed. </li><li><strong>Vert Grip:</strong> Enhances recoil control and firing aim stability. </li></ul></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, Modern Warfare II and III weapons now have corner-slicing functionality, adding an extra tactical edge.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>Global Weapon Builds</strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Seamlessly access a custom weapon build you've created across Black Ops 6 Multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. This time-saving feature lets you adjust any Build or Blueprint in one game, with changes automatically applied wherever that weapon is equipped. To create a build, select a base weapon or Blueprint, add attachments and cosmetics in the Gunsmith, and return to the Custom Loadout screen to save it. The build, with all selected customizations, will then appear in other modes under the same weapon type.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>New Weapons</strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">These weapons are new to Season 01 and were not part of the original launch of Black Ops 6 Multiplayer in October 2024. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Krig C </strong><em>Assault Rifle </em><ul data-cy="list"><li>Full-auto assault rifle.

These summaries cover key objectives, mechanics, and rewards, making it easier for players to jump in and engage with contracts confidently.</p><strong>Bounty </strong><strong> </strong><p data-cy="paragraph">When you pick up a Bounty contract, a nearby player will be selected as your target. A circle will appear on your tac map, periodically updating to show the target’s location. The target will be somewhere within this circle each time it updates, and the circle gradually shrinks as you move closer. The target can also see an indicator on their HUD showing how close the closest player from your hunting team is; this is displayed as a three-level "threat indicator." Completing the contract by killing the target rewards cash, XP, and a singular ping from the bounty target’s body. If another team kills the target, your contract ends with a "poached" outcome, offering a lesser reward. Allowing the timer to run out or losing your team will fail the contract. </p><strong>Big Game Bounty </strong><strong> </strong><p data-cy="paragraph">This contract works similarly to the base Bounty but with a few twists. It only spawns after Circle 2 closes and prioritizes teams with the highest cumulative kills, provided they’re not already bounty targets. If you complete this contract by eliminating the target, you’ll earn an immediate advanced UAV ping along with extra cash and XP, offering greater rewards than a standard Bounty. </p><strong>Scavenger</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon picking up a Scavenger contract, three scavenger caches will spawn near the pickup spot. You’ll be directed to each cache one at a time, with the next cache revealed only after you open the previous one. Opening a cache adds 45 seconds to the contract timer. These caches contain slightly better loot than usual, and each will drop a lootable perk. Opening the third and final cache completes the contract, rewarding your team with cash, XP, and an armor satchel from the last cache. Failing to open all caches before time runs out, or having your team wiped, will fail the contract. </p><strong>Intel</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">When you accept an Intel contract, a nearby upload station will be marked for your team to upload sensitive intel. Reaching the station and interacting with it initiates an "upload" phase where one team member must remain near the station until the upload is complete. If multiple players are in this radius, the upload speed can increase by up to 200%. Completing the upload rewards cash, XP, and a peek at the next circle’s location. Failure occurs if the timer expires or if your team is wiped. </p><strong>Most Wanted </strong><strong> </strong><p data-cy="paragraph">By picking up the Most Wanted contract, you or the team member who picked it up becomes visible on the map for all players. Opponents who kill the Most Wanted target receive cash and XP, while the Most Wanted team can reduce their contract time by obtaining kills and opening loot caches (10-second reduction per cache, 25-second reduction per kill). If the Most Wanted target survives the full contract duration, the contract is completed, and the team earns cash, XP, and revives any dead squad members. Whether the contract ends in success or failure, a "VIP reward crate" appears near the VIP’s location, containing ammo, plates, a killstreak, a weapon, a Gulag token, and cash. </p><strong>Signals Intelligence</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">This contract directs your team to hack nearby contracts for rewards. The nearest contract will be marked for hacking, although you can hack any contract. The number of contracts required depends on team size: solos and duos hack one, while trios and quads hack two. Hacking all required contracts completes the mission, rewarding your team with XP and ten periodic cash payments. Letting time run out or losing your team results in failure.</p><strong>Spy Drone</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">This contract spawns multiple drones in a circle formation near your team. The number of drones varies with team size—solos face five, duos six, trios seven, and quads eight. Destroy all drones to complete the contract and earn cash, XP, a UAV, and redeploy drone beacon from the last drone. Failure results if time expires or your team is wiped out. </p><strong>Elite Contracts</strong><strong> </strong><p data-cy="paragraph">These are tougher versions of existing contracts, offering higher rewards. Elite Contracts reduce the contract time by 45% and reward an additional 1,500 cash on completion. Completing an Elite Contract also drops a reward crate with items, including an ammo pile, armor plate, ultra-rare weapon, and one of several rare items such as a UAV, redeploy drone beacon, deployable kiosk, or, with low probability, a Specialist or Foresight. Note that Most Wanted contracts cannot become Elite, although other contracts might turn Elite as the match progresses. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>Contract Adjustments</strong></u></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Bounty </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Completing the contract now includes finishing downed targets you didn’t down yourself. </li><li>Bounty contracts should no longer start without a valid target. </li><li>"Poached" end state now counts as a contract failure for challenge tracking. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Most Wanted </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Removed the redeploy token from the Most Wanted reward crate in solos. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Scavenger </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The primary reward in Battle Royale and Resurgence is now an armor plate carrier. </li></ul></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>PUBLIC EVENTS</strong></h2><strong>Battle Royale &amp; Resurgence </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Firesale </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>All items in the buy station are discounted at 50% for a limited time. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Restock  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>All Supply Boxes close and are refilled with items. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Jailbreak  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>All operators in gulag and eliminated operators are redeployed at the end of a timer. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Fly Buy  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>A series of drones drop a number of deployable buy stations across the warzone. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Recon Flyover  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Avoid the detection of overhead drones to prevent your location from being broadcast. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Squad Loadout Drop  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Loadout drops that are only accessible by their assigned team.</li></ul></li></ul><strong>Battle Royale </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Contested Loadout Drop  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Limited number of loadout drops that are accessible by any team. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Cash Drop  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>A number of crates are dropped across the field that, when captured, drop a bounty of cash. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Contractor  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>All contracts pay out more when completed within a timer. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Rogue Signal  </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>All teams compete on a random task -- the top teams get access to a reward with exclusive loot. </li></ul></li></ul><strong>Resurgence </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Bounty Royale </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>All teams are automatically assigned a Bounty contract. </li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>High Stakes </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>A number of crates are dropped across the warzone that, when captured, double the XP earn in the current match for the team while also drop high tier loot.</li></ul></li></ul><strong>Plunder </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Blood Money </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>For the duration of the event, operators that are eliminated drop significantly more money.</li></ul></li></ul><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Attack Choppers </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Once the match enters overtime, attack choppers enter the warzone.
