It was a move made amid layoffs at 1047 that saw both the sequel and its popular predecessor pulled offline as the studio promised to return with “big, sweeping changes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those changes seemingly failed to attract players, with just around 2,300 players logging in to play the free-to-play game on Steam at launch and a little more than 800 playing at the time of this piece’s publication (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#max" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>).

They don’t show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don’t capture the community that’s actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to separate Splitgate: Arena Reloaded’s launch player numbers from the nearly 26,000 users who showed up for Splitgate 2, but 1047’s targeted response does aim to remind players that the re-launch also came to consoles and the Epic Games Store. Metrics for those platforms aren’t as openly available as they are for Steam, so it’s unclear if interest is similarly quiet elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, the studio wants both veteran and potential players to know it’s put work into getting Splitgate: Arena Reloaded ready for launch, and it doesn’t plan on slowing down anytime soon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“To our amazing community: thank you,” 1047 continues. “Your feedback and passion have helped make Arena Reloaded better every day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And to everyone who hasn’t played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay’s the best it’s ever been, and we’d love for you to jump in and form your own opinion. A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As 1047 takes to social media to combat the negative sentiment surrounding its re-launch effort, its Arena Royale component is expected to launch in the near future. Splitgate: Arena Reloaded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-relaunches-this-month-as-splitgate-arena-reloaded"><u>came with</u></a> a rebuilt progression system, new and reworked maps, and more.

            <guid>1398940</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering sealed product is making waves at big box retailers and TCGPlayer, but who has the best prices this week? Well, both Amazon and secondary marketplace TCGPlayer have their bargains, so I’ve noted the best deals down to save you looking, as well as the other best deals of the day.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alienware has just dropped a massive discount on their NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 build, coupled with one of the best gaming processors on the market right now in AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Looking for a cheap and cheerful deal instead? How about two 6.6ft braided USB-C cables that can handle up to 240W for the price of a coffee? Thought so. Coming in at the product you didn't know you needed today is a cordless air duster for easy cleaning of desks, PCs, fans and more that's currently half off from $39.98. Let's get into it:</p><p id="mtg-cheapest-at-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG: Cheapest at Amazon">MTG: Cheapest at Amazon</h2></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Amazon is putting out some decent pricing, with my favorite pick here being the "Game Edition" of Cloud Strife-themed Limit Break Commander Deck. It's around the same price as TCGPlayer, making it market value, with the artwork being based on in-game moments instead of the traditional MTG artwork.</p><p>The same can be said for the Marvel's Spider-Man Play Booster Box containing 30 booster packs with the following:<br>• 14 Magic: The Gathering cards<br>• 1–4 cards of rarity Rare or higher<br>• 3–6 Uncommon cards<br>• 6–9 Common cards<br>• 1 Land card (Traditional Foil Land replaces a Land in 20% of boosters)<br>• 1 card of any rarity is Traditional Foil; Foil Showcase Mythic Rare in 1% of boosters</p></div><p id="mtg-cheapest-at-tcgplayer"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG: Cheapest at TCGPlayer">MTG: Cheapest at TCGPlayer</h2></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Meanwhile, TCGPlayer is the place to go for MTG preorders. It's the cheapest for the Lorwyn Eclipsed Play Booster Box and Bundle, with the next Universes Beyond entry Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Play Booster Box, Turtle Power! Commander Deck and Bundle, the latter being over $15 cheaper than Amazon.</p><p>There's some gorgeous Final Fantasy scene boxes coming in cheaper than Amazon too, not to mention the standard Limit Break Commander Deck being just under $5 cheaper on TCGPlayer. It pays to shop around for sure.</p></div><p id="alienware-area-51-rtx-5090"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Alienware Area-51 RTX 5090">Alienware Area-51 RTX 5090</h2></p><div catalogid="eab3ddf4-df4e-4312-bd6d-0ff777612420" id="234132"><div id="234132" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, 32GB DDR5 RAM, 1TB M.2 SSD</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Area-51 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 32GB GDDR7</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This beast is loaded with an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU, GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card, 32GB DDR5-6400MHz RAM, and a 1TB SSD. That alone sells this system with the custom cooling that makes Alienware's Area-51 builds worth the premium. The good news is we're seeing a rare discount on something that has an RTX 5090 in it, a solid 10%, or $550 off, knocking this build down to $5,049.99. What's not to love?</p></div><p id="2-pack-lisen-66ft-240w-usb-type-c-c"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="2-Pack Lisen 6.6ft 240W USB Type-C C">2 Lisen 6.6ft 240W USB Type-C Cables</h2></p><div catalogid="eab3ddf4-df4e-4312-bd6d-0ff777612420" id="234131"><div id="234131" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>2-Pack Lisen 6.6ft 240W USB Type-C Cables</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to my kids destroying countless USB cables over the years, I know what makes a USB-C charging cable that lasts. Braided wins out over rubber cable every day of the week due to its flexibility and durability. Thick caps on either side protecting the port will also be a lifesaver, but getting 240W-capable cables can sometimes cost a fortune.<br>Not today! You can get Lisen’s 6.6ft double pack for a ridiculously reasonable $5.60. These will handle fast charging for pretty much everything you can think of, from a mobile phone or Switch 2 to a MacBook. Even if you don't need a new cable, it's worth buying spares when deals like this crop up.</p></div><p id="jvscam-cordless-electric-air-duster"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="JVSCAM Cordless Electric Air Duster">JVSCAM Cordless Electric Air Duster</h2></p><div catalogid="eab3ddf4-df4e-4312-bd6d-0ff777612420" id="234133"><div id="234133" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>JVSCAM 130,000RPM Cordless Electric Air Duster with Adjustable Tips</h3></p></div><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Cleaning dust or crumbs out of your keyboard is a pain. No-one likes doing it and it takes ages to brush them all out. I was in the "Why the hell do I need an electric duster" camp, but then I bought one and I’m using it quite a lot.</p><p>I use mine to clear out vents, fans, GPU and more inside my PC, and even use it to get to hard-to-reach places in the car and on my desk. They're very handy to have in your desk drawer and it’s a great deal for $20.</p></div></div><p id="market-value-at-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Market Value at Amazon">Pokémon TCG: Market Value at Amazon</h2></p><div><div id="234070" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value at Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><div id="234078" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value at Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><div id="234085" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Q4 Poke Ball Tins</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, the good news is you can get the Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box with Prime delivery without getting stung. It has nine booster packs, a gorgeous Charcadet Illustration Rare promo, Mega Charizard X–themed sleeves, card dividers, a tournament-legal coin, alongside some nice-looking dice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection has four Journey Together and two Destined Rivals booster packs, so if Trainer Pokémon cards are your thing, you’re good to go.</p><p id="cheapest-at-tcgplayer"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cheapest at TCGPlayer">Pokémon TCG: Cheapest at TCGPlayer</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it were me making a choice from the TCGPlayer selection here, I’d go for the Destined Rivals Booster Bundle. It’s $13 cheaper than Amazon right now and works out at $4.66 per booster pack, which is one of the best prices I’ve seen for Destined Rivals booster packs recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want a decent Mega ex card for your Grass-type deck, I’d recommend the Mega Venusaur ex Premium Collection. If you run Meganium alongside it from Mega Evolution, you can double your Grass Energy value while being able to move a Grass Energy from one Pokémon to another thanks to their abilities. That means you can set up and use Mega Venusaur ex’s “Jungle Dump” attack for 240 damage in one turn (it costs four Grass Energy).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll also get the following booster packs:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 × Mega Evolution</li><li>2 × Destined Rivals</li><li>4 × Journey Together</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Everything old is old again.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 was bursting with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2025">really cool new game releases</a>: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Death Stranding 2, Ghost of Yōtei, Blue Prince, Donkey Kong Bananza, I could go on. And yet, it seems like the vast majority of players (at least in the US) spent most of their time playing the old hits on repeat, because the five most popular games on PlayStation last year were exactly the same as the year before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, who <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared on Bluesky today</a> the top five most-played games in the US on PlayStation for 2025:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Fortnite</li><li>Call of Duty</li><li>GTA V</li><li>Roblox</li><li>Minecraft</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">And for 2024:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Fortnite</li><li>Call of Duty</li><li>GTA V</li><li>Roblox</li><li>Minecraft</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPpjLV77yTs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">They're the same picture</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The layout is different (I guess) on Xbox, with Minecraft and Roblox flipped for 2025, and a slightly more complicated order for 2024: Call of Duty at No. 1, then Fortnite, Minecraft, GTA V, Roblox. But uh, <em>same five games</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a pretty damning indictment of the current state of the industry. As Piscatella said himself almost a year ago on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/lrPeLqcty4I" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>, this is a fairly recent trend. As he explains, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a surge in the video game audience, with huge numbers of people playing games who never had before. As a result, many of the major gaming markets effectively reached a cap on how many new players they can obtain in future years, because everyone was already there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, that capped audience is now playing a smaller number of games overall. Some of that is just because games are getting more expensive. More people are gravitating toward live service games they're already familiar with where they can spend smaller amounts of money for a fun experience on a platform they already own, rather than spend larger amounts of money to try new things on new platforms.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But some of that is simply a natural consequence of the rise of live service. As Piscatella continues to explain, the way the market used to work is that players would buy one big new game, spend all their time on that, then move onto the next one. But people just aren't buying new games anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you take the top ten service games every month...on PlayStation and Xbox, seven out of every ten people that turn on their console will play at least one of those games every month, and in terms of total time they're taking, those ten games alone every month take up 40% of total playtime on the consoles." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Piscatella also shares that at the time, Circana expected 30% of people that play video games would not buy a video game in 2025 (the actual numbers for the full year haven't been released just yet). A further 18% would purchase a new game every six months or less frequently. Only 12% buy a game once a month, and 4% buy new games more often than that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So when we're talking about the developers and publishers who are being hurt the most, are the games that are really targeting this 16% of total players that are purchasing very frequently, while the vast majority of players are buying a game or two a year, and they're playing Fornite, Minecraft, and Roblox."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is that it's harder than ever for brand new games to break through, which has been a major part of the recent wave of layoffs, studio closures, project cancelations, and just general industry devasation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-developers-mass-layoffs-human-impact-sony-ea">we've been reporting on</a> primarily in the US industry for the last couple of years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Piscatella concluded that Kinda Funny presentation with a sentence he's said to me many times, and continues to say: "The biggest competitor to any new video game is Fortnite."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Circana is expected to release its full report on US video game sales in 2025 later this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Cast as Bawma, a charismatic pirate king with a mysterious edge, Kravitz's video game debut promises action, intrigue, and a dash of rockstar theatrics. I had the opportunity to speak with him about his role in the game, his decades-long love for the Bond films, and to try to glean a little bit more about his character’s role in this twist on a traditional Bond story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally announced as “Project 007” in 2020, IO Interactive has started to loosen the valve on information about its upcoming game starring the international man of mystery. While we still haven’t had a chance to go hands-on with the project, it looks promising. Blending Hitman-style stealth-action with the globetrotting cinematic shine and sense of humor you’d expect from any silver screen adventure starring your pick of the actors who’ve held a license to kill, it feels appropriate that its villains would be larger than life, just like in the novels and films. That all starts with a bit of blockbuster stunt casting.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/06/knt-bawma-screenshot-3840x2160-1767730028977.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lenny Kravitz as Bawma in 007: First Light.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though he’s new to the series as an actor, Kravitz’s love for the James Bond movies as a fan goes back to his time lining up to see Roger Moore’s films in junior high and high school. “I used to line up on the first night it would be in the theater with a friend of mine,” the musician told me, making sure to pay lip service to his favorite leading men, Roger Moore and Sean Connery. “The theme songs were always amazing, too, always epic,” he told me, reminiscing on Carly Simon’s Nobody Does It Better from The Spy Who Loved Me before shouting out his favorites: Shirley Bassey’s iconic Goldfinger, Wings’ Live and Let Die, and Duran Duran’s A View To Kill.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Kravitz’s cool charisma and rockstar persona feel well-tuned for the role of a pirate king.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kravitz’s cool charisma and rockstar persona feel well-tuned for the role of a pirate king. But he insists that he’s not just playing himself or sending up his favorite campy villains of bygone Bond films. Instead, he looked inward, drawing on his own experiences for inspiration. “I’ve met some folks that are… similar to his character. I grew up in the Bahamas as well as New York City and there were guys who had [Bawma’s] vibe and were doing similar things in the islands.” The musician told me the hardest part of playing Bawma was finding that voice and personality. “It’s really all in the voice,” he assured me. “It took a moment, but eventually we found the sweet spot.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Kravitz isn’t just a prolific performer. He also brought some of his expertise as an icon in the fashion world to the character, even getting involved in giving notes to the art and design team, weighing in on Bawma’s costume as seen in his reveal trailer. From the cut of his jacket to the placement of tattoos and scars, the final design in the trailer was the result of deep collaboration between Kravitz and the IO Interactive team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During our conversation, Kravitz dropped a few hints that Bawma might not be an outright bad guy, though, painting him as more of a morally ambiguous antihero, rather than a straightforward villain. “He’s an interesting guy. We’re not quite sure how he’s going to turn.” IO Interactive CEO and 007 First Light Director Hakan Abrak told me, “We wanted more than just a one-sided villain, like we wanted to have some kind of charisma.” Abrak added that he’s not all-out evil, teasing, “He has more sides to him that could maybe turn out surprising in the story. You’ll need to wait to see that until the game comes out.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That depth played into IO’s casting for Bawma, Abrak told me. During early meetings, IOI realized they needed a performer who could captivate a crowd to fit the character they’d written. He told me, “The way Lenny moves, the way he draws sympathy and empathy kind of drags you in as a person” played a big role in pushing IO to choose the rockstar for this role.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since these interviews, IO Interactive has announced that 007 First Light has been delayed from March 27, 2026, to May 27, 2026.
