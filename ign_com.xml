            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the hugely popular Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 1, developer DICE has outlined the changes and additions fans can expect for the upcoming Weekend 2, and confirmed its start time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Weekend 2 kicks off today, August 14, at 8am UTC (1am PT), and runs until Sunday, August 17. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/open-beta-week-2-playlist-options" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, DICE outlined the playlist adjustments it has made for Weekend 2 and set out its reasoning. The thing to know here is the All-Out Warfare playlist will include Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“During Week 2, we're delivering more variety and choice for how you’d like to play with more playlists rotating between multiple different game modes,” DICE said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As an example, the All-Out Warfare playlist will include both Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush. The in-game descriptions for each mode will tell you which modes are included in the rotation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rotating through multiple modes within playlists helps us understand what our community enjoys as we shape the launch experience, and enables us to keep more fan-favorite modes available at the same time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DICE said rotating through playlists daily is specific for the Open Beta “while we're still able to test and gather feedback, and is not planned for launch.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 2 Playlists Overview:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Day 1, Thursday 14th</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Conquest</li><li>Rush</li><li>Attack &amp; Defend (Breakthrough, Rush)</li><li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill)</li><li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Day 2, Friday 15th</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Conquest</li><li>Squad Deathmatch</li><li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill, Squad Deathmatch)</li><li>All-Out Warfare; Epic battles across expansive maps (Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush)</li><li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Day 3-4, Saturday 16th - Sunday 17th</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Conquest</li><li>Close Quarters; Fast-paced playlist on smaller maps (Domination, King of the Hill, Squad Deathmatch).</li><li>All-Out Warfare; Epic battles across expansive maps (Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush)</li><li>Closed Weapons All-Out Warfare (Conquest, Breakthrough)</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, DICE has added custom search options for Weekend 2. The developer stressed that this is now a Server Browser, which some fans are hoping to see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Based on your previous feedback and to give you more control over map and mode selection, we're introducing a new feature called Custom Search,” DICE said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This feature allows you to choose your favorite combinations of maps and modes. For example, if you want to play Conquest on Siege of Cairo, then matchmaking will prioritize putting you in a match with this combo, if available. Note that this is not a Server Browser (which is not being tested this week).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“During Open Beta, Custom Search will be available for Open Weapon mode playlists so you can mix and match maps and modes as you prefer.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 Open Beta hit over half a million concurrent players on Steam last weekend, so it will be interesting to see whether Weekend 2 can beat that figure. Either way, there’s huge interest in the first-person shooter, which bodes well for its October launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're thinking of jumping in on PC for the first time, be aware you need to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/How_to_Enable_Secure_Boot">enable Secure Boot to play</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">They're not cheap, but they're worth it.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">S.H.Figuarts makes some really fantastic action figures. They’re on the pricy side, but they’re generally worth it, thanks to their superior build quality, wealth of accessories, swappable parts, and highly articulated joints so you can pose them however you want. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The newest batch added to the lineup are some great looking Super Mario figures that are available for preorder now (<a href="https://zdcs.link/a5w8E8?object_uuid=0cddfaac-dcd1-45ad-9321-c2da673c8bce&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see them at Amazon</a>). We have Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Bowser, and a play set, all coming next year. Let’s take a look.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll find links above to all of the new figures (and the play set). If you want more details about them, read on.</p><p id="mario"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mario">Mario - S.H.Figuarts Action Figure</h2></p><div catalogid="4b274db6-e447-49e1-adf2-6d7d259d31d4" id="226913"><div id="226913" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mario - S.H.Figuarts Super Mario Action Figure</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Mario in all his bold, colorful glory. In addition to looking absolutely stupendous, this figure comes with a base with a red “M” on it and a clear stand (so you can pose him jumping). It also has interchangeable hands that are either open or in a fist. Accessory-wise, you get a Question Mark Block, plus a gold coin, a Super Mushroom, and other little plastic parts that help you pose Mario however you’d like.</p></div><p id="luigi"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Luigi">Luigi - S.H.Figuarts Action Figure</h2></p><div catalogid="4b274db6-e447-49e1-adf2-6d7d259d31d4" id="226914"><div id="226914" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Luigi - S.H.Figuarts Super Mario Action Figure</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Luigi figure is just as game-accurate as the Mario one. It also comes with an extra set of hands and a stand (this one is green and has an “L” on it, though). And Luigi comes with a brick block and a red shell.</p></div><p id="bowser"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Bowser">Bowser - S.H.Figuarts Action Figure</h2></p><div catalogid="4b274db6-e447-49e1-adf2-6d7d259d31d4" id="226915"><div id="226915" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bowser - S.H.Figuarts Super Mario Action Figure</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Bowser figure is a bit more expensive than the plumber brothers, but I’m guessing our boy’s thickness is responsible for that. The Koopa King comes with a black base emblazoned with a Bowser logo, plus a clear stand. He comes with replacement hands and a replacement lower jaw to make him breathe a fireball. Very cool.</p></div><p id="yoshi"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Yoshi">Yoshi - S.H.Figuarts Action Figure</h2></p><div catalogid="4b274db6-e447-49e1-adf2-6d7d259d31d4" id="226916"><div id="226916" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Yoshi - S.H.Figuarts Super Mario Action Figure</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m glad the Yosh was not neglected in this set (though Peach and Toad may have something to say about that). Yoshi comes with a green base with an egg on it, plus a clear stand. There’s also replacement hands and eyes, plus a replacement saddle that will actually hold the Mario or Luigi figure on top of him. </p></div><p id="super-mario-playset"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Super Mario Playset">Playset - S.H.Figuarts Super Mario Line</h2></p><div catalogid="4b274db6-e447-49e1-adf2-6d7d259d31d4" id="226917"><div id="226917" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Playset - S.H.Figuarts Super Mario Line</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, there’s a play set that has all the pieces necessary to re-create scenes from the games. It has two pipes (a long one and a short one), two green bases, two brick blocks, two Goombas, two coins, a Question Mark Block, and a Green Shell, plus all sorts of clear stands to help create whatever scene you dream up.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Super Mario S.H.Figuarts Action Figures</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Any one of these figures looks great on its own, but the line really comes to life if you get more than one figure and create a scene with them. You can get some ideas for poses in the slideshow above, where you’ll also find all the accessories that come with each figure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you like these, also check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-new-cyclops-action-figure-from-shfiguarts-is-available-to-preorder">Cyclops X-Men figure</a> that's coming in January.
