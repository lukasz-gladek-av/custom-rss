Taking place in the space-themed space around Magic's Multiverse, it plays on sci-fi tropes from alien creatures to uncharted planets - both of which we got to show off in the gallery above.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Preorder MTG: Edge of Eternities Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first two cards - Broodguard Elite and Debris Field Crusher - are uncommon cards in the card pool of the main set. That means they generally have an eye more toward fitting into Edge of Eternities' draft and sealed formats (which only use cards from this single set) rather than making waves in constructed formats like Standard or Commander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, they do a good job of showing off two of EOE's new mechanics: Warp and Spacecrafts. Warp is sort of an interesting twist on a previous Magic mechanic called Evoke, letting you cast creatures for a cheaper cost but forcing them to be exiled at the end of the turn, allowing you to temporarily take advantage of their abiltiies earlier and then cast them again from exile later. Spacecrafts, on the other hand, start as a simple artifact that you need to "Station" creatures on (by tapping them) in order to make them because creatures that can attack and block on their own.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other seven cards we got to reveal are a little bit different. They are all reprints of exisiting land cards with flashy new intergalactic art, and aren't actually part of the main EOE set. Instead, these are part of the Stellar Sights bonus sheet, which means these cards can be found alongside many other lands in any type of booster pack but <em>are not </em>being added to any formats they aren't already a part of. They can also be found in an even rarer "poster" variant with different art, but only in Collector Boosters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to know more about Magic's interstellar escapades, we've got a more in-depth <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preview">preview of Edge of Eternities</a> - or if you'd prefer to stick to crossover sets, here's a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">the current schedule for its Secret Lair sets</a>.
