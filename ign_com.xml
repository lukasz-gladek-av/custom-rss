Although there is little gameplay footage for some of the bigger content plans, fans still get an outline of how Warhose will support its medieval sequel throughout 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In spring, expect free updates that range from a Barbers feature with additional customization options to Hardcore Mode and Horse Racing. Summer will then follow with what appears to be the first paid content drop, Brushes with Death, which Warhorse said follows protagonist Henry as he “aids an enigmatic artist with a shadowy past.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The autumn season brings the Legacy of the Forge expansion, add-on content that looks into Henry’s past by exploring his adoptive father Martin’s history. Finally, as far as this Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 post-launch roadmap is concerned, winter sees the release of Mysteria Ecclesia, which sees Henry embark on a covert mission to “navigate the complex dynamics” of the Sedlec Monastery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhorse promised to release more free quality-of-life updates as each seasonal expansion rolls out. Details regarding what these updates entail have yet to be revealed. It sounds like each expansion will be available for players to purchase individually, but you’ll also be able to acquire the full bundle as part of an Expansion Pass that also includes the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-shields-of-seasons-passing/9MXFWDC5BLJ2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Shields of Seasons Passing shield customization DLC</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 launches for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on February 4, 2025.

It is also scheduled for Austria and New Zealand beginning sometime in January but no other countries (besides France where it's already active) have been announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dragon Discovery event will see Happy Meals — dressed up as Charizard, Dragonite and Pikachu, Rayquazza, and Roaring Moon — give away a special four card booster pack containing one holographic card.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">really hope i catch a Rayquaza wbu<br>order the Pokémon Happy Meal today and unlock Pokémon TCG Pocket rewards with the McD’s app 👀 <a href="https://t.co/CMELZPniQo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/CMELZPniQo</a></p>— McDonald's (@McDonalds) <a href="https://twitter.com/McDonalds/status/1881719081621127253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">There are 15 cards in the unique set. Pikachu, Miraidon, Koraidon, Hydreigon, Roaring Moon, Dragonite, and Drampa are holos, while Charizard, Jigglypuff, Hatena, Dragapult, Quagsire, Umbreon, Eevee, and Rayquazza are not. The Happy Meals also come with a double sided poster and stickers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald's itself revealed on X/Twitter that those who order one of the Happy Meals through the official McDonald's app will gain rewards in Pokémon TCG Pocket too: 24 Pack Hourglasses and 12 Wonder Hourglasses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means players can unlock two packs (which would cost $1 if paying for them otherwise) in the digital TCG and pick up a level one Wonder Pick too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon has collaborated on myriad events like this in the past, some of which feature higher sought after cards than others. While McDonald's cards will be, in the collector's market, relatively low value, others such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-announces-an-unlikely-collaboration-with-the-van-gogh-museum">the Van Gogh Museum collaboration have gone very wrong</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was meant to be a charming event to encourage children to enjoy art instead turned into a scalper's paradise and a fan's worst nightmare. Those looking to resell a special trading card flooded the museum shop and caused so much chaos <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/van-gogh-museum-pulls-limited-edition-pokemon-cards">The Pokémon Company cancelled the collaboration altogther</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
