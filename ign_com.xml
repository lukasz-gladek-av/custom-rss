            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Praise the Omnissiah.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is set for a second year of DLC, and we have the first details on its huge 10.0 update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Breakout hit Space Marine 2 has sold 7 million copies, so it’s no surprise to see Year 2 support confirmed by publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Saber Interactive. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500577186633221225" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community update</a>, the companies said Year 2 will bring new PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and more unannounced content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 came out in September 2024, and as part of its first anniversary, a “large-scale” update is planned to release in September. Patch 10.0 sounds like a big one for Space Marine 2, but it’s worth noting that Patch 9.0 is due out beforehand. 9.0 was meant to add a new PvP mode, but that’s now delayed to 10.0, which means 9.0 will add only balance changes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We do know a little about this new PvP mode, however. The twist here is it’s Chaos vs Chaos set on a new map, and, most interesting of all, you’ll be able to take control of the Helbrute. The Helbrute, for the uninitiated, is a variant of the Chaos Dreadnought, an evil death-dealer piloted by a Chaos Space Marine trapped within its plated metal chest. You might remember the Helbrute from the Space Marine 2 campaign, where it came off worse in a scrap with the Ultramarines’ Brother Valtus. Alongside this new Chaos-themed PvP mode are new Chaos armours, which are much-requested by fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, 10.0 adds the new Power Axe melee weapon, which has its own moveset and execution animations. We have a first look below:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/01/b9d4da70b5f382d137a5fc2c8a7c87556b8e5053-1751353725644.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Space Marine 2's upcoming Power Axe. Image credit: Focus Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ahead-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-8-fans-believe-datamines-have-revealed-everything-from-the-new-class-to-a-new-much-wanted-melee-weapon-and-a-surprising-new-gun">Datamines had suggested the Power Axe</a>, which makes sense in the context of Games Workshop’s ongoing Space Wolves push for the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game. And let’s remember, in December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-modders-put-the-axe-from-secret-levels-warhammer-40000-episode-into-the-game"><u>IGN reported on Space Marine 2 modders who put the axe from Secret Level’s Warhammer 40,000 episode into the game</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>THIS is why I’m a fan of Warhammer 40k! Hats off to <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimeVideo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@PrimeVideo</a> for producing Secret Level: And They Shall Know No Fear.

We don’t have a first look yet, but it’s advanced enough in development to be announced. Expect more on the Techmarine in the next community updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Techmarine perhaps doesn’t come as a huge surprise given it was also strongly hinted at in datamines (the files mentioned a perk called ‘shoulder gun bolter,’ which is a clear indication that Techmarines are finally in play). For the uninitiated, a Techmarine is a Space Marine engineer-type class who's a big fan of the Cult Mechanicus as well as their Chapter. They’re big on technology and specialize in fixing and maintaining vehicles and other big stuff, such as Dreadnoughts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot of new Space Marine 2 content coming down the line, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive"><u>despite the surprise announcement that development of Space Marine 3 development had begun</u></a>.

On one side, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> cards are going through a steep correction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Crown Zenith</a> cards are showing early signs of what could be a long-term value surge. The bottom line? If you're a collector or investor, <strong>now is the time to buy into both.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m picking up what I can from both sets. The current dip in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundle-shining-fates-amazon-restock-latest">Sparks</a> is a glimmer of hope for long-suffering 2024-2025 collectors. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-card-packs">Crown Zenith</a> is a train I want to be on before it leaves the station. Let's go into more detail:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/pixel-9-15-1751288444113.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Game Freak / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with Surging Sparks. A handful of top cards have taken noticeable hits in the last few weeks. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJB7d?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Pikachu ex - 247/191</strong></a>, for example, has dropped a whopping 51% since early April, falling from $113.38 to just $56. That’s a steep decline, no doubt, but it's important to put it in context. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re seeing more sealed product become available every week, and as supply rises, prices are naturally correcting. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l37AE?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Hydreigon ex - 240/191</strong></a><strong> </strong>has also taken a 34% hit, now sitting at $49.60, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1ODK?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Milotic ex - 237/191</strong></a> is down 26% to $99. Even the alternate-art <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoGOLg?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Pikachu ex - 238/191</strong></a> is feeling the pressure, dropping 22% to $294.99, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWY75n?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Latias ex - 239/191</strong></a> has slipped 23% to $193.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn’t panic selling or lost interest in Surging Sparks, it’s the result of increased availability. Collectors and resellers aren’t willing to overpay for cards that are easier to find. If anything, that creates opportunity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These aren’t bad cards; they’re just correcting from an inflated early market. For anyone who missed the initial wave or hesitated at launch prices, <strong>this correction is your window</strong>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/pixel-9-17-1751289091092.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Game Freak / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Crown Zenith</em> is telling a very different story. Cards from this set, particularly the stunning Secret Rare VSTARs, are starting to heat up. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJn7r?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Giratina VSTAR (Secret) GG69/GG70</strong></a> has jumped 24% this month, climbing from $152.78 to $199.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwnAG?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR (Secret)</strong></a> shot up 22% in just a few days, now holding at $84.99.

Even secondary stars like <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4oL2?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Mewtwo VSTAR - GG44/GG70</strong></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXG4L?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Arceus VSTAR - GG70/GG70</strong></a> are each up 11% from their recent lows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're at a pivotal moment in the Pokémon TCG timeline. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review">Scarlet and Violet</a> era is drawing to a close, and with the Mega Evolution era moving in after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a> sets later this year, we’re about to enter the next generation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That transition turns <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/13/pokemon-sword-and-shield-review">Sword and Shield</a>-era sets like Crown Zenith into the odd category of not-so modern Pokémon cards. If historic price climbs tells us anything, <strong>cards become more valuable two generations out</strong>. We’ve seen this pattern with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-x-y">XY</a> and early <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/15/pokemon-sun-and-moon-review">Sun &amp; Moon</a> sets, and I expect Sword and Shield to follow suit alongside old <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025">Mega Evolution</a> Pokémon.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Sealed Product Price Comparison</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the pricing here by Amazon is insane, but there's some deals to be had when comparing these products to TCG Player. For example, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7YM4?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Super-Premium Collection</a> is a massive 56% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xEG5?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">market value</a>, so go with Amazon on that one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other end of the scale, TCG Player has <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnm1k?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection</a> at a massive 48% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXZv?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's current price</a>, which is very close to MSRP. I've compared all the prices in the carousel above, but another pro tip is clicking through to eBay to see if there's any new bargains to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Scarlet &amp; Violet era winds down with the upcoming <em>Black Bolt</em> and <em>White Flare</em> sets, collectors are already looking backward in anticipation of what’s next—namely, the long-awaited return of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-mega-evolutions-fast-charging-and-a-few-smart-picks">Mega Evolutions</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Think Peekaboo with bullets.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pubg-blindspot"><u>PUBG: Blindspot</u></a> is a cheeky little <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pubg-battlegrounds"><u>PUBG: Battlegrounds</u></a> spin off that's currently in development, and was playable on the show floor at IGN Live. It's a 5v5 top-down tactical shooter that has a classic team deathmatch mode - one we got hooked on even in the chaos of the gaming show floor - and a Demolition mode, that will see teams using traps and obstacles to outwit the enemy. It's been compared to a top-down Rainbow Six Siege and with good reason: to rack up the kills you're going to need to use your brain as well as your trigger finger. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Think 'Peekaboo with bullets'</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Forget all your FPS muscle memory, this is a top-down strategic PvP game where your cunning is as important as your reaction times. You're dropped into a map full of corners, windows, doorways - basically anything you can think of to make line of sight a key part of gameplay - and you have to hunt down your opponents before they pop one in your back. You can see the whole map, but you'll only see enemies if they're in your cone of vision or your teammates, which sounds simple until someone snipes you through a window while you're focused on the doorway at the end of a corridor. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. Demolition Mode is on the way </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While we didn't get to play the Demolition Mode, it sounds like a step up in complexity from the 5v5 deathmatch, adding a greater need for planning and teamwork. Production Director Seungmyeong Yang explained more about it at IGN Live. "Demolition Mode can commonly be found in other games such as Counter Strike or Valorant," he said. "In this Demolition Mode there is an attacking team and a defending team, and the defense team basically tries to block the attacking team from coming in and the attacking team tries to breach the building. It was really fun to see how the gamers react, they seem to really enjoy the game!" Demolition Mode is the inspiration for those Rainbow Six Siege comparisons, albeit it from a whole new top-down perspective. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PUBG: Blindspot at IGN Live</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Start your WASD warmups </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The keyboard and mouse controls are more like a twin-stick shooter set up, and it's going to take your brain a second to catch up to how they work. You control movement with WASD and your cone of vision with the mouse, while to aim and fire weapons you hold down the right mouse button. That will slow your movement, though, so it's always a balance between moving quickly to avoid enemy detection and choosing when to take your shots. Once you've mastered that you can focus on being more accurate, using the mouse wheel and keyboard to go for head shots, body shots, or aiming specifically at any crouched enemies. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. Character choice is key</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any team game, who you have in your five-person kill crew is going to matter. The build I played had 10 characters to choose from, each with pleasingly distinct looks and loadouts to keep things interesting. I'm not exactly a subtle operative, so I gravitated towards those with weapons that could cause carnage up close and personal, like bearded cowboy Collision, who packs a Winchester 1300 shotgun and booby traps; or Kayak, who has a semi-automatic O12 combat shotgun and a remote sticky bomb. Support players can go for Fanatic with her P90 and First Aid Kid, or sniper Buddy with her scanning drones. Some you might want to play just because of their character designs - I'm not usually one for Toxic Gas Grenades, but Dropdown has a sort of Dystopian Harley Quinn vibe that's hard to resist. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. You can play it in August</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no official release date for the full game, but there is a PC beta planned for August. Keep an eye on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Steam page</u></a> for updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar. She loves horror, horror movies, horror games, and French Bulldogs. Those extra wrinkles on her face are thanks to going time blind and staying up too late finishing every sidequest in RPGs like Fallout and Witcher 3.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-pubg-blindspot]]></content:encoded>

The creatures that dominated Earth ages ago, populating our world for 165 million years, will always be fascinating. And, on screen, as part of movie history, dinosaurs have always been a go-to genre for incredible spectacle and chilling thrills - whether you're into t-rexes, pterodactyls, raptors, or gentle giant brontosauruses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dinosaur movies transport us back in time to the era of these wondrous reptiles, while other instances show dinosaurs living among us, either on a secluded island lost to history or as cloned beings brought back by science for our amusement (and dismemberment). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Jurassic Park/World franchise has raked in over $6 billion in box office bucks over the past 30 years, proving that these glorious beasts can bring home the bacon. But which dinosaur films are the best?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are our picks of the 10 best dinosaur movies, from trampled theme parks to warring prehistoric titans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Looking for more movies featuring giant lizards?</strong> </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dragon-movies">The best dragon movies</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/godzilla-movies-in-order">Godzilla movies in order</a></li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Dinosaur Movies</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Jurassic Park (1993)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/nllhr4ja4wstlcbfb2bbwu-1681955831135.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Um, duh. Yup, not only is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/jurassic-park">Spielberg's Jurassic Park</a> one of the best "dinosaur movies ever," it easily doubles as one of the "best movies ever." Adapted from Michael Crichton's novel (and <em>second</em> story about a futuristic amusement park gone lethally haywire), Jurassic Park is endlessly entertaining and infinitely quotable, providing equal parts laughter and horror. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum star in this tyrannosaurus-sized tale about scientists evaluating a - er - unique family attraction before it opens to the public. Hold onto your butts, because this appraisal winds up with a body count.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">See our guide on how to watch the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-park-movies-in-order">Jurassic Park movies in order</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Jurassic World (2015)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/chris-pratt-bryce-dallas-howard-jurassic-world-1681955850181.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More than 20 years after the original Jurassic Park (which wound up becoming a trilogy), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/jurassic-park-iv">Jurassic World</a> kicked off a new segment of the franchise, with greedy corporations and opportunistic scientists learning nothing from previous tragedies and opening "Jurassic World" to patrons everywhere. Naturally, things go horribly awry and carnage ensues and Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard anchor a budding dino-apocalypse. The films would eventually bring back the original three stars but the first World installment stands tall as a formulaic but fun feast for the senses.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Land Before Time (1988)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/we-1681955967848.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, this Don Bluth animated classic blossomed into a decades-spanning franchise featuring 13 sequels, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/the-land-before-time">several video games</a>, and a TV series. The story of a young orphaned dinosaur named Littlefoot, who embarks on a great journey to find a paradise called the Great Valley, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-land-before-time">The Land Before Time</a> is a beautifully animated '80s staple. The saga teaches kids about the importance of friendship, the dangers of prejudice, and the power of hope. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dinosaur (2000)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/s-1681956084110.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Buena Vista Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/dinosaur">Disney's Dinosaur</a>, the company's 39th animated feature, finds a lot in common with The Land Before Time as it also follows a young orphaned dino, this time on a trek to discover to the idyllic Nesting Grounds after a meteor shower devastates their island. A mix of live-action, many of the backgrounds were filmed on location while the dinos themselves were computer-generated, making it the most expensive computer-animated film at the time. Voiced by D.B. Sweeney, Julianna Margulies, Alfre Woodard, Ossie Davis, Joan Plowright, and Hayden Panettiere.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Good Dinosaur (2015)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/nycu8byhvifswllfwdyd-1681956104324.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Walt Disney Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though it's technically the first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ranking-pixar-movies">Pixar film</a> to not quite meet profitable expectations, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-good-dinosaur">The Good Dinosaur</a> is wacky, charming family entertainment, supplemented by the voices of Sam Elliott, Anna Paquin, Jeffrey Wright, and three-time Oscar-winner Frances McDormand. Like most animated dino films, the story involves a thrilling, meaningful journey, though this time it's within an alternate history where reptilian dinosaurs never went extinct. In The Good Dinosaur, a shy Apatosaurus, Arlo, meets an unlikely human friend while traveling through a dangerous and mysterious landscape in order to return home.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>King Kong (1933)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/movie-king-kong-1933-wallpaper-preview-1681956195912.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: RKO Radio Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Most King Kong films are good for a ravenous dino or two, so why not revisit the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/king-kong-1933">1933 original</a> and watch humans discover Skull Island, home of not only Kong but prehistoric life of all kinds: including the Tyrannosaurus-rex, the Stegosaurus, the Pteranodon, and more. King Kong is a classic, famous for being a true spectacle at the time with game-changing special effects, from stop-motion pioneer Willis O'Brien. Kong is still thriving today, as part of Legendary's MonsterVerse, with the latest entry, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire">Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</a>, worth checking out too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Kong: Skull Island (2017)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/21/ymvm3eiygs303nvwjl0n-1682103563791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">King Kong's MonsterVerse reboot began with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/kong-skull-island">Kong: Skull Island</a>, a rollicking Vietnam War-era adventure starring Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, and John Goodman as a part of a mix of scientists, soldiers, and scholars trapped on Kong's dreaded isle of terrifying creatures. In a twist though, the island's usual dinosaurs have been beaten and eaten by new giant monsters, unique to the film and the MonsterVerse itself. And it totally works. Separating itself from the Jurassic Park/World franchise, Kong: Skull Island gave viewers a fresh batch of nightmare fuel to fawn over.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>One Million Years BC (1966)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/one-million-archelon-1681956482588.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Warner-Pathé Distributors</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This '60s British fantasy-adventure, from Hammer Films, starred Raquel Welch as a cavewoman struggling to survive in a fictional past where humans and dinosaurs coexisted. A remake of a film from 1940, One Million Years BC is a largely enjoyable, kitschy featuring dinosaurs (and giant sea-turtles) roaming a scortched Earth, brought to life by stop-motion genius, and Willis H. O'Brien apprentice, Ray Harryhausen (Jason and the Argonauts, Clash of the Titans).</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Valley Of Gwangi (1969)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/ew-1681956529069.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Warner Bros.-Seven Arts</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Harryhausen home run was cult dino-Western, The Valley Of Gwangi, as the stop-motion pro took over the project from mentor Willis O'Brien after O'Brien passed away before production. The story itself was conceived by O'Brien and combined cowboys and dinosaurs as a rodeo horse is revealed to be a fifty million-year-old, prompting members of a Wild West show to venture into Mexico's Forbidden Valley in search of fame and untold wealth. There, however, they confront prehistoric monsters, including "Gwangi," a giant dinosaur that decimates their ranks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Land of the Lost (2009)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/20/90-1681956714215.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Ferrell and Danny McBride turn a 1970s Sid and Marty Krofft TV series (which itself got a short-lived '90s revival) into a comedic romp in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/land-of-the-lost">Land of the Lost</a>, where a mysterious vortex sucks a disgraced scientist (Ferrell), his assistant (Anna Friel), and a survivalist Will (McBride) into a world populated by marauding dinosaurs and fantastically bizarre creatures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's it for our pick of the best dinosaur movies of all time. Did you favorite make the cut? Let us know in the comments.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Upcoming Dinosaur Movies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Two new dinosaur movies are in the works and are worth keeping an eye on. The first is the next installment in the Jurassic World series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/jurassic-world-rebirth">Jurassic World Rebirth</a>, due to release July 2, 2025. The second is a bit more of a mystery. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/it-follows">It Follows</a> director David Robert Mitchell is working on a dinosaur movie, set to release in 2026, which will feature Anne Hathaway and Ewan McGregor. According to rumors, the film has been <a href="https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2023/3/te3854nr94ytqtptif8gphqzlj0p4b" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">titled Flowervale Street</a> and is rumored to be about dinosaurs and set in the 80s.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dinosaur-movies]]></content:encoded>
