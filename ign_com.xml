We apologize for the error. We have edited the headline and article to round up the details in an explainer format rather than present it as new information, and make it clear there is still no news on retail pre-orders. Thank you to all for pointing out the error.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 were set to go live across the world on April 9, but economic chaos caused by Trump's tariffs forced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs">Nintendo to issue a delay in the U.S. first</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-tariff-pre-order-delay-hits-canada-too">then Canada</a>. Pre-orders went ahead as planned elsewhere, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-uk-1">including in the UK</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ posted to Nintendo’s website</a>, the first batch of invitations will go out starting May 8, 2025 for the My Nintendo Store. There is no information yet on retail pre-orders.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Additional batches of invitation emails will then be sent “periodically” until purchasing on My Nintendo Store is opened to everyone, Nintendo added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Initial invitation emails will be delivered on a first-come, first-serve basis to “eligible registrants who meet the priority criteria,” Nintendo explained. Invitees will have 72 hours from the time when the email is sent to complete their purchase.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order invitation priority requirements:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>you must have been the one who purchased any Nintendo Switch Online membership</li><li>you must have had any paid Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months, and</li><li>you must have opted in to share gameplay data and have at least 50 hours total gameplay hours.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no word on whether Nintendo plans to stick to its already announced pricing for the Switch 2, its games (some of which cost $79.99), and accessories, or increase them. Some analysts have expressed concern that Nintendo may be forced to raise the price of the base Switch 2 beyond $449.99 as a result of the ongoing tariff war, but Nintendo has yet to make an announcement one way or the other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Nintendo is bundling Mario Kart World with a Nintendo Switch 2 for $499.99, cutting the cost of the game by a huge $30 in the process. However, Nintendo has indicated this bundle is a limited-time offer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 pricing in the U.S.:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nintendo Switch 2 by itself: $449.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 with Mario Kart World bundled in: $499.99</li><li>Mario Kart World by itself: $79.99</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza: $69.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller: $79.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera: $49.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Controller pair: $89.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip: $34.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Strap: $12.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Wheel pair: $19.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set: $109.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector: $34.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case: $79.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter: $29.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has plenty of reaction to Nintendo’s jump to $80 for the Switch 2 generation, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>from analysts who have helped us understand why this has happened</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-backlash-against-10-nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-heats-up-reggie-fils-aim-tweets-the-story-of-wii-sports-pack-in-from-ign-interview-and-everyone-knows-the-point-hes-trying-to-make">we’ve got the story on former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé</a>, who pointed to the story of Wii pack-in game Wii Sports in thinly-veiled tweets addressing the controversy surrounding Nintendo’s decision to charge for Switch 2 tutorial game Welcome Tour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
