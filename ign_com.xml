The highly anticipated follow-up project to Embark’s The Finals will take a different route than fans of the developer may be used to.

Ebark says it went off without a hitch, encouraging the team to move forward with its fall release date while working a few new ideas into its plans, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The tech test was the best rehearsal we could get, ahead of what's shaping up as a big release this fall. It’s clear that players recognize the passion, effort, and craftsmanship that’s been poured into the making of <em>ARC Raiders</em>," Executive Producer Aleksander Grøndal said in a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The test also honed in on concrete things we’re addressing in this last stretch of development. There are bugs to squash, as well as general polish and performance improvements to be done. We're also fine-tuning game balance and the player economy, and will work on an even better onboarding experience for players who come in new to this genre. At release, the game will be further expanded, with more locations to explore, more adventures to embark on, and more for players to strive towards and discover."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More details about Arc Raider’s full launch will be revealed closer to its October release date.

It is aptly titled Code Vein 2, and it's due out 2026 across PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher Bandai Namco said the debut trailer, below, introduces "a post-apocalyptic world where memories of loss echo across time and the fate of the Revenants and humanity hangs by a thread."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect dynamic action with strategic combat, explorable environments, intense boss battles, and memorable characters that drive the rich narrative forward, players are called to wield time itself as a weapon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb:</p><blockquote>CODE VEIN II features a deep narrative where players and characters are bound by blood, fate, and destiny, set in a future where the last remnants of humanity and Revenants struggle against a world on the verge of collapse. Following the sudden emergence of a threat known as the Luna Rapacis, Revenants have succumbed to madness, transforming into terrifying creatures called Horrors. A Revenant Hunter, guided by a mysterious girl named Lou who possesses the power to travel into the past to rewrite the fate of the world. The player, as the Revenant Hunter, will intervene in key moments of history to alter key revenants’ destinies that reveal hidden truths and information to save the future.</blockquote><blockquote>Players will embark on a journey through a world that spans across two eras, where decisions carry weight and every battle tests skill and resolve. CODE VEIN II features distinctive gameplay for an action RPG, where players use blood drained from enemies to unlock a variety of powerful skills, build strategy for combat with Blood codes, and use unique weapons and equipment called Jails to overcome challenging foes and epic bosses. Players can also forge bonds with powerful Partner allies who fight alongside them and enhance their abilities. Each Partner offers distinct skills and deep narrative connections that shape the journey. Bandai Namco will reveal many more details about the rich universe and game play in CODE VEIN II in the future.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Code Vein was an anime soulslike action-RPG that launched in 2019. It <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/26/code-vein-review">earned a 7/10 from us</a> for its "enthusiasm for mixing things up and getting a little weird." Unshockingly, it's a game about vampires (well, Revenants) in a post-apocalyptic near-future, and it's heavily inspired by FromSoftware's Souls series. Code Vein got several DLC packs, concluding with Lord of Thunder in March of 2020, and the series has been quiet ever since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you need a catch up, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
