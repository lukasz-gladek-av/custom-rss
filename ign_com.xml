            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We asked our community just how far we should push the gore."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Lords of the Fallen II publisher CI Games has shown gameplay footage of its Soulslike sequel during The Game Awards 2025, featuring new character Omeuras and enemy limbs flying everywhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of tonight's showing, IGN asked CI Games for more detail on what we'd just seen, keen for more detail ahead of the game's  launch at some point in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most prominent in the trailer is Omeuras, who CI Games creative strategist Ryan Hill told IGN is one of the sequel's central characters. She's brought to life by Hannah Melbourne, who previously played Agrias Oaks in Final Fantasy Tactics, and The Sorceress in Path of Exile 2.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/11/1-4-1765476366423.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">"With the sequel, we wanted to craft a narrative that's more accessible and character-driven, while still honouring the environmental storytelling that Soulslike fans love," Hill said. "Players who want to dive deep into the lore absolutely can, but we also want every player to reach the end of the game understanding the journey they've taken and the pivotal role they've played in shaping this world."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another key focus in the trailer is Lords of the Fallen II's new dismemberment feature, which allows you to lop limbs off enemies like nobody's business. Lords of the Fallen has never been squeamish with its blood and guts, but its developers say they have heard the call from fans for even more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we asked our community just how far we should push the gore in the next Lords of the Fallen, the answer was loud and unanimous: 'go all in'," Hill noted. "This is a game made by adults for adults, and we didn't want to dilute the brutality or intensity of that experience. Soulslikes thrive on challenge, and that rush you get when defeating an enemy is unlike anything else. Enhancing that moment with a dynamic dismemberment system takes the satisfaction to another level - instead of enemies simply ragdolling to the floor, players can literally tear them apart."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, can every limb be removed? "Yes - every limb can be removed."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonight's showing for Lords of the Fallen 2 comes just hours after CI Games launched a final surprise update for its predecessor, capping off almost two years' of post-launch support that has helped turn player sentiment around. While those updates have been welcomed, CI Games said it had learnt from the experience, and been listening to fan feedback "from day one."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The journey from launch to Lords of the Fallen Version 2.5 (released yesterday) was transformative for our team. Over 70 updates later, the game evolved substantially, and that evolution was driven directly by our relationship with the community. Those learnings shaped not only how we build, but how we listen," Hill concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the sequel, we’ve been actively engaging our fast-growing community from day one, understanding exactly what they want from the next chapter. You can already see some of those requests reflected in our new gameplay reveal trailer: a more varied game world, more distinctive and memorable boss encounters, and a deeper, more meaningful Umbral realm experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Light at the end of the tunnel.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has fully unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> expansion Lord of Hatred, confirming that it includes not one but two new classes, including the Paladin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At The Game Awards 2025, Blizzard announced an April 28, 2026 release date for Lord of Hatred, which will see the Age of Hatred Saga, as Blizzard calls it, reach its climax. Campaign wise, players go up against eternal evil, Mephisto, but there’s a surprise return for Diablo 4 antagonist Lilith, who is back from the dead — shock horror! — after the events of the Diablo 4 campaign. Lord of Hatred adds the new region of Skovos, and there are significant gameplay changes, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big news here is a pre-purchase of Lord of Hatred grants immediate access to the Paladin class, which is a fan-favorite from Diablo 2 and one of the most-requested classes for Diablo 4. Blizzard didn’t say what the mystery second class is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the story setup:</p><blockquote>In the aftermath of Vessel of Hatred, this next chapter drives players toward their final stand against Mephisto, whose deception and spreading influence threaten to twist Sanctuary into a world consumed by malice. As Hell’s legions surge and the ancient Pools of Creation draw Mephisto ever closer, the fate of humanity hangs by a thread. To stop him, the Wanderer must embrace an old foe long believed to be dead. Lilith returns, her prophetic last words echoing true, forcing a perilous alliance bound by necessity rather than trust. With time and allies running out, the Wanderer is in a desperate race to stop Mephisto before hatred reshapes the world forever.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The Paladin, as you’d expect, revolves around hammer and shield gameplay, and smites enemies with Holy Light power. The mystery second class “looms on the dark horizon,” Blizzard said, adding: “its power undeniable, its arrival poised to reshape the battlefield when Lord of Hatred launches in April.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skovos is the ancestral birthplace of the first civilization and the former home of Lilith and Inarius. It stands as Sanctuary’s oldest and most storied region. Now ruled by The Oracle and the Amazon Queen, this never-before-seen in-game land blends volcanic coasts, storm-lashed forests, and waterlogged ruins steeped in forgotten lore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expansion also reworks the Skill Trees to introduce new class-specific variants and expanded level caps, offering fresh buildcraft and strategic depth across all eight classes. There’s a new Loot Filter system to help you target desired gear more efficiently. Crafting is enhanced, with the return of the Horadric Cube. The new Talisman unlocks powerful set bonuses, expanding late-game customization.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veteran players will be keen to know about the overhauled endgame, which you can tap into once you’ve finished the campaign. War Plans let players craft their own endgame progression path, selecting favored activities and layering strategic modifiers as they push toward high-value rewards. The Echoing Hatred stands as the Age of Hatred’s ultimate test: a relentless gauntlet of demonic hordes designed to challenge even the strongest builds. Meanwhile, for something completely different, the expansion adds Fishing!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lord of Hatred includes the full Vessel of Hatred expansion, which players can access instantly via pre-purchase. Players who pre-purchase gain early access to the Paladin class, one extra Stash Tab, two more Character Slots, and three World of Warcraft décor items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a> has a character never before seen in Robert Kirkman’s superhero universe: Ella Mental.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Revealed at The Game Awards 2025 with gameplay footage, Ella Mental — voiced by Tierra Whack — joins established characters such as Omni-Man and Invincible to flesh out the roster of playable characters in the 3v3 tag fighter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of her reveal, we got a chance to chat with not only Invincible series creator Robert Kirkman, but also several members of the development team at Quarter Up to find out some extra details about Ella Mental’s design, her playstyle, and some of the lessons that Quarter Up took away from their recent closed beta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So to start, Robert, what can you tell us about this new character?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Robert Kirkman: </strong>Ella Mental is a completely original character to the game. We're coming in with a new corner of the Invincible Universe. The team reached out to Cory Walker and myself, wanting to see if it would be okay to add somebody new to the game to shake things up. And Cory and I took it as an opportunity to put the old creation hat back on and come up with something new for the Universe. And it's been pretty great. This team is really devoted to Invincible and is really committed to making sure that this game is an authentic experience on par with the television show and the comic book and any other kind of Invincible you would experience. And so to have a new character running around and being added to and fleshed out by them is really awesome and gratifying. And I think it just makes this game that much cooler.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So obviously this is going to be a character that's a part of this new story mode that you're making for Invincible VS. Can you tell us a little bit about what their role is going to be in that story mode?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Rogers, narrative director: </strong>Yeah, we're not talking specific details in story mode just yet, but she will be appearing in the mode for sure. And you've seen a clip of how some of those characters interact with the principal Robot and Ella. And you'll have to wait and see exactly what the context, the wider context of all that is. But she's going to be a pretty pivotal part of the story and a pivotal part of the rest of the game too, because we've put a lot of love and effort into designing her kit and how she fights and what her personality's like and everything in between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: We can see in the trailer that she is voiced by Tierra Whack. Can you tell us a little bit about what it was like working with her? What was the casting process like?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rogers: </strong>Working with Tierra was awesome. When we were trying to figure out how we were going to bring Ella to life and who would be the right person for her, Tierra was someone we thought of pretty early on. And we knew that Tierra was a big fan of the Invincible franchise. And I feel really lucky that she came aboard. She responded to the material really strongly. I think she identified with some of the stuff that we've written there and really, really brought a passion and a drive to the character. And I think that really helped heighten what we wrote and really bring this character that was so nascent to life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I'm really excited about all of her VO and how well it fits with what we envision for the character from the attacks to just like the conversations that they have. She's positive, she's energetic, but she's got this slight sardonic edge to her. And I think Tierra really brings that side of it to the character. So I couldn't be happier, and I think the whole team feels that way.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/tierra-whack-headshot-1765381738336.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">American rapper and singer Tierra Whack plays Ella Mental in Invincible VS.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Speaking of those attacks, I know you can't really go into story details, but can you tell us a little bit about how she will play, what her play style is in the actual game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette, executive producer: </strong>Oh, a lot of mid-range, some long-range zoning, a lot of chargeable attacks, every element. There's stuff that she just does to manipulate space even in front of her so she can bring up earth to block attacks… it acts as a deterrent to trying to get in on her, and she can shatter it, and you can see part of that in the little glimpse of the video. But she uses water, fire, air, and earth to get around. We really wanted something different. So when we asked politely — begged Robert — like, "Hey, this would be a great idea to add a new character, and we'd love for something that's just different that we haven't really explored before that we think we could have some creative gameplay," Robert and Cory are like, "Oh, we'll get back to you," because it sounded really exciting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so as soon as we saw the concepts, we're like, ****, we know what we're going to do. So then we had to get creative and say like, "Oh, how do we solve this?" We're like, "What kind of attacks? What do we think we can pull off?" And that's when we go to Dan [Eder]. We're like, "Dan, what do you think for the art? What can we pull off?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Robert, you mentioned something about putting the creative hat back on. What was that like coming back to the world of Invincible to create this new story for this game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kirkman: </strong>I feel like I've never left the world of Invincible just because I went right from the comic to the TV show. So it's just nice to do more. One fun aspect of Ella Mental is that she was backwards engineered to be in a video game. So when Cory [Walker] and I sat down, it was like, well, what are the deficiencies of the Invincible characters in the context of a video game? And we don't have a lot of projectile throwing characters, and we don't really have anybody that throws fireballs or hits people with rocks. And we have names that we kick around every now and then because a lot of Invincible names are like a normal name that fits inside a different word.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so we'd just be sitting around hanging out and we'd be like, "Ella Mental, that's something we can do something with at some point in the future because it's like Elemental." And then the name Ella is in there. Look at that. That's how creative we are just to completely nail it down. And so we had that in our back pocket. And so it was like, "Oh, we can do something with this Ella Mental name and do some cool stuff with it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Coming around to Dan, what was the process like of bringing this character to life in terms of from concept art to putting her in the game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dan Eder, art director: </strong>I think it was completely different from any other character because we didn't have any reference. Essentially, we got a sketch from Cory, which was amazing, by the way. And then we're like, "How do we make this work in our game? Just if we put her next to the rest of the roster, does she look like she belongs in the same universe?" And I think instantly the answer was yes, but there was still a lot of room to flesh her out in terms of general level of detail and facial features and certain readability related concerns when it comes to some of her elements and just overall color palette, that kind of stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the first thing we did was just try to extrapolate. We looked at the concept, and then we did our own version based on Cory's concept, which was a lot more in line with just the overall art style of the game, but it still kept it very, very authentic to the original design from Cory. I think over time she really evolved, both in terms of her features as well as once we got in those moves on the gameplay side, that really informed us on the visuals like, well, how much do we want to lean into the color palette for the elements and have that be represented in her eyes, for example, which glow based on the element that she's currently casting?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I think very quickly we landed on something that we all felt surprisingly, shockingly happy with very, very early on. Because I think when you design a new character, you don't expect it to be this smooth, not for me anyway, because again, there's so much room for error, which I feel like we dodged a lot of those traps that we could have fallen into with an original character that you'd expect. And I think players, when they get to experience this character for the first time, they're going to be shocked by how integrated she feels into the universe and how her interactions with other characters, as you saw with Robot and Rex and Mark in the trailer, those kinds of interactions are going to feel natural. And I think if you're not an Invincible fan, I wouldn't blame you for thinking she was part of the comics or the show because it feels that real.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Coming back to Robert, you also oversaw Telltale's The Walking Dead. And I know that this is a very different style of game compared to The Walking Dead, but I wonder, has the experience working on Invincible VS been similar at all?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kirkman: </strong>I think it's been similar in that the team at Telltale was so plugged in and so dedicated that my overseeing was a few casual conversations. "This is what makes Walking Dead cool." And then going, "Hey, that looks really great. Hey, that looks really great. That's really working well." And the experience working with the Quarter Up team has been the same. We've talked early on about things, and I've worked with Mike and Helen Leigh on giving a few story points and things like that, but really it's just been a wealth of just sitting back and being like, "Oh my gosh, this is awesome. This is working great. This is looking great." Everything I've seen from Dan, the way the game is structured, it's all just terrific.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So myself, Cory Walker, Ryan Ottley, we really take it seriously that we are the stewards of this brand and we need to make sure that all things are authentic and that it's providing an additive experience for an Invincible fan. But with this one, we had to do very little because the team was just as dedicated to that as we were. And the talent behind this game really shows through and everything that you see from it. And it's been a really remarkable experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Were you a fighting game fan coming in, or has the process of working on this game gotten you more into the genre at all?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kirkman: </strong>Yeah, I'm a huge fighting game fan. Street fighter, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, I love all those games. I still try to keep up, but I will say that sometimes I get a little lost in how complicated they can get and how much better everyone is than me. And I think that that's one of the things that this game tackles really well. You can sit down with this game and just have fun button mashing and be like, "Oh, I did some really cool combos. That looked really nice. I wish I knew how I did that." But at the same time, there's a lot of elements to the game that once you get into it and you're having a lot of fun, you can really dive deep and learn some really complicated things that are really impressive. And it's great that you can have both levels of play in the same game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's really great. And honestly, an Invincible fighting game is almost the thing that I've always wanted out of Invincible more than a show or a movie or whatever. And so to finally have it and to have it be as good as this game is, is really a high watermark of my life, to be completely clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: And then the final question for the Quarter Up crew, you recently had a closed alpha test period. Can you give some overall thoughts on how it went and what some of the main points of feedback you received from it were?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Willette: </strong>Oh, absolutely. It was a fantastic time. We got to play with so many people across different ecosystems, like whether they're playing on Xbox or PlayStation. Got to see people get really sweaty that quickly over three days. That was really impressive. So for us, it was really a network test, but it was also an opportunity to see how people interacted with the system, how much time it was taking them to acclimate to certain things that really separate our game from other games, which is really our Omni-Tag system. It's like the fluidity of tagging in and out. And the game is really about team and team-centric tactics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So by day three, really seeing people capitalize on not just the active tag and assist system, but counter tags, assist breakers, when to use snaps, when not to, taking advantage of arena shifts, the people that found them and were using them a lot, and then just different nasty setups. So whether I was watching A FOxy Grampa or Mustard or Maximilian Dood or Diaphone or just all the other streams that we had going on and then just getting lots of feedback. So things that people wanted with trijumps or certain things that looped or things they wanted improved with motion inputs or just all these things that we've been taking in that feedback and we've been actively updating the game preparing for launch with this feedback in mind. So everything was fantastic from our perspective of just getting that many people into play and getting that quality feedback and just the good, the bad, the ugly, everything. It was a great, great experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Awards 2025 trailer confirmed an Invincible VS release date of April 30, 2026 across Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">We just got our first look at the debut game from Nagoshi Studio, the studio formed by Toshihiro Nagoshi under NetEase after he departed Ryu Ga Gotoku in 2021. It's called Gang of Dragon, and it sure looks an awful lot like Yakuza!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer follows a man in a suit walking through the streets of Japan, before being knifed by a shady person. It then jumps to the same man, unknifed, sitting in a small bar as a group of Yakuza walk in and demand to settle up. The man's phone rings, he has a brief, cryptic conversation, before breaking out into a fist fight that he wins handily despite the Yakuza having guns. He then exits the bar unscathed and marches down the street, only to reveal the iconic sign that marks the real-life entrance to Kabukichō, the inspiration for the Yakuza series' Kamurocho.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The logo flashes, Gang of Dragon, briefly with the first letter of each word spelling out GOD highlighted. Sorry, no release date or platforms at this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the first game from Nagoshi Studio, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-series-creator-toshihiro-nagoshi-establishes-nagoshi-studio-at-netease-games">Toshihiro Nagoshi started in 2022</a> under NetEase after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-creator-toshihiro-nagoshi-confirms-sega-departure-like-a-dragon-sequel">he left Ryu Ga Gotoku in 2021</a>. It's for that reason and that reason alone that we know this can't be a Yakuza/Like a Dragon game <em>despite it looking very very much like one,</em> right down to the setting. It will be interesting to see how Nagoshi threads the needle of making something new after essentially creating and overseeing the Yakuza series for so long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at The Game Awards <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">right here.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Described as an emotionally-rich, charming-yet-dark adventure with puzzle-platforming elements, the game will feature dungeons, forests and bogs to explore as Gertie collaborates with an odd familiar. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The dungeons have been plundered and the monsters long slain," reads an official blurb for the game. "As the heroes move on, an elderly witch quietly gets to work. Coven of the Chicken Foot<em> </em>is a single-player adventure about the building of a bond between an elderly witch named Gertie and a peculiar creature, who must learn to work together to fulfill an oath. As their trust deepens, a dark revelation of what they’re up against will make them question their commitment to the oath and to each other."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wildflower Interactive is built on the notion of pushing myself creatively and working with like-minded creative people, driven by a strong desire to continue the conversation about what kind of experiences video games can deliver," Straley said in a statement today. "We’re doing that with Coven of the Chicken Foot. It nods at the fun and simplicity of old school games, while also evolving the pairing of storytelling and interactivity in a new, challenging way. I’m very proud of what we’ve built at Wildflower and can’t wait for people to explore the world we’re creating and get to know our lovable duo."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no word yet on a release date, just confirmation that Coven of the Chicken Foot is coming to PC via Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"There is no dice-rolling in the game."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise has been steadily making more attempts to expand into video games, and we're seeing that next effort with Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a new open-world single-player action-adventure that's all about wielding dark magic to battle foes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just revealed at The Game Awards 2025, Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the next project from developer Invoke Studios, the creators of Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance. Set in the D&amp;D universe, Warlock focuses on the adventures of the warrior Kaatri, who embraces newfound dark powers to unleash some otherworldly magic in her fight against the forces invading the land.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Warlock is a third-person action-adventure game built around immersive, expressive magic where you use spellcraft to solve challenges and take down monsters — and you do it all in your own creative way across all facets of the game," said Jeff Hattem, creative lead at Invoke Studios.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">​Prior to the reveal, we got an early look at Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons and learned from the developers about the game's approach to "immersive, expressive magic" in its third-person combat and exploration across a connected open world. In the CG trailer, we get to see a variety of foes, such as undead warriors and even a Beholder monster that has been the bane of many D&amp;D veterans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">​According to the developers, the new action-adventure is all about stepping into the "warlock fantasy," and the main narrative will be leaning into the lore of the D&amp;D universe to focus on the story of Kaati — played by Tricia Helfer of Battlestar Galactica fame — as she goes down the path of the warlock. As it goes with D&amp;D, warlocks form bonds with otherworldly beings known as Patrons, and the relationship between Kaatri and her patron will be one of the campaign's core stories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">​The developers stated that the gameplay would lean into player agency, with players using Kaatri's abilities and magic to overcome challenges. Though the team would not say outright whether it has immersive-sim qualities, they pointed to their previous work on games like Watch Dogs, Deus Ex, and Far Cry for the type of experiences Warlock aims to channel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That freeform nature is a critical part of the traditional tabletop experience. However, the devs were clear that this new action-adventure is not really a traditional RPG. They also believe that its player-agency-driven experience will serve as a solid entry point for newcomers to the D&amp;D universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're not trying to simulate the tabletop RPG experience, so there is no dice-rolling in the game — we're trying to really deliver a video-game experience first," said Dominic Guay, studio lead at Invoke Studios. "If you are not familiar with Dungeons and Dragons, you are not going to feel friction, like in that you're missing details of the world. But if you are a fan of the universe, you are going to be really excited about what we are doing with the lore of the series for Warlock."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After we only got a look at the CG trailer, the developers stated that a larger gameplay reveal is set for later in summer 2026.
