            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After half a dozen hours in the earliest moments of the upcoming pirate RPG Sea of Remnants, I was left with tons of questions about how this one will ultimately turn out, whether it was the currently barebones turn-based combat system, the convoluted labyrinth of vendors and upgrade paths that reminded me a bit of an MMO, or the story and dialogue that were sometimes difficult to follow given this early build’s lack of English voice acting or reliable subtitles. But one thing that was never in doubt throughout all of that is just how much this colorful, over-the-top adventure is already absolutely dripping with style that’s so unbelievably hard to look away from, it made me eager to see more in spite of those rough edges. Seriously, the cartoonish characters, exaggerated (and often hilarious) animations, and gorgeous menus are some of the coolest I’ve seen since Persona 5, and even when I didn’t understand everything that was happening, I often couldn’t help but smile ear-to-ear. The version I played is so early and unfinished, it’s still pretty hard to tell if this will deliver in plenty of other areas, from gameplay to technical stability, but there’s plenty of time before the unspecific 2026 launch window to iron all that out, and it already has so much unique charm that I’m officially adding this one to my list of games to follow closely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before I get into what I liked and didn’t like in my time with Sea of Remnants, it’s worth mentioning again that what I played appeared to be an extremely early build that was quite unfinished and prone to all sorts of bugs and rocky technical performance. I’m used to playing unfinished products months and sometimes years before they see the light of day, but even by that measure, this one felt especially under construction. Menus and dialogue were riddled with placeholder text, crashes and bugs were quite frequent, and the entire thing hadn’t been optimized for non-Mandarin speakers like myself, which often left things lost in translation. For all of these reasons and more, it was more than a little hard to tell how things will pan out, both from a technical perspective and where gameplay is concerned, since many ideas were clearly extremely unbaked. Keep that in mind as you watch this video.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What I do know about Sea of Remnants is that it’s playing in a lot of the same space as Sea of Thieves, with open-world high seas to explore as a pirate crew and islands to visit, filled with loot waiting to be plundered. But it also distinguishes itself with unexpected elements, like the turn-based combat that happens when you’re ashore, or the RPG/MMO mechanics that accompany it – to the point where I’m not even sure what odd blend of genres the final product is shooting for, and every 30 minutes came with another surprise that added to that confusion, like how, late in the demo, I learned there were hundreds of recruitable companions I could take with me on voyages and build bonds with. And this is all without having been able to see any of the planned multiplayer components in action, as this will all apparently be taking place in an online world where you can interact with other pirate captains.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not even sure what odd blend of genres the final product is shooting for.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, a lot of the ideas Sea of Remnants threw at me were pretty hard to get a sense for in this build, like the turn-based combat, where my buccaneer crew and I crossed swords and blunderbusses with rival skallywags and local fauna. While beautifully animated, the bits I played were also extremely oversimplified, either due to the section I played being pretty early on in the adventure, or just because it was quite clearly still a work in progress. As a big fan of turn-based battles, I’m hopeful they can flesh out some of the mechanics here to reach the heights of some of my recent favorites like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 or Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, but for now it mostly reminded me of a very stripped-down version of Persona 5.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that, no matter how unfinished any aspect of Sea of Remnants was, it was consistently and without exception one of the most interesting games I’ve played in a long time. The humanoid characters (all of which are puppets for some reason) have a ton of personality despite their wooden faces, and their exaggerated animations really cracked me up. And despite having Sea of Thieves pirate vibes, I rarely felt like I knew what was going to happen next, like how after beating a giant ape boss on an island and getting back on my boat to go home, I suddenly found myself under attack by that same monkey out for revenge, who now captained his own vessel and blasted me with cannon fire. Then, even though I sent him to Davy Jones’ locker, my ship was sunk moments later anyway in the most silly cutscene imaginable. I still feel like I don’t really understand what it will feel like to play the final product, as it swings so wildly between juggling an inventory of loot, blasting cannons on a boat, and choosing between very confusing dialogue options with various party members, but even though playing through that confusion was often a little unintuitive, I certainly can’t say it wasn’t interesting – quite the opposite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also really nice to see such a unique setting, because although there’s a lot of typical piracy shenanigans you might expect, there are also really strange concepts peppered throughout that kept me on my toes, like how my journey started out with me finding the moon buried beneath the sea (!?), or how the marionette characters apparently lose their memory whenever they’re destroyed on an adventure, but always find themselves back inside the main island of Orbtopia to begin again. There’s also a really distinct punk vibe throughout the entire world, as everything is covered with graffiti and many of the characters act like reckless teenagers who cut class to cosplay as mischievous pirates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big question with Sea of Remnants is if its unmistakably cool presentation and interesting hodgepodge of ideas can actually come together into something coherent, and I truly feel no closer to answering that after more than six hours with it. For now, it’s definitely interesting and distinctive enough for me to anxiously wait to see more, but we’ll likely need to wait a fair bit longer before we can get a better feel for how it’s shaping up – especially when it comes to technical performance and the online aspects that were completely absent from this build.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The big question with Sea of Remnants is if its unmistakably cool presentation and interesting hodgepodge of ideas can actually come together into something coherent.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I can definitely see the beginnings of a vision here though, where the punk aesthetic and killer art style play well with over-the-top ship combat and slower, more tactical turn-based battles on foot to create something really special. Plus, we can always use more pirate fantasy in our lives, and I can already tell that this goofy take on the genre will bring a very fresh perspective. Granted, I have no idea how they’ll make online multiplayer, where friends would presumably come along for the ride, work with the turn-based combat and NPC party members. But hey – if they manage to pull it off it sounds like it’d be awesome, and if they don’t at least it’ll be something unique nonetheless.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sea-of-remnants-preview-sea-of-thieves-piracy-meets-persona-5-stylishness-but-is-it-more-than-skin-deep]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has said that Leon S. Kennedy is a "bad match for horror" amid ongoing speculation he is a yet-to-be-revealed second protagonist for Resident Evil Requiem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/brief-look-at-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-reveals-first-person-footage">fresh look at Requiem shown</a> during the publisher's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-spotlight-june-2025-everything-revealed">Capcom Spotlight 2025 broadcast</a>, the floppy-haired fan-favorite was nowhere to be seen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, his absence was made notable by the fact that Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi offered an umprompted explanation for why Leon, of all past Resident Evil protagonists, had not been picked as this particular game's star.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The protagonist this time is an intelligence analyst for the FBI, Grace Ashcroft," said Nakanishi, explaining that the new character was a good fit for Requiem's renewed horror focus. "She's introverted and easily scared, which is a new type of character for the Resident Evil series." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We wanted someone that experiences horror from the same perspective as the player," he continued. "She learns to overcome her fears throughout the course of the story, but she's also an analyst for the FBI who's trained with guns, and is able to act with calm deductive reasoning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom's first trailer for Requiem, aired earlier this month, introduced Ashcroft and the game's returning Raccoon City setting in a manner that only fuelled the flames of fan speculation that Leon would also feature in some capacity. Indeed, fans were quick to spot <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-secretly-stars-leon-fans-believe-as-trailer-easter-eggs-and-actors-resume-potentially-point-to-his-return">a number of clues they said pointed to Leon's presence</a> — including his old truck, still parked outside the ruins of the Raccoon City Police Department.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem First Gameplay Screenshots — Capcom Spotlight 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Is the recent fan speculation around Leon's presence why Capcom has addressed his apparent absence now? Here's what Nakanishi said next, on the character's status in the game:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We always thought about making Leon the protagonist," Nakanishi explained, "but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn't jump at a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he's actually quite a bad match for horror."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this Capcom ruling Leon out of Requiem? Nakanishi seems clear that the combat-tested Leon would no longer work as the hero of a game focused around horror. But the publisher also stopped short of ruling the character out altogether. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leon's status is clearly an important enough talking point that Capcom decided to include discussion of it in tonight's showing — which still showed only a fragment of the full game. With more than six months still to go, Capcom will of course have more up its sleeve to reveal. Could this all be some kind of ruse, and Leon still be a part of it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recent entries in the Resident Evil series have taken different approaches to balancing horror and action — some to better results than others — but it's worth remembering how popular the Leon-focused, action-heavy Resident Evil 4 remains among fans. Could Capcom still be holding back a look at Requiem's more action-heavy moments, where Leon <em>would </em>be a better fit? There's still plenty of time left for the publisher to tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem will launch on February 27, 2026 across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

It's coming on June 30, which we already kind of new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-details-including-release-date-leaked-by-playstation">given that it leaked earlier this week</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The update brings two brand new hunts: Seregios, from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, and Lagiacrus. Lagiacrus is a long-desired returning monster from Monster Hunter Tri, and is known for its agility underwater and its rivalry with Rathalos. Though most of Lagiacrus' fight in Monster Hunter: Wilds won't take place underwater due to the player not really being able to fight while swimming, there will be some elements of the hunt that take place underwater, including some special interactions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the new monsters, there will be a number of other new bits. With the update itself on June 30, new features such as layered weapons (finally), new photo mode settings, the ability to swap handlers, a new collaboration gesture that involves a Fender guitar, a new free gesture set, new paid cosmetic items, and various other rewards and equipment additions hit the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On July 23, there will be a seasonal event entitled Festival of Accord: Flamefete. It will run until August 6 and feature limited-time equipment and other perks. And then on July 30, a new Arch-tempered monster, Arch-temered Uth Duna, will appear, along with its own challenge quest and equipment rewards (that are, frankly, gorgeous).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review"><u>Monster Hunters Wilds an 8 when we reviewed it at launch,</u></a> saying: "Monster Hunter Wilds continues to smooth off the rougher corners of the series in smart ways, making for some extremely fun fights but also lacking any real challenge."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter: Wilds' second free title update is completely free to anyone who already owns the game, and will drop in just four days, on June 30. You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-spotlight-june-2025-everything-revealed">everything else from the Capcom Spotlight today</a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-spotlight-june-2025-everything-revealed"> right here.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has revealed our first look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> gameplay in brief snippets shown during a livestream.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Capcom Spotlight event, Capcom showed a small portion of first-person gameplay, heavy on the horror and featuring new protagonist FBI Agent Grace Ashcroft. We see the character slowly move around creepy corridors with just a lighter for company. At one point, we see Ashcroft turn around to see a hulking humanoid creature close in on her from the shadows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In another clip of first-person gameplay we see Ashcroft explore a grand hallway, this time holding a handgun (as an FBI agent Ashcroft is handy with guns). She's also able to "act with calm, deductive reasoning," and we see her inspect a toolbox in the classic Resident Evil up close style to demonstrate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, we get a very brief look at third-person Resident Evil Requiem gameplay where Ashcroft is, once again, exploring creepy corridors and poorly lit rooms. We see that horrible creature again, casually stomping in the shadows.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the video, Capcom developers explain how the first-person perspective makes for "tense, realistic gameplay," whereas playing in third-person via the over-the-shoulder camera lets you see "more of the action." The third-person persepctive is "great for people who enjoy action-heavy gameplay," Capcom added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem lets players switch between first- and third-person through the Options menu at any point during the campaign. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview">Resident Evil Requiem hands-on preview</a> for more information.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem First Gameplay Screenshots — Capcom Spotlight 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Capcom confirmed Resident Evil Requiem takes place 30 years after the missile strike on Raccoon City that occurs at the end of Resident Evil 3, which explains the enormous crater we saw in the announcement trailer. Indeed, the name "Requiem" was chosen because, as Capcom explains it: "This game is a requiem, a eulogy to those who came before."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no big Leon Kennedy reveal, as some fans had hoped for — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-secretly-stars-leon-fans-believe-as-trailer-easter-eggs-and-actors-resume-potentially-point-to-his-return">and even expected</a>. If the Resident Evil veteran is playable in the game, perhaps that reveal will come later. It's worth noting Capcom developers issued some interesting comments around Leon and Resident Evil Requiem in the video, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">which we go over here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches February 27, 2026, across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.
