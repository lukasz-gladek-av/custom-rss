That's at least for now, as these values could still change wildly in the coming weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet, suppose you were hoping to snag these rare cards without dropping a fortune, tough luck, as standalone prices on these bad boys likely won't change <em>that </em>much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collector Boosters were the only real shot to pick them up, and they’ve already vanished from shelves. The only ones left are with online <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-marvel-spider-man-collector-boosters-where-to-buy">resellers, who are asking over $1,000</a> for a box of just 12 packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if you’re opening packs this week (particularly if you were lucky and snagged some Collector Boosters before the rush), these are some of the priciest cards to look out for, courtesy of data from our friends at <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmOL3J?object_uuid=4961587e-d852-4f11-9066-c4dac800fbad&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer</u></a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10 - Gwenom, Remorseless (Extended Art)</h2><div catalogid="8aa3497f-fa73-497f-8555-4115b2258112" id="228365"><div id="228365" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gwenom, Remorseless</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kicking off the list with a banger, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjdkq?object_uuid=4961587e-d852-4f11-9066-c4dac800fbad&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Gwenom, Remorseless</u></a> is a Venomized version of Gwen.
