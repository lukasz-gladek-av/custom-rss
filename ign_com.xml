Or the more action-packed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tower-defense-simulator-roblox">Tower Defense Simulator</a>? Maybe even catching fish in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fisch-roblox">Fisch</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whichever “Roblox experience” has you or someone you know hooked, I’m sure it has microtransactions (things to spend real money on) in one form or another. Roblox gift cards can be converted into the Robux needed to make those purchases, and those gift cards happen to be included in Amazon's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Black Friday sales</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are slight discounts on digital gift cards, the best savings you can possibly get is by going physical: Right now, you can get <a href="https://zdcs.link/92bnVY?object_uuid=629e0141-5dfd-4b1f-a775-c8b0f7bf2b13&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a full $10 off $50 Roblox gift cards</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Roblox Black Friday Deal: $50 Gift Card for $40</h2><div catalogid="b9d778fc-984a-4acf-ab01-0de3d67a709b" id="212474"><div id="212474" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Roblox Physical Gift Card [Includes Free Virtual Item]</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Equivalent to 4500 Robux, redeemable worldwide</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re doing some holiday shopping over Black Friday, a physical Roblox gift card is an unbeatable stocking stuffer. Though, I have to admit, getting $50 worth of Robux at a $10 discount is something you could even gift to yourself. A $50 gift card is equivalent to about 4,500 Robux. By saving $10, you're basically getting 900 Robux for free. Act fast, however, because I'm sure this Lightning Deal will sell out quick. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on what month you redeem your Roblox gift card, you’ll also get a different free virtual item. In November, that gift is the Midnight Crimson Sombrero, but if you wait until December, you’ll get the Festive Deadpan Alpaca Head.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Does Roblox Have Its Own Black Friday Sale? </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox as a platform doesn’t have an "official" Black Friday sale, but you might find deals, discounts, and special events within specific experiences. Feel free to scroll through <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp63DZ?object_uuid=629e0141-5dfd-4b1f-a775-c8b0f7bf2b13&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Roblox store on Amazon</a> for more discounts, or check out our roundups of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-black-friday-best-deals-2024">best Black Friday gaming deals</a> from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-best-black-friday-deals-2024-live">Nintendo</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals-black-friday-2024">Xbox</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-playstation-black-friday-deals-2024">PlayStation</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>How to Redeem Roblox Gift Cards</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you've received a Roblox Gift Card, you’ll want to head over to <a href="https://roblox.com/redeem" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roblox.com/redeem</u></a>. From there, you will need to do the following:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Log into an existing Roblox account (or register for the first time) </li><li>Find the PIN/Code on the Gift Card and enter it into the white box on the website</li><li>Click the Redeem button</li><li>If successful, a success message will appear on screen and Credit will be added to the associated account</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations!

Glad to have been wrong on this one.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Garry's Mod (@gmodofficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/gmodofficial/status/1862466757589418048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Garry’s Mod was named the best-selling PC exclusive of all-time by the Guinness Book of Records, beating out the likes of World of Warcraft and its expansions. At the time, <a href="https://x.com/gmodofficial/status/1834185126206488932" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newman joked</a> that he “never imagined becoming a world record holder and not be prawn cocktail crisps related.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Garry's Mod lets you play with models from Valve games developed on the Source engine, and its enduring popularity has seen it remain in steam’s top 100 most-played games list for years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Newman said the “Skibidi Toilet guys” had hit him with a DMCA in a wild bit of litigious irony. But soon after, an account purporting to be Skibidi Toilet creator Alexey Gerasimov (DaFuq!?Boom) said he wasn’t behind the claim, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-modskibidi-toilet-dmca-claim-has-been-resolved-creator-garry-newman-says">Newman then told IGN that the matter had been “resolved.”</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Newman had shared the news about the Skibidi Toilet DMCA, including pasting a screenshot of the letter he was sent. The copyright holder the letter was attributed to was <a href="https://inviz.tv/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Invisible Narratives</u></a>, the film and TV production studio that’s partnering with Michael Bay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skibidi-toilet-film-reportedly-in-the-works-from-michael-bay"><u>on a Skibidi Toilet film</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The letter Newman posted specifically cited Skibidi Toilet characters Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, and Titan TV Man, saying they were "all registered copyrights that are unique and representative of our brand." Sure enough, <a href="https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&amp;ti=1,1&amp;Search%5FArg=Titan%20Cameraman&amp;Search%5FCode=TALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=Gr6jPAL716R1MnV450HxzbpYaFF0b&amp;SEQ=20240730153403&amp;SID=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a public catalog search reveals</u></a> that Invisible Narratives had indeed claimed a copyright for Titan Cameraman and three other unpublished works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The letter added that “significant revenue is being generated by unauthorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere." The irony was not lost on Newman, who declared: “can you believe the cheek?” Skidibi Toilet, of course, is largely made with assets from Half-Life 2, and was originally created in Garry’s Mod.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-mod-removing-all-nintendo-content-from-steam-workshop-after-takedown-request">Facepunch removed all Nintendo-related content on Garry's Mod</a> - what amounted to 20 years of uploads - from Steam Workshop after receiving a takedown request from Nintendo. Newman is currently working on a successor to Garry's Mod called S&amp;box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
