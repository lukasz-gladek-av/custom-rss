            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick is teasing a bright future for the Mafia franchise after this year’s prequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, “performed well ahead of expectations.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick spoke about the future of 2K Games’ long-running open-world crime series during an interview with IGN ahead of Take-Two's Q2 financial report (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">the one with the latest GTA 6 delay</a>). As developer Hangar 13 prepares to release new content and updates following The Old Country’s launch in August, the Take-Two boss teased that fans may eventually have more Mafia to look forward to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Definitely,” Zelnick said when asked if The Old Country performed well enough to instill confidence to continue the franchise. “We’re really excited about Mafia, and I think that’s a great question because it is sort of a reset for the franchise. We don’t have anything to announce — that comes from the label — but it definitely performed well ahead of expectations."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like the decision to sell Mafia: The Old Country at a cheaper than expected $49.99 price point paid off, then. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-the-move-to-80-video-games-kicks-in-gamers-point-to-mafia-the-old-country-and-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-hope-the-50-trend-succeeds">Fans praised The Old Country's $50 price tag when it was confirmed</a>, and publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 managed expectations by stressing pre-launch that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-mafia-the-old-country-to-gta-6-dev-says-theyre-not-as-similar-as-youd-think">it was absolutely <em>not</em> a Grand Theft Auto-style open-world game, but a linear, narrative-driven game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two stopped short of providing exact sales figures but said the early 1900s Sicily-set Mafia “quickly surpassed our internal expectations and affirmed our belief that consumer demand remains strong for premium, narrative-driven experiences that over-index on value.” Although it’s unclear when or how another Mafia game could materialize in the future, more new content and updates for The Old Country are confirmed to be in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mafia: The Old Country launched in August as a prequel for the crime drama video game franchise that first got its start with the original Mafia in 2002. The series saw semi-regular releases up until the launch of the divisive Mafia 3 in 2016, with only a group of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-definitive-edition"><u>well-received definitive edition remasters</u></a> arriving to break up the wait for more in 2020. After nearly a decade of waiting for a new entry, it sounds like fans won't have to wait quite as long for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hangar 13 and 2K propped The Old Country up as a fresh start for Mafia when it released earlier this year, and it appears to be a plan that’s panning out. We called it “Great” in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-review"><u>8/10 review</u></a>. At the time of its release, we said, “Mafia: The Old Country is a conventional but effective return to the linear and tightly story-driven format of the original Mafia and Mafia II, and it boasts a wonderful eye and ear for detail.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on The Old Country, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-dev-confirms-free-ride-mode-is-on-the-way-as-part-of-a-free-update"><u>the Free Ride mode</u></a> it received as part of a free update a few months back.

He admitted the launch was met with “a little bit of softness” due to technical issues that have since become infamous in the Borderlands community, but he remains confident “it’ll all be made up,” given enough time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those technical issues resulted in "a little bit of softness out of the gate on the U.S. sales side, but in the fullness of time we’re convinced it’ll all be made up, and we’ll be in a great place," Zelnick said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two expanded on that in its financial report annoncement, saying: "The game received high critical praise, with many reviewers calling it 'the best Borderlands yet.'

Borderlands 4 also dominated YouTube with 30 million views and earned the #1 spot on Twitch during its launch, underscoring the franchise’s enduring mass appeal. While we experienced some challenges with optimization and performance on PC, Gearbox has been addressing these issues and releasing updates to improve gameplay. We are confident that Borderlands 4 will achieve strong unit sales over its lifetime."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 received praise from critics (we gave it an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-review"><u>8/10 in our review</u></a>) upon its September 12, 2025, release date for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, but it was also almost immediately faced with a wave of criticism from fans.
