            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like all-you-can-eat Pizza Huts, reasonably-priced concert tickets, and The Secret World of Alex Mack, Screamer is something I enjoyed in the 1990s but essentially disappeared from our lives decades ago. The original Screamer, released in 1995, was one of a trio of games developed by Italian studio Graffiti before it quickly rebranded itself as Milestone a year later. An over-the-top arcade racing game exclusively for PC, it arrived rapidly in the slipstream of pioneering 3D racers like The Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, and Destruction Derby (and was followed by a sequel and two one-and-done spin-offs) but has faded into relative obscurity since. However, over a quarter of a century since Milestone’s final Screamer game, the series is howling back to the track with a wild new look and an interestingly nuanced suite of controls and power-ups that shake up the slamming, the shifting, and even the steering. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to game director Federico Cardini, Screamer is a game Milestone has long wanted to resurrect, but you should know that it’s more the <em>name </em>that’s being brought back here. That is, aside from the title there really isn’t anything immediately significant in the new Screamer that meaningfully reminds me of the original. Dramatic changes of identity are usually kryptonite for sequels and reboots – especially belated ones – but I actually don’t think it’s a problem in Screamer’s case. The original was an impressive game for its time, but it was admittedly otherwise largely typical of arcade racing games in that era. The new one is a bit of a different story.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You can’t describe Screamer in a single sentence the way you can with a lot of arcade racing games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You can’t describe Screamer in a single sentence the way you can with a lot of arcade racing games. A good deal of arcade racers generally allow you to count the number of pertinent instructions on your nipples. That is, there are only two: accelerate and steer. After an hour of hands-on driving and drifting with Screamer it’s clear there’s a lot more to it than this, and it’s this depth that makes it quite fascinating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Screamer is a twin-stick racing game, and it instantly reminds me of 2020’s Inertial Drift in this sense. While the left stick is used for conventional steering, the right stick is used to add drift angle. In simple terms, the left stick controls the front of the car, and the right stick basically controls the rear. It’s easier to grasp than it perhaps sounds, but it does require a certain deftness on both sticks to make the necessary adjustments to your angle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It goes much further than this, however, as Screamer also packs a potent range of power-ups that are extracted from two separate gauges that fill based on certain actions. Inspired by fighting games, Screamer calls this its ‘Echo’ system – where using one side of the gauge affects the other side. There’s a shotgun spray of bespoke, in-game terminology that you’ll encounter if and when you play Screamer yourself, but I’m going to avoid most of that here because I think it’ll only serve to make Screamer sound a little impenetrable. On track – and in the thick of it – it’s all fairly intuitive, so I’ll try to describe it as such.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screamer - Gamescom 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Essentially, the left side of the gauge will fill throughout a race both passively and via certain actions – like perfectly-timed shifts. Screamer’s vehicles have semi-automatic transmissions, so they’ll shift automatically if you’re overwhelmed (or you forget), but if you nail your upshifts you’ll fill the left gauge faster. It’s not a remotely racing related comparison, but it reminded me of Gears of War’s active reload system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The left gauge is used to provide both boosts and shields against attacking opponents. Even boosts are handled differently, with a press–hold-and-release mechanic that you need to time by using an onscreen icon. Get the release spot-on and you will earn a longer and more effective boost than standard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what of the gauge on the right? Well, you fill the gauge on the right by <em>using </em>the power-ups afforded by the gauge on the left. The gauge on the right allows you to use the offensive abilities Screamer has dubbed ‘strike’ and ‘overdrive.’ ‘Strike’ is a temporary boost in speed during which any other car you smash into will explode, and ‘Overdrive’ is an indefinite boost that lasts until you crash. Overdrive is pretty tough to use on the twistiest portions of the tracks; after a certain amount of time locked in Overdrive you’ll reach a critical state where even a brush off a wall will see you blow up. It is extremely quick, though, and it’s a power-up I observed the AI was always willing to deploy at every opportunity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the 1995 original, Screamer features a roster of unlicensed cars. However, while the original game’s cars were clearly just de-badged versions of iconic ’90s sports cars and exotics with otherwise generic names, the cars in the upcoming Screamer are wild, anime-inspired vehicles covered in aggressive, time attack-style aero. The anime inspiration extends beyond the cars, too; indeed, Milestone has partnered with Japanese animation studio Polygon Pictures for Screamer’s story. We weren’t privy to any of these cutscenes during our preview, but I did get to race as a variety of different characters – each of whom have different abilities that alter how they fill their power gauge, and how their cars handle. There’s a really significant difference in car feel across characters so, even though the handling is quite easy to pick up, it’s not one-note.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Milestone achieved the improbable in 2021 with Hot Wheels Unleashed, creating a gorgeous and highly approachable arcade racing banger that far exceeded any expectations one might have had of a game based on a licensed toy. It’s a very different sort of racing experience to the Hot Wheels Unleashed series but, after my hour with it, I’m not expecting Screamer to quietly come and go when it arrives in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

            <title><![CDATA[Valheim Review Update - Call to Arms]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/valheim-review-update-2025-call-to-arms</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valheim-review-update-call-to-arms.1282530/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to believe it's been four years since I first set sail and fell in love with Valheim. As a fan of survival crafting and all things Norse, it's one of the best experiences out there in both regards. And while it still feels fairly familiar at the outset – and somehow it’s still calling itself “early access,” whatever that means anymore – it's gotten a mountain of patches since launch, with a list of changes that would take longer to read than the rambling tangent about some side character's great-grandfather in a viking saga. From new biomes and new bosses to crafting and combat improvements, the version of Valheim you can download today cuts like a blade that developer Iron Gate has been sharpening winter in and winter out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that still holds true today, except that the world has gotten much bigger and just about every system has been improved on in some small or large way. Except greydwarves. They're still annoying as hell. But we'll get to that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Good news for melee builds</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This revisit is based on the opt-in beta patch announced at Gamescom 2025, known as the Call to Arms update, and that’s fitting because it's brought some of the most significant changes to combat yet. Trinkets are a new equipment slot that lets you build up adrenaline by skirmishing – basically a super meter if you're familiar with fighting games – with different effects at full adrenaline for different trinkets. They've also added a "perfect dodge" that makes it possible to run a melee build without a shield, as long as you're good at timing enemy attacks. And perfect blocks no longer cost stamina, which makes that build way more viable too. Finally, the reign of the stealth archer may be coming to an end! Well, probably not entirely, but at least it won't be so far ahead of other playstyles. Just like nearly everything else that's changed in Valheim over the years, combat is the same system that's always been here but just a bit better and deeper.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>We finally get (killed by) bears!</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The mascot for this patch, though, is the lumbering bear enemy. Why did it take this long to put a bear in the viking survival game? I don't know, but I'm glad she's here now. Sitting somewhere between greydwarves and trolls in terms of difficulty, bears add some much-needed enemy variety to the early areas where most people end up spending a majority of their time anyway. And collecting bear parts lets you build a new weapon and armor set that really lean into the super-aggressive melee playstyle. I'm worried that these items will be completely underpowered in the mid-late game, but it's nice for the first leg of your adventure to be able to go full berserker.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Journeying through mist and flame adds mythological flair</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In the bigger picture, Valheim has become a much more complete saga since I originally reviewed it. Two additional biomes, the foggy Mistlands and burning Ashlands, have been added along with their attendant bosses, but I haven't been able to check the latter out yet on this fresh save I made for the patch where I'm about 25 hours in. As a matter of fact, even with well over 100 hours in Valheim overall across multiple playthroughs, I've still never seen the Ashlands – added just last year – at all, actually. The world is huge! And that's very exciting. There's still a bit left to go on the roadmap, with one major boss and one biome still missing, but it's much closer to the finish line than it is to the start. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 Survival Crafting Games</h3><p>I've reviewed a lot of these! Here are my favorites.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even in my initial Early Access outing, I said I could barely tell this is an Early Access game, and that's only become more and more true. The amount that's already here could take you months to chew through playing off and on like I do. The final 1.0 release might be out already by the time you finish the Ashlands if you start today. The sheer amount of time it would take to even run into a proverbial Under Construction sign puts them out of reach of what most of my playthroughs have even come close to accomplishing. And I have to ask: if it takes 60-plus hours for me to even notice something isn't finished, is it really unfinished at all? Or am I just waiting for an expansion to come out? It kind of feels more like the latter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Swamps are still a bummer</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Every new area has fresh enemies, unique survival challenges, new recipes to discover, and a strong theme. Higher-level biomes pull in more mythological elements that really remind you you're not in Kristiansand anymore. Moving from the Black Forest into the Swamps is still a rough transition with how much more unforgiving the terrain, enemies, and status effects become – right at the same time that travel distances are becoming an issue, and before you can unlock portals. It's no surprise to me that that's where a lot of my runs have ended. Plus, who likes a stinky poison swamp anyway? It's definitely my least favorite biome, even in the latest patch. But it's worth getting through to see what comes after it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Greydwarves are still annoying as hell</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Greydwarves in the Dark Forest remain annoying little pests that come to bother you all the time and present very little combat challenge. If we could craft a trinket that scares away lower-level enemies, I think that would be great. Remember the Morrowind mod that added a belt that would zap cliff racers out of the air? Are Valheim players too young to remember Morrowind? You know what, don't even answer that. I don't want to know.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Survival Games</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Mining feels less grindy, but maybe that's just character development on my part</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gear progression feels a lot less grindy now as well. I haven't compared the numbers to see how much of that is actual changes to ore drop rates and carry weights and how much it's just that I've gotten used to how time-consuming it is. I no longer feel like I'm spending hours and hours teching up from stone to bronze. And while I was initially annoyed by the lack of realism in the fact that repairing items doesn't cost crafting mats… I have to admit I was wrong. It's a great little quality-of-life feature that I don't have to go hunt down extremely rare materials to keep my best gear nice and shiny. It’s good to know that once I craft something, it's mine forever.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The building system could still use some work</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Building is one area where I think other survival crafting games have kind of left Valheim behind, mainly in terms of how fiddly it can get. I know part of this is that it's meant to be fairly realistic, and I respect that. But the variety of structural building pieces, especially early on, is still kind of disappointing. And it remains a massive pain to work on rooftops or anything high up due to how stairs, ladders, and slopes behave. As unrealistic as it is, I find myself wishing for something as simple as Minecraft scaffolding, which lets you ascend up to whatever height you need just by holding jump. I know we can't have Dune: Awakening-style hovering in fantasy Scandinavia. Maybe I could send a raven up there to help me place stuff? Just some ideas.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>One of the best survival crafting games ever has only gotten better</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I adored Valheim when it was roughly half the adventure it is now. The world has gotten so much richer and the progression so much deeper in the four years since, while even mechanics I was interacting with on my first day of a new playthrough have improved in small and subtle ways. If it doesn't lead the pack for the whole genre outright, it's at least very close to the front, howling gleefully as its charming, low-res 3D art style beckons me into calm meadows and foreboding dungeons. I haven't ever really stopped playing it for more than a handful of months at a time since it launched in early access, and the idea of starting a new world always gets me excited even if I know the first few verses of the saga by heart at this point.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/valheim-review-update-2025-call-to-arms]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Victory Royale. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We all know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-festival-season-10-will-feature-gorillaz-starting-tomorrow">Fortnite is the king of crossovers</a>, but the tables have turned in recent years, with Fortnite crossing over into LEGO territory. We've had a handful of sets come out that represent the weird and whacky world of one of the most popular battle royale games, like the Durrr Burger and iconic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-the-lego-fortnite-battle-bus-a-digital-to-physical-triumph">Battle Bus</a>. The most recent set, which dropped earlier this month, is the gigantic Mecha Team Leader. I'm not the biggest Fortnite player, but even I can't deny how much fun this build was. </p><div catalogid="b1c6547c-25f1-4150-8779-f8bb2aa193e5" id="227362"><div id="227362" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader is easily the biggest build <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-batman-forever-batmobile-set-76304">I've done here on IGN</a>. When the box arrived in the mail I was genuinely surprised at its size. Coming in at just under two feet, the box is absolutely massive. The set itself is comprised of 2,503 pieces and is spread out among 19 bags. The instruction booklet is just as heavy-duty, feeling like a graphic novel at 317 pages. The instructions and sticker sets even came in a premium-feeling envelope to protect it, which I appreciated. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I didn't quite know what I was getting myself into when I started this build. I've built countless LEGO sets in my day, but truly nothing quite at this scale. I built this in one day because I don't know how to relax, with a couple breaks in between because my kitchen table chairs aren't comfy whatsoever. Overall, I think it took me around five or six hours. Every aspect of the mech's body is exquisitely detailed, each with their own extremely technical and unique attachment techniques. I timed it, and just one leg took me almost an hour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm not educated on the lore behind the Mecha Team Leader's design, but I think I can speak for everyone when I comment on how ridiculous (and ridiculously awesome) this set is. One leg is made up of what looks like ice cream, with an apple foot, while the other foot is a literal cheeseburger. I don't get it, and I don't care; this thing rules. Building the each body part was extremely satisfying, getting to see how in-depth the attachment techniques are. Every limb is movable and posable except for the knees, which unfortunately don't bend. But you can still articulate the mech's arms, hands, and fingers to put it up on your shelf however you want. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorite aspects of this build is the huge sword. It cleverly uses a grey LEGO minifigure blank head and ponytail hairstyle to simulate what I'm pretty sure is a fabric tassel on the end of the sword's grip. You can slot the sword into either of the mech's hands, so feel free to pose it however you want, the sword won't fall off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mech's chest cavity opens up to allow a minifigure version of it to enter, and this is also one of the first parts of the build. You build out the pilot cockpit, complete with a detailed chair and screens to survey the battlefield, which are where most of the sticker elements come into play. The mech's armor breastplate itself was fun to build, but I'm questioning some of the sequencing in the steps here; it was difficult to attach the upper breastplate once it was fully assembled to the rest of the body without breaking off other pieces in the process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The teddy bear head really ties the whole set together. It's the last bit of the build, and it also one of my favorite parts. I always appreciate how LEGO designers can take ordinary brick shapes and mold into an extremely detailed, uncanny recreation of what we all know to be a head, and the Mecha Team Leader's head is no different. Its eyes, ears, and little tufts of hair sticking out are awesome little details. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though I don't play Fortnite, the LEGO Mecha Team Leader is one of my favorite builds I've ever done, whether for IGN or on my own. Once it's all said and done, it stands at almost 18 inches tall. It's an impressively designed and time-consuming build that I highly recommend spacing out over multiple sessions. The minifigure version of the mech, the buildable sword, and "Fortnite" printed LEGO plaque are all great additions to an already great set. I love LEGO and I'm a huge nerd when it comes to appreciating the design of massive, technical sets like this, and I can't wait to see more of what they can cook up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The latest Silent Hill movie is blazing its own trail.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Christophe Gans’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/return-to-silent-hill"><u>Return to Silent Hill</u></a> is hitting theaters in January 2026, just in time for the 20th anniversary of the original Silent Hill movie. This is good news, given that Silent Hill still ranks as one of the better video game movie adaptations to date. 2012’s Silent Hill: Revelation? Not so much. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cineverse just released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-teaser-trailer-revealed-for-third-movie-based-on-konami-game-franchise"><u>a short first teaser for Return to Silent Hill</u></a>, offering a glimpse of the many horrors Jeremy Irvine’s James Sunderland will face as he navigates the town in search of his missing wife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that so much time has passed since Gans last set foot in the moody town of Silent Hill, you might be wondering how this sequel is connected to its predecessors. Is it a direct continuation of Silent Hill and Silent Hill: Revelations? Which game is it adapting? Here’s everything you need to know before Return to Silent Hill hits theaters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How Return to Silent Hill Connects to the Other Movies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">2006’s Silent Hill stars Radha Mitchell as Rose Da Silva, a woman who brings her adopted daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) to the remote, abandoned town of Silent Hill in order to get to the bottom of Sharon’s recurring nightmares. Sean Bean also stars as Rose’s husband Christopher, who attempts to rescue his family even as they become trapped in a hellish other dimension. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite featuring a different director and writer in M.J. Bassett, 2012’s Silent Hill: Revelation serves as a direct sequel to the first movie. Adelaide Clemens stars as the adult Sharon, now assuming the identity of Heather Mason. When her father disappears in Silent Hill, Heather and her classmate Vincent (Kit Harington) return to the town to find him. Revelation also deals heavily with the religious cult known as the Order of Valtiel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill is not a direct follow-up to either of those films. Instead, this film is telling a standalone story with a different set of characters. Return to Silent Hill stars Jeremy Irvine as James Sunderland, a widower who is stunned to receive a letter from his dead wife Mary (Hannah Emily Anderson), urging him to meet her in Silent Hill. James will descend deeper and deeper into the otherworldly dimensions of the town in order to find her. Silent Hill 2 Remake’s Evie Templeton will reprise her role as Laura, a young girl also caught in the web that is Silent Hill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, it seems you don’t necessarily need to have seen the other Silent Hill movies in order to enjoy Return to Silent Hill. This sequel follows the approach of the games in that the spooky town itself, not the characters, provides most of the connective tissue. Most of the games aren’t directly intertwined by plot, but instead focus on different characters being drawn into the town and finding their personal demons manifesting into literal monsters. The series is not unlike Hellraiser in that regard, as the Hellraiser movies are mostly standalone horror stories linked together by the overarching mythology of Pinhead and the Cenobites. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The script for a new Silent Hill movie that is totally independent from the two previous movies made and respects the way Silent Hill has evolved,” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-new-movie-2023"><u>Gans said in 2022</u></a>. “Silent Hill is a bit like Twilight Zone, the Fourth Dimension, a place where anything and everything can happen.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill 2 (2024) Review Screens</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Which Games Does Return to Silent Hill Adapt?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If the description of Return to Silent Hill’s plot sounds familiar, it should. This film happens to be a direct adaptation of the Silent Hill 2 game, which was originally released in 2001 and remade in 2024. Just like this film, Silent Hill 2 follows James Sunderland as he navigates the various dimensions of the town in search of his late wife. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Return to Silent Hill looks to be the most faithful adaptation of the game out of the three films to date, to the point that Gans went to the trouble of casting Templeton as Laura again. We assume the film will follow the core beats of the game, pitting James against terrifying monsters like Pyramid Head and culminating in a similarly tragic twist ending. Pyramid Head himself can be seen in the teaser, making him the one character confirmed to appear in all three films.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither of the previous Silent Hill movies could be considered more than loose adaptations of the source material. The first Silent Hill film may borrow liberally from the imagery and music of the series, along with a few basic plot points from 1999’s Silent Hill, but its plot and cast of characters are largely unique. Silent Hill: Revelation is sort of an adaptation of the Silent Hill 3 game, transforming Rose and Christopher Da Silva into Heather and Harry Mason. But, again, the less said about Revelation, the better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Direct adaptation or not, it doesn’t appear that Return to Silent Hill will be a 1:1 copy of Silent Hill 2. Gans has hinted the film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240506195503/https://www.ecranlarge.com/films/dossier/1435959-le-pacte-des-loups-silent-hill-christophe-gans-pionnier-du-blockbuster-a-la-francaise" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>also draws inspiration from 2014’s P.T.</u></a>, the infamous demo that was meant to lead into Hideo Kojima’s canceled Silent Hills game. Does that mean the film will feature first-person sequences, a la 2005’s Doom? Or is the P.T. influence more in terms of the steadily mounting sense of dread and psychological horror? We’ll find out when Return to Silent Hill hits theaters in January 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Return to Silent Hill, find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hills-first-cinematic-trailer-has-completely-divided-the-community"><u>why the teaser trailer has divided the Silent Hill fan community</u></a>.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> developer Bethesda has finally teased some of the upcoming changes coming to the game, confirming improvements to space gameplay “to make the travels there more rewarding.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2-years-later-starfield-looks-set-to-actually-let-you-fly-from-one-place-to-another-though-not-quite-like-no-mans-sky">fragments of code uncovered by Starfield fans suggested Bethesda had a more streamlined space travel experience in the works</a>, though potentially still with some caveats. While you may be able to travel between planets within the same system, fans said it looked like you wouldn’t be able to fly <em>all the way</em> between systems. And it looks like you won’t be able to fly directly from a planet's surface into orbit, like No Man's Sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">References to the new offering, referred to in the game's code as "Cruise Mode," were detected by players and shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1mii922/new_findings_in_the_last_2_update_suggest_dev/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reddit</u></a>, though Bethesda reportedly issued another small patch to scrub them from view.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in <a href="https://youtu.be/_zknfAghd-s?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video discussing his career</a>, veteran Bethesda developer Tim Lamb confirmed that the studio has been working on Starfield’s space gameplay, and that a new DLC story is still coming at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think as it comes to Starfield, I'm really excited for players to see what the teams have been working on,” he said. “We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features the players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding. We're also adding some new game systems, and a few other smaller delights. There's also some really interesting stuff coming down the pipe from our verified creators. There's some fun stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I just want to say thanks. We really appreciate the support and the enthusiasm. We can't wait to get it into the hands of our players.”</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-breaks-silence-on-starfield-future-promises-to-share-details-on-exciting-things-in-the-coming-months"><u>Bethesda said it had "exciting things" coming to Starfield soon</u></a> — presumably referring to this. However, Starfield was a no-show at gamescom 2025 last week, prompting further fan concern.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-reportedly-set-for-ps5-release-during-spring-2026-alongside-new-expansion"><u>Starfield's second expansion and much-anticipated PlayStation 5 port would now arrive in 2026</u></a>, following the poor reception to 2024 add-on Shattered Space. Bethesda boss Todd Howard had <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>previously talked of expansions arriving annually</u></a>, but perhaps Bethesda sees the addition of some form of spaceflight as something to keep players occupied until then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years, but it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield went on to reach 15 million players, but the question of whether Bethesda might walk away from the game to focus on its other franchises has been a running theme since release. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would come out following Shattered Space. And in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking more generally about the development of Starfield, Lamb described it as “like making four games at once.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You have your, I'm running around shooting aliens and space guys,” he said. “You have your, I'm flying around in a spaceship, shooting other spaceships. You have the ship builder game. You have the outpost game. Starfield to me was like making four games at once.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
