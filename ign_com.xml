            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-the-2025-terminator-2-retro-game-needed-to-be-made<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For as long as there have been video games, there have also been bad movie tie-ins. And with the exception of the Nintendo 64 classic GoldenEye, the ‘90s was arguably the worst decade for turning movie gold into video game slop. Independence Day? Stinker. Cliffhanger? Utter bollocks. Men In Black: The Game? We all needed neuralising after that one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its smash hit success at the movie box office, 1991’s Terminator 2 wasn’t immune from this curse. It also experienced a less-than-stellar video game treatment, published by Ocean Software on the ZX Spectrum, Amiga, and other platforms, and not one of the many versions was even close to being worthy of the film’s classic status.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember playing the Ocean T2 game from way back,” recalls Mike Tucker, designer and programmer at developer Bitmap Bureau. “I think they went all-out with the blend of game designs in there, including one where you had to rewire the Terminator's arm. And then there's a sliding block puzzle [to reconfigure the Terminator’s face].”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tucker’s colleague, pixel artist Henk Nieborg, also remembers the Probe Software Terminator game, based on the first film and released for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. “It was just a very simple use of the license,” he says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you look at the Mega Drive and Super Nintendo versions of Terminator 2, [they’re] pretty woeful really,” Tucker concludes. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/17/t2d-bike-1750162786338.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">T2's iconic bike chase becomes a high-speed chase level in Terminator 2D: No Fate. | Image credit: Bitmap Bureau</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the ‘90s, though, games like Spider-Man 2, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and Alien: Isolation have proved that the tide has somewhat turned. Making a game based on a movie is no longer the instant critical failure it once was. And with no movie studio demands to launch alongside a brand new film’s opening weekend, any developer tackling The Terminator 2 now would have as much time as needed to revisit the 34 year-old classic. With that in mind, the opportunity to potentially right the wrongs of many previous failed Terminator 2 attempts wasn’t just something that the team at Bitmap Bureau thought would be fun to do… it was something they felt they needed to do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I got an email from Reef Entertainment asking me if I would be interested in doing a project with them, and it would be a licensed project,” Nieborg recalls.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Terminator was on the table,” says Tucker. “And when it was offered to us, being huge Terminator fans, especially myself and Henk, it was just too good an opportunity to turn it down.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Having quite a big license attached to an indie game, that's quite an unusual situation,” Nieborg adds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was an unexpected offer, but a welcome one. Bitmap Bureau’s specialty is retro-style games, with a back catalogue including the top-down shooter Xeno Crisis and side-scroller Final Vendetta. And so when a retro film license arrived in their laps, the team jumped at the chance to use their skills to develop what could be the ultimate Terminator 2 video game. And so Terminator 2D: No Fate was born. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first step towards Bitmap Bureau’s goal was plotting out exactly what a Terminator 2 game would look like, down to the finest details. Afterall, with 34 years of legacy and expectations, anything less than a fully realised, ultimate Terminator 2 experience wouldn’t be good enough.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/17/t2d-boss-1750162815037.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Skynet Centurion, originally designed for T2 but never used, was turned into a boss for a future war level. | Image credit: Bitmap Bureau</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's been a lot of fun adapting the various scenes of the movie into pixel form,” says Tucker. “Usually, when you make your own game, you can just do what you want. But within the confines of a license, you have to be very careful. You have to make sure you get all those iconic scenes in the movie and translate them into some kind of game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of those iconic scenes was the movie’s opening sequence. Director James Cameron offered a small, unforgettable glimpse of the future war awaiting beyond Judgement Day, with a grizzled John Connor leading the resistance against Skynet. But while this sequence is visually impactful, it’s only a fleeting moment of the movie with no obvious gameplay translation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You don't actually see that much of the future war in the first two Terminator movies,” says Tucker. “So yeah, we had to get creative.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We actually got a new boss in there,” says Nieborg, referring to the level’s main adversary. “I had to make that myself [and] get it approved by [movie production company] Studio Canal.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Luckily there was a lot of concept art flying around that we were able to make use of,” explains Tucker. “And there's one boss in particular called Centurion, [a huge mech tank] which appears on the Terminator 2 pinball table, bizarrely.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expanding on small scenes from the movie is only one step towards creating the perfect Terminator 2 game, though. To make the ultimate experience, Bitmap Bureau set out to represent as many of the movies’ classic scenes as they could.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/17/t2d-naked-1750162834727.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Depicting the T-800's naked brawl scene was a challenge solved by 'creative shading.' | Image credit: Bitmap Bureau</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the most contentious scene was the bar fight, which has the Terminator in naked form walking around, beating up bikers,” recalls Tucker. “I think we were trying to put that off for some time. We thought there's no way we could do this. But we found a way, and I think it's great. It's a nice distraction from the rest of the game as well, which is largely run and gun. We had to be very careful what we could show below the waistline, of course. We did include some ‘creative shading’, let's say.”		</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another scene that initially didn’t translate well to the studio’s side-scrolling arcade game format was Sarah Connor’s prison escape. To create an authentic adaptation, the team had to develop and incorporate stealth mechanics and have them sit alongside the beat-em-up action. For instance, Sarah can duck into shadowy cells to avoid patrolling wardens. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can play [the level] as a stealth sequence, or you can just go around hitting the enemies with a nightstick,” explains Tucker. “But if you want to get an S-rank on that level, then you have to sneak through without getting seen.” 						</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You've got the T-1000 walking around as well,” he adds. “So if you bump into him, you're as good as dead. So yeah, you really do need to find the right time and place to hide.”		</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/17/t2d-stealth-1750162849876.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sarah Connor's prison escape becomes a high-stakes stealth mission. | Image credit: Bitmap Bureau</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">34 years later is a long time after the event itself for a developer to revisit a movie to make a tie-in videogame. But how about 41 years later? Terminator 2 may be the most beloved of the legendary series, but it’s also (as the number suggests) a sequel. What stopped Bitmap Bureau going back to the 1984 original instead?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't think that was ever on the table,” Tucker says. “But maybe it will be in the future.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it's probably easier to translate Terminator 2 to a game than the original Terminator, because [in T1] you just have one invincible enemy,” he explains. “Game design-wise, that's quite tricky. I know Alien: Isolation did a good job with that, but translating that into a side-scrolling arcade game, I think would be tricky. But you never know. Perhaps we'll get to translate that [one day].”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Maybe if you play as the Terminator, then it would be fun,” Nieborg suggests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In March 2025, Bitmap Bureau finally revealed their surprising project to the world. Despite initial fears of rejection, the team couldn’t be happier with the overwhelming positive response Terminator 2D: No Fate has received so far.		</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's gone down really well,” says a relieved Tucker. “I'm always really anxious when we release a game because I'm just never sure how it's going to go down. So yeah, that's made us all feel really positive, and it's given us that drive to get over the finish line and just polish the game up, get the bugs fixed, and get [it] out there.”							</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was incredible to see that reception,” agrees Nieborg. “I watched every hour to see how many views there were on YouTube. It just blew up and that was absolutely amazing to experience.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the game isn’t in the hands of players (the true quality deciders) just yet, Judgement Day is fast approaching: Terminator 2D: No Fate launches on September 5. Early signs are pointing to the game finally providing the Terminator 2 experience we always wanted, though. If that’s the case, there will no doubt be demand for Bitmap Bureau to revisit other well-known action classics from the ‘90s that never got their big video game moment.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know a few licenses which I would love to take on,” teases Nieborg. “We'll just see and let 'em come.”								</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We do have other things in development, which I can't talk about,” adds Tucker. “They might be in the same ballpark, let's say. We've really loved working on T2, and I'm sure we'll work on other licensed games again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But at the same time, we're creative people and we like to create our own stuff as well. So luckily Reef Entertainment gives us that balance of working on license stuff and our own [original ideas]. So yeah, we're going to continue in that vein for some time, hopefully.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dale Driver is an Executive Producer of Video Programming at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-will-turn-off-your-switch-2s-rumble-if-it-detects-prolonged-use<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> users have reported having the vibration effect of their controllers turned off, should the console detect you making "prolonged use" of their rumble feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reports of warnings for excessive rumble use have filtered in since the Switch 2's launch earlier this month, as users see a message from Nintendo pop up on screen — "Rumble has been turned off due to prolonged use" — before the ability to make the Joy-Con vibrate further is temporarily disabled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was getting this message originally after about an hour and a half of handheld playtime," one user wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lai1kb/rumble_turning_itself_off/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. "Now it shows within the first 20 min. Anyone else having this issue?"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 2 owners say they've experienced issues with Joy-Con rumble while enjoying a number of games, including vibration-heavy moments in Cyberpunk 2077 (firing the minigun is reported to be particularly energetic), and during cutscenes within The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker on Nintendo GameCube.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But a reddit thread of users tracking the issue lists other titles, too. "Got it during the final boss of Sonic Generations," wrote one disappointed fan. "Been getting it a few times playing Fast Fusion," noted another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is yet to address the warning, though fans believe it is a feature designed primarily to limit the Joy-Con's battery consumption. After all, vibration requires extra power, and while disabling the feature entirely is somewhat heavy-handed, the move will ensure your Joy-Con don't too quickly run out of juice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This keeps popping up for me, too, even when I've only played for a few minutes," wrote one concerned fan in another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l4ehel/anyone_seen_the_rumble_turned_off_due_to/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> thread on the issue. "Worried I have a defective Joy-Con."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, fans impacted by repeated warnings say that fully disabling controller rumble in the Switch's settings menu is their only option to avoid the pop-up continually recurring. Others say that the warning was, for them, only temporary — with the ability to recover their buzz in a matter of minutes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

(Post-sale, Niantic has essentially rebranded under a fresh title, Niantic Spatial, and made pursuing AR technology its sole goal.) Scopely, by comparison, is entirely gaming-focused.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for other fans, particularly those who have played other Scopely titles, the change sparked concerns around the potential for increased monetisation, and of any involvement by Scopely's parent company Savvy Games, which is a product of Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of his first round of interviews since the $3.5bn acquisition was finalised earlier this month, I sat down with Pokémon Go director Michael Steranka to discuss the impact of the game changing hands, and what being owned by Scopely would really mean for fans of the hit smartphone game going forwards.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We physically moved basically one block over so, you know, it wasn't too much of a change," Steranka begins, as we sit on Pokémon Go-branded deck chairs at the game's big Go Fest 2025 live event in Paris last weekend. "It was actually one of our overflow offices that we had anyways, so a really familiar space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I would say the most remarkable thing about this transition so far is how uninterrupted it's been," he adds. "It's very much been business as usual."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Pokémon Go, business as usual means a continually busy schedule of in-game events and additional Pokémon releases, as well as physical events such as Go Fest 2025 and the upcoming debut of a mysterious mobile event series, Pokémon Go Road Trip 2025, set to begin in the UK later this month and wrap up in Cologne in August. Throughout this, and through its acquisition period, Steranka says Pokémon Go has continued as normal — though it is, as he acknowledges, still early days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Granted, [the acquisition] fully closed during Osaka Go Fest, the team has been quite busy, and so it's probably intentionally not disruptive around this moment in time," he notes. "But the sense that I've been getting through all the conversations I've had with folks at Scopely is the way they operate is to be quite unintrusive with individual game teams. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As you know, our full development team moved over with us, and in terms of the day to day, who we interact with, we all still ladder up to Ed Woo, our team's leader within Niantic, who still is within Scopely as well."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The key thing that's maybe a little bit less of a priority is the augmented reality focus.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what will change? Let's start with a positive for most Pokémon Go fans — the likely reduction in focus of AR-focused gameplay going forward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The key thing that's maybe a little bit less of a priority is the augmented reality focus," Steranka acknowledges. "It's no secret a lot of players have not been super excited about some of the AR systems that have been added to the game over the years. Moving forward, if we add any AR functionality to Pokémon Go, it'll be because we as a team really believe it's going to be a fun and exciting thing to add."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Niantic, Scopely is a company entirely dedicated to video games — something Steranka perhaps tellingly describes as a "breath of fresh air" for his own team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Philosophically it's great, or I'm expecting it to be great, to be at a company that's fully dedicated to games, because that's where I feel like we did struggle a little bit over on the Niantic side," he says. "It's just when it comes to overall company priorities, and where do we want to invest, and what sort of company initiatives we're pushing forward at Scopely, it'll be very much focused on what's best for this game. And I think that'll be a nice breath of fresh air for everybody."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/736-a-new-way-to-power-up-pokmon-is-coming-to-pokmon-go-00-00-09-1750066518265.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go plans out new features months in advance, such as its upcoming new Golden Bottle Cap item.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite recent changes to increase the amount of in-game features available to fans playing remotely, and the introduction of new items such as the Lucky Trinket and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-developer-addresses-pay-to-win-fears-as-it-introduces-unprecedented-20-premium-pass-with-gold-bottle-cap-that-boosts-a-pokmons-stats-to-100">pricey upcoming Golden Bottle Cap</a>, Steranka says players are simply seeing the Pokémon Go team's own roadmap of features, planned months in advance, go live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's kind of funny, because I think some of the recent changes we've made in the game have been things that players have been hoping for and wanting for a while, and a lot of online chatter that I've seen has been suspicion that, like, 'Oh, this is this must be because of the Scopely acquisition'," Steranka says. "These are things we've been working on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But to be fair, Scopely hasn't come in and said, 'Hey, don't do that.' They've very much come in and been very supportive of all the things that we had already been planning on the roadmap. We've got a couple other amazing features and updates coming down the line later this year that players will be equally thrilled to see."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, in terms of the game's plans for the future, and the suggestion that any new owner might come in and start adding new things to Pokémon Go's existing content schedule, Steranka says the Pokémon Go team already has "pretty much planned out for the next two years, essentially, though that does change over time as well."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I think people who are skeptical will remain skeptical.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shortly after the sale was first announced, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS3HawhQy78&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steranka sat down for a lengthy heart to heart with TrainerTips</a>, perhaps the best-known and longest standing Pokémon Go player on YouTube, for an insightful interview that aimed to soothe initial fan fears over the game's future. Months later, and with the deal now done, I ask Steranka where he thought community sentiment towards the game and its new ownership stood now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think people who are skeptical will remain skeptical," Steranka replies. "The biggest thing that we can do is just prove over time that this actually is a great direction for the game to go. But I do think that, especially after having that interview with TrainerTips, I've definitely seen people have a little bit more optimism for the future. It's healthy skepticism, but optimistic, regardless. So that's how I feel personally. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've heard great things about Scopely. I think actions will speak louder than words, but so far, the actions have been awesome, and I have every expectation that that's going to continue over the coming years."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/736-a-new-way-to-power-up-pokmon-is-coming-to-pokmon-go-00-00-09-1750070657268.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Scopely is best known for running smash hit smartphone game Monopoly Go!</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, alongside this enthusiasm, I was keen to ask about the match-up between Niantic's now-separate Pokémon Go team and the Savvy Games-owned Scopely. In the past, Pokémon Go has frequently positioned itself as an inclusive game run by progressive leadership. I asked Steranka what the internal conversations were like around being owned, ultimately, by a Saudi-backed company, and what it might mean for the game going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That was definitely something I was curious about personally early on when I met with Walter Driver, the co-CEO and founder of Scopely," Steranka acknowledges. "I did address that head on with him, and his perspective on that really resonated with me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Number one, [the Pokémon Go] team is pretty much never gonna be engaging directly with Savvy. For the most part, they just let Scopely operate the way that they want to operate. Number two, it's always better to engage with people of all different kinds of backgrounds. And if there's any change that you'd like to make in the world, you can't really make any changes by not engaging, right? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And I think that actually is very, sort of central to our philosophy around Pokémon Go as a game as well. We want people to go out and meet with other folks in their community and fully believe in the power of getting face to face and finding common ground and bettering the world from that type of community-first approach. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"You can't really make any changes by not engaging.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"So yeah, I don't think there's going to be any major or any changes at all that is dictated down on high, from Savvy, and if anything it just means we have the funding needed to invest in areas that we've always wanted to invest in. And so that's something I've really been excited about, because there is a world where maybe we became a public company, and then we're at the scrutiny of shareholder demands on a quaterly basis. That's not really a world we're operating in within at Scopely, which is great. It can be a lot more focused on what's best for the long term health of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, SNK, another Saudi-backed company, raised eyebrows by including European football star Cristian Ronaldo in its new game Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, as Ronaldo cements himself within the Saudi football leagues. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I did see that," Steranka says, when I bring this up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I guess what you're saying is, don't expect Ronaldo in Pokémon Go anytime soon, I ask.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Definitely not," is Steranka's reply. "Yeah, that's a little bit not our vibe within Pokémon Go."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Talking to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/woodkid-hideo-kojima-death-stranding-soundtrack-1235357959/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rolling Stone</u></a>, Lemoine talked about his process — both with Kojima and without — and the challenges of writing music for a medium that's changing in real-time as players progress through the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, he also reflected on Kojima opening up about the "problem" of having players "like [Death Stranding 2] too much." "That means something is wrong," Kojima told him. "We have to change something."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"There’s a key moment where we had a discussion, probably halfway [through] when we were doing the game, where he came to me and he said, 'We have a problem,'" Woodkid explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Then he said, 'I’m going to be very honest, we have been testing the game with players and the results are too good. They like it too much. That means something is wrong; we have to change something.' And he changed stuff in the script and the way some crucial stuff [happens] in the game because he thought his work was not polarizing and not triggering enough emotions." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Kojima, "If everyone likes [your work], it means it’s mainstream. It means it’s conventional. It means it’s already pre-digested for people to like it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don’t want that," Kojima reportedly told Lemoine. "I want people to end up liking things they didn’t like when they first encountered it, because that’s where you really end up loving something."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Woodkid added "that was really a lesson for [him]," convincing him "not doing stuff to please people, but to make them shift a little bit and move them."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Kojima Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not long to go now — Death Stranding 2 is out on June 26, 2025.

That's why we're left with so many questions about Eve's world, including an official explanation as to why she requires a costume change so often.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it seems Shift Up considered retrospectively adding in cutscenes to better explain the story, Kim was concerned that may "clash" with what players know and understand of the game thus far.
