            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/last-epoch-1-2-builds-best<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch 1.2 Tombs of the Erased brings a sentinel rework, Weavers endgame Faction, revamped Monolith of Fate experience, and much more. This is Last Epoch’s biggest update yet and IGN has teamed up with the ARPG experts at Maxroll to prepare detailed guides on all of the new content along with excellent builds for leveling and endgame alike. Before we get to the builds, here’s all the new stuff coming in 1.2:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New 1.2 Tombs of the Erased Content</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/01-new-content-woven-faction-1744819698558.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Woven Faction</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest changes in 1.2 is the new Woven Faction. They provide a deeper endgame experience by adding Woven Echoes to your Monolith of Fate. Begin interacting with them by finding a Cemetery of the Erased on your Echo Web, after completing the mini-boss at the end you can enter the Haven of Silk and speak to Masque to join the faction. Gain ranks with the Woven Faction by completing Woven Echoes to add points to your Weaver Tree then use these points to customize your endgame experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Champions &amp; Mini-bosses</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As you explore the Echo Web, you may also find some fun new surprises in the form of Champions, and new weaver mini-bosses. The Champions are larger, more powerful versions of rares, immediately visible due to their angry red glow. Defeating them is tricky but if you persevere you’re sure to be duly rewarded. There are also several new mini-bosses you can encounter in 1.2, so keep an eye out for a scary-looking boss as you explore the Monolith of Fate.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Set Item Crafting and LP Changes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch has an in-depth <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/resources/beginner-crafting-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crafting System</a> where you use Affix Shards, Glyphs, and Runes to heavily customize your items. This popular system is straighforward to understand and has a fair bit of depth to master. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1.2, crafting in Last Epoch gets even better. You can break Set items down to obtain crafting shards and then use those to craft set bonuses on your items. This gives you the best of both worlds where you have the power of a set bonus and the flexibility to craft your own gear with the affixes you need. EHG has also made a big change to how you use Unique items with Legendary Potential (LP) to craft Legendary items. In the past, when interacting with the Eternity Cache the modifiers added to your Legendary Items were chosen at random. So if you used a 1LP Unique, you get a Legendary with 1 random affix, if you use a 2LP Unique, you get a Legendary with 2 random affixes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, if you complete a Temporal Sanctum of level 2 or higher you can choose 1 affix to transfer to your Legendary! This means you get to pick what you want when using a 1 LP Unique, if you use an item with 2-4 LP, then you get to pick 1 affix and the remaining modifiers are chosen at random.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Uber Aberroth</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch’s ultimate boss is getting even tougher with 1.2. In addition to the normal version of this encounter, there is a special Uber Aberroth encounter. Very little is known about this foe beyond the fact that he is the most dangerous being in Eterra. Challenge him at your own risk!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1.2 Tombs of the Erased Leveling Builds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Use Maxroll’s leveling builds to cruise through the campaign with ease. Season 2 introduces the ability to switch your Mastery so you can level with the most efficient build for the campaign, then respec your mastery upon reaching the endgame. Here are the best ways to level each of the game’s 5 classes, straight from Last Epoch’s top speed runner Terek!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/primalist-build-1744820944042.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Primalist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The best way to level a Primalist is by playing Druid. This build has good damage, it’s very cozy as you can use transformations to spam your skills during the campaign, and gets quite tanky thanks to Werebear form.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/mage-build-1744820963651.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Mage</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Spellblade mastery seamlessly weaves blades and spells to decimate foes using Shatter Strike. You are reliant on spells in the early game but once you get Shatter Strike most of your time is spent rotating between Shatter Strike for damage and Mana Strike to recover your resources to continue dealing damage. Don’t be fooled by the Mage’s health, you can easily generate tons of Ward just by hitting enemies.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sentinel-build-1744820980104.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Sentinel</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot off the rework, Sentinel is stronger than ever. The most efficient way to level is by playing Paladin to get easy access to Resistances and Holy Aura for both offensive and defensive bonuses. Crusade your way through the campaign burning enemies in the holy fire of your Judgment!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/acolyte-build-1744820998394.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Acolyte</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As an Acolyte you are a master of the undead and the profane. Embrace your inner darkness and become a Warlock to create rifts in reality which unleash a volley of Chaos Bolt. The Chthonic Fissure skill provides great persistent damage for clearing while your Summoned Infernal Shades melt bosses with their hellish assault.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/rogue-build-1744821018335.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Rogue</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Rogue levels with her trusty Falcon Companion, flying through levels with ease and grace. This Falconer build is easy to scale with great sustain thanks to the Melee Leech affix on gear. With a bit of investment into Health, Regen and Physical Resistance, this Rogue becomes a well-rounded beast of a build.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1.2 Tombs of the Erased Endgame Builds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After you complete the campaign, you enter Last Epoch’s endgame. Maxroll’s Last Epoch team has been extensively testing a wide variety of endgame builds to dominate in the Monolith of Fate. While all of these builds are powerful, you can use Maxroll’s tier lists to see how they compare across different kinds of content.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Heartseeker Marksman</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/heartseeker-marksman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heartseeker Marksman</a> uses a new skill which seeks enemy targets and triggers a spectacular display of Fire and Cold Projectiles that cover the entire screen. Watch your enemies evaporate as they get blasted by your Attacks and Spells!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The build revolves around dealing Damage with Heartseeker and proccing an insane amount of Dragonfire from Dragonsong. Heartseeker also triggers Burning Dagger for even more craziness. This Marksman has incredible mobility and utility thanks to Shift, Smoke Bomb, Shurikens, and unspecialized Decoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Fast Clear Speed</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Deals Damage While Moving</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Insane Scaling with Gear and Uniques</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Active Playstyle</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Needs Uniques to Shine</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Survivability Relies on Gear</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Defensive Tools Require Timing</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Judgement Paladin</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/judgement-paladin-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judgement Paladin</a> creates Consecrated Ground with Judgement, to burn enemies with holy fire. Become the Judge and cleanse your foes of impurity, as they hopelessly try to break through your immense defenses. This build is a natural continuation of the Paladin Leveling Build, making it extremely easy to play as your first character of the season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Judgement Paladin deals Fire Spell Damage Over Time with Consecrated Ground and generates Mana with Vengeance. Consecrated Ground also grants massive Healing, since multiple instances can stack on top of each other. Use Holy Aura and Symbols of Hope for great passive buffs. Healing Hands grants Ward and Healing, while acting as your Movement Skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Insane Tankiness</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Exceptional Sustain</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ High Single Target DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing Scaling With Gear and Uniques</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Limited AoE</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Average Clear Speed</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Needs Legendaries To Shine</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Generator/Spender Playstyle</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Warpath Void Knight</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/echo-warpath-void-knight-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warpath Void Knight</a> uses Warpath to wipe the battlefield clean of enemies. Stay spinning to increase your Damage and AoE until Warpath almost covers the whole screen. Unleash the Spin-to-Win playstyle with this build!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warpath Void Knight specializes into Warrior's Fury to reach amazing levels of Void Melee Damage and Area of Effect. Warpath costs more Mana every second, but thanks to the Void Well Passive and Mana stacking, you can stay spinning for a long time. The Void Well Passive is mandatory when you have Warrior's Fury allocated. Devouring Orb, Anomaly, Symbols of Hope, and Abyssal Echoes grant powerful buffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing AoE</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Extreme Clear Speed</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Very Simple Gameplay</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Excellent Single Target DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Gear Dependent</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Average Tankiness</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Needs Legendaries To Shine</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Requires Mana Investment</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tornado Shaman</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Summon the fury of the storm with this <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/tornado-shaman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tornado Shaman Guide</a> as you strike down foes from afar. This build invokes Tornados onto the battlefield that rapidly calls Storm Bolts down on enemies in an enormous area. Speed through monoliths and destroy bosses with this outstanding build.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Place down long-lasting Tornados on the battlefield that rapidly cast Storm Bolts thanks to Charged Storm for huge Lightning damage. Gathering Storm allows you to drastically increase the damage of those storm bolts while Summon Spriggan, Warcry, and Maelstrom offer you some amazing offensive and defensive bonuses. Since you are not casting Gathering Storm manually, you can equip an unspecialized Fury Leap for mobility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Insane Tankiness</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Exceptional Sustain</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ High Single Target DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing Scaling With Gear and Uniques</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Limited AoE</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Weaker Defensively While Moving</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Optimal Play Requires Standing Still</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Summon Spriggan Dies Often And Needs To Be Resummoned</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Stygian Coal Lich</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/stygian-coal-lich-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stygian Coal Lich Guide</a> harnesses the power of undeath in the form of Stygian Beams. This Lich transforms into its horrific Reaper Form to unleash a barrage of deadly Necrotic Stygian Beams. Hit your enemies with Rip Blood to empower yourself, and generate Mana and obliterate everything around you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turn Drain Life into a DPS powerhouse thanks to the Stygian Coal Unique Catalyst.

Watch your foes die as you swiftly cruise through the battlefield with this amazing build that focuses on maximizing the destructible power of the Twilight Strike Node inside the Aerial Assault Skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to the Cooldown Reduction from Free Lofting Bird, you can spam Explosive Trap to cycle through Dive Bomb and Aerial Assault almost non-stop.

With each swift cast, Frost Claw releases a barrage of projectiles, all capable of converging upon a single target. This relentless assault not only deals Damage but also has the power to Freeze foes in their tracks. Thanks to its high Cast Speed, it can maintain a relentless offensive assault, while also accumulating Ward to fortify its Defenses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is an Ailment-based build that scales Frostbite and Cold Damage Over Time. Its Damage primarily comes from Frost Claw, Elemental Nova, and Ice Barrage.

Builds are compared based on their Endgame Planner Setup.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bossing</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Use Maxroll's <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/tierlists/bossing-tier-list" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bossing Tier List</a> to see which builds excel at taking down Monolith Bosses, Dungeons Bosses, and Pinnacle Content. Maxroll considers many factors when placing the builds but mainly focuses on Overall reliable DPS. Builds are compared based on their Endgame Planner Setup.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hardcore</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Maxroll's <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/tierlists/hardcore-tier-list" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardcore Tier List</a> ranks a build's suitability for the optional permadeath mode “Hardcore”. Therefore the builds are primarily ranked based on their raw survivability and reliability, even on their Starting Planner Setup. Unlike the other tier lists, the early game gearing is given higher weight here, because a single death means losing your character when playing on Hardcore.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Speed Farming</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Maxroll's <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/tierlists/speed-farming-tier-list" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speed Farming Tier List</a> ranks a build's ability to speed through content. Naturally, speed is the main factor, which means the ability to AoE down mobs, move quickly, and maintain this speed even at high corruption. Builds are compared based on their Endgame Planner Setup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This article was created by IGN Staff with help from the Maxroll Last Epoch Team.</em>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-has-serious-potential-for-old-school-fun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After more than a decade in the shadows, the Ninja Gaiden series returns with not one but three releases this year: the surprise remaster of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black that’s already out, this fall’s Ninja Gaiden 4, and in between, the 2D action platformer that returns the series to its roots, Ninja Gaiden Ragebound. While the mere existence of this trio is a pleasant surprise, Ragebound is perhaps the biggest shock, as the series hasn’t been two-dimensional since the early ‘90s. It’s also being delivered by a developer (The Game Kitchen) and publisher (Dotemu) who are new to Ninja Gaiden. They aren’t new to pixel art or retro throwbacks, though, and Ragebound appears to be in good hands that have real love for the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you know The Game Kitchen’s Blasphemous series, you’ll know they produce some of the best-looking pixel art today. Even though the Ragebound reveal trailer featured a lot of hand-drawn animation, everything I saw during my playtime was pixel art, from the title screen to cut scenes. I love the sense of depth they create in a forest area with layers of parallax scrolling, while fireflies drift about in the foreground, unconcerned with all the bloodshed happening right in front of them.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sequence-10-00-05-45-08-still002-1744762607029.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">An early boss fight.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of bloodshed, defeated enemies provide a satisfying splatter of pixelated red spray. Some bad guys even have multiple death animations. I also appreciate how, while some enemy corpses will fly offscreen or just burst into goo, others remain littered in your wake. Your own blood will occasionally spill on the background. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For its part, meanwhile, Dotemu published TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge, Streets of Rage 4, Metal Slug Tactics, and the upcoming Marvel Cosmic Invasion. This is a team with a track record of reviving dormant game franchises and reinvigorating them with fresh ideas and often dazzling art. That seems to be the case again with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound. It looks like a supercharged 16-bit version of the NES trilogy and adds some gnarly new ninja tricks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One is the Guillotine Boost, which lets you bounce off enemies and projectiles with a spin attack. Not only will it deal damage, it extends your time in the air and therefore will help you cross wide areas with no ground beneath your feet. Game Kitchen has prepared many platforming challenges for you around this technique.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sequence-10-00-10-01-08-still003-1744762662791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kumori, your demoness buddy.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll notice certain enemies have a glowing aura around them. These you can slash to load your hypercharge attack, which decimates large foes and obstacles with one hit. Hypercharges can be chained together if there are multiple glowing enemies nearby. So in many instances there is a preferable order in which bad guys should be defeated, adding one more layer for you to think about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be clear, Ragebound is a level-based action game, not a Metroidvania. You make your way through each area slashing enemies, platforming, and fighting a boss at the end -- like the large demon bat thing I encountered in one of the first areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mercifully, checkpoints will prevent you from being sent back to the beginning should you be overcome. At the end of a stage you’re scored on your performance from D to S and will receive a summary of your completion time, number of kills, max combo, collectibles you found, and any challenges you completed. Challenges might be things like not taking damage or killing a certain amount of enemies with hypercharged attacks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I want to mention the prologue that sets the scene for Ragebound because it’s awesome, but if you want to avoid any and all story spoilers you may want to skip ahead. *pauses* Okay, cast your mind back to that first cutscene that opened the original Ninja Gaiden back in 1989. Two ninja face each other under a full moon. They dash forward, leap into the air, and clash swords. Back on the ground, after a moment, the red ninja falls, and we learn this was Ryu Hayabusa’s father. Most of us had never seen anything so cinematic in a video game before. This event kicked off Ryu’s quest for revenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the prologue of Ragebound, we play as Ryu’s father in the moments leading up to his duel. It’s so cool! Right from the jump, fans will recognize updated versions of classic tunes, like that which underscored the moment Hayabusa San collapses to the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When word gets back to Ryu of what happened to his father, he leaves for America and all the events we witnessed in Ninja Gaiden I-III. Back in his village, some kind of portal is opened that sends demons spilling into our world. With Ryu preoccupied, it’s up to one of his pupils, Kenji, to save the village and dispatch this demonic threat. So it would seem the events of Ragebound play out alongside the original game. A literal gaiden, or side story, then. Clever.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s cool to see Ryu's 3D costume rendered in pixel art.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ryu is in one of his 3D Ninja Gaiden outfits here. He’ll obviously be changing into his original blue outfit for his trip to America, but it’s cool to see a 3D costume rendered in pixel art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many gamers who came up in the ‘80s and early ‘90s still have PTSD from those damn birds that first appeared in level 3-1 of the original Ninja Gaiden. They were kind of an annoying combination of the medusa heads and fleamen from Castlevania. My friends, I regret to inform you: The buzzards are back. Thankfully, they still take just one hit and seem to be more manageable here, at least in the early stages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most interesting new additions to the classic Ninja Gaiden formula is Kumori, a demoness who will become your companion and has some useful tricks of her own. If you happen upon a Demon Altar, Kumori can commune with it and switch to the dark world, where hidden demonic entities are revealed and can be used to navigate environments and open whatever was blocking Kenji’s path. This isn’t a cooperative game, though, so Kenji will remain trapped in the altar while Kumori is galavanting about demon town. She also has special attacks that can help Kenji in combat.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sequence-10-00-15-56-22-still005-1744762535242.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Two heads will make you deader than one.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I already encountered some really cool enemies in my short playtime, like a cyclops that spits giant eyeballs from its gut. I like the way it dissolves into a skeleton, too. In a nice touch, clever moments break up the action, like when a demon leaps out at you but is eaten by a dragon snake thing that comes out of nowhere. These are eye candy moments that could just be amusing, or they might introduce a monster you’ll run into later on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think old school Ninja Gaiden fans are bound to enjoy this return to form. Ragebound has great pixel art, fast-paced platforming action, and new ideas that elevate the source material. I’m looking forward to learning more about Kumori and seeing how her relationship with Kenji develops. From what I’ve played so far, this seems like another winning combination of beloved but neglected IP with passionate indie devs. Ninja Gaiden Ragebound is out this summer.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
