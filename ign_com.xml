I am praying he makes to when we are done. Thanks, internet, for signal boosting Caleb’s story.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re deeply thankful to the Borderlands community for rallying around Caleb after he shared his story several weeks ago,” <a href="https://x.com/GearboxOfficial/status/1861880536467210743" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gearbox added</a>. “His courage, strength, and determination are an inspiration to us all. Our team was honored to host him last week at our studio.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McAlpine himself returned to the Borderlands 3 subreddit to post pictures of his Gearbox visit and reveal what had happened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So Gearbox flew me and a friend down 1st class the 20th of this month and we got to tour the studio and meet an amazing bunch of people from some of the devs of all of the Borderlands games up to Randy the CEO,” McAlpine posted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We got to play what they have for Borderlands 4 so far and it was amazing. I don’t know if I will be around when the game comes out but I just want to say thank you to all of you for all of your love and support and for helping in making this happen. It truly was an amazing experience and it was just awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We stayed at the Omni at the Star (the Dallas Cowboys headquarters) and the hotel wanted to do something nice as well and got us in on a VIP tour of the entire facility. Needless to say me being a Lions fan I got to talk a lot of smack lol.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you everyone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 is due out at some point in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-dev-hello-games-hails-very-positive-steam-rating-8-years-after-overwhelmingly-negative-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"You have no idea what this means to us."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man’s Sky</a> developer Hello Games has hailed hitting a ‘very positive’ Steam user review user rating for the first time, eight years after the game’s controversial launch was slammed by players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space sim No Man’s Sky launched in August 2016 on PS4 and PC to tens of thousands of negative reviews on Steam, with players complaining about broken promises and a lack of meaningful content, particularly on the multiplayer side. The game quickly settled on the dreaded ‘overwhelmingly negative’ Steam user review rating, a clear sign to anyone who visited its Steam page that something was very wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Guildford, England-based Hello Games has continued to update No Man’s Sky over the years, improving player sentiment to the point where it is now considered superb. It took two years to hit ‘mixed,’ then another three to hit ‘mostly positive.’ At the time, five years after launch, Tim Woodley, Head of Publishing at Hello Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-gets-mostly-positive-steam-review-5-years">explained how hard it was to claw back Steam user reviews from such a low base</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Over the last five years we've moved from 'overwhelmingly negative' to 'mostly positive,’ it's an incredible achievement for the team,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Moving to 'mixed', which may seem funny to celebrate, took two years of hard work. Moving from ‘mixed’ to ‘mostly positive’ has taken the last three years (knowing that any small mistake along the way may result in backlash and negative reviews).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In some ways, it's easy to dismiss Steam reviews, it's a bit of meme to share the silly ones, but as a developer, they are undeniably meaningful. For five years now if someone bought No Man's Sky they had to do it in spite of a red or yellow warning symbol beside our name (and affecting the likelihood algorithm in charge of displaying the name in the first place).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The team is really chuffed today at hitting this milestone but we also owe a huge thank you to the community, the players, but also folks like yourself who continue to support us to do this work we enjoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each percentage point becomes exponentially harder to earn as you move up the ratings. Moving from 20% positive to 21% positive may only require a few hundred positive reviews whereas moving from 69% to 70% needed 10,000 positive reviews. This is why it's so rare for games to change their All-Time rating and why we'd assumed that we might never be able to."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, three years after that milestone, No Man’s Sky is on ‘very positive.’ Next stop, ‘overwhelmingly positive?’</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/hQcPpQ8ILM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/hQcPpQ8ILM</a> <a href="https://t.co/69AjoB48NY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/69AjoB48NY</a></p>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1862085950181892131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Games chief Sean Murray, who had come under fire upon Hello Games’ launch for failing to deliver on features he’d talked up in pre-release interviews, hailed the game’s new Steam user review rating. “Holy shit you guys - it happened,” he tweeted. “ALL REVIEWS: Very Positive. Thank you Thank you Thank you. You have no idea what this means to us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Hello Games continues to work on No Man’s Sky, it’s developing its next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-no-fire"><u>Light No Fire</u></a>. It's about adventure, building, survival and exploration together, set on a fantasy planet the size of Earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Target is one of the most popular retailers for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Black Friday</a>, and one thing I've learned over the years of finding deals is that it knows how to put on a good sale. This year, Target has come out the gate swinging with outstanding Black Friday deals on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPbP6W?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNDPKE?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5 consoles</a>, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDPMO?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Meta Quest 3S VR headset</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rayban-meta-wayfarer-smart-glasses-black-friday-deal-2024">Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer smart glasses</a>. It's also a great one-stop shop for holiday gift ideas like a new Apple iPad or a pair of AirPods, Pokemon TCG sets, LEGOs, toys, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Target is one of my favorite shopping sites, both in-store and online. Its prices are very competitive, its return policy is generous, and it has plenty of retail locations so that buying online and picking up in-store is a convenient option. Target offers great exclusive discounts via its <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6nPw?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target Circle membership</a>, and best of all, joining is free. There is a paid upgrade that's worth it for regular Target shoppers similar to Amazon Prime or Walmart+, and it's on sale for Black Friday as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update: Target's most popular deals, like the Nintendo Switch bundles and Apple devices are going out of stock quickly. I expect some (but not all) of these deals to return on Black Friday, if not sooner.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Friday is like a bonus holiday for Pokémon TCG fans. We're talking about deck building, chasing rare cards, or just stockpiling boosters for a rainy day. This year’s Black Friday deals are stacked with good finds.</p><div catalogid="b7da3839-8786-4d5d-b4cf-91f633a5d7a5" id="212187"><div id="212187" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Disney and Pixar 'Up' House 43217</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGOs are one of the best gift ideas for the holidays, so LEGO deals get snapped up pretty quickly during Black Friday. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKDGpY?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target is advertising select sets for up to 40% off</a>. We've added all of the ones that are shown in the ad scan that have been discounted, but expect to see even more sets on sale in the coming days. The best deal right now - a LEGO City Space Science Lab for only $19.99 (originally $35) - would make a great gift for kids. At an average cost of a mere 3.5 cents per brick, this deal is a phenomenal value.</p></div><p id="lego-sets"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="LEGO Sets">More Black Friday LEGO Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="19e8ee55-2ffc-4ace-a6aa-1417133b8b05" id="211553"><div id="211553" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Console</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony released their entire set of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">Black Friday PlayStation deals</a> last week and most major retailers have followed suit. The best deal is definitely on the consoles themselves: the PS5 Slim Disc Edition has dropped to $424.99 (originally $500) and the PS5 Slim Digital Edition has dropped to $374.99 (originally $450). I would choose the Disc Edition because it's only $50 more and then I have the option to buy (and later sell or trade) physical disc media. Target doesn't carry the "Fortnite Cobalt Star" bundle but all that includes is a couple of Fortnite skins and in-game currency. If you want to save some money and go the Digital Edition route, I would suggest getting the NBA 2K25 bundle, which also includes a game.</p></div><p id="playstation-5-console"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="PlayStation 5 Console">More PlayStation Black Friday Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="56b24fb1-b74e-4b45-8835-20eee9ba9746" id="211428"><div id="211428" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Outlaws was released only 3 months ago, and it's already 33% off for Black Friday. Maybe Ubisoft is trying to boost sales after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">lackluster sales at launch</a>, but that means you get to enjoy a AAA title at a great discount. IGN's Tristan Ogilvie gave it a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">7/10 review</a>, but I've beaten the game and I immensely enjoyed it and would give it at least an 8. It definitely has a "Assassin's Creed game in a Star Wars skin" vibe, and there's nothing wrong with that.</p></div><p id="ps5-and-xbox-video-games"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="PS5 and Xbox Video Games">More Black Friday Video Game Deals for PS5/Xbox</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Target isn't the only retailer with games already on sale.

I thought that this was going to be the official Black Friday deal. Alas, Target (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-breaks-nintendo-amazon-freeze-black-friday">but not Amazon, due to their supposedly shaky relationship</a>) has just knocked another $75 off the price tag.

Pure titanium (not titanium "coated") metal is considerably more expensive and is one of the main reasons why the Apple Watch Ultra commands a high price tag. The size of the case is also larger at 49mm (compared to 41mm-45mm for the Series 8). Other upgrades over the Series 8 include a brighter display protected by a scratch resistant sapphire crystal face, a precise dual-frequency GPS, beam-forming triple microphone array, dual speakers, up to 36 hours of battery life, up to 100m (300ft) of water resistance, a customizable physical action button next to the crown, and a built-in Oceanic+ app that literally puts a dive computer on your wrist. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

From teaser videos and screenshots, below, we can see a remarkable likeness to Guerrilla Games’ Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West, complete with robot beasts and a female character who weilds a bow and arrow, all in what looks like a familiar post-apocalyptic setting and art style.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Light of Motiram Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rebuild a new civilization and battle, befriend and raise various mechanimals alone or with friends in a sprawling hostile world,” Light of Motiram’s description continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked both Tencent and Sony for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horizon isn’t the only game Light of Motiram is being compared to. Given its base building, survival mechanics, and resource gathering gameplay, as well as the ability to tame "mechanimals," many are pointing out similarities with Pocketpair’s smash hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a>, which itself was accused of "ripping off" Pokémon. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company eventually launched a lawsuit against Pocketpair accusing the company of patent infringement, legal action Pocketpair has vowed to fight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Can I be the first to say it???" one Steam user said. "hahahh I mean it's obvious right? I don't need to say it. This is Palworld all over again."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I honestly think this is far more blatant than even Palworld," said another. "Horizon 3 - let’s go!" said an X / Twitter user. "Disgusting rip-off," <a href="https://x.com/Maanlosi/status/1862086620561789224" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added another</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/28/h-lol-1732793707107.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Light of Motiram. Image credit: Polaris Quest.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Light of Motiram is also being compared to Capcom's Monster Hunter and a number of other games that feature a similar aesthetic and gameplay mechanics. The inevitable question Sony and Tencent face now is whether the PlayStation maker will take any action against Light of Motiram. Guerrilla is of course working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">a multiplayer, live service Horizon game</a>, which you wouldn't be surprised to see look like Light of Motiram when Sony eventually makes its announcement. In that context, Sony probably won't look too kindly upon what Tencent is doing here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Light of Motiram is due out on PC and mobile at some point in 2025. It will be free-to-play and playable solo or with up to nine other friends per server, with full crossplay enabled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Fans desperate for an announcement from Sony have so far fed on scraps from director Hidetaka Miyazaki, who is asked about the prospect of more Bloodborne pretty much every time he’s interviewed by press.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, in February, ahead of the launch of FromSoftware’s Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">M<u>iyazaki said that because the developer doesn’t own the Bloodborne IP</u> he couldn’t speak about its future</a>. He did, however, admit Bloodborne would benefit from releasing on more modern hardware.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS4 Games (Summer 2020 Update)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the release of the PS5 Pro brought little cheer to Bloodborne fans, who have reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps5-pro-can-you-see-the-difference">Sony's $700 mid-gen console upgrade barely improves the game at all</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, fans have the surprise in-game server maintenance notice, which just so happens to coincide with PlayStation’s 30th birthday on December 3. Why would Bloodborne undergo server maintenance now, nearly a decade after its launch? And why would it fall on PlayStation’s 30th birthday, which Sony is already celebrating with a number of initiatives?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are debating this now, but amid the frenzy of speculation there are messages of caution. “Friendly reminder that they’ve periodically done server maintenance before and that’s exactly what it’s always been: server maintenance,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/1h1b8nf/comment/lzabylz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warned redditor amygdalapls</a>. “Not a new patch, not an update, not anything along those lines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do wish it was more but alas. Brace for disappointment!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Bloodborne server maintenance seems designed to coincide with potentially big announcement events, just to mess with fans. In 2022, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/zeqdf2/bloodborne_undergoing_maintenance_during_the_game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloodborne underwent server maintenance on the same day as that year’s The Game Awards</a>, sparking a similar cacophony of speculation and excitement we’re seeing today. Then… nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does add a dash of spice to the debate this time around is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-confirms-sonys-buyout-intent-but-insists-no-decision-has-been-made-at-this-time">Sony’s confirmed attempt to buy FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a> as part of a deal that could be confirmed imminently. That acquisition, should it go through, sparks all sorts of questions of its own, including whether Sony would seek to make FromSoftware’s future games PlayStation exclusive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, though, it seems more Bloodborne disappointment is on the cards, and the wait for that elusive 60 frames per second next-gen upgrade will continue — perhaps forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You could potentially start your shopping on Friday morning and be too late.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of deal quality, Black Friday 2024 is shaping up to be a golden year.

But if you want to save some money and go the Digital Edition route, I would suggest getting the NBA 2K25 bundle (see below), which also includes a game.

IGN's Tristan Ogilvie gave it a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">7/10 review</a> which is still good, but I've beaten the game and immensely enjoyed it, so I would give it an 8, myself.

Alas, Target (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-breaks-nintendo-amazon-freeze-black-friday">but <em>not</em> Amazon, due to their supposedly shaky relationship</a>) has just knocked another $75 off the price tag. That means you can pick up a Switch bundle for as low as $225. I have both models and, if I were to buy a third, it would be the Switch OLED.
