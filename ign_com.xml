Space-Time Smackdown includes the likes of Dialga ex and Palkia ex alongside the generation four starter Pokémon: Turtwig, Chimchar, and Piplup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being the second full set, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">unlike the expansion set that was Mythical Island</a>, Space-Time Smackdown features between just 140 and 150 cards. This should make it significantly easier to complete compared to set one, Genetic Apex, which includes 286 cards. It's unclear if this 140 to 150 number includes the alternate art pieces, however, which could bump up that number by a few dozen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Are you ready to rumble?

This is because Final Fantasy Remake itself only adapted the opening few hours of the original game, up to the point where the party leaves Midgar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth expanded the scope significantly, however, introducing the open world and thus covering myriad locations such as Costa del Sol, the Golden Saucer, and many more, including some new ones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It brought the overall story up to the end of Disc 1 of the original Final Fantasy 7, which closes in both games with what's arguably the most iconic moment in video game history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part 3 will pick up immediately after this, though very little is known about it so far. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-in-development">Development began in June 2022</a> but Square Enix hasn't said when it will end, only vaguely noting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027">it hopes to release Part 3 by 2027</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Gold Saucer Date (1997 vs. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Something it has said, however, is that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-we-will-not-cheat-with-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-airship">it "will not cheat" when it comes to the Highwind airship</a>. This allowed the party to quickly move around the map in the original game but, now in the world of fast travel, many fans wondered how the iconic ship could be implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will not cheat with the airship system [in Part 3] but take the challenge head on so it can freely fly all over the game map," Hamaguchi said in November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">In our 9/10 review of the last game</a>, IGN said: "Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion, both as a best-in-class action role playing game full of exciting challenges and an awe inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
