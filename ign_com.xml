The issue was so bad that Microsoft updated its <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>support website</u></a> to reveal it has placed a temporary block on Windows 11 for users with those games installed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After installing Windows 11, version 24H2, you might encounter issues with some Ubisoft games," Microsoft said at the time. "These games might become unresponsive while starting, loading or during active gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In some cases, users might receive a black screen. The affected games are Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Assassin's Creed Origins, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Star Wars Outlaws, and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To safeguard your Windows update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on devices with these games installed. These devices will not be offered to install Windows 11, version 24H2 via the Windows Update release channel."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft released an update to fix the problem in Star Wars Outlaws and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, but Microsoft and Ubisoft are both still working to sort out the Assassin's Creed games, and frustration has finally spilled over into Steam user reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Negative reviews for Assassin’s Creed Origins ramped up mid-December before hitting a peak as we crossed into 2025, with the game’s recent user review rating dropping to ‘Mixed.’ Overall reviews for the game remain ‘Very Positive.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pretty much all the recent negative reviews complain about the Windows update making Assassin’s Creed Origins unplayable. Until a resolution is found, Ubisoft told customers not to manually update to version 24H2 using the Windows 11 Installation Assistant or the media creation tool. If the game stops responding, you’ll need to use Task Manager to close the application.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft’s Windows problems have hit the company at a particularly troubling time. The company is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/days-after-shutting-xdefiant-and-laying-off-hundreds-of-staff-ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-how-to-structure-a-tencent-buyout-without-the-guillemot-family-losing-control">reportedly in buyout talks with Chinese megacorp Tencent</a> after a torrid 2024 in which it closed studios, shut down games, and made mass layoffs. The company’s next big game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, was delayed into 2025 and Star Wars Outlaws failed to meet sales expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft’s shares fell to their lowest level in the last decade in September after it made a series of dramatic announcements around the performance of its games. As well as delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Ubisoft announced a return to Steam after a period of PC launch exclusivity on the Epic Games Store, with Star Wars Outlaws recently releasing on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-xbox-and-sony-games-affected-by-actors-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Hopes to resume production this year.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hideo Kojima has revealed the ongoing video game actors strike has affected production on his Xbox game as well as his upcoming action espionage title for Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Kojima said that Kojima Productions was forced to suspend actor scanning and filming for the Xbox-published <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game">OD</a> during the second half of 2024 after the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) video game actors' strike began in July.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, casting for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Physint</a>, Kojima’s hotly anticipated return to the “action espionage” genre, was suspended due to the strike. Kojima added that he hopes to resume production in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">SAG-AFTRA video game voice actors accuse gaming companies of refusing to meet their demands on artificial intelligence. Negotiations over a new contract began in October 2022 and SAG-AFTRA members approved the strike in September 2023. Check out IGN’s feature, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamers"><u>What the SAG-AFTRA Video Game Actors Strike Means for Gamers</u></a>, for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this means for both OD and Physint remains to be seen, with both games without an official release window. Both are video game / movie hybrids, with Nope and Get Out Director Jordan Peele collaborating with Kojima on OD. Physint was announced during a Sony State of Play broadcast, suggesting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-hideo-kojimas-return-to-action-espionage-be-one-of-the-first-ps6-games">it may release on PlayStation 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Kojima is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2</a>, which is out at some point in 2025, and the live-action <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-movie-coming-from-a24-kojima-productions">Death Stranding film with A24</a>. In his tweet, Kojima teased “other adaptations” are underway, without saying any more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OD and Physint aren’t the only video games affected by the SAG-AFTRA strike. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices">Activision confirmed it had recast some members of the <u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</u> cast</a> after fans noticed much-loved Zombies characters with new voices in-game. Activision said at the time: "We respect the personal choice of these performers. Out of respect for all parties, we won’t add new commentary about the ongoing negotiations with SAG-AFTRA. We look forward to a mutually beneficial outcome as soon as possible."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is not subject to the strike because it was in development before July 25, 2024, when the strike began. However, as suggested by Activision's statement, the voice actors may have decided against signing new contracts in solidarity with striking union members. IGN has asked SAG-AFTRA for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Wiktor Szymanowicz/Anadolu via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
