            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Final Fantasy 7's multiplatform release had a pretty good month too.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It was an understandably quiet January in the U.S. games market, with very few new releases and a bit of a comedown from a busy holiday season leaving Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 again the best-selling game of the month, and the PlayStation 5 on top for consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 led hardware in both unit and dollar sales, with the Nintendo Switch 2 taking second in both, according to analysis shared by Circana senior director and analyst Mat Piscatella. Overall hardware spending was up 16% year-over-year, with an increase in Switch 2 spending (admittedly an increase over nothing, as the Switch 2 wasn't out last year) offsetting declines in spending on PS5 (down 17%), Xbox Series (down 27%) and Switch 1 (down a whopping but understandable 79%). Accessories spending was down 5% to $185 million.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In content, spending up was up 3% year-over-year to $4.3 billion, largely driven by a 23% increase in subscription spending. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was once again the best-selling game of the month, followed by NBA 2K26 again in the No.2 spot, and Madden NFL 26 rising from No.4 last month to No.3 in January. Battlefield 6, last month's No.3, dropped to No. 5 in January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only new game entering the top 20 for January was Code Vein II, which came in at No. 11. We did see Final Fantasy 7: Remake leap from No.225 last month to No.9 for January, thanks to its Xbox Series and Nintendo Switch 2 releases. Fallout 4 also made a big jump from No.68 to No.20, possibly thanks both to Season 2 of the Fallout TV show coinciding with a major drop in price on Steam at the end of the month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Piscatella tells IGN that outside the top 20, both Fable Anniversary and Animal Crossing: New Horizons saw significant sales bumps. In the former's case, this was thanks to the new trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-the-first-preview">the upcoming Fable game</a>, and in the latter's, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/ACNH_3.0_Update_and_Switch_2_Edition:_All_Details_and_Everything_New">due to the DLC and Switch 2 release</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, total gaming spending reached $4.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Not exactly a thrilling start to 2026, but when has January ever been an explosive month for games?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">January 2026 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>Madden NFL 26</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Final Fantasy VII: Remake</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>Code Vein II (NEW)</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>EA Sports College Football 26</li><li>Helldivers II</li><li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A*</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>Flight Simulator 2024</li><li>Fallout 4</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has released a lengthy Q&amp;A article discussing its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-get-nintendo-switch-launch-next-week-priced-at-20-each">upcoming Switch re-releases of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a>, and addressed its decision to launch them separately — rather than as part of the Nintendo Switch Online service, like numerous other Game Boy Advance titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response to the question "Why are you handling these classic games differently?" Nintendo <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71365/#s1q4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes</a>: "In celebration of 30 years of Pokémon, we thought it would be fun to return to the ultimate versions of the original Pokémon adventures in the Kanto region with these special releases."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in response to the question "Will these games also be coming to the Game Boy Advance – Nintendo Classics collection?" Nintendo replies: "These games are being offered as standalone software and are not planned for release as part of the Game Boy Advance – Nintendo Classics collection."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither of these answers seem to address the question of why the games could not <em>also </em>be part of the Switch Online's GBA collection (as a nice way for subscribers to access them at no extra cost) or why the games are priced at $20 each — a cost that has raised many fans' eyebrows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, the whole Q&amp;A reads as a rather defensive list of answers to questions Nintendo has anticipated fans will naturally raise in response to its decision-making here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If these titles are meant to celebrate 30 years of Pokémon, why aren't you releasing the original Pokémon Blue Version and Pokémon Red Version games that launched 30 years ago?" reads another pre-empted question. "We thought users will appreciate the ultimate versions of those original adventures, which add various features and upgrades to the contents of Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version," comes the reply. That's fair enough, but then having opened the Red and Blue can of worms, Nintendo goes on to pre-empt another popular question.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Will you add the original Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version or other Pokémon games to the Nintendo Classics collections available with Nintendo Switch Online?" It's a question Nintendo fans have asked ever since the first Game Boy titles were announced for Nintendo Switch Online, years ago. In response, Nintendo lists a selection of Pokémon spin-off games which are already available via the service, and then concludes with: "We have nothing to announce regarding any other potential titles."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon LEGO Sets</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One notable response suggests that Nintendo sees its launch strategy for FireRed and LeafGreen as likely a one-off: "What about other classic games beyond Pokémon titles? Is this the return of standalone Virtual Console types of offerings?" The response: "We remain focused on offering classic games through Nintendo Switch Online and Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But again, other than Nintendo thinking this solution would be "fun", there's little reasoning given here for why FireRed and LeafGreen will be a costly exception to its usual rule.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Nintendo is unlikely to turn around and say to fans that, really, money is the reason why it is doing this — whether that is the motivating factor here or not. And of course, despite any complaints online, these re-launches will undoubtedly sell very well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other fans have suggested that Nintendo is just technically unable to offer FireRed and LeafGreen via its usual Nintendo Switch Online GBA catalog, which typically allows players to load multiple save states and rewind gameplay. Such antics would likely create havoc for The Pokémon Company, by allowing for easier duplication of Pokémon. With just this list of Q&amp;A answers to go on, though, this remains speculation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon will celebrate its 30th anniversary next Friday, February 27, with its annual Pokémon Presents livestream. Tune in then for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
