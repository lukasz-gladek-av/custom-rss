It’s yet another addition to the in-development title that sees Grinding Gear fine-tune the experience to live up to both it and fans’ expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Endgame maps have increased their monster, chest, Essence, Strongbox, and Precursor Artifacts numbers in hopes of creating a more rewarding experience for those deeper into Path of Exile 2. Endgame players will now also find four new Tower Map areas – Alpine Ridge, Bluff, Mesa, and Sinking Spire. Skill changes include tweaks to things like Supercharged Slam, Scavenged Plating, and more, while monster balances promise increased toughness per essence modifier and a reduction for the Lost-men Zealot’s Meteor range. There are, of course, also a vast number of glitch and quality-of-life improvements included in today’s list.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Path of Exile 2 patch 0.1.1 is only the first of many updates set to launch in 2025. Included in the patch notes are mentions of fixes for issues Grinding Gear says it “didn’t quite get ready in time for this patch.” For example, it’s taking longer to fix Una’s Song than the team anticipated, and Map Stash Tabs are also on the way. Grinding Gear says these problems will be addressed “as soon as they’re ready.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s worth stressing that just because a specific issue is not on this list, it doesn’t mean that we’re not aware of it or that it isn’t going to get addressed,” game director Jonathan Rogers explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNJSDxwC9bY&amp;t=8s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a recent video going over everything in 0.1.1</u></a>. “It just means that we either can’t fix the problem quickly, or we can’t do so without the need for a new economy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The long wait for the Path of Exile 2 early access launch finally came to an end when it released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on December 6, 2024. It saw massive success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-enjoys-massive-launch-becomes-15th-most-played-game-ever-on-steam"><u>securing its place as the 15th most-played game Steam game ever</u></a>. Regardless of its strong start, the team acknowledged that more could be done to make the experience feel rewarding, outlining <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-dev-admits-the-game-doesnt-feel-rewarding-enough-outlines-plans-to-increase-loot-drops"><u>a plan to tweak loot drops last month</u></a>. For everything coming in update 0.1.1, you can read the full patch notes below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Path of Exile 2 Update 0.1.1 Patch Notes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>0.1.1 Patch Notes</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This patch contains new endgame tower maps, checkpoints for map areas, respawn attempts for the Arbiter of Ash, as well as many monster changes, unique changes, improvements and bug fixes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Endgame Changes</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added 4 new Tower Map areas: Alpine Ridge, Bluff, Mesa, and Sinking Spire.</li><li>The Lost Towers Map area has also been revamped.</li><li>To address the problem of only having one attempt at the Arbiter of Ash Boss fight, you will now have up to six respawn attempts at this fight. Respawns can only be triggered by the person who put in the keys, and everyone in your party will be respawned at the same time. Leaving the Map still forfeits your attempt so you'll still need to fight the boss with the build you walked into the Map with. Higher difficulties of the Boss will lower the number of respawn attempts you receive. We'll be looking to add respawn attempts to other Pinnacle content over time.</li><li>The Arbiter of Ash can no longer be interrupted during his falling flame seed skill. His flaming gale skill can no longer be blocked.</li><li>The Arbiter of Ash Boss is now invulnerable for longer during its emergence and now takes significantly reduced damage while emerging.</li><li>The Arbiter of Ash is now way less likely to target minions when using his sword, which could prevent some of their skills being used.</li><li>Added checkpoints to Map areas.</li><li>Map areas now contain a minimum of 3 Rare Monsters.</li><li>Citadels can now appear closer to the Ziggurat Refuge.</li><li>Improved the visibility of Citadels on the Endgame Map.</li><li>Maps now display their Biome when hovered in the Atlas UI.</li><li>Added the new Overseer's Precursor Tablet, a currency item which can be placed in completed Towers to add Map Bosses to valid Maps in radius. These tablets drop from Map Bosses, and can roll exclusive modifiers that affect Map Bosses.</li><li>Map areas have been adjusted to have more distinct specialities for the content they contain. For example, one Map area might have more total number of monsters, while another is more likely to contain additional content such as Strongboxes, Essences or Shrines. Generally speaking, the more difficult a Map is to clear, or the smaller it is, the more axes it will specialise in. Here's an overview of changes we've made to give Maps more discernibility:</li><li>A number of Maps now spawn up to double the number of Chests, and twice as many minimum Magic or Rare Chests.</li><li>A number of Maps now contain up to double the number of Monsters.</li><li>A number of Maps now contain 50% more Magic Monsters.</li><li>A number of Maps now contain 50% more Rare Monsters.</li><li>A number of Maps now have a higher minimum number of Rare Monsters you will encounter.</li><li>A number of Maps now have a lower minimum number of Rare Monsters you will encounter.</li><li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Essences.</li><li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Strongboxes.</li><li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Shrines.</li><li>Maps that are only exclusively found in Biomes containing Citadels now have 50% more chance to contain Essences, Strongboxes and Shrines.</li><li>Unclaimed Hideout Areas now have substantially more Magic Monsters, and fewer Rare Monsters.</li><li>Monsters in the Untainted Paradise have been breeding. Untainted Paradise now contains 100% more Monsters, of which spawn 100% more (thus quadruple) Magic and Rare Monsters.</li><li>Improved the highlightability/clickability of Shrines.</li><li>Reduced the damage scaling of Monsters in Simulacrum encounters with added Difficulty.</li><li>Adjusted the chance for Maps to contain Bosses, you should be encountering a Boss roughly every 1 in 4 Maps.</li><li>The chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher has been reduced to account for the increase in total number of Map Bosses.</li><li>The Radiant Waystones Atlas Notable Passive now provides +15% chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher (previously 25%).</li><li>The small Map Boss Waystone Chance Passives now provide +6% chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher (previously 10%).</li><li>The "I'm not afraid of you!" Delirium Atlas Passive Skill now grants "Delirium Bosses in your Maps drop 100% increased Simulacrum Splinters" (previously 50%).</li><li>Reduced the number of monsters and small chests from Breaches by 15%.</li><li>Increased the amount of Simulacrum Splinters found in Maps by 20%.</li><li>Added dedicated 2D art for Waystones that are instilled with layers of Delirium.</li><li>Crisis Fragments, Breachstones, Simulacrums, and An Audience with the King now have a more appropriate gold value to vendors.</li><li>Increased how far you can zoom out on the Endgame Map on keyboard and mouse input, to match the zoom level on controller input.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Skill Changes</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Supercharged Slam now has "Each successive aftershock gains +0.5 metres to radius, up to 3 metres (previously uncapped).</li><li>Scavenged Plating now grants you stacks for a duration based on the enemy's rarity. Normal enemies grant 1 stack, Magic enemies grants 2 stacks, Rare enemies grant 5 stacks, and Unique enemies grant 10 stacks.</li><li>The Lightning Bolt Skill granted by the Choir of the Storm Unique Amulet has been renamed to Greater Lightning Bolt to differentiate it from the Skill granted by Staves. Triggered Greater Lightning Bolts are now unable to trigger a subsequent Greater Lightning Bolt if the first was a Critical Hit. Greater Lightning Bolt now deals roughly 3.5 times more base Lightning Damage compared to Lightning Bolt.</li><li>The Temporalis Unique Body Armour can no longer reduce the cooldown of a Skill to below 100ms.</li><li>Skills socketed in a Meta Gem's sockets can no longer gain energy.</li><li>Clarified Vine Arrow's description to explicitly state that it hits enemies on landing.</li><li>Removed the Aura tag from Pain Offering for consistency with other minion skills, as the skill does not directly create an Aura (the Aura is created by the summoned minion).</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Monster Changes</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Monsters now have increased Toughness per Essence modifier affecting them.</li><li>Added a small delay before monsters released from Essence Monoliths can use their skills.</li><li>Forsaken Miners now throw less grenades, which have also had their damage reduced and their visuals improved.</li><li>Rudja, the Dread Engineer's grenades now deal less damage in Cruel and Maps.</li><li>Reduced how far away Faridun Plaguebringers can use their Detonate Dead skill from.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bring me that horizon.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Yakuza series has no shortage of weird and wonderful games. From the serious but goofy at times mainline entries to its plethora of historical spinoffs, prequels, and side stories. There’s something for everyone here, really. Whether you’re looking for the next installment in the long running Like a Dragon series, or just want to play something a little different, our last hands-on with Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii ahead of release suggests that it’s shaping up to be another solid spin-off that will plunder dozens of hours from you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag dropped way back in 2013, I’ve been itching for another worthy pirate adventure. While there have been a few decent attempts released since then, none of them managed to capture my attention and made me excited to get to pirating until I got the chance to play Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. At first glance, Pirates and Yakuza may seem like a combination that’s about as compatible as oil and water. But upon closer inspection, Like a Dragon’s world, eccentric main character, and not too overly serious presentation makes for a surprisingly competent and fun pirate adventure. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Combat Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii you assume the role of longtime series favorite Goro Majima after he loses his memory and winds up on an Hawaiian island. From everything I saw during my few hours of hands-on time, the series’ weirdness is cranked up to 11 here. Outside of beating up roving gangs of pirates and the occasional bounty with my small tiger companion, I found myself recruiting a wide assortment of weirdos to my pirate crew, playing a plethora of fun and surprisingly addicting minigames – such as a home run derby, karaoke, and sailing the pacific ocean in my pirate ship, complete with ship-to-ship combat and aggressive weather. To put it bluntly, there’s a lot to do here. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Island Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">During my preview I spent a lot of time in the pirate city of Madlantis, an area overrun by pirates, criminals, and some genuinely strange people even by Yakuza’s standards. I was able to participate in numerous minigames and side activities such as claw games, ports of classic SEGA arcade games like Virtua Fighter, and the Pirates’ Coliseum, an area where I was able to engage in ship-to-ship combat to battle it out with an assortment of unique pirate crews, as well as other combat-based minigames. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of combat, in main gameplay, it strays away from the JRPG turn based style of the two previous Like a Dragon games in favor of a more traditional beat-’em-up combat style. Majima has two fighting styles: Mad Dog and Sea Dog. While both fighting styles are rooted in the standard “heavy and light attack mixed in with dodges” formula, both styles play differently enough that I found myself swapping between them in order to keep the momentum on my side and deal out as much damage as possible. In Mad Dog mode, Majima will don his familiar getup and use a plethora of fast combos to quickly dispatch an enemy. Sea Dog, on the other hand, has Majima wearing a pirate getup and relies on pirate-themed weaponry such as two cutlass swords, a pistol, and a grappling hook. While Mad Dog was fun to play, the majority of my combat time was spent in Sea Dog due to its diverse assortment of weapons and abilities. Regardless of what fighting style I had selected, though I found myself having a ton of fun beating up dozens of rival pirates. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It strays away from the JRPG turn based style of the two previous Like a Dragon games in favor of a more traditional beat-’em-up combat style.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say combat didn’t have its shortcomings, though. Blocking and dodging took a bit of practice to get used to, and the enemies can range from a total pushover to a challenge that had me seeing the game over screen more times than I had expected to in a Yakuza game. Still, once I figured out how to effectively switch between fighting styles and take advantage of every tool and ability I had available, the combat became a challenging but rewarding experience. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Set Sail</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Naval combat is a welcome addition to the Like a Dragon universe. While some games tend to over complicate ship combat, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii goes with a “less is more” approach to its maritime warfare sections. My ship had a few methods of destroying enemy vessels the port side of my pirate ship was donned with short-range flamethrowers that could deal immense damage as long as I was close to my target, while the starboard side of my ship was equipped with long-range cannons. Firing off these two options in addition to the front-facing machine guns is how I spent most of my time in ship-to-ship combat. The third option was to leave the helm of my ship and use Majima’s rocket launcher. While this didn’t do as much damage as the other options, it was pretty fun to jump around my boat and take pot shots at enemy ships. Regardless of which method I chose to engage in, I found myself having fun drifting my boat around and sinking enemy vessels.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on everything I’ve played so far, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is definitely shaping up to not only live up to the high standards of the Like a Dragon series, but it also has the potential to become one of the better pirate games released since Black Flag. With its fun and creative combat, intuitive ship warfare, and genuinely interesting and wacky world, you’re going to want to pack your Hawaiian shirt.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Keep in mind that this list below does not include the games available with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p><div catalogid="6381d2be-7f83-4285-91f2-acb37fdd2982" id="213268"><div id="213268" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic x Shadow Generations</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Sonic Game Released on the Switch (in Release Order)</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Mania (2017)</h3><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/thumbs/userUploaded/2017/8/14/sonicmania1280-1502683395450.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sonic Games: Sonic Mania</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review">Sonic Mania</a> was developed by PagodaWest Games and Sonic fangame community member Christian Whitehead as a love letter to the classic Sonic the Hedgehog titles released on the Sega Genesis and Sega CD platforms. Taking place after the events of Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, the game remixes eight iconic levels, including Green Hill Zone and Chemical Plant Zone, and introduces five new ones, including the glamorous Studiopolis Zone and the peaceful Press Garden Zone. This game also introduces a new troupe of Eggbots called the Hard-Boiled Heavies for Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles to beat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mania is considered one of the best Sonic games of the 2010s because of the experiment in allowing a group of Sonic fans to create a game other Sonic fans would love, the vivid neon graphics, and the new challenges present in every stage.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Forces (2017)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/11/sonic-forces-review">Sonic Forces</a> makes Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic form a resistance against Dr. Eggman after he conquered most of the world alongside Infinite, a masked jackal who uses the Phantom Ruby to create doppelgangers and warp reality. The game switches gameplay modes between third-person Boost gameplay with Modern Sonic, side-scrolling gameplay with Classic Sonic, and a mode with the custom avatar character, which can be any animal you want, whose weapons use Wisp power-ups. Forces’ writing and lighting aren’t exactly the best in the series, but the game is still tolerable for some people.</p><div id="197171" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Forces</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Team Sonic Racing (2019)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/17/team-sonic-racing-review">Team Sonic Racing</a> takes racing games to a whole new level by having players race <em>with</em> each other, not <em>against</em> each other. This game has a cooperative gameplay mechanic similar to Splatoon and Overwatch, using Sonic Heroes as a frame of reference, where you play in teams of three characters and work together to win each race, paying very close attention to your teammates’ performance and sharing Wisp power-ups with them to allow them to speed up and pull your ranks. Since most of the karts are sports cars, you can customize them with gold rims and paint your car any color you want West Coast Customs style.</p><div id="181380" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>2 Games Sonic Mania + Team Sonic Racing</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 (2019)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Released a year before the real-life Tokyo Olympic Games was scheduled to begin (only to be postponed to 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/05/mario-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-tokyo-2020-review">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020</a> brings the platform rivalry between the jolly red plumber, the speedy blue hedgehog, and their respective friends back to the world stage with new events, like surfing, skateboarding, karate, and sport climbing, and bonus features. The game includes a story mode that takes Mario and Sonic back to the Tokyo 1964 Olympics and their early 2D sprite selves, while everyone else works to help bring them back to the real world in the present day. You get the best of both eras and some history lessons about the Olympic Games in Tokyo to go with it.</p><div id="195359" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mario &amp; Sonic at The Olympic Games Tokyo 2020</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Colors: Ultimate (2021)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-colors-ultimate-review">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a> is a remastered version of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-colors">original Sonic Colors</a> developed by Blind Squirrel Games for Sonic’s 30th anniversary in 2021. The remaster enhanced the graphics to brighten up the colors of Eggman’s interplanetary amusement park and the character models, introduced a new Jade Ghost Wisp to help Sonic phase through walls and ceilings, replaced the traditional lives with rescues from Tails, and introduced mini races against Metal Sonic. You can also collect Park Tokens to customize Sonic with the wackiest designs for his shoes and gloves.</p><div id="197172" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Colors Ultimate</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Origins (2022)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-origins">Sonic Origins</a> compiles the first four classic Sonic games released on the Sega Genesis and Sega CD and remasters them for modern consoles and the audience that plays on them, whether they’re veteran fans seeking a nostalgia fix or young fans who want to understand Sonic’s history. Players can experience the game in Classic Mode, which is the original format presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio, or Anniversary Mode, which replaces lives with coins and allows Sonic to use Drop Dash as he did in Sonic Mania. Each game in the compilation features new animated cutscenes at the beginning and end done by the incomparable Tyson Heese to connect all four games into a cohesive story, provided you play them in the original release order.</p><div id="187208" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Origins Plus</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Frontiers (2022)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-frontiers-review">Sonic Frontiers</a> is the first open-world game in the Sonic franchise – or should we say, “open-zone”? – born out of a trend of open-world games being styled after The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Sonic explores the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-frontiers/maps">vast Starfall Islands</a> to fight cybernetic enemies, solve various puzzles, and run through Cyber Space levels modeled after the levels from past Sonic titles in an effort to save his friends from the digitized dimension. Both veteran and new Sonic fans alike will enjoy running around the mysterious island set to a soundtrack that strikes a delicate balance between serenity and chaos.</p><div id="172543" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Open-World Sonic Frontiers</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Superstars (2023)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-superstars-review">Sonic Superstars</a> is a collaborative effort between Sega and Arzest to bring 3D graphics to a Classic Sonic game, a move that surprised everyone at the 2023 Summer Game Fest (including this author). With Classic Sonic being a CGI character on his own for the first time and classic levels getting revamped with new music and upgraded level designs, the game allows up to four people to locally play together as Sonic and his friends throughout 11 levels across the Northstar Islands and grants new powers for every Chaos Emerald they collect to overcome obstacles. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic X Shadow Generations (2024)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Sonic's latest is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a>, a remastered version of 2011's Sonic Generation that goes beyond graphical upgrades and quality-of-life improvements by including an all-new campaign comprised of reminagined Shadow stages from past Sonic games. The two campaigns combine for 15-20 hours of content across over 150 stages, leading us to say in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">our Shadow x Generations review</a> that it "soars far and above previous enhanced versions we've gotten in the Sonic franchise."</p></div><div catalogid="6381d2be-7f83-4285-91f2-acb37fdd2982" id="213268"><div id="213268" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic x Shadow Generations</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">More Sonic Games Available with Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to play some classic Sonic games with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">Nintendo Switch Online subscription</a>, there are a few available under the SEGA catalog.
