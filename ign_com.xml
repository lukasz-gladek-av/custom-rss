            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As PopCap announces a "definitive" new version of its beloved original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/plants-vs-zombies">Plants vs Zombies</a>, the studio has reflected on the evolution of its garden tower defense franchise — and revealed why now is the right time for it to go back to the series' PC and console roots, after a pair of sequels focused on smartphones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN, PopCap studio general manager Nick Reinhart said the freshly-announced Plants vs Zombies: Replanted was an opportunity to "reestablish" what fans loved about the series, while making it accessible on modern consoles, with polished-up 4K graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted will arrive on October 23, 2025 priced at $19.99, for PC (via EA app, Epic Games Store and Steam) and on consoles for Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">New features include local co-op and PVP options, two additional game modes (a roguelike permadeath offering named Rest in Peace, and Cloudy Day mode, which ups the difficulty by limiting sunlight), plus an art gallery showing previously-unreleased concepts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Describing the package as "the definitive PvZ remaster," executive producer Jake Neri said it was PopCap's way to "preserve the magic of the original while also giving it a freshness that allows it to live for another 20-odd years."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've heard for quite a while now that that people would love a remaster of this game," Neri continued, when asked why Replanted was surfacing now. "Timing is important."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"PopCap just celebrated [PvZ's] Sweet 16, which may seem like a little bit of a strange one but, at PopCap, we are strange," added Reinhart. "It certainly has been swirling around sort of for a little bit, as we've been talking about getting things pulled together."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Replanted's announcement comes at an interesting time for the Plants vs Zombies franchise, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/18/plants-vs-zombies-3-in-development-pre-alpha-available-now">at least six years of work</a> by PopCap testing various versions of Plants vs Zombies 3 on smartphones. Finally released worldwide in January 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-takes-plants-vs-zombies-3-offline-for-major-overhaul">PvZ 3 was then taken offline in October 2024 for another "major overhaul"</a> — and, nearly a year later, it is still to resurface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My official answer here is that I don't have anything to say about PvZ 3 at the moment," Reinhart said when asked for an update on the MIA threequel's status. For 2025, at least, the franchise's focus appears to be Replanted — though there are "no plans" for Replanted to also launch on smartphones, something that would leave the runway clear for PvZ to return there at some point.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/30/screenshot-bowlingminigame-1753890173475.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Is it a reset?" Reinhart said, when asked if Replanted's launch was the franchise resetting to its origins, after various spin-offs and sequels. "I think that's an interesting way to sort of frame the question. What I would say is that I think it's more of a reacknowledgement of what our roots are, and what sort of games we should be thinking about and what we should be making."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Has the brand ever gone away? No," Reinhart continued. "A reset, to me, almost implies 'well, it's been dead on the vine,' and we're, like, trying to bring it back or something like that. I don't think it's there. I do think that it's an opportunity for us to reestablish that this is a brand that people love, that there are still a lot of Neighborville stories that we can and should tell, and that we have to author that, to some extent, with our fan base in mind, and that we have to be able to acknowledge what we've done there."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, PopCap has arrived on its decision to relaunch the original Plants vs Zombies after seeing the reaction to its more recent games in the series. 2013's smartphone-only Plants vs Zombies 2 was popular and long-lasting, though included touchscreen power-ups and microtransactions that grated with some players. More recent years have seen the franchise's console focus transform into a 3D shooter, via the Garden Warfare spin-off franchise — though for now, 2019 entry Battle for Neighborville appears to be the last. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even PopCap itself, previously a prolific creator of bizarre but compulsive game ideas (Feeding Frenzy! Zuma! Bookworm!) has consolidated its focus in recent years. Bejeweled Stars will be a decade old next year, while Peggle 2 is 12 years old already, with no sign of a third entry on the horizon. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/30/screenshot-gameplaynight-1753890173477.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I would say that the passion of the community is an important thing that has to be galvanized and recognized," Reinhart said, discussing why PopCap has gone back to PvZ's roots now. "So much of what inspires our design decisions is, how we make sure that we are keeping something that is familiar, that doesn't entirely break the compact we have made with the player base, but that we can also then begin to iterate and move it forward as well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game has given us an opportunity to go and dive in and try to figure out exactly what it is that people love about PvZ," Neri added. "And there's a lot of learning that we've done about the zaniness of the IP and how it appeals to people in that way, and that helps guide us and help us be true to what the the expectation is."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This desire to keep within fan expectations helped informed PopCap's choice of new modes for Replanted, Neri continued, as while the developer had plenty of ideas and could have gone in "all different directions," Replanted's team instead aimed for what they thought fans would actually want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're very thoughtful about how much innovation we bring into it," Reinhart agreed, "and not just trying to alienate the core overall experience for players... As we look to the future, we're looking at the brand more holistically and saying, what else is there? And what would it mean for us to reinvestigate some of that? There are no formal plans for right now, but it's something we are spending a lot of time looking at. But for this year, for the current stanza of where PopCap is, it is back at tower defense, and we're excited about that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've done a ton of exploration around what people loved about all the different versions of PvZ and trying to bring it back into this version," Neri added. "As we go forward, I definitely hope that Replanted will be an anchor for for us, that people can look to and understand — because the original PvZ still lives in people's hearts and minds."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/30/screenshot-levelselect-1753890173478.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what of the future? Does a return to the more grounded original Plants vs Zombies in Replanted offer a clue as to where the franchise could go next? Or could it spark the re-release of other PopCap classics?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've absolutely been having conversations about — if this is fruitful, if this meets the fans expectations... is this a template?" Reinhart said. "I think there's a lot of enthusiasm about that. Now, whether or not there are actually plans ongoing yet, we can't say that, but I would say we're very interested to see how this goes and what it would maybe mean for other properties to sort of maybe follow a similar route.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"PvZ is incredibly enduring," Reinhart concluded, "and being able to bring that to a new audience, to reawaken people's nostalgia and their feelings about it as well, especially in a time where I think the world could use a little bit of joy and wackiness, it just feels like the right time for that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The game will launch for all platforms on December 4, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> will let players create a customizable character for the first time, and set off on a "journey of restoration" after your home town of Wishvale is burned to the ground. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Footage shown in today's debut trailer features the series' usual HD-2D visual style, with turn-based battles and the ability to rebuild Wishvale by placing and designing homes and other buildings. A press release for the game promises over 30 recruitable party members, and a return of the series' Break &amp; Boost battle system.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If the idea of an Octopath Traveler prequel sounds familiar, that's because this game incorporates story elements from Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, a free-to-play spin-off for smartphones, released back in 2020 within Japan, and more widely in 2022. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a blog post, Square Enix said that while Octopath Traveler 0 was "inspired by story elements and gameplay ideas from that game", it was also designed from the ground-up as a "full-fledged console and PC RPG" with additional narrative content, fresh character backstories, full voice acting, and the aforementioned town-building feature. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The name OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 conveys the idea that you're undertaking a journey of your own making," producer Hirohito Suzuki said in a statement. "Whether you've played the first game in the series, Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, or even neither, we’ve packed this game with original experiences that can be enjoyed by anyone! I look forward to players experiencing this new story for themselves.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix's first Octopath Traveler originally launched for Nintendo Switch back in 2018, before eventually launching on other platforms in subsequent years. Octopath Traveler 2, meanwhile, arrived in 2023. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's presentation also saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-is-square-enixs-latest-new-action-rpg-coming-to-switch-2">Square Enix announce a second HD-2D title, The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, which looks to  be a brand new action RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For everything else announced, here's our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">roundup of today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase presentation in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

No matter which one you buy, though, all have the same expected estimated release date of February 2026.</p><div catalogid="d6c6ae7e-891a-43aa-a5c8-76fb10d87c7f" id="226178"><div id="226178" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (Original Soundtrack - Vinyl)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, the<a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXogd?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u> IGN Store</u></a> (which is owned by our Parent Company IGN Entertainment), was selling the exclusive black and gold galaxy effect variants of both the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP85NZ?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>6LP Vinyl</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL87Wm?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>2LP Viny</u>l</a> for $155/£143 and $47/£44 respectively, before selling out of stock. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the IGN store still has the standard black versions of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEgE5P?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>6LP Vinyl for $145/£134</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/985mqq?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>2LP for $42/£39</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDrkJ?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Laced Records</u></a>, who specialises in physical music media, are taking preorders for the standard black vinyls too, both the <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/collections/clair-obscur/products/clair-obscur-expedition-33-deluxe-x6lp-boxset" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>6LP set for $145/£115</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAWyp?object_uuid=2948a14a-0cb2-4026-b983-c6268f3498c4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Double Vinyl for $42/£36</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach"><u>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</u></a> is out, Hideo Kojima has turned his attention to the Xbox-published <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game"><u>OD</u></a>, which he previously described as "a game I have always wanted to make." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ssense</u></a>, Kojima reflected on the development and reception of Death Stranding 2, and offered an oh-so-brief glimpse into what's next, including the mysterious OD.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're hoping for some concrete details, I'm afraid you're out of luck — Kojima is as coy as ever about the new project — but he did describe it as "something totally different... people will love it or hate it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Kojima seemed very matter-of-fact about that aforementioned hate, though; while he acknowledged he will likely read fan consensus on social media and watch the inevitable video essays that pop up dissecting his work, ultimately, he believes "the real evaluations come after — 10 or 20 years from now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-officially-reveals-od-project-with-xbox-studios-and-jordan-peele-game-awards-2023">Kojima announced OD at The Game Awards 2023</a>, he took to the stage to call it something “no one has seen before.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is a game, don’t get me wrong, but it’s at the same time a movie and at the same time a new form of media," he said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The floating heads that show up in the footage above include Sophia Lillis (It, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and Udo Kier (Hunters, Swan Song).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as viewers started to wrap their heads around OD, Nope and Get Out Director Jordan Peele walked onto the stage to express his love for Metal Gear Solid 2 while revealing that he is collaborating with Kojima on OD as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He's been an inspiration to me, and the opportunity to collaborate with him is truly incredible," Peele said. "In my films, I’m always trying to maximize the immersion, put the audience into the main character’s shoes. Hideo is the master of this and he does it on a whole other level. What he’s cooking up here is completely immersive, utterly terrifying, and I am absolutely honored to be collaborating with the GOAT. Let’s go.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima didn't share the extent of Peele's involvement in OD. However, he did tease more impressive names that haven't been revealed yet:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I can say right now, is it’s not just Jordan. I have other creative partners with me on board on this project. I can’t really say who they are right now, but, I tell you, they are the legends and they are amazing.”</p><div id="hideo-kojima-games-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hideo Kojima Games Tier List</h3><h3>Hideo Kojima Games Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for when we'll eventually see anything of OD, it's worth bearing in mind that in January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-xbox-and-sony-games-affected-by-actors-strike">Kojima confirmed that the video game actors strike had affected its production</a>, as well as that for his upcoming action espionage title for Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Kojima said that his studio, Kojima Productions, was forced to suspend actor scanning and filming for OD during the second half of 2024 after the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) video game actors' strike began in July.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, casting for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Physint</a>, Kojima’s hotly anticipated return to the “action espionage” genre, was suspended due to the strike.
