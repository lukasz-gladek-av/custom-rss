            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Store has partnered with Bethesda Softworks and world-renowned artist Dave Rapoza to create Hellwalkers - the latest piece in IGN’s exclusive museum-quality IGN Artist Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Available only on IGN Store, <em><strong>Hellwalkers - IGN Artist Series 004</strong></em> vividly captures the menace and power of the legendary Doomslayer, as made possible by the equally legendary artist Dave Repoza, a lifelong Doom fan himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Store has <strong>400 premium weight art prints ($70)</strong> and <strong>100 premium acrylic art prints ($275)</strong> - both measuring a bold 18 x 24 inches. These pieces are brutal, iconic, and highly-collectible.</p><a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/ign-artist-series-doom" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each print is individually numbered and signed by Dave Rapoza and the acrylic print is truly fine art, backed on gator board and featuring a Certificate of Authenticity (laser-etched on the Doomslayer’s Shield Saw). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Id software has proven for more than 30 years that Doom truly is eternal. Since its world-shaping debut in 1993 to the epic, weighty, powerful play style of The Dark Ages, the Doom franchise’s Doomslayer has stood at the forefront of gaming as an immortal icon. This IGN Artist Series is a must-own for any serious Doom fan, and will not be reprinted once it is gone. The piece is destined to become a collector’s item, and is a perfect edition to any Doom fan’s wall. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dave Rapoza is a self-taught artist who grew up in Carver, MA.  For nearly 20 years his stunning artwork has been turning heads. Rapoza’s artwork has graced Marvel Comics covers, Magic: the Gathering, Paizo Publishing projects and a huge range of others. He has also contributed art to Diablo IV, League of Legends and the Witcher 3, among many other games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My first experience with Doom was playing the original in my neighbor’s kitchen on their ancient computer—it made a big impression on me, especially the music and definitely helped spark my love for games,” Repoza said. “Whenever I take on something like this, I try to tap into what made me a fan in the first place and boil that down into a single image. It’s a fun challenge, and I’m proud of how this one turned out. Hope you enjoy it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IGN Artist Series is IGN’s love letter to the pop culture icons we all love to watch, play, and discuss. Available for under a day, IGN Artist Series 001, 002, and 003 was produced in partnership with Bethesda and Amazon Prime Video and featured Fallout’s The Ghoul, Maximus, and Lucy MacLean, from artist Kevin Tong. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/limited-edition-ign-artist-series-hellwalker-prints-from-dave-rapoza-now-available]]></content:encoded>

Fortunately you don't have to reach a certain level or join a specific group. Here are the quick simple steps to redeeming them:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Launch Anime Rising</li><li>Press the <strong>green "Store" button</strong> on the left side of your screen</li><li>Then <strong>press the "Codes" button</strong> of a blue bird near the bottom right.</li><li>Enter your code here and press the blue Redeem button to get your rewards.</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Anime Rising Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're having trouble redeeming a code, there are two main reasons why one usually doesn't work. Here's what you need to know:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The code is expired</li><li>The code has been entered incorrectly</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">If a code is entered incorrectly or doesn't exist, you'll see a message that says, "Invalid code". To avoid running into this problem, we recommend <strong>copying and pasting directly from this article</strong>. Just make sure you don't accidentally end up with an extra space in your code when copying one. This is why it never hurts to double-check before redeeming a code.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Find More Anime Rising Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You can always check back here for whenever new codes are added since we try to update as often as we can. However, if you want to search for Anime Rising codes yourself, there is a <a href="https://discord.gg/animerising" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated Discord server</a> where they're announced. The in-game window for codes mentions each developer's Twitter account but they don't seem to post any on there.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Anime Rising in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime Rising is a collector game that seems to be inspired by Solo Leveling. You can defeat all sorts of enemies and then resurrect them to fight for you. Over time, you'll amass a large squad of teammates to help you complete quests. Using free summons from the codes in this article, you can also get characters heavily inspired by other popular anime shows too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jeffrey Lerman is a freelance game journalist for IGN who has been covering games for over a decade.
