            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-that-makes-every-dialogue-decision-for-you<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features a Canon Mode that makes every dialogue decision for the player instead of having them choose, Ubisoft has revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative director Jonathan Dumont was asked by a fan on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1jc9mj/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> how much weight player choices have in Assassin's Creed Shadows. "Choices come more into play when recruiting allies and romancing some of the characters," Dumont said, before revealing the ability to remove these choices altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Since the fanbase is divided on branching dialogues, we have incorporated an option called Canon Mode which allows you to play the game with choices already made for you, to give you a choice free experience," he added. "Hope this makes it fun for everyone."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Role-playing games have long included dialogue options that allow players to shape the story, but Assassin's Creed picked up branching dialogue when it shifted to a full-on RPG series with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/assassins-creed-origins-review">Assassin's Creed Origins.</a> Clearly, some fans preferred more concrete stories like that of Ezio's in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/03/12/assassins-creed-ii-review">Assassin's Creed 2</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mainline Assassin's Creed Games in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft will therefore hope fans of both options will pick up Assassin's Creed Shadows, which could be the most important entry in the franchise's history. Not only does it have a lot riding on it as the long-awaited Feudal Japan-set entry and the first full Assassin's Creed since 2020, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">a struggling Ubisoft needs it to perform well</a> following recent flops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not enjoyed a particularly positive promotional period so far, however. Issues began as some fans expressed frustration with inaccuracies in the game's depiction of Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">leading the development team to issue an apology</a> and say the game is not intended to be a factual representation of history but instead "a compelling, historical fiction." This comes despite art director Thierry Dansereau telling IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Ubisoft looked to make Shadows as "authentic as possible to match historical events"</a> just two months prior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concern was also raised when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission. Ubisoft apologized for doing so but refused to remove the artwork from the aforementioned and presumably already printed artbook available in the Collector's Edition. The historical re-enactment group said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says">this was not good enough</a>, but Ubisoft hasn't publicly acknowledged it since.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are also frustrated by the delay to the game, as Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was originally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">due out in November before being pushed to February 14</a>. This puts Assassin's Creed Shadows in more direct competition with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">PlayStation's Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei</a>, another 2025 open-world action adventure game set in Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained confidence</a>, however. "There's a lot of space for very high-quality games, and those two games can sell very well," he said in the company's latest earnings call. "The focus is to really make sure that we deliver a fantastic experience with this dual protagonist approach and two different and complimentary gameplays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

The game launched in September with an Ultramarines Champion skin for the Heavy class, and this week’s game-changing Patch 5 added the Dark Angels Champion skin for the Bulwark class.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Patch 5 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, based on fresh datamines, that cadence looks set to continue with each season up to Season 9.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Warhammer 40,000 spoilers for upcoming cosmetics follows!</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1hc0fw6/upcoming_seasons_leaked/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor agentduckman12</a> uncovered information revealing the cosmetic DLC, reproduced below.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Season 3: Raven Guard</li><li>Season 4: Salamander</li><li>Season 5: Space Wolves</li><li>Season 6: Chaos Pack</li><li>Season 7: Imperial Fist</li><li>Season 8: White Scars</li><li>Season 9: Blood Angels</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">What fans don’t know yet is which class is set for each Chapter Champion skin, although agentduckman12 also leaked a Salamander Sniper Champion Pack skin render, below, so we know the Sniper class is set for a Salamander Champion skin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Assault, Tactical, and Vanguard are classes are therefore still up for grabs. Obviously there are enough Chapters here for each class to get more than one Champion skin, unless Saber plans to release new classes in the future of course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only other question is when these seasons will roll out. If we’re looking at year one including four seasons, then we could be waiting until 2026 for Season 9 and the Blood Angels skin. IGN has asked Focus Entertainment for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of unannounced DLC, IGN has reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-discover-unannounced-research-centre-which-houses-all-sorts-of-unreleased-secrets">the availability in-game of what looks like a Battle Barge expansion set to hit Space Marine 2 with Season 3</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The confirmation comes <a href="https://assettocorsa.gg/open-world-map-coming-in-summer-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via Kunos' official website</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Kunos, the map will make its way into Assetto Corsa EVO in mid-2025, at an unspecified point during summer in the Northern Hemisphere. The open world will be released in stages, and will eventually cover 1600 square kilometers. New features and content will be added as the map expands. Kunos explains the map is fully laser-scanned, and will boast "unmatched detail."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Local businesses based around the Nürburgring are also set to feature, so players will be able to rent cars and upgrade and customise their vehicles at actual outets. As part of today's news, Kunos has opened an invitation to all local businesses in the vicinity of the Nürburgring to contact the studio for the opportunity to be featured in Assetto Corsa EVO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assetto Corsa EVO will initially become available on PC in Early Access from January 16, 2025. Console versions are also expected eventually, but not until the game exits its Early Access period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.
