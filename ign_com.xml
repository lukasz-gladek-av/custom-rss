As a huge Charizard fan, I <em>had</em> to have it, even with its pretty high $119.99 USD MSRP (or <em>a lot</em> <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4DZD?object_uuid=a580be26-8e88-41b5-b177-6399c8fdba87&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">higher on resale sites</a>!)</p><div catalogid="cdd9f331-db80-4e75-bee5-ce536d513fff" id="231185"><div id="231185" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex Ultra Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve always collected <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon trading cards</a>, but I only just started <em>playing </em>using the official format in the last two years. A few decks have crossed my playmats, but variations of a Charizard ex deck have continued to be my main. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I knew I’d need the Phantasmal Flames’ Mega Charizard X ex and Oricorio ex cards to experiment with new deck builds, so that was a good enough excuse as any to try and grab this collection… even if I might try and get the <em>non</em> promo-art versions to play with instead. </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon TCG: Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection (Phantasmal Flames)</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Click through the slide show above to see everything included in the </em>Pokémon <em>TCG: Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection, plus some of the cards I pulled from the booster packs. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a complete list of what’s included in the Pokémon TCG: Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>1 foil full-art promo card featuring Mega Charizard X ex</li><li>1 foil full-art promo card featuring Oricorio ex</li><li>65 card sleeves featuring Mega Charizard X</li><li>1 playmat featuring Mega Charizard X</li><li>1 deck box featuring Mega Charizard X</li><li>1 metal coin featuring Mega Charizard X</li><li>6 damage-counter dice</li><li>18 Pokémon TCG booster packs:<ul data-cy="list"><li>2 Surging Sparks TCG booster packs </li><li>4 Journey Together TCG booster packs </li><li>4 Destined Rivals TCG booster packs </li><li>4 Mega Evolution TCG booster packs </li><li>4 Phantasmal Flames TCG booster packs </li></ul></li><li>A code card for Pokémon TCG Live</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">I pulled a few playables from the Phantasmal Flames and Mega Evolution booster packs (still searching for more Lillie’s Determinations), but I didn’t get any Phantasmal Flames “chase” cards, like any of the rare cards listed on this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-phantasmal-flames-most-expensive-cards"><u>Phantasmal Flames most expensive cards list</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite random pull is absolutely the Destined Rivals illustration rare Team Rocket’s Houndoom, another one of my favorite Pokémon  of all time. Fire and Dark-type Pokémon  are my favorites, so I’m stoked for the Charizard X and Houndoom cards and Charizard-themed TCG accessories, what can I say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The playmat included in this set features nice stitching around the edges that many other official playmats lack, too, so I see it lasting quite a while, and the Mega Charizard X coin is beautiful. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This should go without saying, but I don’t think this collection is worth it unless you aim to <em>use</em> the exclusive TCG accessories that come with it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I would have preferred some variety between the playmat, deck box, and card sleeves, but at least the art they chose for the set is sick. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The coin brilliantly shines in an array of rainbow colors, and it makes for a neat easter egg balanced on top of my Charizard figure by First 4 Figures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though this absolutely is not new as far as Pokémon TCG collections go, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed by the dated array of included booster packs. I would have <em>loved</em> to see more Phantasmal Flames, and even Mega Evolution, booster packs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But maybe I’m just salty about this because <em>one</em> Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection was the only Phantasmal Flames product my partner and I could purchase between the two of us.  I'm lucky I was also sent a press copy of this particular collection so I didn't have to share! For reference, we succeeded in buying one at The Pokémon  Center website, but failed everywhere else for everything else. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, that’s an entirely different conversation. Even with the $119.99 price tag, I’m happy with the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection as both a huge fan of Charizard and the TCG. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Best Phantasmal Flames Cards Chase Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">According to marketplaces like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-phantasmal-flames-most-expensive-cards"><u>TCGPlayer</u>, certain Phantasmal Flames cards</a> have already skyrocketed further in price, and, following up from our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-most-expensive-cards">Mega Evolution round-up</a>, we’ve ranked the ten most expensive cards so far just above. From aggressive Mega attackers to powerful evolution support, Phantasmal Flames brings a fiery mix of competitive threats and high-demand pulls. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Casey DeFreitas is the Deputy Editor of Guides at IGN and loves all things Pokémon.
