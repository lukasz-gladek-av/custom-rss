            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition</a> is out now, and of course modders are already pushing it to its limits. But the way they’re doing it is a lot of fun — and is perhaps the closest we’ll get to seeing a Waaagh! visualized on-screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is Relic Entertainment’s much-loved real-time strategy game set in Games Workshop’s grim dark sci-fi universe. It launched in 2004 and proved to be an entry point into the Warhammer 40,000 universe for a generation of PC gamers, while also pleasing existing fans with its authentic representation of the setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, over 20 years later, Dawn of War returns in Definitive Edition form, and some of the modders who have spent years tinkering with the original are excitedly moving over to this new version to see what it's capable of.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of this early testing is being done by people involved with <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/unification-mod-dawn-of-war-soulstorm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dawn of War’s wonderful Unification Mod</a>, which lets users seamlessly combine almost all community-created races. Within hours of Definitive Edition’s release this week, modders started seeing how many Ork Boyz they could spawn in-game before it crashes, because, well... what else would Ork Boyz do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One member of the Unification Discord, Gunnisson, led the charge by summoning Ork Boyz as soon as they got their hands on the Definitive Edition:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/dow1-1755253840929.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, a progress update at nearly 1,000 Boyz spawned:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/dow2-1755253930010.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Orks just like to gather in big groups. They're not sure why.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Over 3,000, and according to Gunnisson: "They're pathing through each other exceptionally well."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/dow3-1755253991979.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ork count kept on increasing, to the point where, after more than 10,000 Orks, Dawn of War hit single-digit frames per second and became unplayable. But it still ran! "I mean, 10,000+ models on screen, I call that a win for performance and stability," Gunnisson said.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/dow4-1755254170636.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Gunnisson was eventually able to make 47,504 Ork Boyz “before the game died.” It took over seven hours, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/809740820151664680/810173515197579375/1405787870962126953" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they said</a>, while publishing the screenshot below: "At the end it was still chugging along at 10 seconds-per-frame."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/image-1755252844682.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">That's a lot of Boyz. Image credit: Gunnisson / Discord.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Performance is fantastic," Gunnisson added. "It took a lot of corpses to start impacting." Then: "I'm hyped to try some big matches."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a herculean effort, and for Warhammer 40,000 fans is about as close as we’ll get to a good old Waaagh! For the uninitiated, this is the name given to the wonderful moment when enough Orks gain enough collective momentum to launch devastating system-wide invasions. The Orks don’t really understand what’s going on or why it’s going on — they’re just happy they’re in a massive scrap — but for anyone on the receiving end, it’s bad news indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3556750/discussions/1/591779517900522091/?snr=1_5_9_" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> to mark the release of the Definitive Edition, Relic thanked modders for helping to test the game ahead of launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to say a huge thank you to our community modders who we have been working with for many months,” Relic said. “They've put in a lot of work both in helping us to support legacy mods, and in readying their own mods for the Definitive Edition.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s exciting to imagine what modders will be able to do with the Definitive Edition in the coming years as they get to grips with the game. As Gunnisson suggested, massive battles involving tens of thousands of units may now be possible, if the game can stand up to it. Perhaps then we'll get truly lore accurate body counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

I don't feel any need to go back and work with him again."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with more distance, Hayer told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/he-once-said-playing-metal-gear-solid-5-would-be-60-hours-of-humiliation-but-snake-actor-david-hayter-finally-played-the-game-all-is-forgiven/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PC Gamer</u></a>, "Well, there was reluctance. I didn't want to play the game because I figured it would hurt my feelings. Then, you know, 10 years went by and I was like, 'Ah, to hell with my feelings. What do I care?' [...] I'm a screenwriter, so I get fired for a living, like I literally, eventually, get fired from every single gig that I've got, and I'm not a child.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was like, 'Stop being a baby and play the game.' So I played it. It's amazing."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hayter has also "forgiven" Sutherland, too. After bumping into him at a bar in Dallas, Hayer and Sutherland "had a bunch of drinks." "He's a great guy, you know? No, no ill will. All is forgiven," Hayter said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for why Hayter rates Phantom Pain as highly as he does?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The fact that you can go into the same scenario each time, and the [enemy's] gonna be doing the same thing, but you can take on different routes or different strategies of attack, makes it feel like time travel… So, yes, that was badass.

Its lack of story focus is sure to be divisive for the Metal Gear faithful, but the resulting emphasis on my story, my tales of Espionage Action, easily make it my favorite in the series."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Are Death Stranding and Metal Gear Solid games too reliant on cinematics?

That’s because the word Paladin was found in the name of a build uploaded to Blizzard’s servers (2.5.Xpaladin67961).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Paladin is one of the most popular classes from Diablo 2, so its arrival in Diablo 4, should it happen, would be celebrated by the game's community. Now, this may be <em>nothing</em> (and Diablo 4 fans are already joking that the Paladin will be added as a Mercenary rather than a new class), but a new class is expected from Diablo 4’s second expansion, and the Paladin would certainly be a crowd-pleaser.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Blizzard confirmed earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-next-expansion-after-vessel-of-hatred-wont-come-until-2026">Diablo 4’s next expansion was pushed out of 2025 and into 2026</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald's has announced fresh restrictions aimed at combating scalpers, as it launches the next wave of its enormously popular Pokémon promotion in Japan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last weekend, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mcdonalds-pokmon-card-giveaway-ends-early-amid-restaurant-chaos-scalping-and-widespread-food-waste-as-fans-buy-dozens-of-happy-meals-only-to-dump-uneaten-burgers">fast food chain was swamped by scalpers who bought up dozens of Happy Meals just for the exclusive Pokémon cards within them</a>. Photos and videos posted to social media by outraged fans highlighted arguments among patrons over the scalping, and showed examples of huge food wastage, with the Happy Meals dumped by the side of the road or left in the restaurant uneaten. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The incident meant McDonald's ran out of its cards within hours of its three-day promotion going live, forcing the burger brand to apologise to Pokémon fans left empty-handed. And now, McDonald's has gone further — with new rules regarding the availability of Pokémon merchandise in Happy Meals applied from today.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We deeply apologize to our customers who regularly use McDonald's restaurants, as well as to our store staff and many others for any inconvenience caused by the Happy Set Pokémon Card Campaign," McDonald's wrote in a new <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0814a/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> released this morning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will continue to release the Pokémon Happy Meals, which include five different toys, as scheduled from Friday, August 15. However, in light of the current situation, we will be implementing the following purchase restrictions for three days until Sunday, August 17th."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These restrictions include a maximum purchase of three Happy Meals per group (this was previously higher, and per person). "If you order four or more," McDonald's now says, "we will refuse your purchase and cancel the order."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Furthermore, during this period, there may be restrictions on use at some stores and during certain hours," the chain continued. "We will not allow purchases from customers who do not follow the above rules and etiquette."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest difference with the coming weekend's promotion, however, is that it no longer features Pokémon cards at all — just Pokémon toys. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/untitled-1-1754903573029.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A Pokémon fan shows a collection of Happy Meal card packs, while food lies unopened and dumped. Image credit: daihonyaku/daiyamoto69.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On scalping specifically, McDonald's said it "does not tolerate the purchase of Happy Meals for the purpose of resale, or the abandonment or disposal of food," in a direct response to the activities of some customers last weekend. However, it's unclear how the chain can and will be able to enforce this. Still, what's obvious is the brand has taken note of the social media outrage — and the disappointment among young Pokémon fans and families at not being able to get cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to customers who look forward to dining with their children, grandchildren, or friends due to these purchase restrictions," McDonald's concluded. "We will continue to review and improve these sales methods and measures, listening to the opinions of our customers and store staff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Pokémon news, last week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-updated-with-new-card-art-following-ho-oh-plagiarism-controversy">The Pokémon Company replaced the art for its Lugia and Ho-Oh cards</a> which had fallen foul to claims they included fan designs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
