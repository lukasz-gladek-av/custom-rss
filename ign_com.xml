            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">No other studios were affected, per Ubisoft.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nineteen employees have been laid off from Star Trek: Bridge Crew and Tom Clancy studio Ubisoft Red Storm, IGN has learned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft confirmed the layoffs to IGN in a statement as follows:</p><blockquote>Today, Ubisoft made the decision to eliminate 19 roles at Red Storm Entertainment. This step is part of our ongoing, targeted restructuring and global cost-saving efforts, and reflects the needs on the studio’s projects. While this was not an easy decision, it was a necessary one given our operational priorities. We remain committed to supporting those affected with comprehensive severance packages, extended health-care benefits, and career transition assistance. We deeply appreciate their hard work and the impact they’ve had on Ubisoft.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft PR also confirmed that no other Ubisoft locations were impacted by today's layoffs. However, the company did not respond to IGN's request for information on how many employees remain at Red Storm or the status of the company's current projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft Red Storm was originally Red Storm Entertainment, founded by author Tom Clancy specifically to make games based on his novels, including Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six. The studio was acquired by Ubisoft in 2000, going on to create hits such as the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon series and assisting on other popular Tom Clancy games such as The Division. In more recent years, it has taken a backseat role as more of a VR and support studio beginning with Werewolves Within in 2016. and continuing more recently with Star Trek: Bridge Crew and Assassin's Creed Nexus VR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Storm also worked on a canceled Splinter Cell VR game, and the also-canceled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">The Division Heartland</a>. Most recently, Red Storm assisted on XDefiant, which just shut down completely last month after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">an announcement last year</a>. At the time, Ubisoft shut down the San Francisco and Osaka studios behind the game, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-16/ubisoft-entertainment-cuts-45-people-from-its-us-staff?embedded-checkout=true" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some layoffs occuring at Red Storm as well</a>. It is unclear what project Red Storm is currently working on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

I would be willing to bet a large portion of folks would immediately think of Metal Gear Solid and the gravelly tones of David Hayter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-sale-top-deals-live"><u>Prime Day</u></a>, the Nintendo Switch version (which will also run on the Switch 2) of the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 is the lowest it has ever been at only $16.99 – that's a whopping 58% discount.</p><p id="get-the-deal"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Get the deal">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="3566e46b-444b-47d6-b918-d96c51fe8444" id="224505"><div id="224505" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 (Switch)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The Nintendo Switch Version of Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This collection contains a bunch of tactical stealth goodness from the original Metal Gear Solid that first called the PlayStation home, and its PS2 follow-ups, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, in addition to plenty of other goodies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These three games alone are packed with memorable gaming moments, such as the emotional conflict between Boss and Snake in MGS3, to the back-of-the-box Codex number in MGS, that it’s hard to count just how many there are. Even if you are only familiar with Kojima from his newer games, for this sale price, even if you are only slightly interested or intrigued, you can’t go wrong trying this series out. If you are a longtime fan, you already know how good these games are. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just ask yourself, is having these games with you on the go worth the price of less than it costs to go see a movie and get some popcorn? Heck, even if you already own it on another platform, for 16 bucks, why not get another copy?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a note only Metal Gear (MSX), Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Metal Gear (NES), and Snake’s Revenge are on the cartridge, with the other games requiring a download. </p></div><p id="more-prime-day-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More Prime Day deals">More Prime Day Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Day is one of the best times to buy pretty much anything.
