While the set is home to some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-best-cards-to-chase-and-buy-today"><u>fantastic chase cards all of its own</u></a>, it’s also led to some price increases on cards that play nicely with the new Universes Beyond additions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only that, while there's been a rapid price increase, none of these cards are overly expensive to buy standalone on the secondary market right now (maxing out at $15 at most). From card draw engines to Saga skippers, these are three of the best cards you can snap up right now, and what to use them for.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Harmonic Prodigy - Modern Horizons 2</h2><div catalogid="a45e6fa8-6038-4b99-9157-52f0f0917838" id="223122"><div id="223122" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Magic The Gathering Harmonic Prodigy</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Harmonic Prodigy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Harmonic Prodigy has seen a significant price jump because it pairs so nicely with <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAxBY?object_uuid=83c80e00-0500-4094-9cd1-495eceb3eeab&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vivi Ornitier</a>, a great Commander option from the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the Prowess, Harmonic Prodigy triggers abilities of a Shaman or Wizard a second time. Not only does that mean Vivi can grow in power and turn into a mana source, but it also means you can ping rivals for an extra point of damage, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's up by +272.96% in the past year, and +131.78% this month, currently sitting at around <a href="https://zdcs.link/985P3R?object_uuid=83c80e00-0500-4094-9cd1-495eceb3eeab&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$11.45 market value</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Barbara Wright - Universes Beyond: Doctor Who</h2></div><div catalogid="a45e6fa8-6038-4b99-9157-52f0f0917838" id="223123"><div id="223123" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Magic The Gathering Barbara Wright</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Barbara Wright</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, I have no interest in Doctor Who (but my editor does!). Still, even if you don’t like timey-wimey sci-fi shows, Barbara Wright is certainly now worth a look for any Final Fantasy decks you’re building.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Her History Teacher perk allows players to select a step on a Saga (including Final Fantasy Summons) and jump right to it. That means you can get to <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJg81n?object_uuid=83c80e00-0500-4094-9cd1-495eceb3eeab&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bahamut’s Megaflare</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeb83l?object_uuid=83c80e00-0500-4094-9cd1-495eceb3eeab&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Primal Odin’s Zantetsuken</a> without delay. Sure, it’ll mean your Summons are gone sooner than they otherwise would be, but let's be honest, your opponents aren’t going to know what hit them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She's up an unbelievable +4230% in the past year, +2835.71% in the past three months, and even +415.48% just this month.

(Sigh) OK, but it’s still a great inclusion if you’re a big fan of drawing cards (and who isn’t?). He's up 189.84% just in the past few months, rising to <a href="https://zdcs.link/91j18A?object_uuid=83c80e00-0500-4094-9cd1-495eceb3eeab&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$12.68 market value</a>, up from $4.33 in March. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Danny Pink is a 4-cost 4/3 on his own, but he also gives other creatures +1/+1, which then allows for additional draw. If you’ve been keeping an eye on the latest batch of Commander Decks, you’ll know where this is going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Put simply, Danny Pink gets out of hand quickly when used in the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXW4NB?object_uuid=83c80e00-0500-4094-9cd1-495eceb3eeab&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Counter Blitz</a> precon deck.

Those who fall in battle hit the ground and can get picked back up, if their teammates wail on them hard enough to knock out the purple bars of their circular dial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm probably not alone in feeling like, sometimes, this mechanic seems to get more arduous as players fall more often. If you fall once, it's only one pip on the bar; but by third death, you've got the whole radius covered in purple, and it can feel quite difficult to chip that much purple bar down while a Nightlord is attacking you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it turns out, there are some hidden mechanics that may be helping or hindering your efforts to pick your teammates back up. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZullietheWitch" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Zullie the Witch</a> has been on the Elden Ring Nightreign beat, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HUe7JUs8_M" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently put up new video</a> in which they try to understand how revives work. (Thanks for the spot, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/you-arent-just-imagining-things-elden-ring-nightreign-player-confirms-its-6x-harder-to-revive-someone-at-3-bars-when-compared-to-1-because-fromsoftwares-ui-is-basically-lying-to-you/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per Zullie's investigation, the first time a player falls in battle, they get one bar at a total of 40 HP. But as they continue to fall, this escalates at a surprising rate, with 45 per bar at second death and a whopping 80 per bar at three, for a grand total of 240 HP total if you're on three bars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitting the player who's downed chips away at those totals, but if they're left alone for 3.5 seconds, the death timer around their dial resumes (unless you're in a Night boss fight) and the gauge starts to refill. The fill time also speeds up as you gain more bars, going from 2-per-second at one bar to 40-per-second at three bars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's a lot of math to say: the more you fall, the harder it gets (exponentially so) to pick you back up. There is some good news though, as penalties gradually wear off over time or whenever one visits a Site of Grace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zullie also highlights some hidden math in how weapons work on the revive bars, too. It's about what you'd expect, compared to regular attacks; giant weapons, like Halberds, Reapers, and Greatswords have more impact on the revive bar than Claws, Daggers, Torches, or Fists on a per-swing basis. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, Revenant's Cursed Claws make for uniquely effective revival tools in this regard, as they have the same base numbers as a Greatsword. Revenant mains can effectively play both White Mage and Summoner, I guess?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Zullie's video goes into even more math around the revival numbers, but for the average Elden Ring Nightreign player, the solid takeaways are that higher bars get increasingly harder to clear as Nightfarers fall. Honestly, it makes certain characters like the Revenant even more valuable as teammates, when they have both summons to help out and an ultimate that will pick teammates back up regardless of their bar's status.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Absolutely," said guitarist Terry Corso. "We understand that they're trying to bring some new stuff onto these releases, and if you've gotta make cuts, you've gotta make cuts. I don't know why it had to be us, I feel like our song was really good on there and it did really well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I kind of get it, that skating feels a little more punk [and] we're not a punk band," added lead vocalist Dryden Mitchell, "but I think that's what makes a cool soundtrack, is a collection, being different."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the soundtrack's reveal among fans was mixed, with some celebrating the return of tracks by CKY and Iron Maiden, while others said they would miss bands such as Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Zebrahead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 - Before and After Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Responding on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, Hawk has taken personal responsibility for the remake's choice of soundtrack, and said he had deliberately decided to include an element of discovery, as players got to know new tunes as well as old favorites.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was my choice to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in THPS3+4 OST," Hawk said. "I'm hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place.
