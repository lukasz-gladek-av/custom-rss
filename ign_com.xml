But fan discussion has now centered on the fact this amiibo also unlocks a jukebox feature for Samus' Vi-O-La motorbike, which allows you to hear other themes from the game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/samus-1764933522137.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The amiibo - Samus - Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Series costs $29.99.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussion around the rights and wrongs of Nintendo providing extra features for amiibo owners is nothing new, and dozens of Nintendo games include exclusive additions for people who own associated figurines (or borrow them from friends). Additionally, in this case, there have also been a number of inaccuracies shared over the radio's usage, with some reports incorrectly stating that it includes otherwise exclusive music, or that the bike's main Sol Valley area is silent otherwise. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's true that the Sol Valley's etheral, ambient music is relatively sparse — the desert-like area is meant to be a wasteland, after all, and a notably different environment from the game's main areas that Samus once again explores on foot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some fans have suggested that it would have been nice to have the option of turning on the in-game radio without buying a $29.99 toy, which — while a familiar argument for Nintendo games with amiibo-exclusive features — seems fair enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Couldn't they have given us that jukebox mode in the first place instead of having us buy an accessory to unluck said jukebox mode?" wrote Nintendo fan knightedwolf851 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/casualnintendo/comments/1pdpg1j/it_seems_you_will_be_able_to_put_music_in_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. "Spending more money on a game we already bought for 70-80 bucks?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Honestly, if the DLC is something that doesn't effect the gameplay and story then I'm fine with this," countered another fan, Kerrpllady. "It is a cosmetic that doesn't impact the game. (Unlike the the Skyward Sword teleport, which I think that mechanic removed some decision making from the game anyways.)"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"30 dollars to kill the intended ambiance? Okay then," quipped a third fan, The_Pepper_Oni.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">i genuinely think the desert would have been at least 3x better if they had put some BANGING music behind it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As Nintendo finally looks set to acknowledge a certain secret character's presence in Donkey Kong: Bananza, fans are taking the moment as further evidence of upcoming, unannounced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As everyone who has completed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong: Bananza</a> will know, the game's final boss is King K. Rool (and if you haven't played the game yet, you should, it's great). While he's hinted at numerous times during the game, King K. Rool's reveal is kept as a late surprise — and Nintendo has hidden the crowned reptile from all of its marketing around the game. That is, until now. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dataminers who have peered into the files of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-today">Nintendo Today</a> smartphone app have spotted that Rool will finally be acknowledged on December 15, when the scaled royal figure is set to star in the software's daily intro animation (as recorded and already visible via the Mario Wiki). And now, fans are putting Rool's reveal together with a certain other event happening in the very near future, along with some previous hints, to suggest we'll be seeing much more of the character very shortly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because, of course, next week is The Game Awards on December 11, and Nintendo has used the show to reveal some more minor announcements in the past — though, it has to be said, not for the past few years. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/108339-amiibo-king-k-rool-super-smash-bros-1200x675-1764928588998.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">King K. Rool.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there's an expectation that Nintendo does have DLC for Mario Kart World waiting in the wings, as that game's credits mysteriously include the voice actors for both King K. Rool and Void Kong, Bananza's main villain. Neither character can be found in the game at present, something that's led fans to believe the pair are arriving as part of the racer's first wave of post-launch characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wrapping up 2025 with a DLC drop for Switch 2's launch title that celebrates this year's second-biggest Nintendo release just makes sense, and may help shift a few more Switch 2 consoles ahead of the holidays (not that Nintendo really needs the help).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will King K. Rool be meeting Geoff Keighley next week? As ever, IGN will be reporting on all of the announcements from The Game Awards live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
