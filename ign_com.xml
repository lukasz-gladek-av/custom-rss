            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">New Game Plus! Level cap boost! More!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft's next big patch for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is available today, July 29, 2025, and the publisher has now given a detailed rundown of everything included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-expansion-claws-of-awaji-release-date-revealed">previously announced</a>, Title Update 1.0.7 adds New Game Plus mode, which will unlock as soon as you hit the credits after completing the game's story. From here, you have a couple of options: either to restart the game from scratch, or pick up the action from when Naoe first arrives at the game's hideout. Either way, your hard-earned gear, skills, allies and hideout progression will carry over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're playing New Game Plus or not, there's a level cap increase from 60 to 80, and a boost in the Knowledge Rank cap from 8 to 10, allowing you to counter the game's higher-level enemies with the ability to unlock more skills. You can also now upgrade gear at your Forge to level 4, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sweat your way through Shadows' story a second time via New Game Plus and you'll unlock a gold katana and long katana for Naoe and Yasuke, respectively, and also snag the last of the following three new achievements/trophies, which this update also adds:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Enjoy the Ride:</strong> Reach Level 80 </li><li><strong>Stars Unseen:</strong> Reach Knowledge Rank 10 </li><li><strong>Worth its Wait:</strong> Complete the story on New Game Plus </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Ubisoft has rebalanced some of the game's money and resources. Players will likely be happy to see a boosted amount of Mon now given from selling items, while purchased items cost less. You'll also get more resources from dismantling items and from end of season chests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is set to continue updating Shadows for the forseeable future, with a further patch due in early September that will add the ability to fast-forward the time of day and better unfog the world map when synchronising viewpoints. Assassin's Creed Shadows' first major expansion, Claws of Awaji, then arrives on September 16 as the game's first paid add-on — though it will be free for anyone who originally pre-ordered the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Find today's full patch notes below:

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting a group of friends together to learn and play a board game can be a daunting task. Not only does it require everyone in-person, but between setting up, learning the rules, and actually playing through the game it can end up taking multiple hours. Thankfully, there's an online solution that solves many of these issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena might be one of the best-kept secrets, despite having more than 10 million registered players. Still, the flexibility to play many of the most popular games today whenever you desire makes it a must for board game enthusiasts. With a massive catalog spanning every genre, it's got plenty to offer for both casual and hardcore players alike. Check out our full breakdown below to learn more about Board Game Arena, some of the included games, pricing, and what devices are supported.</p><p id="what-is-board-game-arena"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is Board Game Arena?">What Is Board Game Arena?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena is a <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> that allows you to play more than <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/gamelist" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,000 popular board games</a>—completely free. What's the catch? Surprisingly, there isn't one. It really is as good as it sounds. A metaphorical board game buffet just waiting to be devoured.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The browser-based website is pretty lightweight, allowing it to run seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. You can play games in real-time with players from across the world or set up a turn-based match that lets players take turns when it's convenient for them. While this significantly increases the time it takes to complete a game, it's a flexible option that's perfect for those with a busy schedule who can't dedicate the time it takes to sit down and play longer games.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">How it works</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Most games include a step-by-step guided tutorial, which is the perfect way to learn a new game that doesn't require combing through a massive rulebook. Many also have links to educational videos if you prefer to learn by watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best part about Board Game Arena is that the entire experience is automated. That means no more worrying about the rules or players potentially cheating. Each game features a simple interface that clearly indicates which moves you can make at any given moment. This also helps games move along at a brisk pace, as there's no setup, teardown, or fiddling with components.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can create digital tables and indicate the number of opponents they are looking for before starting a match. Generally, finding players is quick, with tables often filled in a matter of seconds. Some games even include expansion content, which you can decide to enable when setting up your table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each game features a built-in text chat option to interact with your friends or opponents. And, if you want to host a virtual game night and get the full experience, optional voice and video chat are also available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because many board games require a lot of time and commitment, Board Game Arena leverages a <a href="https://en.boardgamearena.com/news?id=304" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reputation system for all players</a>. Anyone who takes too long to make a move or leaves a game before it's finished receives a penalty. This allows you to quickly identify potential problem players and avoid matching with them to ensure a positive play experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For players looking to test their ability, Board Game Arena also offers ranked matches and tournaments for every game. This is a great way to face off against some of the best players in the world and improve your skill.</p><p id="subscription-tiers"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Subscription Tiers">How Much Does Board Game Arena Cost?</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena is available in two tiers: free and Premium. The free tier only requires that you create a free account in order to access the catalog of games. However, you'll quickly find that many of the most popular games have the "Premium" badge on them, which means you can't start a table unless you have a paid subscription. If you're patient, though, you can wait for another premium member to set up a table and join for free.</p><div catalogid="9b93e6b9-077f-4e03-9675-f0d3733462be" id="225356"><div id="225356" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Board Game Arena</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, to experience the best of Board Game Arena without any restrictions, you'll want to sign up for a Premium account. Like most <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-subscription-services">game subscription services</a>, you can pay monthly or yearly, with the latter being a bit cheaper in comparison. Board Game Arena's is priced at <strong>$5 per month</strong> or <strong>$42 per year</strong> (which works out to about $3.50 a month). For less than the price of a new board game you can experience more than 1,000—with more added every week.</p></div><p id="games-included"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Games Included">What Games Does Board Game Arena Include?</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/01/25/wingspan-board-game-review-1674676696680.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Board Game Arena features some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">most popular board games</a> available today, including: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building games</a> like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review">Wingspan</a>, Splendor, and Res Arcana; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family games</a> like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/azul-board-game-review">Azul</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/15/ticket-to-ride-review">Ticket to Ride</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harmonies-board-game-review">Harmonies</a>; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative games</a> like Pandemic, Sky Team, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fellowship-of-the-ring-trick-taking-game-review">The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick-Taking Game</a>, and many, many more. The best part—new games are added weekly, so there's always something to look forward to and play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more experienced players, there are plenty of longer, more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategic games</a> that typically need a well-versed group to play including Terraforming Mars, Ark Nova, and Terra Mystica. While these games can take hours in-person, the instant setup and automated turn structure helps them move much faster than their real-world counterparts, making this the ideal way to play many of these heavier games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although most games require two or more players to enjoy, Board Game Arena has a vast catalog of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo games</a> for players who prefer that format. Many modern games also include a solo variant, allowing you to play against an <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/2414/blogpost/109521/what-is-an-automa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automa</a> and learn the strategy without the pressure of additional players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you only have a few minutes to spare, Board Game Arena also features dozens of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">quick board games</a> that can be played on your phone to give you your fix. The beauty of its massive catalog is that you can choose the perfect game based on how much time you have available.</p><p id="available-platforms"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Available Platforms">Board Game Arena - Available Platforms</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Board Game Arena is browser-based, it's available on just about any modern device that can access an internet browser. While you <em>can</em> play games on mobile, I find that some games' visual aspects don't scale well for the smaller screen. Your best bet is to play on PC, Mac, or even a tablet as each of these can fit more visuals and information on the screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matthew Adler has written for IGN since 2019 covering all things gaming, tech, tabletop games, and more.
