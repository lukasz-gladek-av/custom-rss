To match the standards Ultizero Games have set for ourselves, we are going to take some additional time to polish the game. Lost Soul Aside will now release on August 29, 2025. We want to express our heartfelt thanks to our fans waiting for the launch."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally the passion project of solo developer Yang Bing, Lost Soul Aside has grown to become a major Sony-published title under the company's China Hero Project, with Bing now the founder and CEO of Shanghai-based studio Ultizero Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-and-pc-single-player-action-game-lost-soul-aside-the-big-interview">IGN recently had the opportunity to sit down with Yang Bing to discuss the long road to launch</a>. So many years of development went into Lost Soul Aside, escalating from a solo creator's vision to a trailer reveal at Sony's State of Play broadcast. Through it all the hype has built up, with some calling Lost Soul Aside an exciting mix of Final Fantasy characters and Devil May Cry combat — even from the moment Yang Bing's initial reveal video went viral in 2016.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main character Kesar wields a shape-shifting weapon you can swap between, which changes your playstyle, and you have a dragon-like companion named Arena who can summon abilities to support Kesar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its inspirations, Lost Soul Aside emphasizes aerial dodging, precision timing, combos, and countering along with large-scale boss fights. The game blends its sci-fi premise with a variety of contemporary aesthetics that fit into a campaign that takes you across multiple dimensions. Although it's tough to glean where the story is going based on its trailers, Bing describes Kesar's journey as one of "redemption and discovery."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Japanese gamers were reminded of these painful feelings on April 30, when actor Shinya Okada’s dramatic reaction to losing all his original Pokemon Red save data from 1996 was captured in a YouTube video. The actor’s stunned facial expressions and fans’ outpourings of sympathy even led the incident to be featured on <a href="https://www.crank-in.net/news/165828/1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese entertainment news outlets</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A familiar face in Japanese TV dramas, 77-year-old actor Shinya Owada is also a huge Pokemon fan, regularly playing through various games from the series on his YouTube Channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@shinyaohwada" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“Shinya Owada’s Hideout.”</u></a> Often accompanied by his trusty Squirtle plushie (that he <a href="https://x.com/oowadashinya/status/1887780979852673211" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>recently took on an adorable trip to the aquarium</u></a>), Owada’s warm-hearted enthusiasm for the games, plus his dramatic narration of the dialogue has earned the veteran gamer over 56.4K subscribers.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/30/japan-1746009732056.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Japanese actor Shinya Owada lost his Pokemon Red save data.

Owada’s startled reactions of “wait? what?” as he realizes that all the hours he has put into capturing and training Pokemon have vanished are palpable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Owada also <a href="https://x.com/oowadashinya/status/1917172028580434361" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to X </u></a>to share his feelings on the matter in a post that quickly amassed 4.4 million views and over 200 comments: “My Pokemon Red Game Boy cartridge save data has vanished. In my remaining lifetime, I will find another adventure to embark on.” Although he had previously streamed Pokemon Red, he announced that he plans to stop playing the game for now.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">【ご報告】<br>ゲームボーイソフト<br>ポケットモンスター 赤🟥の<br>冒険のセーブデータが<br>消えてしまいました^_^<br>人生の限られた時間の中で<br>また新しい旅を探します<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B1%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ポケモン</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ゲーム</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%81%AC%E3%81%84%E6%B4%BB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ぬい活</a> <a href="https://t.co/uofsbpsYDR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/uofsbpsYDR</a></p>— 大和田 伸也 (@oowadashinya) <a href="https://twitter.com/oowadashinya/status/1917172028580434361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Owada’s unfortunate data loss experience attracted many sympathetic comments, with people reminiscing about the sadness they felt when they lost valuable saves when they were children, often on cartridge-based systems like the Game Boy and N64, or PS1 and PS2 memory cards. As many commenters suggested, it seems likely that the battery in Okada’s Game Boy cartridge of Pokemon Red finally died, thus deleting his precious save data. Without the benefits of cloud-based storage back-ups, it was quite easy to lose all the data on your cartridge or memory card if the contacts wore out, you took it out of the console too quickly, or even looked at the console in the wrong way (this writer swears that this is how she lost her 90 hours of Final Fantasy IX gameplay back in 2001...).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Losing save data is also losing life,” stated one commenter on Owada’s YouTube video, drawing stark attention to the hours of effort and grinding that vanish into oblivion when you lose a save (something that all Simmers, Citybuilders, and RPG fans can attest to). Others were more philosophical: “even if save data disappears, the memories remain!” Comments also showed fans’ fondness for Owada, with one user adding: "If this happened to any other video game streamer, I would laugh at how ridiculous it is, but with Mr. Owada, it's a different story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If all this has strangely inspired you to go back to Game Boy-era Pokemon games, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-version/walkthrough"><u>IGN’s comprehensive walkthroughs</u></a> for Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit Shinya Owada / YouTube.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

Following the trend, Twilight Masquerade single cards are also crashing in price, so make sure to check if you can just buy the cards you're after for less.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Twilight Masquerade Single Cards</h2></p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Surging Sparks Single Cards</h2></p><p id="shining-fates-collection"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Shining Fates Collection">Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219657"><div id="219657" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">kachu gets a lot of oversized cardboard love in this box with a promo card, a giant version, and four Shining Fates booster packs. It is a decent pickup if you like opening packs, but single card prices are slipping hard right now. I think it makes more sense to hunt down the exact cards you want unless you are feeling reckless.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Shining Fates Single Cards</h2></p><p id="dark-brotherhood-medalion"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dark Brotherhood Medalion">The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered Dark Brotherhood Medallion</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219658"><div id="219658" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered Dark Brotherhood Medallion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, this is one of those collectibles that you either want immediately or not at all. It is an officially licensed Dark Brotherhood medallion, limited to 5000 pieces, finished in black and gold, and somehow still cheaper than most novelty keychains. Ships later this year, assuming you survive the wait</p></div><p id="paldean-fates-booster-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Paldean Fates Booster Bundle">Pokémon TCG Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219659"><div id="219659" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Paldean Fates brings back shiny Pokémon in a big way, and this bundle gives you six booster packs to chase them. I want to be excited about it, but again, single card prices for Paldean Fates are not holding up well. If you just want a shiny Charizard ex SIR without the suspense, the singles market is sitting there quietly judging your pack opening addiction.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Paldean Fates Single Cards</h2></p><p id="azure-legends-tin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Azure Legends Tin">Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219660"><div id="219660" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes 2 x Surging Sparks Booster Packs</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I like a good tin, especially one with five booster packs packed inside, but getting a random Kyogre, Xerneas, or Dialga promo card feels a little like gambling with slightly better odds. It is a solid pickup for the price if you do not mind leaving your promo fate to the RNG gods. If you are only after one specific chase card though outside of the included two Surging Sparks boosters, it might save your blood pressure to just buy it separately.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Surging Sparks Single Cards</h2></p><p id="lexar-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lexar Sale">Lexar Sale</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219661"><div id="219661" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lexar Sale</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Up to 54% off Micro SDXCs, Portable SSDs, M.2 SSDs, Sata III SSDs and RAM </p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Lexar is finally giving some breathing room on pricing with this Amazon sale, and the Armor 700 is a standout. You are getting 4TB of rugged storage with serious transfer speeds for about 100 dollars off the typical price. It is water resistant, dust resistant, and a lot more durable than whatever junk is sitting at the bottom of your backpack right now.</p></div><p id="pokmon-game-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Game Sale">Pokémon Game Sale</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219557"><div id="219557" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Click through for the full Woot gaming sale</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Woot is offering a solid spread of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/pokemon">Pokémon</a> games today, and I want at least three of them. Brilliant Diamond, Legends: Arceus, Let’s Go, Eevee!, and a few others are sitting between $39.99 and $44.99, which feels right for anyone catching up before Switch 2 changes the landscape again. In my opinion, it is a smart time to grab them while prices are behaving themselves. Everything here is fully playable now and will likely get performance bumps once Nintendo's next system arrives.</p></div><p id="msi-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MSI Sale">MSI Desktops &amp; Components Sale</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219558"><div id="219558" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MSI Desktops &amp; Components Sale</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Click through for the full Woot gaming sale</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">MSI’s factory-reconditioned gaming desktops are quietly one of the best parts of today's sale. Machines like the AEGIS R 13NUE-448US are going for $1,129.99, and RTX 4060 GPUs are under $300. I want to be responsible, but this pricing makes it harder than it should be. If you have been thinking about rebuilding your setup, this is exactly the kind of deal you hope not to miss.</p></div><p id="samsung-512gb-microsdxc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Samsung 512GB MicroSDXC">Samsung Pro Plus 512GB MicroSDXC + Reader</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219560"><div id="219560" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Samsung Pro Plus 512GB MicroSDXC + Reader</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/publisher/samsung">Samsung</a> PRO Plus 512GB microSD card with a USB reader for $29.99. I think it is a good fit if you are adding games to your Switch, Steam Deck, ROG Ally, or anything else still using microSD storage. It is fast enough for quick transfers, big enough for most libraries, and cheap enough that you do not have to think too hard about it. Just know it is not built for Switch 2, in case you're planning ahead.</p></div><p id="8bitdo-xbox-edition-keyboard"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="8BitDo Xbox Edition Keyboard">8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard (Xbox Edition)</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219562"><div id="219562" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard (Xbox Edition)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/8bitdo-retro-mechanical-keyboard-review">8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard</a> is down to $99.99 at Amazon. I think it is one of the best-looking keyboards out right now if you want something that works and does not scream “boring office equipment.” It has Kailh Jellyfish X switches, a top-mount design, fast response, and Xbox-inspired styling that actually looks good on a gaming desk. I probably do not need another keyboard. I am thinking about it anyway.</p></div><p id="8bitdo-mouse-xbox-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="8BitDo Mouse Xbox Edition"> 8BitDo Retro R8 Mouse (Xbox Edition)</h2></p><div catalogid="85730312-bd7b-47fe-8925-a7f92b6aba21" id="219563"><div id="219563" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> 8BitDo Retro R8 Mouse (Xbox Edition)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon also has the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/8bitdo-retro-mechanical-keyboard-review">8BitDo Retro R8 Wireless Mouse</a> on sale for $58.68. It feels like the natural companion to the Retro 87 Keyboard, but it also stands fine on its own. It packs a PAW 3395 sensor, programmable buttons, a 4K polling rate, and a charging dock that doubles as a signal booster. I want one for a low-key gaming setup that does not look like it is held together with RGB lighting and prayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
