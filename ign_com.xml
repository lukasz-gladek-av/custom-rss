The contents of these free updates will differ depending on the game.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, these upgrades are free, and are not the same as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/nintendo-switch-2/Nintendo_Switch_2_Edition_Games_List">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</a>, which are premium upgrades (or, in the case of The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, free upgrades to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what can Switch 2 owners expect? Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet, for example, get an “improved image quality” for high-resolution TVs and an “improved” framerate for “smoother movement.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Odyssey, on the other hand, gets HDR support and GameShare support, so two people can play together online, with one player controlling Mario and the other controlling Cappy. All the details are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Nintendo's list does not mention framerate fixes for the two top-down Zelda games, which is a strange and disappointing omission given their performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-san-francisco-interview-with-nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser">our interview with Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser</a> to find out more about the just-opened Nintendo San Francisco store, and all things Nintendo Switch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo San Francisco Store Photos</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Here’s the list of free updates for selected Nintendo Switch games:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clubhouse-games-51-worldwide-classics">51 Worldwide Games</a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Software update release date:</strong> 05/06/2025</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>GameShare support: up to four people can play 34 games.

The game was due out fall 2025 but is now delayed to spring 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bloomberg put it:</p><blockquote>PlayStation leadership didn’t give Haven staff a reason for her departure, but it came several weeks after an external test of Haven’s first game, the online shooter Fairgames, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Some developers at Haven were concerned about how the game was received and its progress, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is sticking with Haven and Fairgames for now, with new co-studio heads Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski in place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s yet more trouble for Sony’s embattled live service ambition, which now appears to be in full retreat. While Arrowhead’s Helldivers 2 was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony’s other live service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Sony’s Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid eye-wateringly low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us multiplayer game. And earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony announced plans in February 2022 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-by-2026">launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026</a>, later saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-10-live-service-games-will-be-from-different-genres-and-for-different-audiences">the push would bring games of different genres to different audiences</a>. It spent big on studio buyouts as part of the drive, bringing in Destiny developer Bungie, Jade Raymond's Haven Studios, and the now shuttered Firewalk Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in 2023, Sony president Hiroki Totoki said the company was reviewing the 12 live service PlayStation games it had in the works, and committed to launching only six of them by the end of financial year 2025, meaning by the end of March 2026. Totoki said Sony was still working on when the other six live service games would come out, adding: "It's not that we stick to certain titles, but for the gamers quality should be the most important.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie is still flying the live service flag, with Destiny 2 ongoing and the in-development Marathon set to launch fully later this year. Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-teamlfg-a-new-playstation-studio-spun-out-of-bungie-thats-making-a-team-based-action-game-inspired-by-fighting-games-mobas-and-frog-type-games">Sony announced a new PlayStation studio called teamLFG and teased its debut game</a>, which is a live service incubation project. Guerrilla’s Horizon multiplayer game is also in development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

And, you know, that scoundrel fantasy of Kay mixing with the pirate fantasy of Hondo, it just kind of makes sense, right?" Rechner told IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And we also knew that Kay would be kind of coming into her own, learning what it means to be a leader, and then having someone like Hondo as a mentor - or is he? - we thought it led to really interesting things."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The DLC adds a new adventure to the main game featuring the Rokana Raiders crime gang, the Miyuki Trade League who can supply Kay with upgrades for her Trailblazer ship, and a new blaster capability called Shock. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Outlaws is also getting a Nintendo Switch 2 release on September 4, but Rechner refused to spill details on whether the new platform would bring any new features to the game, but did say that there was more information to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In terms of a specific feature set, that's something that we will get into later. So we'll have more stuff to talk about later."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the Switch 2's features that the game could take advantage of are controllers that can be used as a mouse and a new GameChat capability. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar. She loves horror, horror movies, horror games, and French Bulldogs. Those extra wrinkles on her face are thanks to going time blind and staying up too late finishing every sidequest in RPGs like Fallout and Witcher 3.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In fact, he said Nintendo's support of third-party publishers this time around was better than it has been in the past:</p><blockquote>"We're launching four titles with Nintendo Switch 2, and that's I think a bigger array of releases than we've ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform. Historically, being a third party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo has been very forthcoming in addressing that. And we're stepping up too, because we have great optimism for the platform. In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis, we obviously want to be where the consumers are. But we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalog opportunities as well."</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Take-Two is bringing Civilization 7 (June 5, launch day), the NBA 2K and WWE 2K series (unclear which games, or when), and Borderlands 4 (September 12). Those admittedly aren't surprising inclusions, as Take-Two was already publishing all four franchises on the Nintendo Switch. But Zelnick's quote does make it sound like the door could be open in the future to other releases, especially from Take-Two's back catalog. GTA 6 probably won't make the cut, but perhaps GTA V, one of these days?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke directly to Zelnick ahead of the investor call about the company's quarter, including discussion of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-development-began-in-earnest-in-2020-following-the-massive-success-of-red-dead-redemption-2-take-two-says">GTA 6's development timeline,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations">Zelnick's thoughts</a> on the game's recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">delay to next year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-labyrinths-weird-metroidvania-take-on-pac-manactually-works</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadow-labyrinth%E2%80%99s-weird-metroidvania-take-on-pac-man%E2%80%A6actually-works.1190724/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-labyrinths-weird-metroidvania-take-on-pac-manactually-works<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As an ancient gamer (now 32), I’ve had plenty of experience playing Pac-Man. During my pre-teen years, many of my summer days were spent losing quarters to my local arcade, attempting to reach the mythical "split-screen level." As a devoted fan of the franchise, I admittedly had reservations going into my PAX East preview of Bandai Namco’s new, unconventional take on the series, Shadow Labyrinth. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On paper, Shadow Labyrinth should not work. Pac-Man as a dark sci-fi metroidvania where he turns into a giant mech and shoots lasers out of his mouth sounds like bad gaming Wattpad fiction. Yet, that is exactly what it is…and Puck, Man, it was glorious. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shadow Labyrinth Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story takes place shortly after the events of the Prime Video animated short, Secret Level, as the protagonist, the dark and brooding Swordsman No. 8, wakes up surrounded by monsters and aliens. He soon meets a mysterious figure known as Puck, a yellow circular creature who looks like he enjoys eating pellets, fruit, and blue ghosts. After a brief introduction, the duo vows to work together by combining their unique abilities of strength and mobility in the hopes that they can navigate the treacherous world and survive the darkness that awaits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That darkness comes in many shapes and sizes, as the setting features a handful of different biomes, each with distinct personalities, backdrops, and characteristics. No two mazes in this 2D adventure will have the same layout, and enemy designs and types will change depending on the region that is being explored. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My preview started by placing me in an underground tech biome filled with various melee, flying, and ranged enemy types that could only exist underground, like bat-creatures and angry hedgehogs. Gameplay was straightforward and intuitive enough initially. Combat and dodging reminded me a lot of the original Castlevania titles, and its platforming elements are akin to a love child of Ori and the Blind Forest and Celeste, thanks to Puck’s ability to grapple onto spots, adding extra layers of maneuverability. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story takes place shortly after the events of the Prime Video animated short, Secret Wars.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Combining the grapple with aerial attacks makes for interesting gameplay against enemies, especially when challenge rooms come into play. Like many other Metroidvanias, Shadow Labyrinth has rooms that will seal off once entered, requiring the Swordsman to defeat each combatant inside to unlock the room. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enemies spawn in from all over the room, attempting to overwhelm with quantity and variety, making for a bullet-sponge-like environment. I frantically grappled to avoid ground foe charges while dodging flying enemies simultaneously, failing to do so multiple times, and needing to respawn. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After getting the hang of their patterns and placements, I grappled up and used melee attacks to chain movements in the air, then slammed my sword down from above on the enemies below, making for an immensely satisfying victory. While I only experienced two challenge rooms in this particular build, I was impressed with how difficult but rewarding each room was. But despite how much I enjoyed this, the true beauty of Shadow Labyrinth’s platforming and combat comes to light when Puck becomes the controllable character. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The platforming element of controlling Puck is both clever and nostalgic, as the Swordsman will morph into him and ride waves of electricity to help them move around areas otherwise blocked by environmental hazards or inaccessible heights. While riding the wave, you’ll move identically to the old Pac-Man games, but with an added twist. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Puck is still limited to moving left, right, up, or down on the violet electricity line, but he is no longer limited to a lined grid and can also stop, aim, and jump. While this might sound simple, it adds a new layer to movement and combat. Some challenge rooms even feature these lines, which can be used to execute sword attacks, creating an entirely new approach to beating each room’s combat puzzle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite instance of this occurred halfway through the preview during the Kaiju boss battle (yes, you read that right). The fight is similar to a challenge room in the sense that it blocks off any retreat, but this time it is a one-on-one fight, as the boss is much bigger than Swordsman No. 8. To combat the size difference, Swordsman No. 8 can use Puck’s ability to ride up the wall to not only get a height advantage and deal extra damage to the enemy’s horn weak spot, but also avoid massive laser attacks that would otherwise kill them both. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it turns out, the boss isn’t the only one wielding a laser, which leads to my other favorite, absurd moment in this preview: Puck can turn into a giant mecha named Gaia. Yes, this is a Metroidvania Pac-Man game where you can control a Gundam and fight Kaiju. Again, this should not work, but it does so marvelously, resulting in an epic crescendo to a fever dream of a boss battle and transformation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even after the boss battle ended, there was still plenty to explore in Shadow Labyrinth. The first thing I unlocked afterward was a pared-down version of Gaia’s laser ability, which the Swordsman can use by holding down the charge button. Not only is this move great for dispelling large groups of foes blocking an area, but it can also be thrown into attacks in locations like the challenge rooms to make for some delightful combo kills. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Shadow Labyrinth Game Awards Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the new power move, I also unlocked a new location featuring another strangely familiar-looking set of enemies that would begin to float through the level toward me until they touched the ground. At first, I was confused about how to beat them, as hitting them with a sword wasn’t working. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t until I started listening to the music and sound effects and remembering why the enemies’ movements looked so familiar that a lightbulb went off: these are the Pooka from Dig Dug. Just like the 1982 classic arcade title, the only way to destroy Pooka is to stun and inflate it when they are materialized.

The game features something for everyone here, as the platforming, combat, and puzzles each stand out on their own as enjoyable experiences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I implore you to suspend your disbelief about how this bizarre concept can even work, and at least give Shadow Labyrinth a try when it is released, as this insane creative bet by Bandai looks like it might actually pay off.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
