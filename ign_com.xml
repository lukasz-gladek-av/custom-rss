            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When the Switch 2 preorders were first going up (and selling out), I wrote about how it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-is-still-worth-buying-even-with-the-switch-2-release">still worth buying a Switch 1</a>. I wasn't planning on picking up the new Nintendo console off the bat, but the incredible reviews of Donkey Kong Bananza convinced me to cave and buy one much earlier than I'd expected. IGN gave the game a rare <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">10 out of 10 review</a> and people are already talking about how it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-game-of-the-year-2025-donkey-kong-bananza-clair-obscur-expedition-33-death-stranding-2">giving GOTY vibes</a> barely a week after release. As a lifelong Nintendo fan, the potential of missing out on a Donkey Kong masterpiece for a full year was just enough to push me over the edge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was first introduced to Donkey Kong in the Super Nintendo days. Donkey Kong Country was challenging and fun, and my brother and I spent countless hours playing it. Then came <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, which if I remember correctly, actually required an Expansion Pak to function. It was the first 3D game I'd played that truly felt new and sits comfortably as one of my favorite games from my childhood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These feelings of nostalgia are definitely what drove me to move up my Switch 2 purchase timeline, but who am I to deny myself a little bit of magic every once and a while? I was pretty worried I wouldn't be able to find a console available anywhere since stock has been pretty spotty since release, but I actually managed to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXj1N?object_uuid=f2b0d653-92d0-4ec1-ada6-bbd81ff7a580&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">secure a Mario Kart Switch 2 bundle at Target</a> today.

After that, we learned that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-finally-confirmed-by-nintendo-sparking-questions-over-when-switch-2s-3d-mario-will-arrive">team behind Mario Odyssey</a> were the ones who worked on the game. Then, IGN's review really sealed the deal for me when I got an in-depth look at the game from someone I know and trust for anything Nintendo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like everyone else, I loved Mario Odyssey when I played it on the Switch. It was flat out <em>fun</em>, and exploring those new 3D worlds and taking on those challenges really hit the spot. Getting that same feeling from a Donkey Kong game would scratch a decades-old itch I didn't even know I still had. The freedom to smash, climb, and barrel through a world as Donkey Kong is something I'm really looking forward to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regrettably, my Switch 2 isn't set to arrive until three days after my copy of Bananza. I guess I'll just have to stare at it in anticipation for days until my console finally shows up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jacob Kienlen is a Senior SEO Strategist and Writer for IGN.

There's a new Combat Patrol (an army starter pack or a set to bulk out an existing force) for The Leagues of Votann, and check out Buri Aegnirssen, a specialist Tyranid hunter, below. Yes, that's a Tyranid Prime on top of his head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Supporting the release is a new Leagues of Votann Codex, packed with lore and new rules.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer: The Old World</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up was a reveal for Warhammer: The Old World.

Also coming to the Flesh-Eater army is the Charnel Watch. And there's the Death Battletome for the Nighthaunt, packed with lore and "some significant defensive buffs." Check out the wonderfully-named Lord Vitriolic, below:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-193107-1752863496722.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Helsmiths of Hashut</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's a big one: the Chaos Dwarfs faction returns for Age of Sigmar as the Helsmiths of Hashut. This new faction includes the Infernal Cohort with Hashutite Spears, the War Despot, the Dominator Engine, and the Tormentor Bombard war machine. As you'd expect, the set includes a new Battletome.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer: Underworlds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop then revealed the Spitewood Expansion set for Warhammer: Underworlds. Designed as an expansion to the Embergard boxed set, Spitewood contains two brand new warbands, two new Rivals decks, a new double-sided board, and a token board that includes new feature tokens representing deposits of Aqua Ghyranis.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-195458-1752864905965.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Legions Imperialis</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaving Age of Sigmar behind, Games Workshop revealed new tanks for the Horus Heresy game, Legions Imperialis, including the Typhon Heavy Siege Tank Squadron, the Cerberus Heavy Tank Destroyer, and the Mastadon Assault Transport, the latter of which was described as the "30,000 equivalent of a siege tower."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-200120-1752865299831.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Also coming to the 30,000 setting is the MKII Assault Squad and the Journal Tactica: The Forges of Saturn.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-200506-1752865516174.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Black Library</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Scouring is confirmed! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/big-summer-warhammer-preview-adds-black-library-logo-and-now-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-are-hoping-games-workshop-is-finally-ready-to-move-the-narrative-forward">As fans had speculated</a>, The Scouring period of Warhammer 40,000's long history is getting its own novel series, kicking off with Ashes of the Imperium by Chris Wraight. This multi-book, multi-author series is set to reveal what happens to the Imperium and the Traitor Legions after the end of The Horus Heresy. Ashes of the Imperium will be released later in the year.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-200852-1752865809523.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">40K is getting five new Space Marine characters: Vulkan He’stan (Salamanders); Darnath Lysander (Imperial Fists); Aethon Shaan (Raven Guard); Caanok Var (Iron Hands); and Suboden Khan (White Scars).
