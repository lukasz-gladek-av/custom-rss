Until next Friday, July 25, you can grab every Borderlands game, as well as Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, for just $16. If you're unfamiliar with how Humble Bundle works, the more you pay, the more you get. So while $16 gets you all eight games, you can choose to pay less to get only some of the games on the list. Conversely, if you pay more than $16, not only do you get all of the games, but you also contribute to charity and video game publishers.</p><p id="borderlands-x-wonderlands-collection"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Borderlands x Wonderlands Collection">Borderlands x Wonderlands Collection at Humble Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="7da98a53-91b8-4423-94f8-77aa2bf9f45d" id="225456"><div id="225456" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands x Wonderlands Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle (a $279 value) includes all of the mainline Borderlands games, the VR version of Borderlands 2, the Telltale games, and more.

Since this deal is specific to PC gamers, It's also worth noting that every game on this list is playable on the Steam Deck except for Borderlands 2 VR. As of right now, we haven't gotten any confirmation that Borderlands 4 will be Steam Deck verified or even playable on the handheld, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 has been generating a lot of buzz in 2025, but did you forget that a Borderlands movie actually came out last year? Well, good thing I'm here to remind you that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-kevin-hart-jack-black">IGN's Matt Donato reviewed the big screen adaptation</a>, giving it a three overall saying "Borderlands is a catastrophic disappointment that plays like hacked-to-pieces studio slop, betraying everything fans adore about Gearbox Softwareâ€™s franchise in derivative, regrettable fashion." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's to hoping the next game brings the franchise back to it's full potential when it releases in September later this year.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4 Is Available for Preorder Now</h3></div><div catalogid="28a64a86-ee8f-4f65-82e1-797e39965a10" id="223086"><div id="223086" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you're caught up on the entire Borderlands saga, you can preorder <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> before it drops September 12 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. It promises the same high-octane looting and shooting the core games are known for with some new twists and turns along the way.
