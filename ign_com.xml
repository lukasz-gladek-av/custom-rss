            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/patapon-12-replay-brings-classic-playstation-games-to-pc-and-nintendo-switch-this-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cult-classic rhythm strategy bundle <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/patapon-1-2-replay">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a> is bringing two beloved PSP games to PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5 (PS5) July 11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two-pack remaster was revealed during today’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OqoRxXUjGA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 2025 Nintendo Direct</a> alongside gameplay and its summer launch plan. It’s a move that finally allows two hidden-gem PlayStation games from the mid-2000s to stomp onto non-PlayStation platforms for the first time while updating them for PS5 players, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Having lived in the desolate frontier for years, the Patapon tribe was driven from their home by the Zigoton army,” an official description from new publisher Bandai Namco said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This drove them to become fierce warrior spirits that can only be commanded by the beat of the war drum, played by the Mighty One (the player). Their wait has finally come to an end as the drums of war are heard once again by the Almighty’s return to guide the Patapon tribe through their adventures to fight against challenging enemies and return them to their homeland.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Patapon 1+2 Replay seems to come with a few upgrades not seen in the 2017 PS4 remasters. Bandai Namco specifically lists upgraded graphics as one of the more noticeable additions, though returning Almighty will also notice added Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulty modes, as well as timing adjustment and constant command display options. While Patapon 1+2 Replay aims to bring the classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/patapon">2007</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/patapon-2">2008</a> titles to players better than ever, there’s no sign of the PSP’s 2011 title, Patapon 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patapon may not be one of PlayStation’s more recognizable franchises, but it’s still a name that has been associated with the brand for nearly 20 years. It’s unclear why or how it’s leaping other platforms now or if the series will continue to blossom with any new entries in the future. There’s also been no mention of a potential Xbox version, so it’s best to expect Patapon 1+2 Replay on PC, Switch, and PS5 to be where things end for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on today’s news, you can catch up with everything else revealed during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

While called Everybody's Golf in many regions, the series was Hot Shots Golf in North America for a while, until 2017's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/everybodys-golf">Everybody's Golf</a> reunited the franchise name. This latest entry, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots, looks to mark as much by combining the two names into one unified, new entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's an interesting twist in the details, though. Digimon Survive studio HYDE is making this, under the Bandai Namco umbrella, in a partnership with Sony Interactive Entertainment. Traditionally, this has been a Sony-published series, and developer Clap Hanz was working on the series. Clap Haz released its own self-titled game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-20-years-making-playstation-golf-games-clap-hanz-wants-a-new-challenge">Clap Hanz Golf</a>, back in 2021.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, it looks like you can expect the usual blend of classic golf and some of the wackier options. Characters have their expressive celebrations, and several game modes offer strange, surprising mix-ups to your usual round of golf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will also be local couch co-op and online multiplayer, which is good news for those who, like me, grew up passing a controller around playing Hot Shots Golf. The announcement debuted during today's Nintendo Switch Direct, and I could see Everybody's Golf Hot Shots working pretty well as a couch co-op Switch game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No date's been set yet, but Everybody's Golf Hot Shots will be heading to PS5, Switch, and PC sometime this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">head over to our recap of today's Nintendo Direct for March 2025</a> if you're looking for other announcements. Alongside some new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-reveals-samus-new-psychic-abilities-on-the-planet-viewros">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> footage and several remasters and sequels, we also got to see a new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-card-update-ahead-of-switch-2-launch">Virtual Game Card feature</a> that's coming to Nintendo's handheld ahead of the Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
