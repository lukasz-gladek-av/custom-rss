            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/one-piece-luffys-bento-panic-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With over 1100 chapters, nearly as many episodes of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-piece-series-movies-in-order">anime, movies and OVAs</a>, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-piece-netflix-review">live-action Netflix series</a>, a card game, and much much more, One Piece has become its own media empire. The tales of the Straw Hat Pirates are beloved all over the world, and now One Piece: Luffy’s Bento Panic, a new board game from Kess Entertainment, brings the crew to your tabletop! This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party game</a> is fun for even those that haven’t hopped on the pirate ship themselves.</p><div catalogid="6332a546-d9b7-4a5a-ad95-a0d24c88b981" id="214114"><div id="214114" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>One Piece: Luffy’s Bento Panic</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Designed by Anthony Thorp, three to nine players take on the roles of crew of the Straw Hats, returning after a successful adventure. In typical fashion, Luffy and his crew decide to celebrate the only way they know how – with a giant feast full of the crew's favorite delicacies. What follows is a mad rush as each person tries to eat as much as they can before Luffy devours everything and the party's over. The goal of Bento Panic is to amass the most points (finished piles of food) by the time the bag of food is empty or Luffy wakes up the third time. This is a fast game where a full session, even at larger player counts, won't take you very long, making it perfect for parties.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each turn is fairly straightforward, with each player being able to take one of five possible actions: grab food from the bag, eat piles of food that are in front of them, try to steal your neighbor's food, block someone trying to steal yours, or use your character's special ability. Each action is associated with a simple one-handed gesture that each player performs two at a time. Stealing, for example requires you to point at one or both of the players to your left or right while grabbing food tokens from the bag requires you to simply reach out towards the bag. It makes for a silly time, and it's the fact that everyone performs the actions together that makes the game so quick to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I first saw the player count of Bento Panic could go up to nine people, my immediate concern was that this game would quickly spiral into chaos. Few games manage player counts so high, but luckily I never found this to be the case here, because you really only need to worry about the people on your immediate left and right. It's only your neighbors that you have to worry about attempting to steal from you, so regardless if you are playing with only three of you or the full roster of nine, your risk of being stolen from never increases beyond those two people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the ways the game can end is when Luffy wakes up for the third time. In the grab bag that contains all of the food tokens (a nice fabric drawstring bag adorned with the iconic Straw Hat pirate logo no less) are special "juicy meat" ones that move Luffy down his sleep track. Once that track hits zero, Luffy wakes up and will steal all the food that hasn't been eaten yet from whomever has the biggest pile of meat in front of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of One Piece know just how "on-brand" it is that Luffy would lose control when meat is involved. This mechanic also provides the game with a good "push your luck" feeling, where you have to risk waking up Luffy and losing your piles of uneaten food, or do you play it safe and try to eat a smaller pile or two first, and have others take the risk? </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a fast game where a full session, even at larger player counts, won't take you very long.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect to take into account when making your choice of actions are the special abilities that your other opponents have at their disposal. Each Straw Hat has an ability that can be activated by striking a dramatic pose as your action, with abilities like Jinbe’s “Fishman Karate” that cancels out any steal actions being taken against you while letting you then take a food pile from any pirate that attempted to steal your food. Once these are used, they can’t be used again until you've been stolen from, which means sometimes you <em>want</em> someone to steal from you. Using these skills is completely optional, and the game is fun with or without them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bento Panic can still offer up a good time for folks who may not be into One Piece and can't tell one Straw Hat from the other. At its heart, this is a set collection game mixed with reading other players' intentions. It's fun, but it doesn't offer much depth. However, it also never overstays its welcome, which makes it great as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party board game</a>, or as a palate cleanser between other complex games. Bento Panic gets better with more people playing it – in my play sessions, even at the max player count of nine, everyone was still having fun, which a lot of other games can't say.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAbO5j?object_uuid=89bf2c1e-15d7-43c1-9bc2-34cb8452cd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXNZw?object_uuid=89bf2c1e-15d7-43c1-9bc2-34cb8452cd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Barnes &amp; Noble</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX26ZB?object_uuid=89bf2c1e-15d7-43c1-9bc2-34cb8452cd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Target</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5Xdb?object_uuid=89bf2c1e-15d7-43c1-9bc2-34cb8452cd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 14, 2025 4:03 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Luffy's Bento Panic is a fast-paced game that would find itself home at any party, or especially, any anime convention. I don't count myself a big fan of One Piece, but I still had a good time playing it with friends. This is a light-weight game I would happily bring out during a party, but not necessarily one I would play on game night with my board game crew. Still, I think there is value in having a solid collection of those party-only games in a collection and One Piece: Luffy's Bento Panic is an easy recommendation for that list. Just be sure you and your friends aren’t hungry when you play, because if you aren’t when you start, you probably will be by the time you finish.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-could-be-playstations-big-movie-win-if-it-stays-faithful-to-the-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Uncharted’s 2022 cinematic outing and The Last of Us’ hit HBO show, it was only a matter of time until <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-film-confirmed">Sony announced that Horizon was coming to the silver screen</a>. PlayStation Studios and Columbia Pictures recently formally confirmed that a movie adaptation of Horizon Zero Dawn is in the works, which will bring to life both Aloy’s origin story and the video game’s vibrant, machine-filled world. And while development of the movie is only in the early stages, I’m already pretty confident that it could be Sony’s first major video game win at the box office… if it stays true to the games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last few years have seen several video game success stories grace both the small and big screens. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review">The Super Mario Brothers</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-review-3">Sonic films</a>, both skewed for family audiences, are the gold standard in terms of both critical reception and box office numbers. On TV, Sony’s own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-1-review">The Last of Us show</a> sits alongside the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arcane-season-1-review-league-of-legends">Netflix’s Arcane</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-1-review-amazon-prime-video">Amazon Prime’s Fallout</a> as fan favourites. And even adaptations that have had more middling reviews from fans and critics have been able to come out on top at the box office; the Tom Holland-led <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-movie-review">Uncharted movie</a> grossed more than $400 million. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while it’s true that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-video-game-adaptation-curse-is-a-myth">the days of the “video game curse” are mostly long gone</a>, there are still issues that persist in this field. Uncharted may have found its audience, but it is not the faithful adaptation of the original games fans were hoping for. More recently, we have seen poor critical and box office performance for the likes of last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-kevin-hart-jack-black">Borderlands film</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video">Amazon’s Like a Dragon: Yakuza series</a>. Both seemed completely uninterested in staying faithful to the storylines, lore, or even simply the tone of the games they were built upon. They simply did not accurately depict the world of the games that fans fell in love with. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/14/horizon-zero-dawn-bird-bow-1736866650308.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Horizon's unique robotic ecosystems would be incredible to witness on the big screen.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While such failures can occur in video game adaptations, they are part of a wider issue with adaptations in general. Netflix's The Witcher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-producer-says-some-witcher-book-changes-are-necessary-but-painful-for-us-too">has taken considerable liberties with its source material</a>, significantly changing the original books’ events and characters, plus shifting the overall tone. While adaptations often need to make changes to fit their new medium, these examples feel like they have become different things entirely. And for fans of the original texts – the pre-baked audience that should be the first in line to watch a new adaptation – this can be not just incredibly disappointing, but also signal the project’s eventual downfall.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings us back to Horizon. The recently announced movie isn’t actually the first attempt at bringing Horizon to screens. Back in 2022 Netflix announced it was developing a series based on the game, and <a href="https://gamerant.com/horizon-zero-dawn-netflix-show-title-setting/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumours began to circulate about a “Horizon 2074” project</a> that was to be set during the pre-apocalypse period, perhaps trying to fill in some of the backstory the games touch upon and skirt around. This direction, while ultimately never confirmed by Netflix, certainly proved polarising for the game's fanbase, who are clamouring for a story that is faithful to the one that made the original game such a resounding success. Plus, of course, they want to see huge robot animals, which a pre-apocalypse setting would naturally not feature.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, such fans need not worry: whatever the plans were for that show, the project is no longer in development at Netflix and Horizon is now being reworked into a cinema release. Given the heavy CGI effects that any Horizon adaptation would need to realise its iconic visuals, this is a smart move, as the increased budget of a Hollywood movie is one of the keys to realising the story and world’s potential and make them shine on the big screen.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If Horizon is given the same kind of treatment afforded to The Last of Us on the small screen, there is no reason it can’t be PlayStation’s first big cinema win. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s much more to Horizon than its incredible robotic creatures. Consider the success of Fallout, Arcane and The Last of Us in the past few years. These adaptations were praised for being worthy extensions of their source material and for their faithfulness to not just the visuals, but also the tone and stories of their original game franchises. Gamers care about adaptations having an authentic story. The Last of Us did, of course, craft new storylines that deviated from its source material, but most of the show stayed true to the narrative structure of the games. The result was a show that sailed on the proven strength of the game, which resonated with both fans and newcomers. And so if Horizon is given the same kind of treatment afforded to The Last of Us, Arcane and Fallout on the small screen, there is no reason it can’t be PlayStation’s first big cinema win. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remaining faithful to the original game isn’t something to do just for the sake of fan expectation, though. Horizon Zero Dawn received the Best Narrative award at the The Game Awards in 2017, as well as the Outstanding Achievement in Story award at the 2018 DICE awards, which shows how highly regarded the game’s story is. It is a tale worth staying faithful to. Set in 31st century North America, it follows Aloy, a member of the Nora Tribe, as she explores the mystery surrounding her origins and how they link to an old-world scientist, Elisabet Sobeck, who is Aloy’s perfect doppelganger. These characters and the world they exist in are captivating: Aloy in particular is a brilliant anchor, and her allies Erend and Varl are easy to root for thanks to relationships that are massively fleshed out across Horizon Zero Dawn and its sequel, Forbidden West. Further depth is added through the examination of how attempts were made to save Earth’s climate, with a rogue AI expanding to create the creatures that now populate so much of the Earth. Complimenting this is the mysterious Sylens, a constant presence and an enigma we want to get to the root of. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/14/horizon-zero-dawn-town-1736866719609.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The unique cultures of Horizon's world could prove as compelling as Avatar's Na'vi tribes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The intricacy of each community and settlement Aloy uncovers along her journey makes for an expansive, immersive world that feels completely unique. This worldbuilding is fuel for a compelling film franchise. Much like how James Cameron’s Avatar series has explored the culture and traditions of Na’vi tribes, a Horizon film could dig into the ways tribes like the Nora protect themselves from Earth’s robotic hunters. The unique combat encounters are a highlight of both Horizon games, and with the likes of the saber tooth tiger-like Sawtooths, the towering Tallnecks, and sky-bound Stormbirds, there’s the potential to litter the landscapes with impressive visuals. Alongside rival tribes and those loyal to the rogue AI Hades, these creatures ensure the games are full of action and suspense. Those same elements would provide interesting challenges for Aloy and her allies in a movie adaptation, too. All combined, Horizon is a rich source of creative and visually-rich storytelling that needs very few changes to suit the current cinematic landscape.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horizon’s story is compelling from the offset, and if followed faithfully, I believe its film adaptation could be, too. What makes Horizon stand out from other would-be franchises is the diligence in its story, crafting a world that is unique, timely, and fresh with an aesthetic that feels distinctly cinematic. There are so many nuances to the world and the storytelling that it is easy to imagine a Horizon adaptation being a resounding success both critically and at the box office. And with the more expansive story of Forbidden West, there is a huge canvas for the franchise as a whole to work with – if adapted carefully, this could be a long-term proposition for Sony. There is a huge opportunity to make a film franchise that can match the success of its source material, which has proven to be tremendous success across the last two generations of PlayStation consoles, captivating gamers worldwide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the film can take the ingredients that have made the game such a success and keep them intact, then the basics are in place for a compelling adaptation. And with more Sony titles set to become film and TV franchises, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-from-john-wick-director-in-development">Ghost of Tsushima</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-helldivers-2-film-in-production">Helldivers 2</a>, such an approach would set PlayStation up for success in an entirely new medium. But forgetting what made Horizon great in the first place – or, even worse, purposefully diverging away from it – could put Sony not only in the firing line of negative fan feedback, but also the same kind of financial difficulties suffered by Borderlands. Bad adaptations have been overwhelmingly rejected by fans, and as a result often audiences as a whole. Let’s hope that Sony (plus the writers and directors it chooses) recognise what they have on their hands and do right by Horizon.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Connor is a coffee and whisky driven culture wordsmith, with work published at NME, Radio Times, Yahoo, and others.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's certainly unusual for a studio head to announce it's happening to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The most demanding period of game development — both physically and mentally — commonly known as 'crunch time,'" Kojima said. "On top of mixing and Japanese voice recording, there’s an inevitable pile of other tasks: writing comments, explanations, essays, interviews, discussions, and non-game-related work. It’s incredibly tough."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Kojima failed to mention Death Stranding 2 specifically, and Kojima Productions does have a number of games in development, it's the most likely candidate for being in the crunch phase as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-2-tgs">it's due out in 2025</a> and crunch usually arrives towards the end of development. The studio's other two projects, the mysterious OD and Physint, both appear to be much earlier in development and lack release windows.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The most demanding period of game development—both physically and mentally—commonly known as “crunch time.” On top of mixing and Japanese voice recording, there’s an inevitable pile of other tasks: writing comments, explanations, essays, interviews, discussions, and… <a href="https://t.co/FrXRgaS748" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/FrXRgaS748</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1877861699409391835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn't appear to be this crunch period in particular that's prompted Kojima to think about his eventual retirement, despite his comments that it's "incredibly tough." Instead, his purchase of a Ridley Scott biography appears to have spurred a reflection on his own career.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At this age, I can't help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative,'" <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1878722221058986139" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 61-year-old Kojima said</a>.

Microsoft declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Mp1st, Virtuos has remade Bethesda’s much-loved open world role-playing game using Unreal Engine 5, which suggests a significant rework rather than a more straightforward remaster. Gameplay changes were also allegedly detailed, including tweaks to Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and the heads-up display (HUD).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by Mp1st, Blocking was changed with action games and Soulslikes in mind because the original system was too “boring” and “frustrating.” Sneak icons are now allegedly highlighted, with damage calculation revamped. The knockdown that comes from Stamina being depleted is reportedly harder to trigger. And the HUD was redesigned to make it easier to understand. Elsewhere, hit reactions were added to make response clearer, and Archery was reportedly modernized in both first and third-person perspectives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">Word of an Oblivion remaster emerged in 2023</a> when documents published as part of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) versus Microsoft trial over the buyout of Activision Blizzard revealed a number of unannounced Bethesda games set for release in the years ahead. The list, put together in July 2020 ahead of Microsoft’s March 2021 purchase of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media, included the following:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial year 2022:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Oblivion Remaster</li><li>Indiana Jones game</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial year 2023</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Doom Year Zero and DLC</li><li>Project Kestrel</li><li>Project Platinum</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial year 2024</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Elder Scrolls 6</li><li>Project Kestrel: Expansion</li><li>Licensed IP Game</li><li>Fallout 3 Remaster</li><li>Ghostwire: Tokyo Sequel</li><li>Dishonored 3</li><li>DOOM Year Zero DLC</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously a number of these games were either delayed or outright canceled. Doom Year Zero is now Doom: The Dark Ages and set for launch this year. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle didn’t launch until December 2024. And The Elder Scrolls 6 got nowhere near financial year 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That Oblivion remaster is what we’re concerned about now, though. And it’s worth noting it was called a <em>remaster</em> in the Microsoft document. Perhaps the scope of the project changed and Bethesda went big on a remake. We'll find out when the company finally unveils what has become one of the worst-kept secrets in all video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, which platforms will the Oblivion remake launch on? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-finally-looks-set-to-make-the-jump-to-playstation-this-year">Microsoft is all-in on multiplatform releases now</a>, and with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-games-reportedly-set-for-release-on-nintendo-switch-2">the Nintendo Switch 2 waiting in the wings</a>, Oblivion may open its gates to more than just PC, Xbox, and PlayStation players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaker NateTheHate, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-release-date-reportedly-leaked-online-alongside-release-window">who this week reported on the alleged release date of Nintendo’s Switch 2 reveal</a>, has said <a href="https://youtu.be/AIhoTirZxlk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Oblivion remake is set to launch this June</a>.
