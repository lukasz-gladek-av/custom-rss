Here’s a breakdown of everything included. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Animal Crocs-ing Collection Is Now Available</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The collection is headlined by one style of platform Crocs you can pick up in sizes for adults (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgMZ8?object_uuid=3e850469-f501-4468-b181-5bfa513812d4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">starting at $89.99</a>) or kids (<a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRYyb?object_uuid=3e850469-f501-4468-b181-5bfa513812d4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">starting at $54.99</a>). The adult version lists women's sizes, but in my opinion is just as unisex. Most importantly, with a spread of colors, the Crocs manage to capture a pretty robust picture of the island featured in New Horizons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The top of the Crocs is a soft green color, with images of the classic Animal Crossing trees, while the platform heel features blue and white ocean waves. A yellow line separates the two, acting as the beach. The heel grip has similar blue and white tones to the platform, but to create the effect of clouds in the sky. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The base pair of Crocs also comes with six “exclusive” Jibbitz that aren’t available for purchase individually. These include K.K. Slider, Timmy and Tommy, Tom Nook, Isabelle, a weirdly tall house, and a classic fruit tree. As far as we know, everyone gets apples, but it would be a cute gimmick if the fruits were randomized. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo Switch Screenshots</h3></div></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Additional Jibbitz Charms Can Be Purchased Separately</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The more challenging decision is whether to pick up any additional charms. The Creator set features the always-fashionable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/How_to_Unlock_Able_Sisters_Shop">Able Sisters</a> as well as the shirt and backpack icons used throughout the series. The Collector set features, as you’d expect, three characters that help you build your various collections: the museum-keeper <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/blathers">Blathers</a>, his stargazing younger sister Celeste, and the art dealer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/redd">Jolly Redd</a>. You also get the fossil and seashell icons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, we have the special “single charms” you can currently only find online at the Crocs store. One can only imagine how Nintendo or Crocs decided on these, but for around $5, you can grab a single charm of one of your <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/Villagers_and_Special_Characters">neighboring villagers</a>. At this time, your only options are Bunnie, Rosie, or Marshal, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the charm line expanded to include more characters down the line (<em>cough, </em>Raymond).  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is the first Crocs and Animal Crossing crossover, it isn’t anywhere close to the first fashion collaboration for Nintendo. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-converse-sneakers-collab-pikachu-eevee-mewtwo-charizard">Pokémon crossed over with Converse</a> back in 2022, while Levi’s once stocked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-levis-denim-collection-revealed">a full Super Mario collection</a>. Puma featured <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/puma-animal-crossing-crossover-sneakers">Animal Crossing and other Nintendo properties</a> on a range of activewear back in 2021. Most of these collections quickly sold our or were otherwise in limited stock, so it's a good shout to grab a collaboration like this before it's only available on the resell market. </p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 26, 2025 5:16 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-crocs-and-charms-are-now-available]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's all downhill from here.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA's long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/skate">Skate</a> reboot finally has an early access release date, and the good news is you'll be able to play it for free in less than a month. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skate's early access launch begins on September 16 via PC (EA App, Epic Games Store, Steam), PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously announced, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-skate-will-require-an-always-on-internet-connection">you will need an internet connection to play the game</a>, as well as an EA account to log in. Skate developer Full Circle previously explained the need for an online connection as something required for its vision of a "living, breathing, massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"You’ll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time," the developer continued, "as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, today's release date trailer focuses firmly on multiplayer gameplay, with squads of skaters seen traversing the streets of San Vansterdam. The game's open-world features traffic, and what look like custom-made objects hung in the sky for you to try and skate upon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skate was originally announced by publisher EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-announces-a-new-skate"><u>way back in 2020,</u></a> and development has continued slowly but surely ever since. The game has previously been playable by fans within <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-4-is-officially-called-skate-and-it-will-be-free-to-play-and-have-cross-play-and-cross-progression"><u>closed community playtests</u></a> that have even seen the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eas-skate-gets-microtransactions-before-its-release-date"><u>introduction of microtransactions for cosmetic items</u></a>, if you were wondering how EA plans to monetise the game. All purchases will be reset at the game's impending early access launch — though if you've paid anything before then, your money will be refunded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can clearly see the direction developer Full Circle is taking the series, but I can also say that Skate is shaping up to be a game worthy of being the long-awaited sequel to 2010’s Skate 3," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/can-skate-revive-the-old-school-magic">Skate hands-on preview</a> earlier this year. "The gameplay seems refined and lives up to its predecessors, the world is big and fun to explore, and the overall sandbox’s 'do what you want' vibe is really making me look forward to diving back in."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The sudden and unexpected appearance of Mega Dragonite then galvanises the rest of the Pokémon, including Roy's Mega Lucario, who then rally to save the day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And after a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mega-pokmon-species-revealed-for-pokmon-legends-z-a">mixed response to Mega Dragonite's in-game design</a>, its anime appearance now seems to be getting a warmer welcome. "Mega Dragonite haters better apologize," wrote one fan. "It’s flapping the little tiny wings! Omg I love it hahaha," wrote a second. "Awwww. Okay okay, I’m won over," said a third.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unusual — though not unheard of — for a Pokémon to make its anime debut before they're available in a Pokémon game. The practice was far more common during the franchise's early years, when various species from both the Johto and Hoenn regions were glimpsed in anime form before their corresponding games arrived. (Remember Misty carrying around that Togepi egg for what felt like forever?) </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, the practice of debuting Pokémon via the franchise's anime has become less common, however, with just a handful of species (Magearna, Terapagos) getting the same treatment over the last three generations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends Z-A is set to arrive on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on October 16. Fans are expecting dozens of new Mega Pokémon to uncover, though only one other species has been officially revealed so far: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-reveals-another-all-new-mega-pokemon">Mega Victreebell</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Overall, Legends: Z-A didn’t feel like a full action game to me," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-system-first-impressions">first hands-on impressions of Pokémon Legends Z-A's battle systems</a>, "but kind of more like an MMO, with its casting times, cooldowns, and behind-the-scenes math happening. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but I do hope Legends: Z-A gets challenging enough to make me more intentionally dish out commands and think about switching Pokémon at just the right moment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
