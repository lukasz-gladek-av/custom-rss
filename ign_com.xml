It will be the latest Xbox exclusive heading to the PlayStation console following games like Sea of Thieves and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 version was developed by Panic Button in partnership with Turn 10 Studios and Playground Games and will feature the same content as the Xbox and PC version. Furthermore, Car Packs, and the Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure expansions will also be included.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The move comes amid growing interest from Xbox in releasing its games on non-Xbox platforms including PlayStation and Nintendo Switch, with Xbox boss Phil Spencer confirming its intention to support the Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the most recent investor call, Microsoft revealed that while Indiana Jones and the Great Circle reached 4 million players, and Game Pass on PC grew 30% to increase services revenue by 2%, overall gaming revenue fell with console sales <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-growth-indiana-jones-great-circle-call-of-duty-hardware-falls">dropping nearly 30%</a>. This may incentivize Xbox to prioritize Game Pass and push for more games on other hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Forza Horizon 5 is the continuation of the open world racing series. A little more arcade than its racing sim sibling, Forza Mortorsport, Forza Horizon 5 allows drivers to race and explore beautiful Mexico.
