            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Days of Our Lives' current 61st season has included a shoutout for one of Nintendo's lesser-known franchises, much to the surprise of fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A recent episode of the long-running soap saw Salem University student Aaron flirting with classmate Arianna outside his dorm room. Looking for an excuse to invite her in, Aaron boldly suggests Arianna might like to wait inside, in order to "play Xenoblade on my Switch." I'd have gone for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, personally, but there we go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To the surprise of Aaron — and, let's be honest, everyone at home watching — his offer is taken up by Arianna, who awkwardly laughs and steps inside, looking like she really did not have anything else better to do. Aaron, bless him, looks genuinely surprised his suggestion worked — as well he should.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">In this scene from the long-running American soap opera Days of Our Lives (s61e008), Aaron uses playing Xenoblade as an excuse to invite Arianna into his dorm room. <a href="https://t.co/LQ9kCVmuyC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LQ9kCVmuyC</a></p>— Nintendeal (@Nintendeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendeal/status/1967660763499405407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The moment has since been turned into a clip and uploaded by <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1967660763499405407" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendeal</a> to social media, where many Nintendo fans are celebrating someone remembering that Xenoblade exists. (To those who were hoping for a new game announcement in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">last week's Nintendo Direct</a>, I hope you're doing okay.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Monolith Soft, the Xenoblade Chronicles series began back in 2010 on Wii, with subsequent years featuring half a dozen sequels and re-releases. The most recent of those, a new version of Wii U side-story Xenoblade Chronicles X, launched for Switch back in March, at a time when most Nintendo fans were just waiting for Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This show has 61 seasons and I've never seen any bit of it until Xenoblade was mentioned," wrote Zhenghua Yang, founder of To the Moon developer Serenity Forge, after watching the clip. "Top tier marketing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know nothing about this show but Aaron is already my favorite character and there is no question about it," wrote another fan, AmiibroN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally launched in 1965, Days of Our Lives is (still) running — now on streaming service Peacock. For anyone who has watched the full episode, do let us know what happened next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: NBC/Peacock.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Flying the Early Access nest</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for a new survival game to obsess over, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lost-skies">Lost Skies</a> officially goes from Early Access to full release on September 17. As the name suggests, you're doing a lot of grappling and gliding in the game, exploring floating islands to unlock technology and collect raw materials, but the core of the game is its detailed, physics-based ship-building system. There's co-op for 1-6 players too, so you don't have to fly alone. If you haven't checked it out yet now is the perfect time, and here are a few details to tempt you to take off. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">PSA for sufferers of airsickness </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Lost Skies is all about exploring ruins and biomes, collecting resources to craft and refine a skyship, so you're spending all your time at high altitude. You'll start out with a grappling hook for shorter distances, then craft a makeshift glider, and by combining the two you can chain movement that will let you get to the harder to reach areas. Once you have enough materials to start crafting your skyship it will become a home base and a weapon war.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>You are not alone</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The various regions of the Lost Skies world are home to strange creatures, like the Blue Manta that travels through the skies, but will attack if provoked, or the burrowing Spitter Motus Beetle that rudely shoots balls of acid at you. Those are the least of your worries though - there are also the Seraph, strange mechanical looking enemies that are powerful and use nano-technology to devastating effect. They're are not to be trifled with. You do have someone on your side though, an AI companion called ASA that can help explain the strange lands you find yourself in, and stop you turning into a weird sky loner. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Something really bad happened</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like most survival games, there's a terrible event that has left you trying to craft your own underpants or going toe to toe with an enraged boar. In Lost Skies it's not the old zombies or aliens stuff, but something called the Cataclysm. AI companion ASA helps you decode the clues you find scattered around ruins, and figure out how the monstrous mechanical Seraph are involved.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Lost Skies Regions, Bosses, and Wildlife Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">You can create your own Lost Skies islands</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're the sort of person who doesn't just want to live in a world, but to shape and control it too, maybe check in with a therapist and then try the Lost Skies Island Creator. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102670/Lost_Skies_Island_Creator/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This free tool</a> allows players to sculpt and populate an island, and use assets from the game to refine and populate it. There are already hundreds of player made islands.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">It's made by the Surgeon Simulator folks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It might look whimsical, but Lost Skies is made by the studio that brought you cult hits like Surgeon Simulator. That was the cult where you had to perform complex medical procedures with tricky physics-based controls. Many virtual patients died, but hilariously. They also created the self-explanatory I Am Bread and I Am Fish. Lost Skies is definitely a vibe shift, but one that takes the bare bones physics-engine skills of Bossa and makes it real pretty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Disclaimer: IGN Entertainment and publishing label Humble Games operate under separate divisions of the same parent company, Ziff Davis.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lift-turns-mundane-productivity-into-a-clever-puzzle-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-lift-turns-mundane-productivity-into-a-clever-puzzle-game.1299582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If your interests lie in the fairly specific cross-section of Soviet-inspired utopia/dystopia, tinkering with stuff, and techno-goop, then you’ll need to set eyes on The Lift (that’s an elevator, for my American English-speaking friends). This supernatural puzzle game has a compelling pitch, and I was excited to get hands-on with a bunch of quirky tools in a PC demo build.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I played two polished chapters – one being the tutorial scene, and the other a slice taken from mid-game. All three hours I spent in-game made for an entertaining voyage into the unreal, with only some minor niggles. The Lift may still be on the workbench, but I’m happy to say that it’s looking ready and wired up for a great time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Speculative Fix-tion</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You play a silent man known as a Keeper, filled with pride by a life dedicated to repairing broken things. The amusing tutorial immediately throws you into a “test lift.” A woman’s voice crackles over a speaker and she coaches you, in an over-the-top propagandic way, through your first tests of rewiring circuits and replacing light bulbs. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Lift - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lift’s tactile handyman interactions are a distinguishing mechanic from the get-go. For instance, opening a panel may involve grabbing a handle, then mimicking the real-life movement of physically “pulling” it open towards you with your mouse. Rectify the test lift’s malfunctions, and the doors will open to what hints at humorous but increasingly bizarre goings-on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Lift’s tactile handyman interactions are a distinguishing mechanic from the get-go. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like many sci-fi stories before it, The Lift takes place in an abandoned research facility, known ominously as The Institute. It gave me Kowloon Walled City vibes: chaotic, windowless rooms built around the titular elevator. You’ll advance through floors filled with malfunctioning machinery, but find quickly that your job extends beyond simple handyman work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo showcased a very brief amount of time outside The Institute (and an introduction to a character called Trader, who confusingly doesn't seem to have anything to trade), where the most dreamlike of The Lift’s visuals are found. Think Expedition 33-style surreality: traffic lights hang from the sky, furniture drifts about in mid-air, and giant, ludicrously tall chairs tower in the distance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I absolutely love the premise of this irreverent-slash-eerie sci-fi world, though I found it a little difficult to follow the narrative clues dropped by the occasional characters I encountered (more on them in a bit). The indoor environments say a lot, however: What’s that weird black sludge? What spooky force is breaking all The Institute’s chairs? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing you’ll see in The Lift is physically harmful to you, but you just know that those questions are going to have strange answers…</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hidden Object(ives)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lift is heavily objective-driven, with various tasks assigned by chattering, “wacky” characters over intercom known collectively as Rubus. They’ll tune in occasionally to talk at you, alluding to various problems and tasking you with repairing them. I generally found these sequences to be unengaging, and I’d catch my eyes glazing over as I thought, “Please just give me the objective already.” </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/4-ducttape-1757978971604.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice acting is well-suited to their varied personalities and expertly delivered, but I found all of The Lift’s characters unnecessarily longwinded. It’s not a huge drawback, but having to listen to their prattle without a fast-forward button was a bit distracting in a game built around hands-on, can-do gameplay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for those tasks, you’ll often have multiple objectives – and sub-objectives – on the go at any given time. They are tracked helpfully in your handheld Bureau Utility Gadget, or “B.U.G.,” and range from simple tasks like accessing a blocked-off room to the obscure, like “Get wave production to level 3” (the latter of which I soon learned was simply a euphemism for "just fix as many things as possible”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The very first task is to find the actual Lift and make it move to a different floor. Each floor is essentially a giant puzzle you’ll need to revert its original, non-shabby state, thus unlocking your ascension to higher floors and taking you closer and closer to… well, whatever is leaving black splodges of slime everywhere.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/7-crafting-1757978986519.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll be collecting lots of screws, power cables, and other tidbits. There are two ways to navigate your inventory: one is via a circular menu, and the other is by cycling through items in your hand – both remarkably straightforward. A nice touch are auto-suggested tools for certain broken things you’ll hover over, like a “bee” for a bee socket. Yes, really. With The Lift’s more esoteric machinery, those suggestions help!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tooling Around</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">So what needs fixing, anyway? Sometimes it’s simply replacing a screw on a wonky chair. You’ll also discover messed-up circuit boards with missing parts, which you may need to hunt around for. Sometimes that involves finding a spare part on a shelf, and other times you may need to buy a “spinny electromotor” from a vending machine. Not all things mirror the handyman tools of real life and can actually cross into more whimsical fantasy concepts (like the aforementioned bee).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your government job also covers some supernatural cleanup. During the demo I graduated from a screwdriver to more complex tools, such as the Cleaning Beam that sucks up those glowing, pulsating black masses into oblivion. I also wielded a glue gun – which inexplicably uses duct tape and not glue – to patch up holes in the wall, also oozing with that peculiar black substance.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/8-generator-1757979001402.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Be warned: there’s a bit of backtracking. The Lift has minor metroidvania aspects, with certain items or objectives not reachable until “unlocked,” whether through removing gunk off a door or finding a new type of tool. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the earlier puzzles even had me backtracking a bit farther than I would’ve expected. I didn’t mind this at all, and honestly liked how it reflected the unplanned messiness of real-life DIY, but players who prefer a more streamlined experience may want to keep this in mind. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t expect solutions to go full IKEA: only one screw may be needed to realign a whole bench, for instance. But if you’re thinking that there can’t be much challenge in playing with screws and light bulbs, think again. The puzzles are environmental as well, and one of the later hurdles I came across was actually quite devious and required serious exploration before I figured out the solution. My biggest tip? Don’t forget to look up. Often.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Glitchcraft</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/11-bee-1757979015649.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll find random, glitchy objects strewn about the world, from staplers to comically large calculators. These can be fed into a trash chute in exchange for tokens, which can be used to purchase limited numbers of spare parts at vending machines. (You may need to repair the vending machine first.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As a fan of crafting games, my short experience with The Lift’s craft system was a notable highlight.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Late in the demo I also gained access to crafting, and I wish I’d had more time to tinker around with it! Feeding specific numbers of those same glitchy objects into a crafting machine transforms them into snazzy new fix-’em-up modules. If one tricky circuit board is giving you a headache, your craft room may be just the place to find its broken part.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a fan of crafting games, my short experience with The Lift’s craft system was a notable highlight. This build’s craftables only feature the basics like cables and power units, but I can’t wait to see what else we may be able to make later on. More bees to get circuit boards buzzing again? Even zanier tools?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/2-mainhall-1757979031386.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lift’s developers say that they’re aiming for a much more hopeful, positive take on the Soviet concept of productivity, but I can't say I felt much of that idealism myself. The narrative instead hints more at instability (in a science-gone-awry way – no dystopian government to be seen here). This definitely isn’t a downside – but positive Soviet satire is an uncommon theme that I’m hoping the finished game will lean more into, and maybe even be defined by.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think that fans of the puzzle genre will be refreshed by The Lift’s new take on problem-solving. Overall, the execution of the fiddling-and-fixing gameplay is spot-on, and there’s great satisfaction to be had in watching lights flicker on and systems come back online. And despite my rather insignificant annoyance of the wordy characters, I actually can’t wait to tinker more, mend bigger and weirder machines, and see where this strange story (and its goop) leads when The Lift comes out next year.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lift-turns-mundane-productivity-into-a-clever-puzzle-game]]></content:encoded>
