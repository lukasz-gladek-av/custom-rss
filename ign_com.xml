Personally, I’d go for the Disc Edition—it’s just $50 more, and you get the flexibility of physical games, which you can buy, sell, or trade later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you prefer the Digital Edition, the NBA 2K25 bundle is a smart pick if you can find it in stock, as it includes a game. On the other hand, the Fortnite Cobalt Star bundle, while eye-catching, doesn’t include a game—just something to keep in mind. These deals will end after Cyber Monday on December 2, so act fast to avoid disapointment.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Will the PS5 Pro Be Discounted for Cyber Monday?</h3></div><div catalogid="22330e1e-28c7-4dd9-bdc4-9851a9ac43c6" id="210194"><div id="210194" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PlayStation 5 Pro</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Short answer, no. Long answer: While major hardware discounts are rarely a sure thing on brand-new releases, Cyber Monday might bring some unexpected deals. In the announcement for Sony's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">lineup of holiday deals</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-black-friday-2024-sale-predictions">PS5 Pro</a> was (unsurprisingly) nowhere to be found. However, some retailers could surprise shoppers with modest discounts or exclusive PS5 Pro bundles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-review">PS5 Slim</a>, for example, was released last year at a similar time and ended up getting a free game bundle (Spider-Man 2 or Modern Warfare 3) <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-the-ps5-slim-spider-man-2-and-call-of-duty-ps5-black-friday-bundles">at the end of November</a>. We’ll be keeping an eye out to see if any retailers step up with a Cyber Monday special.</p></div><p id="playstation-vr-2"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="PlayStation VR 2">PlayStation VR 2 is $349 for Black Friday</h2></p><div catalogid="5daeac12-bdd9-4053-b6ac-ac98bab9c7de" id="211422"><div id="211422" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PlayStation VR 2 - Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best Cyber Monday deals is the PSVR2 Horizon: Call of the Mountain bundle, now just $349—a massive $251 discount. It’s the same price as the standalone PSVR2 during this sale, but the bundle is the clear winner, including an incredible game to showcase the headset's power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At this price, the PSVR2 is a strong competitor to budget-friendly options like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyber-monday-meta-quest-3s-deal-2024">Meta Quest</a>, offering a premium VR experience at an accessible price. If you’ve been waiting to step into high-performance virtual reality, this deal is too good to pass up.</p></div><p id="ps5-ssd-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="PS5 SSD deals">Cyber Monday Deals on PS5 SSDs</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 games continue to grow in size, and with SSD prices climbing in 2024, finding the right storage at a great price is more important than ever. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> now here, there are plenty of discounts to explore. For example, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bgo2?object_uuid=b2079bf5-f109-4861-be4c-78e53621e28a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WD Black SN850X 2TB SSD</a> with a heatsink is currently available for $133.99, offering excellent value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep in mind that not all SSDs are compatible with the PS5. To ensure optimal performance, you'll need a PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 drive with a minimum read speed of 5,500MB/s to match the console's internal storage. To simplify your search, we've curated a list of SSDs that meet or exceed these requirements.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>PS Plus Cyber Monday Deal (Save 30%)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/20/54151004493-d618819f1a-k-1732112194364.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Save up to 30% on PS Plus during Black Friday 2024.

Plus, all PS4 and PS5 players can enjoy extra discounts on recent movie releases during the promotion.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Wait for Cyber Monday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As Black Friday deals continue throughout the weekend, keep an eye on video game Black Friday deals from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-games-under-30-black-friday-2024">Nintendo</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">PlayStation</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-black-friday-2024">Xbox</a>. Waiting for Cyber Monday can be risky – the hottest gaming deals tend to sell out fast. This is why Black Friday tends to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-video-games">the better time to buy video games</a>. Frankly, if you see a game deal you like, we'd recommend hopping on it now. But if you missed out on the PS5 2K25 bundle (or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-bundle-2024-new-live">any of the insanely popular Switch bundles</a>), there might still be hope come Cyber Monday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

In terms of video game deals, quite a few have caught our eye that have been brought over into the retailer's Cyber Monday sale, including an excellent discount on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB1LZE?object_uuid=2b1cd6e2-864e-4a08-b68c-ca70a8b4fe28&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0C93LGYCN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 for Switch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch owners can enjoy a nice 63% discount on this collection, which has brought its price down to just $18.74. According to price tracker <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0C93LGYCN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camelcamelcamel</a>, it's the lowest price its hit so far which is a massive bonus. A lot of deals like this won't stick around long after Cyber Monday, so if you've been wanting to add this stealthy series to your game library, now's the time.</p><div catalogid="e6bf14dc-1201-4240-b1c4-1ff7a2ef1ca2" id="212612"><div id="212612" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty in this collection to keep you busy all throughout the holidays, too. It comes with Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Metal Gear (NES/FC version), and Snake’s Revenge. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview">Metal Gear Solid Delta</a> hopefully dropping sometime soon, there's never been a better time to sneak back into this series of games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's got even more gaming deals in its Cyber Monday sale that are worth adding to your virtual shopping cart. Some big ones that got our attention were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-cyber-monday-deal-2024">Star Wars Outlaws, which remains on sale at $40 from Black Friday</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-cyber-monday-deal-2024">Sonic X Shadow Generations, which is down to just $30</a>. These just scratch the surface of what the retailer currently has available, though.

Retailers often stagger their inventory, reserving stock for each major sale event. This means Cyber Monday will bring back popular deals alongside brand-new, never-before-seen offers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, Black Friday was the in-store shopping frenzy, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">Cyber Monday focused on online deals</a>. While those lines have blurred, Cyber Monday remains the top event for online-focused retailers like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Even traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart roll out exclusive online-only offers. Amazon, in particular, has already shifted gears to highlight its Cyber Monday deals early, so expect some amazing sales ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelance writer who works with the Guides and Commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 1, 2024 3:16 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He continues on to say it's, "a worthy successor to the best of the Prince of Persia legacy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has a few more game deals live that are worth taking advantage of.
