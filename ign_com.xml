He said the Digital Extremes tech team is “so excited” to see what a Nintendo Switch 2 Warframe port would look like but can’t even begin development until they get their hands on the necessary hardware.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our tech team is so excited to take advantage of the high-speed cores and the other really cool features of it,” Sinclair said. “There’s just such a backlog for dev kits. So, yeah, if you know anyone… just one, that’s all it would take.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Digital Extremes brought its 12-year-old multiplayer hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/20/warframe-review-3"><u>to Switch in 2018</u></a>, allowing longtime players to enjoy all that Warframe has to offer, at home and on the go. It is available to play through Nintendo's new console but only through backward compatibility, with Nintendo including it on <a href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-Games+with+issues+that+prevent+progress+on+Nintendo+Switch+2%2C+including+games+with+start+up+issues-EN.pdf?_gl=1*1xud3vk*_gcl_au*MTc0ODcyNjcwMy4xNzUwNzk4MDAz*_ga*MTc5MjY2MzA2Mi4xNzQxODc1MjIw*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NTI5NDE3NjMkbzIxJGcxJHQxNzUyOTQxODE0JGo5JGwwJGgzOTg0NDU4NDM." data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a list of Switch 2 titles that still suffer from start-up issues</u></a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When we get a dev kit, we will be doing a custom build for Warframe.

Sinclair teased faster load times as just one of the potential upgrades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know our programmers are just, like, ‘Oh, I can’t wait.’ We definitely have plans. When we get a dev kit, we will be doing a custom build for Warframe. Absolutely.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 launched on June 5, 2025, introducing new features such as Joy-Con mouse functionality, improved graphics, and enhanced social tools. Although its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-confirmed-so-far"><u>launch lineup</u></a> was able to lean on third-party support with titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Deltarune Chapter 1 – 4, Split Fiction, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, and Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut, early adopters remain on the lookout for more games to fill out their libraries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As players clamor for more games, other indie developers say they, too, are in need of dev kit access. Into the Restless Ruins creator Ant Workshop, Citizen Sleeper 2 developer Fellow Traveller Games, Unreal Engine support studio Tanglewood Games, and more spoke about dev kit scarcity with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/where-are-the-switch-2-indie-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesIndustry.biz</u></a> last month. Insider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nate the Hate also reported</u></a> that many developers across the indie and third-party spaces have been unable to start work on Switch 2 games due to a lack of dev kit access (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-games-delay-lack-of-dev-kits/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TheGamer</u></a>). It's currently unclear which publishers currently have access to Switch 2 dev kits or when they will become more available.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warframe The Old Peace Screenshots - TennoCon 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, there’s no word on when Digital Extremes or many of the other dozens of developers without dev kits will receive the tools they need to bring their games to Switch 2.

The remaster introduced numerous quality-of-life updates that were much needed, in addition to a brand-new epilogue chapter. We gave the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review">a 9/10 in our review</a>, stating, "Xenoblade Chronicles X was already one of the Wii U’s best games, and this Definitive Edition does more than enough to justify another trip to planet Mira."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Switch Games Are on Sale at Woot</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> out now, there has never been a better time to jump in and experience the Nintendo Switch library of Donkey Kong games.

If you haven't had the chance to check this one out yet, Amazon has Nintendo Switch copies available for only $34.99.
