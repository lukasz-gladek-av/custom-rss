            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Years before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-gcn">Animal Crossing</a> became a global success, Nintendo warned its localisation team how "difficult" it would be to make the game work outside of its native Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Extension</a>, Nintendo localization manager Leslie Swann said bosses cautioned that the English-language launch of Animal Crossing, then titled Animal Forest, would be a huge job due to the sheer amount of in-game text within the title, as well as its numerous Japan-specific cultural references and items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Swan remembered then-Nintendo president Satoru Iwata discovering her team was working on bringing the notoriously odd and text-heavy game would be launched outside of Japan — something that left him in disbelief.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We knew of Animal Forest, but we hadn't really dinked around with it — we usually would get the Japanese versions of games and play through them," Swann recalled. "But we hadn't really messed around with that one very much. So, anyway, [Takashi Tezuka, Nintendo executive officer] basically said to me, 'We'd like to have you localize it' and I said, 'Sure.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But then he said, 'No, Leslie, I'm not sure you understand, it's going to be difficult.' And I kept having to assure him that we would make it happen."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing's earliest incarnation, known as Animal Forest, launched for N64 in April 2001 and never made it outside of Japan. It was only when the game was given an expanded GameCube launch that the decision was made to localise the title elsewhere — and even then, its arrival around the world took years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A month or two later, I was in a meeting with Mr. Iwata and some other heads of the development group," Swan recalled, "and we were just kind of going around saying, 'Here's what we're going to be working on,' and I just said, 'Well, Mr. Tezuka is asking us to work on Animal Forest' and he just burst out in laughter. He just laughed and said, 'I don't know how you're going to do this.' And it's true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/09/gettyimages-81942145-1757414619829.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The late Satoru Iwata reportedly laughed at the idea of bringing Animal Crossing to the west. Photo by GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Swann's team had to rename every character, determine each character's catchphrase and localise the game's calendar of in-game events to make sense to a more global audience. Other work involved sifting through the game's inventory of items to ensure everything made sense for players outside of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can't tell you the number of hours we spent on that game, all hands on deck," Swann continued. "We were so lucky at that point that we didn't have other big projects, as we pretty much had the entire staff dedicated to that game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Everybody would get together in a room and we would say, 'Okay, today we're going to rename all the furniture in this set,' or 'Today we're going to work on names for these characters and their catchphrases.' Then, after this, we would submit all this stuff to our legal department who had to clear everything because our thought from the beginning was if this is big, then we're going to want to make merchandise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the game's name, Animal Crossing, went through various changes before launch — with some suggestion it might include 'Forest' in the title before it was ultimately dropped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It must have been at least six months or maybe a year for us to clear the name Animal Crossing," Swan concluded. "I remember we had so many other names that we were in love with and then we would be crushed when they would be rejected. My favourite was 'Animal Acres,' because the grids of the town lent themselves to being called acres. But again, that didn't clear."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from Swann on her career, including her work on Nintendo Power magazine and how she ended up voicing Princess Peach for years, the full <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Extension</a> interview is well worth a read. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I hate horror though, so it wouldn’t be horror... plus, I have no ideas."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Okami and Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya recently weighed in on Hideo Kojima’s “lost” horror game demo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pt">P.T.</a>, and its lasting legacy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A collaboration between Hideo Kojima and film director Guillermo del Toro, P.T. was released in 2014 on the PS4 as a free demo for their upcoming game Silent Hills. However, when series publisher Konami cancelled the game in 2015, they also delisted the demo from the PlayStation Store, making it impossible to redownload. This led to second-hand PS4 consoles with the critically acclaimed demo commanding high prices on auction sites like Ebay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On X, where he regularly responds to (and blocks/unblocks) fans, Hideki Kamiya recently talked about P.T in response to a user expressing hope that either Kamiya or Kojima would try making another P.T.-style game. On September 5, Kamiya <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1963791553694220633" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted,</u></a> “if it’s impossible to resurrect P.T., Kojima should make a new game in the same style,” adding: "if Kojima doesn’t do it, maybe I’ll give it a go. I hate horror though, so it wouldn’t be horror... plus, I have no ideas.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems that Kojima’s upcoming experimental horror game OD might go some way to plugging the P.T.-shaped hole. First teased back in 2023 via a mysterious trailer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-compares-od-to-boktai-says-it-will-be-just-as-different">OD promises to</a> “explore the concept of testing your fear threshold, and what it means to overdose on fear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like P.T., OD is also a collaboration with a filmmaker, this time with Jordan Peele of Get Out fame. Hideo Kojima <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-will-read-your-initial-responses-to-his-mysterious-xbox-game-od-but-insists-the-real-evaluations-come-after-10-or-20-years-from-now"><u>previously promised</u></a> that OD will be something that “no one has seen before,” although details still remain scarce. Kojima will be holding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kojima-set-to-offer-glimpse-at-future-projects-during-event-celebrating-10-years-of-independence-from-konami"><u>a special event in Tokyo</u></a> later this month to celebrate 10 years since his break with Konami, where he is likely to reveal more info about future projects (possibly including more about OD).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Devil May Cry and Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya kicked off his career at Capcom working on the original Resident Evil and its sequel, he has never made a modern, photorealistic horror game akin to P.T. In a series of tweets last October, Kamiya observed that P.T.’s delisting left a gap in the market, which Japanese indie hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-exit-8">The Exit 8</a> stepped into. “The Exit 8 went viral, but it’s basically just a watered-down P.T.,” Kamiya opined.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Exit 8 is far less gory and objectively less scary than P.T., however it does share the delisted demo’s looping corridor mechanic, building a sense of dread in the player as they try to spot anomalies in its subway passage. Selling fast on Steam upon its release in November 2023, The Exit 8 has grown into such a phenomenon that it has even spawned a film adaptation (which recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-exit-8-the-live-action-horror-movie-adaptation-of-the-hit-indie-game-has-sparked-a-backlash-in-japan-over-its-tsunami-scene"><u>generated some controversy in Japan</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1844064525647216826" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>saying</u></a> that he can’t play P.T. alone because it is “too scary,” Hideki Kamiya is full of praise for Kojima and del Toro’s demo. He even went so far as <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1844214379350471060" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>to say that</u></a> the ‘8-like’ sub-genre (games with similar settings and mechanics to The Exit 8, which proliferated in the wake of its meteoric success) should really be called ‘P.T.-like.’ “P.T. was really that revolutionary - with an unparalleled uniqueness, and I think it has strongly influenced subsequent game creators,” said Kamiya.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Kamiya, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/okami-2-capcom-hideki-kamiya-and-machine-head-discuss-hotly-anticipated-sequel-in-exclusive-interview">he's busy working on Okami 2 for Capcom with his new development studio, Clovers</a>. Kamiya left PlatinumGames in 2023 under something of a cloud.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

"But that was something that was a little bit too much, so we decided to skip that one. But that whole scene when you can see his weakness, I think, is very important, in combination with the ruthlessness and how vicious [the Nazis] are."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The concept around Hitler was that he was going to be extremely physical," Matthies added, picking up the story. "Like, the opposite of spiritual, basically. If you have a Nazi enemy – or, in this case... the ultimate Nazi – how do you make something unique out of it? How do you make it interesting and something they haven't seen before?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This resulted in the darkly comic scene where Hitler gets increasingly irate, eats, vomits and has to urinate. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Wolfenstein's Most Insane Moments</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had this idea that... 'Oh, maybe we just see it,'" Matthies laughed. "Y'know? I was Slacking with Todd Vaughn, VP of Production at Bethesda at the time, and I was like: 'Er, you think that would be a problem if we see Hitler's penis?' He was like, 'Yeah, I don't advise doing that.' I was like, 'Ah, you're probably right, maybe that's too much...' We all need to be saved from ourselves sometimes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of that decision, or perhaps because of it, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus landed as another strong entry in the studio's beloved shooter series — and hopefully not the last. As part of the same interview, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/machinegames-teases-were-not-done-with-wolfenstein-yet">MachineGames suggested its team were still keen for a third entry to round off the trilogy</a>, as they still had "story to tell".</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
