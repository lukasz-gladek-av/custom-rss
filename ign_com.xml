            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">League of Legends has become a global phenomenon, reaching out to multiple audiences with the likes of the popular MOBA game, the award-winning TV series Arcane, and the virtual K-pop group K/DA taking on the music world. Among the many projects that Riot Games has tinkered with, we’re finally getting a look at the anticipated League of Legends physical Trading Card Game, Riftbound. After getting hands-on with the cards and learning about the flow of the game, it’s a pleasant surprise how well the Riftbound team has translated the MOBA into a competitive card game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After getting a chance to talk to the Game Director of Riftbound, Dave Guskin, and receiving a breakdown of the game’s inception to the upcoming release, I had a good grasp of what the Riftbound team’s hopes were for the future. With the four trial decks on hand representing Jinx, Viktor, Volibear, and Yasuo, it was time to get some games in. Like many TCGs premiering their first set, keywords specific to the game will have brief descriptors for new and experienced players to familiarize themselves with the mechanics. With that said, gameplay was pretty easy to pick up if you have any TCG experience. Guskin did mention that they’re not trying to “reinvent the wheel,” taking inspiration from other card game systems and developing an “approachable” game that highlights the League of Legends champions. Based on my experience so far, I do think League of Legends players will take to this gameplay pretty well. Either way, it looks to be a great foundation for folks that are fans of both the game and TCGs.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Riftbound Trading Card Game (League of Legends)</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All the usual suspects for TCG card types are there, with specific ones being reminiscent of leader-type game formats. First and foremost, there is the Legend card that dictates the deck you’re playing. For example, Jynx Loose Cannon is a red and purple Legend, so the deck must consist of cards with either of the two colors. These also dictate the deck’s playstyle – typically with their abilities – so choosing a Legend is very important to deciding what kind of deck you want to play. Next, we have units, which are the creatures or characters that will help you vie for domination on the field of play. Another familiar type are spell cards that can be used for removal or support. Then there are gear cards that serve as artifacts or items that stay on the field alongside your units. Rune cards are the resource or mana of the game that sits in its own resource deck to pull from. Finally, an interesting card type that really emphasizes the MOBA aspect are battlefield cards. Players will conquer these battlefields to both score and win the game. Each battlefield has unique effects as well which makes for interesting interactions as players go back and forth to hold these battlefields throughout a match.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The One Piece Card Game or Hearthstone, for instance, are good examples of what Riftbound feels like.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With some games under my belt, the gameplay reminds me of other card games that revolve around leaders. The One Piece Card Game or Hearthstone, for instance, are good examples of what Riftbound feels like, with leaders having unique abilities that support the cards you play. Unlike leaders who typically have the choice of engaging in combat, your Legend takes a step aside and benefits the player with a passive or activated ability which can be used at certain times. For instance, the Viktor Legend can play a recruit unit token onto the field by paying one rune and tapping down or exhausting himself. With that said, players can choose a champion unit of the same name as your Legend to sit outside of your deck to be played whenever possible. So instead of a single leader unit dishing out and using abilities, the game has a Legend aside safely to always assist the player while the champion unit goes in to handle the combat. This champion unit acts like any other unit in your deck. As part of the setup, the game guarantees that you see the champion unit that you most want to play versus hoping you draw into it. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/27/viktorr-1751042726714.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The game starts with a hand of four and the draw phase only gives one card, but I didn’t feel like I was dumping my cards too much to my detriment. Jynx, for instance, thrives on rushing down and playing cards because she allows the player to draw a second card if the player begins the turn with one or less cards in hand. Sometimes you can luck out for a turn and you just don’t have enough runes to play anything meaningful, but there were enough chances to manipulate the field to give myself time to set up. Also, if all else fails, you have the champion unit that was chosen at setup as an option. Getting two mana or rune cards every turn is a familiar concept and it helps avoid being mana-screwed. In this game, there’s a maximum of 12 runes, which leaves a bit more room for card plays compared to similar games. There is a recycle action, which is just another name for “putting at the bottom of its respective deck,” whether it’s a rune card or a card from your main deck. Recycling mostly happens with your runes in the form of payment for cards. Strong cards tend to have a recycle cost, meaning you bring your total rune count down to play the powerful cards. This helps to avoid spamming said strong cards, and also makes players consider their choices if they want to play cards efficiently or on curve. It happens fairly often here, but it’s not debilitating enough that it’s a distraction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help with this recycle mechanic, there are gear cards in the decks that help pay for the recycle cost versus using your actual rune cards. It’s a nice addition that helps speed things along and ramp up the action. Speaking of which, the combat and scoring is probably the most interesting part of the game. Battlefield cards are the locations that your units will fight over, similar to how players fight for lanes in the MOBA. In a one-on-one game, each player chooses one battlefield from the three they have with their deck and sets them onto the field. When a unit enters or conquers a battlefield, the player scores one point. If the player continues to hold the battlefield up until the beginning of their next turn, they also score a point. Scoring the final point is a little nuanced, but the concept is pretty straightforward. In addition, Riftbound streamlined a lot of the math that players tend to do when going into a combat for said battlefields. Unlike Magic the Gathering, unit cards in Riftbound have only one number that signifies both their strength and health in the form of Might. If a unit card with five Might attacks a battlefield with two units, one with three Might and another with two Might, all three units kill each other and are sent to the trash. That’s right! It’s as simple as adding the total might of both the attacking and defending units in a battlefield showdown to determine who survives. Of course, spells can help break any ties or turn around the tables, but this system streamlines the combat compared to other games. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/27/yasuoo-1751042904646.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I can see League of Legends players getting a good understanding of the strategy with this game based on how positioning works in the gameplay. When first deploying your units, they are played in your base. From there, you can move your units when able to any battlefield whether there are enemies or not. A unique keyword in Riftbound is ganking, which MOBA fans are familiar with. For those that don’t know, ganking is another term for surprise attacks on enemy units. In Riftbound, units can only move to and from the base and a battlefield. They cannot move from battlefield to battlefield unless they have the ganking ability. The strategy of knowing when to move and where really matters in this game, and it’s a pleasant surprise from the typical ongoing charge of characters to an opponent’s life in other TCGs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, deck brewing is, for me, the lifeblood of any TCG. There’s no better feeling in card games than creating a deck that caters to your playstyle or taste and seeing it perform well against your friends or at your local store. Riftbound has six different colors – or domains, as they call it – to build decks around. Red or Fury is of course the aggressive color, which consists of damage removal and putting out cheap units that can attack quickly. Green or Calm appears to revolve around buffing and counterspells. Blue or Mind has a lot of draw capabilities and is usually known for control. Orange or Body appears to play around big bodies and mana-ramping effects. Purple or Chaos consists of bouncing enemies off the field and movement abilities. Finally, Yellow or Order seems to focus on token units and going wide. This is all based on what I see from the trial decks, but I have seen some overlap in terms of removal. The most exciting color for me is purple because of the movement in this game. It really does matter in Riftbound how you move throughout a match, and purple has some benefits when moving.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Coming into Riftbound with a medium understanding of the MOBA and characters, I was quite surprised by how much I enjoyed the gameplay.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From what I’ve experienced and heard from others, matches can be fairly quick – averaging less than 25 minutes if both players are familiar with the mechanics. Guskin mentioned to me that they’ll leave it up to the stores about whether or not events are best of one or three. When it comes to the bigger competitive events, best of three from Swiss to Top Cut is the plan, but final details are still being determined at this stage. Riftbound is launching this summer in China first before going global later in October. As I’ve seen in other card games, staggered releases do leave a sour taste – especially if it affects big competitive events – but Guskin assured me that the goal is to “narrow the gap in the first few sets and eventually have a simultaneous global release”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming into Riftbound with a medium understanding of the MOBA and characters, I was quite surprised by how much I enjoyed the gameplay. I come from an RTS background and never really understood what the MOBA custom game was in Starcraft at the time, but I learned about the genre much later. Now I enjoy aspects of League of Legends through Arcane or even the K/DA music. Like many TCGs nowadays, the existing fandoms help folks get that first foot through the door to experience a new TCG. And with League of Legends’ pedigree, I really think Riftbound has a great foundation for what they’re hoping to build and I look forward to checking out more of the game when they do. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-is-an-impressive-league-of-legends-trading-card-game]]></content:encoded>

The top five are all worth at least $40, with the top three going above $50. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to some other sets, that's all-in-all fairly reasonable... unlike the $500 plus you're looking at for the rarest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-destined-rivals-cards">Destined Rivals singles</a> right now!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While other recent sets have more expensive cards in general amongst their top ten, the special illustration Charizard ex is still among the priciest cards in the recent TCG right now, regularly floating between $170 and $185.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Ivysaur - 167/165</h2><div catalogid="adb6b196-6dcd-4a7e-ab99-4844468d534b" id="223551"><div id="223551" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ivysaur - 167/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Glancing at 151’s full-art holofoil of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ5OY?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ivysaur</a>, it’s not hard to understand why it’s a pricey contender to start off this list. Drawn by Yoriyuki Ikegami, who has been working on the TGC since the Crown Zenith days, this Ivysaur is a beautifully drawn card featuring the Seed Pokémon in a forest, staring into the water and seeing its former self as a Bulbasaur staring into the water.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a vibrant, colourful card with a bit of emotion under the surface. Plus, this is a solid card for gameplay as well. Its 100HP makes it a bit tanky for a Stage 1 card. While it’s three-Energy Vine Whip dealing 80 damage feels standard, Leech Seed being able to heal and pepper damage at the same time is a nice bonus. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Charmeleon - 169/165</h2></div><div catalogid="7c24db06-3ef7-4529-8884-6d778802c567" id="223549"><div id="223549" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Charmeleon - 169/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re back to a Stage 1 illustration rare, but this time of a <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q473ld?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charmeleon</a> drawn by Miki Kudo, a long-time Pokémon TCG artist who’s been around since the 2016 Generations set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When looking at all three full-art versions of the Charmander evolution chain, you can see that Kudo has gone for a mountainous theme, respective to what’s thought of as a Fire Pokémon’s natural habitat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, needing to discard an Energy each time for the already costly Fire Blast may seem cumbersome, but its 90 damage could quickly turn the tide depending on early game situations. That said, it shouldn’t be much trouble anyway if you plan on evolving it quickly. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Bulbasaur - 166/165</h2></div><div catalogid="bed8f282-efd4-4afd-87c6-ac9db6851a4e" id="223550"><div id="223550" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bulbasaur - 166/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of the illustration rares beyond the standard 165 cards in 151, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWYJrA?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur</a> is another Ikegami card that captures what Pokémon fans love about the original Grass starter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While collectors can enjoy its adorable face, sitting under a tree and loving life, also having Leech Seed as an attack with 70HP makes it a pretty reliable Basic Pokémon that can at least take a hit or two at the start of a match. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Alakazam ex - 201/165</h2></div><div catalogid="10253fac-98fb-4225-b3a0-8d6e29fef852" id="223541"><div id="223541" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alakazam ex - 201/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first among the pricey ex cards of 151 is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgj3E?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alakazam ex</a>, who can quickly stack some serious damage, both by using its Mind Jack to take advantage of your opponent’s benched Pokemon, and Dimensional Hand to deal damage from your own Bench. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Drawn by Shinya Komatsu, it wouldn’t be surprising if this Alakazam ex’s design is one of your favourites among 151 like it is mine. Set in the back of a home with potion bottles and books everywhere, testing its psychic abilities with those iconic spoons, it’s a thoughtfully done yet cosy sort of card that shows Komatsu understands Alakazam’s genius and drive to gain the edge in battle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Squirtle - 170/165</h2></div><div catalogid="cac6fcfd-399f-4bf5-81aa-16cdfe3d67fb" id="223540"><div id="223540" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Squirtle - 170/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The illustration rare of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgw7B?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Squirtle</a> is where 151 starts to get pricier, but it’s not hard to understand why when you look at its artwork and who illustrated it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Placing the Tiny Turtle Pokémon in the ocean water at the beach, this Squirtle was drawn by Mitsuhiro Arita, a veteran artist who has been working on Pokémon cards since the TCG’s very inception and has drawn almost 700 of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The risk of its Withdraw attack and the two-Energy cost of a 20-damage Skullbash doesn’t make it the best gameplay-wise. And yet, with the amount of jaw-dropping detail put into Squirtle and the ocean waters themselves, this can more be considered a work of art than a playing card.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Charmander - 168/165</h2></div><div catalogid="b440d385-5030-4d17-9b9e-27c615da2908" id="223539"><div id="223539" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Charmander - 168/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that we’ve reached Kanto’s Fire-type starter, it’s the illustration rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL82wM?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charmander</a> that turns out to be the most valuable among the original three, compared to Squirtle and Bulbasaur. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also illustrated by Miki Kudo, you can see its design is much like Charmeleon’s in a mountainous canyon, but this time at the bottom. The crowning touch for this theme is further down this list, but its duo Fire attacks, one dealing damage and another removing a troublesome Stadium card, this Charmander is a must for any Kanto-based Fire deck when its full evolution chain has been added. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Zapdos ex - 202/165</h2></div><div catalogid="d90cc191-aa00-4caa-900a-660bf81f4aac" id="223538"><div id="223538" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zapdos ex - 202/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Conjured up by the artistic talents of Shiburingaru, who has been of part ot the Pokémon TCG since 2022’s Brilliant Stars, 151’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwOG3?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zapdos ex</a> is stunning, with a majestic illustration featuring the electric bird soaring through the sky with its fellow Legendaries, Moltres &amp; Articuno. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its ability and moveset are nothing to overlook either. Along with Voltaic Float giving it flexibility for an easy retreat, Zapdos’ Multishot Lightning attack gives it the capability to shred through your opponent’s benched Pokémon as well as those active. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Venusaur ex - 198/165</h2></div><div catalogid="9434fc56-5232-437f-b0a8-b70052fba801" id="223537"><div id="223537" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Venusaur ex - 198/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A vivid and colourful card design, even more so than its pre-evolutions, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJ5LY?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Venusaur ex</a> looks both peaceful and intimidatingly stoic at the same time. Another card by Yoriuki Ikegami, it’s fitting for the fully evolved Grass-type starter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also like Bulbasaur and Ivysaur, it’s fairly tanky as well with 340HP, paired with it being able to steadily heal your team and inflict Poison plus Confusion to your enemies too. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Blastoise ex - 200/165</h2></div><div catalogid="f195fc8d-ec53-4736-a93b-bcadc97a550e" id="223536"><div id="223536" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Blastoise ex - 200/165 - SV: Scarlet &amp; Violet 151</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The second most expensive card in 151 is this resplendent vibe of a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWYJLA?object_uuid=85470b0b-0c0f-4011-bd87-5174e34f5035&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blastoise ex</a> card. Another by veteran Mitsuhiro Arita, there are multiple reasons this special underwater-themed card has drawn quite a high price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as its very pretty illustration facing the final Squirtle evolution underwater, it’s just as Venusaur ex, with the ability to deal more damage. While its HP isn’t as high, its Solid Shell reduces damage, while its Twin Cannon attack can deal up to 280 damage at a time at the cost of two Energy cards, even though you have to discard Energy cards each time you use it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1.

The crowning jewel of Miki Kudo’s illustrations, this Charizard completes the trilogy: starting with Charmander at the bottom of the mountainous canyon, Charmeleon slightly higher up, and Charizard itself soaring above with a fiery volcano in the background. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That, combined with the natural nostalgia for the practically priceless <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/11/pokemon-just-hit-us-in-the-nostagia-with-updated-pokemon-base-set-cards"><u>Charizard from the base set</u></a>, is arguably why this is the most expensive card in 151 by over $100. Although its Brave Wing and Explosive Vortex attacks make it a strong damage-dealer, you might want to keep this one in a special case rather than a tournament deck if you manage to pull one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like in other current sets such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-back-in-stock-amazon-new-updated-2025"><u>Prismatic Evolutions</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-destined-rivals-cards"><u>Destined Rivals</u></a>, and even the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025"><u>upcoming Mega Evolution set</u></a>, 151 has plenty of rare holofoil cards that have driven up a high market price on sites like TCG Player. In this case, though, it’s all of the full-art holofoil editions of Kanto favourites, also known as “illustration rares”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.
