The exclusive announcement trailer above introduces us to hero Fenrix Haven, a demon hunter who makes a deal with an angel for immortality, and the hordes of foes he'll have to slice and dice to prevent the resurrection of an ancient and pesky archdemon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat looks heavily inspired by Hades, and there are ranged weapons, melee attacks and special attacks called Celestial Blessings.  In the trailer we also get a glimpse of some of the other mechanics that will aid Fenrix on his journey, from a skill tree called The Grace of the Arbor to artifacts like a magically levitating hoverboard called the Jelly Engine. Weapons like silver-infused hammers, swords and a darkness cleaving shadow dagger can all be unlocked in the Magic Forge. This kit should come in handy when facing bosses - called Sealed Tyrants - as well as the Archdemon Asmodeus’s army of minions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ember and Blade First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game can be <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://store.steampowered.com/app/3470500/Ember_and_Blade/__;!!AEH8rfA!yJrQDDnnvpE219JT_B04ODzEPOpYMedii6whg8kk9PUlem-18nRnGVPujVSuosiGm5sXUu_ERmJUElE$" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlisted</a> on Steam now ahead of its 2026 release, and developer Line Games is promising a playable demo in the second half of this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

Plaintiffs also take issue with the fact that Ubisoft did not offer to create an 'offline, single-player option of the Game, otherwise known as a 'patch' when it shut down The Crew’s servers in March 2024," Ubisoft's lawyers wrote. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The [essence] of the plaintiffs’ complaint is that Ubisoft allegedly misled purchasers of its video game The Crew into believing they were purchasing unfettered ownership rights in the game, rather than a limited license to access the game. But the reality is that consumers received the benefit of their bargain and were explicitly notified, at the time of purchase, that they were purchasing a license."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The response further adds that the Xbox and PlayStation packaging contain a "clear and conspicuous notice — in all capital letters — that Ubisoft may cancel access to one or more specific online features upon a 30-day prior notice."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has now filed a motion to dismiss the case. If that fails and the lawsuit does proceed, the two plaintiffs have demanded a jury trial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Storefronts including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-now-warns-customers-theyre-buying-a-license-not-a-game-before-they-continue-to-payment">Steam now include an up-front warning to customers that they’re buying a license, not a game</a>.
