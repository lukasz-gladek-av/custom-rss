            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors and hopes regarding a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> remake have been raised again over the past week, driven by recent comments from Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii which do not deny nor confirm the existence of such a project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year marks the 30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger. As a result, Square Enix has launched various projects to celebrate the classic RPG. This includes a <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/music/sem/page/chrono/piano_soundscape/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>brand new album</u></a> featuring piano arrangements of character themes, a character popularity poll (Frog took the top spot, as reported by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202511/59024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Famitsu</u></a>), and <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/music/sem/page/chrono/concert/30th/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>orchestral concerts</u></a> to be held in Japan next January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this sudden celebration of Chrono Trigger after very little fanfare about the cult classic has prompted speculation that Square Enix is leading up to a bigger reveal of a Chrono Trigger remake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopes were reignited again among Japanese-speaking fans on November 30, when Yuji Horii was directly asked in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq1II1jaiuA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>discussion program</u></a> on YouTube if all the recent Chrono Trigger 30th Anniversary projects and events are hinting that a remake is in the works. Horii did not outright deny it, responding with "I can't say," "You shouldn't ask that!" and "I'll get told off!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This and publishing executive Kazuhiko Torishima's jokey follow-up cries of "There is! There is (a Chrono Trigger remake)!” have led to Japanese speaking fans hoping, once again, that a remake is in the works despite the fact Square Enix hasn't made any announcement. “I wonder if it will be announced next year?” <a href="https://x.com/kasago_p/status/1995458296199667729?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>users</u></a> wondered on X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chrono Trigger was originally released for the Super Famicom/SNES in 1995. With the involvement of Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii, and Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama, the RPG is beloved by fans and is considered by many to be one of the greatest games of all time. Although an upgraded version is currently available to play through Steam and on smartphones, fans have been calling for Chrono Trigger to get the remake treatment for years.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">25 Games That Still Deserve A Sequel</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The recent Dragon Quest HD-2D remakes have also got Chrono Trigger fans hopeful about seeing the SNES game recreated in the same style. “I want to play Chrono Trigger with beautiful graphics like these!” said <a href="https://x.com/rus_08F/status/1994982553292607650?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a user</u></a> on X. “Please, Square Enix!” Official posts by Square Enix accounts about Chrono Trigger anniversary merch have also attracted similar enthusiastic <a href="https://x.com/qvjB3Fkf25tsQVV/status/1993542117134942602?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>comments</u></a> like, “If there’s a remake I’ll definitely, definitely buy it!” In November, Japanese game news site<a href="https://dengekionline.com/article/202511/56445" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Dengeki Online did a poll</u></a> of games readers most wanted to see get the HD-2D treatment, and Chrono Trigger topped the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The situation is similar to that of Final Fantasy IX, with the game’s 25th anniversary celebrations this year also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-set-tongues-wagging-on-potential-switch-2-nintendo-direct-remake-reveal"><u>stoking fans’ hopes</u></a> that Zidane and Garnet’s adventures are in line for the remake treatment, although in IX’s case the rumors were backed up by the infamous 2021 Nvidia leak, which showed that a FFIX remake was possibly on Square Enix’s to-do list at one point. However, it seems that for both games, the anniversary celebrations were simply a chance to revisit these classic games through events and new merch. Until an official announcement is made, all fans of both games can do is continue to express their enthusiasm for these classic RPGs to Square Enix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
