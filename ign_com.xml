            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/meet-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pacifist-whos-already-hit-prestige-without-killing-anyone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is a game all about shooting guns and killing other players. At least, that’s how it’s meant to be played. Not for one determined pacifist, however, who has managed to Prestige without killing a single player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Redditor Pilgore revealed his in-game stats after reaching Prestige 1, confirming a remarkable 0.00 K/D after 111 games, or 19 hours and 26 minutes of Multiplayer. That means he managed to gain enough experience to level up past 55 and trigger Prestige despite having zero kills. Perhaps even more remarkable, Pilgore achieved the feat with a 1.92 win ratio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How did Pilgore manage it? Why do this in the first place? And where does he go from here? IGN interviewed Pilgore, real name John, to find out, and obtained permission to publish one of his matches on the Nuketown map to show off his impressive pacifist tactics. Check it out in the video below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Pilgore employs a combination of playing the objective (I know, rare for Call of Duty!), and using the Spy Cam Tactical equipment and Scrambler Field Upgrade to gain score during the match, then calls in the UAV, CUAV, and HARP scorestreaks as they become available. Pilgore also shoots down any enemy scorestreaks as soon as they come in. Pilgore does not shoot at enemy players at any point; rather, he plays Call of Duty like the most useful support class you could ever want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you'd expect, Pilgore has many more victories in objective-based modes such as Hardpoint and Domination than K/D-focused modes such as Team Deathmatch and Kill Confirmed. And if you’re interested in Pilgore1’s Perks, he uses Flak Jacket, Gearhead, and Dispatcher to trigger Strategist, with the Tactical Expert wildcard granting an extra Tactical. "Four Spy Cams can genuinely get you UAV/CUAV on its own," he said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why bother playing Call of Duty as a pacifist? It turns out Pilgore has done this before with previous Call of Duty games, joking with a friend that he could Prestige before him even if he got zero kills on Black Ops Cold War. “I enjoyed playing that way so I just kept on going,” Pilgore said. He managed to hit Prestige 15 on Cold War, 10 on Vanguard and Modern Warfare 2, and 15 on last year’s Modern Warfare 3 playing this way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s one hell of an achievement and shows incredible focus and discipline, but one thing that bothers me about all this is how Pilgore was able to avoid killing an enemy player just once, even accidentally. I play a lot of Call of Duty and I’ve often killed enemy players by mistake, simply by either pressing the wrong button at the wrong time, or having a rocket intended for a scorestreak blow up an enemy player who just happened to get in my way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was definitely risky at the start (previous games) and I got lucky a few times,” Pilgore explained. “I'd throw a Decoy grenade and it would sometimes hit somebody, luckily, it never got me a kill (yet). I've gotten much better at being careful after doing this for 51 Prestiges now. There's almost no worry of it happening this game as the Spy Cam has replaced Decoys for me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pilgore added that he’s been lucky enough not to have an enemy player jump in his crosshairs while he’s shooting down scorestreaks. And it’s worth noting that the player who calls in a scorestreak gets the kills if it crashes down on other players, so there's no danger of an accidental kill there.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/12/ss-ac03caa8430a111c836669ad53651613069a0c67-1920x1080-1731411855835.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pilgore spends a lot of time shooting scorestreaks out of the sky. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I also assumed that it would take an excruciatingly long time to gain enough XP to Prestige while playing as a pacifist, but Pilgore insisted his method is “actually a pretty decent way to get score/XP.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I consistently get at least 7,000 score a match,” he went on. “My tactics haven't really changed over the years. Experimented with different loadouts but the main gameplay has been the same. Earning XP doing this is much better than you'd think.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Keep going until I get a kill or get bored. I have a buttload of patience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The inevitable next question is what’s next for Pilgore? Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his history playing Call of Duty as a pacifist, there’s no turning back now. “Keep going until I get a kill or get bored,” he vowed. “I have a buttload of patience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking on Zombies mode?

This license over product argument will likely be at the crux of Ubisoft's defence.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You never knew that the manufacturer could come in one day, and, without your control, leave you with a skeleton of what you thought you paid for.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Imagine you buy a pinball machine, and years later, you enter your den to go play it, only to discover that the all the paddles are missing, the pinball and bumpers are gone, and the monitor that proudly displayed your unassailable high score is removed," the lawsuit reads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Turns out the pinball machine manufacturer decided to come into your home, gut the insides of the pinball machine, and remove your ability to play the game that you bought and thought you owned. Even though you paid full price to receive this game, you never knew that the manufacturer could come in one day, and, without your control, leave you with a skeleton of what you thought you paid for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-crew-delisted-from-all-digital-storefronts-servers-shut-down-early-2024">The Crew is, indeed, no longer playable.</a> No version of the game, whether it's physical or digital or even if it's owned already and has been since it launched in 2014, can be bought and played in any capacity. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-but-the-original-is-gone-for-good">Ubisoft has taken measures to create offline versions of The Crew 2 and sequel The Crew: Motorfest</a>, but no similar action was taken for the original, rendering it non-existent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lawsuit seeks monetary relief and damages for those impacted by The Crew's shutdown but only time will tell whether it is successful. Ubisoft declined to comment when contacted by Polygon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Storefronts including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-now-warns-customers-theyre-buying-a-license-not-a-game-before-they-continue-to-payment">Steam are now adding an up-front warning to customers that they’re buying a license, not a game</a> ahead of a Californian law going into effect in 2025. The change to Steam came after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/californias-new-law-will-force-storefronts-to-disclose-that-buyers-dont-actually-own-their-digitally-purchased-media">California governor Gavin Newsom signed a law</a> forcing digital marketplaces to make it clear to customers that when they buy media, they only buy a license to that media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that the new law still doesn't prevent companies from yanking your content away from you, but at least they'll have to warn you about the true nature of your purchase before you click that buy button.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Now, years later, it remains on hold, but one Valve developer has given fans a glimpse at what might have been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced during the 2017 Game Awards, In The Valley of Gods is set in Egypt during the late 1920s. It stars Rashida and Zora, a pair of documentary filmmakers who accidentally made it big with a hit movie but have since seen their careers go off a cliff. They reunite years later after receiving information about the lost Tomb of Nefertiti, with a goal of reigniting their careers by documenting their trip to Egypt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve visual effects developer Matt Wilde took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skilful.bsky.social/post/3lakopz32k22x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a> to publish a six second water test created by Camp Santo before the studio’s move to Valve. It shows the player character bobbing in impressively realistic water while looking out from inside a cave at the other protagonist from a first-person perspective. “I do often tend to work on liquidy things,” Wilde said.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Matthew Wilde, the Valve developer behind the water shader for Counter-Strike 2, has shared a rare gameplay footage. It shows the water technology that was tested for In The Valley of Gods before Valve acquired the company Campo Santo. Team shelved the game not so long after… <a href="https://t.co/wIs6Im8KYx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/wIs6Im8KYx</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1855941378301141312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a reference to Wilde’s work on Valve's 2020 virtual reality exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, which caught attention for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-alyx-update-liquid-physics-14">ultra realistic liquid in glass bottles</a>. More recently, Wilde worked on Counter-Strike 2’s water and effects.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Spent a good chunk of lock-down doing this important work. Boozy liquid shader, now available in the latest update for Half-Life: Alyx <a href="https://t.co/Iw9h98pmEg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Iw9h98pmEg</a></p>— Matthew Wilde (@skilful) <a href="https://twitter.com/skilful/status/1265875309980643329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Wilde’s In The Valley of Gods clip obviously sparks questions about whether Camp Santo / Valve will one day return to the game. “To fans looking forward to In The Valley of Gods, it’s probably clear that the optimistic ‘2019’ at the end of the announcement trailer isn’t going to be accurate,” Campo Santo co-founder Jake Rodkin said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/03/in-the-valley-of-gods-on-hold-as-campo-santo-devs-work-on-other-valve-projects">when it was announced that In The Valley of Gods had been put on hold</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the end, Valve Time makes fools of us all. But yes, developers from the former Campo Santo team have joined other projects at Valve, including Half-Life: Alyx.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So to answer your question as of today, In The Valley of Gods development is on hold — but it certainly feels like a project people can and may return to. And when that happens, we’ll find an exciting way to let fans know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/687440/In_The_Valley_of_Gods/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In The Valley of Gods’ Steam page is still live</a> — with a December 2029 release window.
