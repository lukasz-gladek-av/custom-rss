At the bottom of the list is the appropriately-named 'The Final Puzzle' — which is proving to be something of a headscratcher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/resident-evil-requiem/Final_Challenge_Puzzle_Solution">IGN has a work-in-progress guide to The Final Puzzle</a> where significant progress has been made through the challenge's convoluted early stages, which feel more complex than anything seen in any other Resident Evil game to date — and, seemingly, with still some way left to go.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly what the final outcome or reward for the challenge might be remains unknown — but as the game continues its launch around the world, the hunt for answers here will undoubtedly become a major point of community focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's own description for the challenge offers only the vaguest of hints, to "Let the sweet pair hear the voice." The mechanics of the puzzle, or at least its first part, appear to rely on players picking up or examining a variety of objects throughout the game to determine fragments of a code.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Requiem's trail of clues relies on players picking up a specific severed hand which, if obtained, can also be scanned later on to provide a hidden RNA code in a blood sample analysis machine. Other items also hide their own codes, providing (with a bit more puzzling work) a version of that RNA sequence that can be plugged into a safe that features buttons labelled with a Star, Sun and Moon. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem Review Screens</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After that... well, it's here the trail has gone cold, though likely not for long. We'll be keeping an eye on further progress made throughout the next few days, as players uncover further steps. For now, however, it's just fun to see that the game hides this kind of puzzle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a far more granular look at each step to-date, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/resident-evil-requiem/Final_Challenge_Puzzle_Solution">IGN's work-in-progress guide to The Final Puzzle</a> is right here.

The reason is that Space Marine 2’s engagement distances and recoil are extremely low, while average enemy size is rather big. It's very difficult to completely miss your enemies. This is why the only skill element of ranged combat is to aim for the head, and this is why head shots are so important for bolt weapons.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>That being said, I agree that we've overtuned headshots way too much, especially with how different perks and multipliers stack with each other. We will reduce the gap between body shots and head shots. But it's not going to be as easy as applying this perk by default to everybody. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We need to adjust base damage of all bolter weapons and then adjust damage sensitivity on all enemies and do it case by case.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem has finally arrived, ready to provide you with hours and hours of survival horror action, in which you can test your mettle as both Grace Ashcroft and Leon S. Kennedy. Much like its modern predecessors, Requiem boasts a reasonably stacked campaign, but just how long is it? Here, we’ll let you know exactly how many hours it took different members of the IGN team to finish the game, and what they prioritised doing with that time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Long is Resident Evil Requiem?</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Our fastest player finished the game in <strong>4.5 hours</strong>.</li><li>Our “slowest” player finished the game in <strong>16 hours</strong>.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone plays games differently, so read on for more details about how everyone played, how long it took to reach the credits, and how much extra time players spent exploring. Once you've finished the game yourself, be sure to submit your times on our sister website, <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/169267" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>How Long To Beat</u></a>, and see how your time compares!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem Review Screens</h3></div></span></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Jesse Gomez - Senior Video Producer </h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Completion Time: 8 hours and 59 minutes on Standard (Modern) / 4 hours and 38 minutes on Insanity.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shy of just under nine hours, my first playthrough of Resident Evil Requiem consisted of meticulously hunting down every single Mr. Raccoon collectable, reading as many files as I could (I missed just three of the 75 available to find), and relishing in the blood-soaked glory of Leon's vast, yet costly arsenal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I wasn't so engrossed by exploring every nook and cranny of the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center and beyond for secrets, I'm sure I could’ve shaved an hour or two off my playtime. For my second playthrough, though, I cut that time practically in half. I dove into a run on Insanity difficulty right after hitting credits and, armed with knowledge of objectives and environment layouts from my first playthrough, I blitzed through it all in just over four hours and a half hours. Such speed does come with some hiccups, though; to Grace's dismay, I did get munched on a few times by the many monstrosities that stalk the care centers' halls. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dale Driver -  Associate Director, Video Programming</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Completion Time: 16 hours on Standard (Modern)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I hit credits 16 hours into my playthrough of Resident Evil Requiem after choosing what I assume to be the “good” ending! I played through the game on the standard modern difficulty; the hardest option available out of the gate that doesn’t demand you deal with Ink Ribbons taking up inventory space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was quite thorough during my playthrough, making sure I got all the antique coins and all the safes' codes, and generally trying not to leave anything behind. When I got to Raccoon City later in the game, I spent a decent amount of time revisiting the classic locations and soaking up the nostalgia. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did have an advantage that many first-time players won’t have, which I assume might have cut an hour or two from my playthrough. I’d previously played through the majority of the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center section for IGN’s preview of Resident Evil Requiem, so when it came to that section I already knew what I needed to find and where it was hidden. That certainly sped up the early hours for me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, I’ve only finished the game once, but I definitely plan to dive back in for an Insanity run and see what I missed!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Tristan Ogilvie - Senior Video Editor + Reviewer</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Completion Time: 10 hours on Standard (Modern)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It took me just over 10 hours to roll credits on Resident Evil Requiem, however that was to arrive at the shorter and what I consider to be the worse of its two possible endings. Man, I hate that ending so much! So, I immediately reloaded my save game to play through the other, better, ending, which added close to another 30 minutes onto my playtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I opted to play Requiem on the Standard (Modern) difficulty setting, mainly because I didn’t want to be restricted to using ink ribbons in order to save my game during Grace’s sections like you are on the Standard (Classic) setting. As the parent of two young kids who are liable to disrupt me at any moment and for no good reason, I need to have the ability to save my game without any restrictions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, I am now playing a second time through on Standard (Classic) and taking my time with it a bit more. I’ve still got a number of small things like notes and Mr. Raccoon bobbleheads to track down, as well as a few areas here and there tucked away in the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center that I didn’t fully explore the first time through. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m too much of a coward to tackle the game a third time on the Insanity difficulty setting, however if Capcom ends up adding a Mercenaries mode to Requiem at a later date I’ll come charging back harder than a zombie chef with the smell of blood in his nostrils. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Matt Purslow - Executive Editor of Features</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Completion Time: 11 Hours on Standard (Modern)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I completed Resident Evil Requiem in exactly 11 hours. And, if you’re planning to do a pretty “regular” playthrough, I expect you’ll clock up a similar playtime. While I didn’t scour every last corner, bookshelf, and drawer for the most fiendishly hidden treasures and lore drops, I was reasonably thorough in my exploration of the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center and the locations that await beyond it. I scavenged enough currency to buy a healthy selection of upgrades, ensuring both Grace and Leon were well equipped for the dangers they faced, but by the time credits rolled there were still guns that could be further modified and stats that could be improved. I unlocked some safes, but there are still several left to crack in a second playthrough. I read plenty of documents, and so learned many of the story’s extra details, but there are still mysteries to be solved by finding the papers I missed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">11 hours is pretty typical for a Resident Evil game, but relatively slender compared to many of today’s massive, RPG-style games, and so a second playthrough is certainly on the cards. I not only plan to gather what I missed, but also play with the opposite perspectives of Requiem’s default set up – I’m excited to see what exploring Rhodes Hill as Grace in third person is like, and taking on Leon’s sections as a first-person shooter. That’ll surely clock up another dozen hours. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Brian Altano - Executive Producer</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Completion Time: 12 Hours on Standard (Classic)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It took me around 12 and a half hours to beat Resident Evil Requiem on the Standard (Classic) difficulty setting, in which Leon can save the game infinitely at pretty much every save station, while Grace needs to find (or craft) limited, finite ink ribbons, just like in the classic Resident Evil games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a huge fan of the series and I had a hunch I’d like this game, but I didn’t expect to practically adore it. I found myself exploring every inch of it for secrets, collectibles, easter eggs, and more. Ultimately I missed a few on my first run through the game, but then immediately started a second and third playthrough after initially rolling credits the first time in an effort to find everything. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some really fun post-game options tied to beating the campaign with specific parameters (like finishing it without using a single healing item), plus a couple of other little challenges I’m excited to try. There’s one specific Mr. Raccoon bobblehead I definitely wouldn’t have found without the help of IGN’s guides guru, Brendan Graeber, so if you’re a completionist who doesn’t want to miss anything on your first trek through the story, be sure to give our walkthrough a look. Then there’s the unlockable “Insanity” difficulty that I absolutely can’t wait to repeatedly get my butt kicked in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, I’ll probably put about 40 hours into Resident Evil Requiem, a number that will only go up if Capcom decides to add a Mercenaries mode and additional story DLC post launch. I really love this game!</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-long-is-resident-evil-requiem]]></content:encoded>
