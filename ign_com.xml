            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-full-release-schedule-2026">Pokémon Day 2026</a> is a particularly special celebration for fans, as it's officially the 30th anniversary of the famous Red and Blue release in Japan in 1996. There's plenty of excitement going into the day, which also makes it one of the best times to check out the best deals on everything Pokémon. </p><p id="tldr-best-deals-today"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="TL;DR - Best Deals Today"><strong>TL;DR: The Best Pokémon Day Deals</strong></h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether that's restocks or price reductions on the latest and greatest Pokémon TCG releases, or some sizable discounts for almost every Pokémon game on Nintendo Switch - I've done the hard work for you, and found the best offerings available today. </p><p id="pokmon-tcg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG">Pokémon TCG: Restocks and Best Prices</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Quite surprisingly, there's actually a whole lot of great Pokémon TCG restocks and deals available right now online, with Amazon having some of the best around. The online retailer has gone through something of a massive restocking mission this week, and at just the right time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pokémon Day Finds at Amazon</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest highlights from Amazon's selection include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qb8xdJ?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ascended Heroes - Elite Trainer Box</a>, now available and in stock for trainers to freely buy. It's matching market price, at $119,99 as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QV5X2x?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pokémon Day 2026 Collection</a>, which, considering the ongoing 30th anniversary celebration, should absolutely be at the top of your buy list right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides those standouts, I also wanted to highlight the Prismatic Evolution themed <a href="https://zdcs.link/ak1K3X?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pokémon Day 2025 collection</a> that released last year. Listed for $40.64, Amazon has recently restocked the special edition set.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It includes two Prismatic boosters, a special metallic Eevee coin, and a foil Eevee card that features a unique Pokémon Day 2025 logo. That's absolutely worth picking up alongside the new 2026 collection, if I say so myself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also want to call out availability on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q451rd?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phantasmal Flames - Three Pack Blister</a>, for $32, alongside the Mega Lucario ex Figure Collection, and several of the Scarlet &amp; Violet Unova series, like the Poster Box, Tins, and Illustration Collection. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pokémon Day Finds at TCGplayer</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGplayer has also pulled out all the stops for Pokémon Day, and has several of the most popular Pokémon TCG sets in stock and at market price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of sealed sets, I want to highlight the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-perfect-order-sealed-products-are-up-for-preorder-at-tcgplayer">Perfect Order booster boxes</a>, which are currently available for <a href="https://zdcs.link/z642Ll?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$201.18 market price at TCGplayer</a>. That's a remarkably good price for the upcoming set releasing on March 27, and probably one of the best deals I've seen all year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring 36 booster packs, you're looking at about $5.50 per pack, which is as close to MSRP as I think we're ever going to get. Compare this to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOjbY8?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phantasmal Flames booster boxes</a>, which are currently going for $320 or more, this is a huge saving. I'd snap this up ASAP before prices spike again as we get closer to release day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My next best suggestion is to consider The Pokémon Center Exclusive Ascended Heroes ETB, which is currently available for just <a href="https://zdcs.link/zE8lvM?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$246.84 market price at TCGplayer</a>. Considering this was selling for $400 just a few weeks back, I'd consider this one of the best deals available right now for the biggest Pokémon TCG fans out there.</p><p id="nintendo-switch-games"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Nintendo Switch Games">Nintendo Switch Games on Sale Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon’s Woot store has been known to offer a bunch of deals in the past, but it might just have outdone itself this time around with its <a href="https://zdcs.link/ak1K2w?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">brand new "Video Games For All!" sale</a> that includes a whole slew of Pokémon games on Nintendo Switch. Just use promo code LEVEL20 to access the new bargains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest standout is on Legends Z-A, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrJXRm?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>which is down just $35.92 on Nintendo Switch</u></a>. IGN's Rebekah Valentine gave the game an 8 out of 10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review"><u>in her review last year</u></a>, saying “Pokémon Legends: Z-A finally feels like Game Freak hitting its stride in Pokémon’s 3D era, with a fun setting to explore, a well-written story, and a total battle system overhaul that works surprisingly well.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can upgrade to the Switch 2 version digitally as well for just $10 after making your purchase, making this a certified bargain. But, and this is a big but, these are certified Pokémon Day deals that <em>will </em>expire by the end of today (February 27, 11:59 PM CT, to be exact). So, act fast to avoid disapointment.</p><p id="funkos-toys-and-plushies"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Funkos, Toys, and Plushies">Pokémon Funkos, Toys and Plushies</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I couldn't wrap things up without at least mentioning several amazing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-plushies">Pokémon plushies</a> that are on sale at Amazon right now. That includes an adorable and <em>massive </em><a href="https://zdcs.link/98A4vL?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">20-Inch Torchic Squishmallow</a> that's down to just $30.99, which is lowest price in the past 30 days. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a great deal on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB8glE?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lugia</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ZA1Ev?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Snorlax 12-Inch plushies</a>, which are just perfect, and also at 30 day price lows right now at $22.99 each (down from $34.99).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also worth mentioning the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-pokemon-funko-pops-are-up-for-preorder-at-amazon-2026">brand new lineup of Pokémon Funkos</a>. A select few are now available, while several others are still up for preorder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some bangers in here as well: an angry, electricity-summoning Pikachu, an angry, vine-summoning Venusaur, and more.

There’s an adorable <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOjKoB?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eevee</a>, a dynamic <a href="https://zdcs.link/z645Ek?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pikachu</a>, and a pricy (yet incredible) set depicting <a href="https://zdcs.link/aR75m4?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise</a>. All sets are now back in stock and available to purchase, exclusively at the LEGO Store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite from this is definitely on the Eevee LEGO set. This LEGO version is definitely going to be popular, so I'd snap it up ASAP before it sells out again fast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-pokemon-eevee-set-72151">built this set</a> as well, so you can check out our full impressions over there. Long story short, it's a gorgeously designed set that manages to turn a pile of blocks into a smooth and fluffy-looking critter. In addition to the loveliness of this set, the price is right as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Pokémon's 30th Anniversary celebrations, be sure to check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-pokemon-video-games">roundup on best Pokémon games of all time</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is IGN's Senior Commerce Editor and resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.
