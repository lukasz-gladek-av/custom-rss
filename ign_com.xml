HAS. COME.</blockquote><blockquote>A daemon-engine of unspeakable horror, an abomination of iron and heresy, a thing that should not be, and yet ‚Äî here it is.</blockquote><blockquote>The warp has opened, and it has delivered unto us something far worse than any Black Crusade.</blockquote><blockquote>üî•üöÇ THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE IS READY FOR WAR. üöÇüî•</blockquote><blockquote>His whistle drowns out the cries of the fallen.</blockquote><blockquote>His smile is an unblinking omen of annihilation.</blockquote><blockquote>The Emperor weeps.

To put it in other words, Cena, the WWE's superstar ‚Äògood guy,‚Äô the Make-A-Wish world record holder and all-round much-loved wrestler and actor, became a WWE ‚Äòbad guy‚Äô before we got GTA 6.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/03/gettyimages-2202199096-1740999762452.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">For the first time in over 20 years, John Cena is a WWE bad guy.

No, that doesn‚Äôt mean Cena has just leaked his role in GTA 6 (although wouldn‚Äôt that be something!). Rather, he‚Äôs just leaning into the meme for a bit of social media fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it‚Äôs clear that Cena‚Äôs a GTA 6 memer at this point, there‚Äôs still some speculation that his Instagram post is some cryptic hint about the game itself.
