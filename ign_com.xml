But in its recent financial report, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record">Microsoft sounded delighted with Black Ops 6’s early days performance</a>, saying sales on PlayStation and PC were 60% higher compared to the 2023 release of Modern Warfare 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes were on Black Ops 6’s impact on Game Pass, though. Growth in Microsoft’s subscription service has stalled in recent years, and the day one release of the latest entry in Activision’s phenomenally successful first-person shooter series was seen as a make or break moment for Game Pass.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has yet to say exactly how many new subscribers Black Ops 6 brought through the door, although CEO Satya Nadella has confirmed that Game Pass set a record for new subs on launch day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cev90rmyel2o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, Treyarch associate creative director Miles Leslie, who has worked on Call of Duty for 16 years, said Black Ops 6’s release on Game Pass has helped convince players who were “on the fence” to give the game a shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we've seen is it's allowed people that might have been on the fence, might have had some of that friction, might have been like, 'I haven't played in a while' to actually come back and try the game," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That will be music to Microsoft’s ears, given it’s desperate to expand the Call of Duty audience in the long term. Analysts have suggested the company was willing to sacrifice Black Ops 6 launch sales on Xbox for a potential bigger overall player base, which it intends to monetize long-term with the release of battle passes and cosmetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've gotten to the point now where Black Ops and Call of Duty have been around so long - I've been working on it for 16 years," Leslie added. "And really the challenge for us is how do you bring along the fans that love Call of Duty, but how do you create an environment where you can welcome new fans in?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trick now of course is to convince Game Pass players to stick around and keep paying that monthly subscription. To that end, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-revealed-details-on-maps-weapons-and-more">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> kicks off on November 14, and we’ve got all the details.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-mod-solves-one-of-the-games-biggest-problems<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Tactical download.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> modders have made significant progress improving the game, even solving one of its biggest problems since launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since Space Marine 2’s record-breaking launch in September, players have faced the prospect of awkwardness before they set out on a co-op mission — awkwardness that makes simply playing the class you want more frustrating than it should be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 includes three-player co-op missions as part of Operations mode. These co-op missions are set during the game’s campaign, but with different characters who are off doing other missions that tie in to the events that follow main character Titus.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Operations mode restricts a squad to one Space Marine of each class. So, for example, it is impossible to have an all-sniper team (developer Saber has said this is a deliberate design decision to encourage “strategic variety.”)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is Space Marine 2 will actively matchmake you into a group with a player who is the same class as the one you have selected. In-game, there is an area of the Battle Barge where players must “assemble” before an Operations mode mission kicks off. The countdown only begins when all three players have selected a different class. This means <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-having-awkward-pre-mission-standoffs-because-two-of-the-same-class-cant-play-together">you can end up in awkward standoffs where two or more players want to be the same class</a>, each waiting for the other to blink first and switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a frustration that often bubbles up on Space Marine 2 Discords, subreddits, and on social media as players work to level up certain classes above others. Staff at Saber have said class matching is on the cards, but modders have already gone one step further and removed the class limits in Operations mode entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Astartes Overhaul, from Tom, aka Warhammer Workshop, is perhaps the most significant mod yet for Space Marine 2. This massive upgrade to Space Marine 2 gameplay, available to download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40000spacemarine2/mods/89" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus</a>, lets players select any squad configuration without class restrictions, among many other changes that affect the balance of Operations mode. So, if you want an all-sniper team, you can have it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/sm2-1731072484969.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Space Marine 2 modders have unlocked customization options currently unavailable otherwise.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Remarkably, the changes Space Marine 2 mods make to the Space Marines themselves, whether it’s a purely aesthetic customization not normally possible or certain classes using weapons and equipment they’re not supposed to, can be seen online by other players in public PvE sessions. While Space Marine 2 uses dedicated servers, a lot of the game elements are client-side controlled. So if you’re playing with random players, there’s a chance you might see things like Bulwarks wielding Thunder Hammers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-update-40-secretly-clamped-down-on-pvp-modding-publisher-confirms-but-doesnt-have-a-problem-with-pve-modding">Space Marine 2 publisher Focus Entertainment has confirmed to IGN that it has no problem whatsoever with PvE modding</a>, but Tom is playing it safe. He recommends those who use the Astartes Overhaul mod stick to private lobbies “to minimize disruption to other players' games.” “Keeping the Overhaul in private lobbies helps ensure a positive experience for all players,” he continued. “Your support in keeping things balanced is hugely appreciated!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No class limits in Operations isn’t all the Astartes Overhaul mod does. It even adds allied reinforcements to the Operations missions. This means you’ll encounter various allies who bring fresh support to each mission, including Imperial Guard soldiers, Space Marines, and even Dreadnoughts.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/emblems-1731072535187.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Astartes Overhaul adds new Chapter emblems for Warhammer 40,000 lore fans to tinker with.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the mod adds a ton of new Chapter emblems, an expanded arsenal of weapons for each operator, an expanded enemy roster (including early access to a new enemy type), “lore accurate” weapon buffs (“Bolters and other iconic weapons have been rebalanced for that real 40K punch”), new mid-operation checkpoints, new takedown animations, and new Retributor cosmetics and customizable Mark 8 armor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The addition of Retributor cosmetics is notable because the Loyalist Space Marine Chapter starred in Syama Pederson’s much-loved fan-made YouTube video series Astartes. Speaking to IGN last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-developer-used-the-best-warhammer-40000-fan-film-ever-as-a-reference-point">Saber creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick namechecked Astartes as his favorite reference point for the look of the game's Space Marines</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He got the sound of them walking down those corridors… ker-klonk, ker-klonk-ker-klonk… but when they move it’s straight away like they’re predatory animals," Hollis-Leick said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels"><u>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</u></a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

That’s a “significant increase” of 12% year-on-year, Sony said. Profit tripled to 138.8 billion yen (approx $911 million), up a whopping 184% year-on-year. Those positive results were good enough for Sony to raise its financial year forecast for its gaming business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony said the boost to revenue came from an increase in sales of non-first-party games, including add-on content (like microtransactions), as well as the impact of foreign exchange rates and an increase in sales from network services, mainly from PlayStation Plus. (Sony gets a cut of all sales on the PlayStation Store, and of course generates revenue from sales away from its platform, such as Steam.) Dragging those sales down, however, was the continued fall of PS5 sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the operating income side, Sony said it had seen an improvement in hardware profitability (typically consoles are sold at a loss), as well as the aforementioned increase in sales of third-party games and network services.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony sold another 3.8 million PS5 units during the quarter, down 29% compared to the same period last year. The four-year-old console is now on 65.5 million shipped, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-entering-the-latter-stage-of-its-life-cycle-sony-says">Sony recently admitting the PS5 is in the second half of its life cycle</a>.

That’s enough to put Black Myth: Wukong up there with Grand Theft Auto 5 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as one of the fastest-selling games of all time, and is an astonishing return for a game that had a reported budget of $70 million over six years of development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord, a live service hero shooter from Sony-owned Firewalk Studios, followed on August 23, but flopped spectacularly. Amid disastrously low player numbers, Sony hauled Concord offline just two weeks after launch. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">It eventually shuttered Firewalk and confirmed Concord wouldn’t return</a>.

In February, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close"><u>Sony announced a round of layoffs</u></a> affecting 900 staff, or about 8% of its global PlayStation workforce. The layoffs impacted a number of PlayStation studios, including Insomniac, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, and Firesprite, but PlayStation's London studio was hit hardest with a notice of closure. Since then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio"><u>Sony-owned Bungie has also suffered devastating cuts</u></a> as Destiny 2 struggles to find commercial success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has just released the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, a $700 mid-gen upgrade that boosts the graphics and performance of PS4 and PS5 games. Amid a quiet time for first-party launches (Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Yōtei is slated for release in 2025), Sony will benefit from upcoming third-party games Monster Hunter Wilds and Rockstar’s guaranteed megahit GTA 6, which parent company Take-Two recently insisted was still on track for a fall 2025 release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
