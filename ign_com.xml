It’s an especially enticing reveal, as the PC Game Pass version of GTA 5 comes with that all-new Enhanced update Rockstar dropped in early March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No matter what version you’re playing, everyone will have access to <em>Oscar Guzman Flies Again</em>, the latest update where you can take to the skies — taking control of the McKenzie Field Hanger in Grapeseed,” an official description from Xbox explained. “Play new arms trafficking missions, fly new aircraft, and more.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its arrival in two Tuesdays will mark a triumphant return to Game Pass after Rockstar’s open-world masterpiece was previously removed from the service. However, while the addition will mark the title's first time on PC Game Pass, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows as far as many die-hard GTA fans are concerned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-online-on-pc-is-finally-catching-up-with-console-versions"><u>GTA 5 Enhanced arrived on PC March 4</u></a> as a free update, bringing access to all the latest vehicles, performance upgrades in Hao’s Special Works, animal encounters, and visual bumps.

If you’re returning to the world of GTA 5 Online and looking to migrate your account over to that shiny new Enhanced upgrade, you might find yourself out of luck. For now, it appears the issues with account migration are still ongoing.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA 5 and GTA Online</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, we’re still waiting for any news about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>Grand Theft Auto 6</u></a>.

Alongside the in-game upgrades, Nintendo's adding a number of additional features through the new Zelda Notes option in its Nintendo Switch App, including achievements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch App (formerly known as the Nintendo Switch Online App) will get an update adding Zelda Notes, a game-specific service exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 versions of both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This app was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games">shown off in the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, allowing players to use GPS-style navigation to reach landmarks in the Zelda games. For achievements, the app will track your play data and allow players to earn in-app medals based on their records. These account for opening chests, earning rupees, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the Achievements section, Nintendo lists categories such as "Quests and Adventures Cleared," "Shrines of Light Cleared," "Locations Visited," "Lightroots Unlocked," and others. Alongside tracking those numbers, the app will also let you see how you match up with other players on a global scale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the achievements seem geared towards completion, it's interesting to see Nintendo experiment with these options. Granted, they exist in a phone app rather than on the Switch 2 console by itself, but I am curious to see whether other games get similar treatments in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other features of the Zelda Notes app include a Daily Bonus option for helpful resources, a Voice Memories section which adds more story and lore to the world as you explore, and an Autobuild Sharing tool. These do seem like handy tools, and especially geared towards people playing through this Zelda duology for the second time on their Nintendo Switch 2.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 has a launch date set for June 5, 2025.
