            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch 2 owners will be able to take upcoming Nintendo exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> for a test run next month — but only with an active Switch Online subscription. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning, Nintendo confirmed a two-day Drag x Drive "Global Jam" event on August 9 and 10, the weekend before the game's August 14 arrival. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To date, Nintendo has said surprisingly little about Drag x Drive, which is set to follow Donkey Kong Bananza as the company's next <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/platform/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive. A multiplayer sports game with mouse controls, the game has only been briefly glimpsed so far — despite it launching in less than a month.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Eager to hit the court in Drag x Drive? Get a sneak peek with the Drag x Drive: Global Jam demo event!" Nintendo wrote today, announcing the game's upcoming public trial. "This event takes place on August 9 and 10, exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 for Nintendo Switch Online members."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're interested, you'll be able to download and try the game's Global Jam demo between 3am and 7am Pacific, then 5pm and 9pm Pacific on August 9, plus 9am and 1pm Pacific on August 10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Drag x Drive is a multiplayer-focused experience, some fans have said it is surprising to see the game's demo limited to those with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. There is no local multiplayer option within the game, Nintendo has previously noted, but surely the company would want this demo to be available to as large a Switch 2 audience as possible?</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Eager to hit the court in Drag x Drive? Get a sneak peek with the Drag x Drive: Global Jam demo event!</p><p>This event takes place on Aug 9 and 10, exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 for Nintendo Switch Online members. <a href="https://t.co/1OVNAHdC3u" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1OVNAHdC3u</a></p></div>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1945287268748361864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">A previous demo for the game, available to play as part of the Switch 2's in-person pre-release events, revealed Drag x Drive to be a three-versus-three sports title with gameplay similar to wheelchair basketball. Players must propel themselves across the game's neon courts and perform a throwing action in order to pass the ball, or shoot it at a basketball hoop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly which modes will be available in the full game, or indeed this Global Jam offering, remain to be seen. Nintendo has however said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-drag-x-drive-has-a-release-date-but-no-price-so-far">Drag x Drive will be a budget price release</a>, costing $19.99 / £16.99, and an eShop-only digital title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before all that, Nintendo's blockbuster Donkey Kong Bananza is due to arrive later this week. Yesterday, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-donkey-kong-bananza-would-have-looked-as-a-switch-1-game">Nintendo gave fans a rare peek behind its development curtain</a> with a glimpse at how the game would have looked on Switch 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

I've listened to it several times this morning and can report that, annoyingly, they've made it even more catchy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-blows-past-700-million-at-the-box-office-in-its-quest-to-be-the-highest-grossing-video-game-film-ever">breakout box office run in theaters</a> that saw A Minecraft Movie notch up (no pun intended) $955 million, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-block-party-edition-to-double-down-on-memes-with-sing-along-theatrical-release-in-may">launch of a special singalong version of the film</a>, Steve's Lava Chicken found its own fame by becoming the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jack-blacks-steves-lava-chicken-song-from-a-minecraft-movie-officially-hits-the-billboard-100-charts-the-shortest-ever">shortest-ever track to make the coveted US Billboard Hot 100 Chart</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Minecraft has released a remixed version of the viral Lava Chicken song from the movie <a href="https://t.co/gQER36wTTF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gQER36wTTF</a></p>— barry scott (@barryscott33338) <a href="https://twitter.com/barryscott33338/status/1945093537701220662?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">At just 34 seconds, the song — which boasts deep lyrics like "la-la-la-lava ch-ch-ch-chicken" — was written by Black and the film’s director Jared Hess, and marks the second video game movie appearance by Black to feature a breakout song, after his turn belting out "Peaches" as Bowser in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie">Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Months after the end of A Minecraft Movie's theatrical run, it seems there's never going to be an escape from Steve's Lava Chicken.
