            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-fans-are-doing-a-gta-6-and-losing-their-minds-over-hidden-half-life-3-clues-they-desperately-want-to-be-real<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life fans have waited years for Valve to do… something <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-3">Half-Life 3</a> related. That’s nothing new. But recent weeks have seen a step up in the hunt for clues, with some believing Valve has already started an elaborate alternate reality game (ARG) that will lead to the dramatic confirmation that Half-Life 3 is finally on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This next level obsession, which GTA 6 fans will find instantly familiar, was kickstarted by Mike Shapiro, the voice actor behind Half-Life's mysterious G-Man. Late last year, in full G-Man mode, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-rumors-ramp-up-after-g-man-voice-actor-issues-cryptic-tweet-his-first-in-years">Shapiro published a cryptic tweet teasing some sort of news for 2025 alongside the tags #Valve, #Halflife, #GMan, and #2025</a>. It was Shapiro’s first non-reply tweet since he congratulated Valve on the success of VR exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-alyx"><u>Half-Life: Alyx</u></a> back in December 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was enough to send the rumor-mill into overdrive, but since then all sorts of wild theories have emerged within the Half-Life community. Some who have analyzed Shapiro’s tweet to within an inch of its life believe he has started an ARG for Half-Life 3, connecting the dots in such a way to lead them to the ultimate prize in video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life fans obsess about numbers. Valve, famously, can’t count to three. But can it count to 197? It turns out that Shapiro’s X/Twitter post contained images of the cover art of his new song, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tYRar01hCM?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Long Dog</a>. Buried within this image is the number 197. Bizarre!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/10/longdog-1736528102368.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">197! What does it mean? Image credit: Mike Shapiro - Topic / YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Best Long Dog is three minutes and 17 seconds long, aka 197 seconds long, because of course it is. Oh, and it came out 197 days after his previous song, Magnetic North. Weird!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s where the Half-Life community really steps up to the plate. Some fans theorize 197 is a reference to gold, or, more specifically, its stable isotope 197Au. This is Half-Life, after all! What’s gold got to do with anything? GoldSrc, pronounced "Gold Source,” is the original Half-Life engine. Eventually it was replaced by the Source engine, but the link is clear. Oh yeah, gold only has a single stable isotope, which means 197Au is the only gold isotope with no half-life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The plot thickens. 197 appears three times in relation to Shapiro: in the cover art of his song, in the length of the song, and in the days after the release of his previous song. Three times! Could 197 hint at a date? Some think so. Perhaps it’s July 19?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we move on to fellow Valve game Counter-Strike 2, and what some believe to be hints at Half-Life 3 in the game. Remember we told you Shapiro’s song is called Best Long Dog? Valve renamed the Popdog hallway in map de_train to "Longdog."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot more to this apparent ARG, including even more numbers and people drawing lines in the snow. But the long and short of it is that Shapiro’s tweet, combied with changes to Counter-Strike 2, mysterious references to a dog and the number 197 are fuelling one of the most popcorn-worthy community obsessions since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect">GTA 6 fans started analyzing phases of the moon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1hy21ov/weve_lost_our_collective_minds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor emsollas summed up the sentiment</a>. "I think we’re so starved with real information on our beloved HL3 (or even the notion of Episode 3) that we’re literally seeing signs where there are none," they said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yes Shapiro’s post is definitely leading, and there maybe something coming. But breaking down every bit of info and finding the 197 and trying to connect it is just... lunacy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Half-Life 3 does not exist, despite the story ending on a cliffhanger with 2007’s Half-Life 2 Episode 2. In November, to mark Half-Life 2's 20th anniversary, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/never-before-seen-half-life-2-episode-3-gameplay-footage-and-ice-gun-revealed-in-new-documentary"><u>Valve opened up about its development</u></a> in a documentary that revealed never-before-seen work-in-progress footage, a brand-new Ice Gun, and a raft of new concept art. You can see the gameplay segment from the documentary in the video below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the details shown in the video, Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic, and it would have focused on Alyx as a companion character. Aside from the Ice Gun, the footage shows a blob-like enemy that could split into multiple parts. According to the documentary, the team had completed a "collection of playable levels in no particular order" and expected to be able to release the game within a year or two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve has plenty on its plate already, of course, including ongoing support of Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, Steam itself, the Steam Deck, and new game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deadlock"><u>Deadlock</u></a>. Could it also be working on Half-Life 3 alongside all those other projects?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

There’s multiple collaboration events, free recruitment opportunities, a new version of a popular character, new story content, and in-person experiences.</p>If you haven’t checked out Goddess of Victory: Nikke yet, it’s a free-to-play sci-fi RPG shooter from developer Shift Up that’s available for download on iOS, Android, and PC. You’re in charge of a group of android soldiers called Nikke and lead them in a fierce battle to reclaim the overworld from a vicious race of aliens called Raptures.<p data-cy="paragraph">The game has been a resounding success, recently celebrating its second anniversary as well as reaching 45 million downloads worldwide. Throughout its two years, it has collaborated with several renowned IPs, including Neon Genesis Evangelion, Chainsaw Man, Nier: Automata, Re:Zero Starting Life in Another World, and Dave the Diver. That tradition continues in 2025, with Shift Up recently announcing a collaboration with Stellar Blade as well as a second collaboration with Evangelion.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/45m-celebratory-1920x1080-en-1735928143021.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stellar Blade collab will unite two popular games developed by Shift Up. Stellar Blade is an action-adventure game available on PS5 that shares a similar setting with Goddess of Victory: Nikke. You play as Eve, and your mission is to reclaim Earth from monsters called Naytibas after humans lost their battle against them and were forced to flee the planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Evangelion collab arrives in February and will feature loads of new content. It will add two brand-new recruitable SSR characters, named Asuka: WILLE and Rei Ayanami (Tentative Name), and Sakura will be a free-to-obtain collaboration character. Plus, there will be new collaboration character costumes (including free-to-obtain costumes), a new 3D event map, new collaboration event storyline, and a new bullet hell minigame.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These two collabs are the biggest events on the horizon, but they’re not the only updates to come to Goddess of Victory: Nikke. Things got started on the first day of the year, with the addition of a new recruitable version of Rapi, the game’s heroine. Called Rapi: Red Hood, she’s an awakened form of Rapi who has taken on the power of another strong Nikke called Red Hood. The new version of Rapi is an SSR Nikke, the highest rarity in the game. Rapi’s upgraded variant was also accompanied by new events that delve deeper into her story for the first time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The start of the new year has also brought events that reward players with free chances to recruit characters. With the new events and story content, you can earn more than 100 recruitment opportunities in all. That gives newcomers or players who haven’t played in a while a chance to jump in and hit the ground running. Plus, the recruitment banner featuring popular character Scarlet: Black Shadow from last year’s New Year event will make a return.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/rewards-1735928173140.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The new year celebrations have also been happening in the real world, and that will continue with a pair of live concerts in Japan and South Korea. Called Melodies of Victory, the concert will first visit Pacifico Yokohama National Convention Hall in Japan on January 11. It’ll then move on to Kyung Hee University Grand Peace Palace in Seoul, South Korea on February 15.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/concert-kv-en-1735928267895.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For tickets and more information, you can visit the official websites for the <a href="https://nikke-concert.jp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese concert</u></a> and the <a href="https://nikke-concert.kr/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Korean concert</u></a>.
