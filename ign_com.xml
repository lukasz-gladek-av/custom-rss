            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With a week to go until the official launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, fans have issued a warning over online spoilers, as datamined details from the game have begun to leak online — including word of even more new Mega Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends Z-A is due to launch on October 16 for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, but already there's evidence of early copies filtering out into the wild. And now, as of this morning, IGN has seen evidence that the game is actively being datamined to extract its secrets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To date, The Pokémon Company has revealed just a handful of the new Mega Pokémon expected to make up the game's final roster of fresh Mega species. And while an older leak had listed out many of the still-to-be-confirmed Mega Evolutions, there's evidence today that even more creatures may be included than first expected.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In response to all this, Pokémon fans have now begun signalling that anyone hoping to go into Pokémon Legends: Z-A without seeing spoilers should be mindful of where they click online over the next few days — or log off social media completely. (IGN will not be spoiling any of the new species here.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in Kalos, home of the Mega Pokémon mechanic, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-new-mega-pokmon-announced-for-pokmon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A adds the first new batch of superpowered creatures to the franchise's Mega Pokédex in over a decade</a>, although no all-new Pokémon species are expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New Mega Evolutions include the majestic-looking Mega Dragonite — which has also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mega-pokmon-gets-surprise-anime-appearance-months-before-debut-in-pokmon-legends-z-a">now made its Pokémon anime debut</a> — plus Mega Victreebell, Mega Hawlucha and Mega Malamar. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">New Mega Pokemon in Legends: Z-A</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Post-launch, Pokémon Legends: Z-A will unlock Mega Evolutions for each of the three fully-evolved Starter Pokémon, available via online play: Delphox, Greninja and Chesnaught. And beyond that, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-getting-dlc-starring-mega-raichu">you can already buy Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Mega Dimension</a>, a paid DLC which will add two new Mega Evolutions for Raichu. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-as-30-mega-dimension-dlc-pushes-price-of-owning-every-new-mega-evolution-to-100-on-nintendo-switch-2">fans have complained about the costs of obtaining every Mega Pokémon announced so far</a>, something which requires more than $100 to obtain the base game, DLC and a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How many other new Mega Evolutions will Pokémon Legends: Z-A include? We're about to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

And just like the game that inspired it, you get six guesses to solve the five-letter word. As the mod description confirms, it's the same word for everyone, so "don't be a gonk, keep your streak alive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best bit, however, is not that you get two chances to play a Wordle-type game per day, but that the word list is manually curated and pulls from Cyberpunk sourcebooks, "so you'll frequently get the CHOOM etc." So if you've been looking for a way to boost your Cyberpunk lore knowledge or get better acquainted with the in-game lingo, now's your chance.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/screenshot-2025-10-10-at-10-31-29-1760088701787.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Gonkle is a Cyberpunk 2077 take on Wordle.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has insisted players won’t see anything made by generative AI in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of generative AI is one of the hottest topics in the video game industry, with the pressure on publishers to cut costs and speed up development in order to boost profits despite the risk of backlash from some fans. Indeed, according to a report by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Financial Times</a>, EA’s new prospective owners (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo">the ones who just spent $55 billion to take the company private</a>) are betting on the use of generative AI to do just that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And EA itself, even before it was bought out, had signalled that it was all-in on generative AI, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">CEO Andrew Wilson insisting AI is “the very core of its business.”</a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For now though, at least when it comes to Battlefield 6, generative AI is taking a backseat. Rebecka Coutaz, general manager of original series developer DICE in Sweden, and Criterion, the UK studio now also a part of what’s collectively called Battlefield Studios, told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a> that while generative AI “is very seducing,” currently there is no way to work it into the developers’ daily work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Coutaz clarified that generative AI is used in preparatory stages "to allow more time and more space to be creative.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA’s approach here for Battlefield 6 is in contrast to Activision’s for Call of Duty. Call of Duty has suffered a number of generative AI controversies in recent years, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash"><u>now-infamous six-fingered zombie Santa bundle</u></a>. Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">Activision was forced to add an ‘AI generated content disclosure’ to the Steam page for Black Ops 6</a> after Valve changed its storefront rules.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/santa-claus-1733746080205-1760086374302.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Black Ops 6's 'Necroclaus' loading screen. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on Coutaz’s comments, and the current lack of an AI generated content disclosure on the Battlefield 6 Steam page, we won’t see something similar in EA’s rival first-person shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In August, Treyarch associate creative director, Miles Leslie, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-generative-ai-backlash-not-replace-but-streamline">suggested generative AI images had made their way into Black Ops 6 by mistake</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We live in a world now, where there are AI tools,” Leslie told IGN ahead of Black Ops 7's reveal at Opening Night Live 2025. “I think our official statement we said last year, around Black Ops 6, is that everything that goes into the game is touched by the team a hundred percent. We have generative AI tools to help us, but none of that goes in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And then you're going to say, ‘Yeah, but it has.' I'll say it has by accident. And that was never the intention. We've come out and been very clear that we use these as tools to help the team, but they do not replace any of the fantastic team members we have that are doing the final touches and building that content to put it in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So everything you play: human-created and touched. AI tools in the world we live in: it's, how do we streamline it? That's really the goal. Not replace, but streamline.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting the Black Ops 7 Steam page <em>does</em> include the AI disclosure.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But will Battlefield Studios' stance on generative AI hold for much longer, especially with EA's new owners breathing down its neck? In the interview with the BBC, Coutaz sounded optimistic about the use of the tech going forward. "If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative," she said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The debate over generative AI is bigger than in-game assets. Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-issues-official-statement-in-response-to-generative-ai-claim-as-openai-ceo-sam-altman-calls-sora-2-copyrighted-character-videos-interactive-fan-fiction">Nintendo issued a statement in response to claims around generative AI</a>, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman calling Sora 2 copyrighted character videos “interactive fan fiction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, the famously litigious The Pokémon Company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this"><u>formally responded to the use of Pokémon TV hero Ash Ketchum and the series' theme tune by the Department of Homeland Security</u></a>, as part of a video showing people being arrested and handcuffed by law enforcement agents.
