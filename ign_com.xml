ConcernedApe’s head of operations and business development, Cole Medeiros, confirmed with The Verge that, while the Stardew Valley creator does indeed play a role in the Hollow Knight follow-up, they aren’t ready to reveal who he plays. Medeiros added that Barone would “rather not say which character(s) so as not to spoil any surprises for anyone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-shoots-up-steams-most-played-games-chart-hours-after-launch-with-huge-concurrent-player-numbers-as-storefront-issues-ease"><u>hundreds of thousands of players have already logged in to Steam</u></a> to play Hollow Knight: Silksong on a Thursday morning, it might take some time to find how Barone is featured. Team Cherry made the metroidvania sequel available for players today, September 4, 2025, for $19.99 for PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S, and it immediately helped cause <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-but-its-so-popular-its-crashing-storefronts-including-steam"><u>digital storefronts like Steam and the Nintendo eShop to crash</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Civilization VII developer Firaxis has laid off an unknown number of individuals today, despite the insistance of Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick that the game's sales are consistent with expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, a number of Firaxis employees announced across social media that they had been let go, including members of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lightningfused.bsky.social/post/3lxzhoahbfc2h" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">production</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/emmakidwell.bsky.social/post/3lxzgvwuq6k2r" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">narrative</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/noodleverse.bsky.social/post/3lxznuwg3422g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">art</a>. Civilization VII publisher 2K <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed the layoffs to Game Developer</a>, saying the studio was restructuring and optimizing its development process for "adaptability, collaboration, and creativity." The company did not confirm the number of individuals impacted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firaxis released Civilization VII earlier this year, and the game has since received a mixed reception on Steam amid player complaints about the game's user interface, lack of map variety, and that it was missing expected features. Since then, Firaxis has released a number of updates to the game to improve it in these areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, Strauss Zelnick, CEO of 2K parent Take-Two, has said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-insists-projections-for-the-lifetime-value-of-civilization-7-are-very-consistent-with-our-initial-expectations-for-the-title-despite-slow-start">while Civilization VII did get off to a "slow start"</a>, the company's internal projections for the "lifetime value" of the game still match initial expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the key thing is that Civ has always been a slow burn. It's always been a title that had — I'm not really a big believer in the long tail theory of the entertainment business — but Civ is an example of that theory. And right now our projections for the lifetime value of the title are very consistent with our initial expectations for the title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So while we were off to a slow start and while we have had to make changes — and there are more changes coming — I feel like consumer uptake is better and better and we feel really good about the title. I think over time it's going to take its place in its civilization pantheon in a very successful, credible way.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The question now is, just how big will it be? It’s already the 29th most-played game on Steam of all-time, with the likes of Helldivers 2 in its sights.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Silksong is one of the most anticipated games of 2025. Over six years after its initial announcement and as the most wishlisted game on Steam, Silksong finally launched today, September 4, across PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S priced $19.99 and weighing in at 7.62GB.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Silksong’s true player count will be much bigger across all platforms. Neither Sony, Nintendo nor Microsoft make player numbers public, but Silksong crashed those storefronts, too, so it will be massive everywhere. And let’s remember Silksong is a day-one Game Pass title. Yep, this one’s enormous, perhaps even the biggest indie game launch of all time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong Release Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Little was known about Silksong ahead of launch, so players are only now discovering its secrets.
