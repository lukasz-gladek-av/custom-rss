Preorders at Target are already sold out as well, while Best Buy’s selection is merely marked as “Coming Soon”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that, outside of keeping up with deal trackers, you’ll very more than likely have to pay above retail price for the time being. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, we’ll give you a full breakdown of the best places to get your buy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/pokemon"><u>Pokémon</u></a> preorders for whichever Mega Evolution: Ascended Heroes products you’re looking out for. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ascended Heroes Tech Sticker Collection — Charmander &amp; Ghastly</h2><div id="234434"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234434" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Evolution: Ascended Heroes Tech Sticker Collection - Charmander - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><div id="234435"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234435" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Evolution: Ascended Heroes Tech Sticker Collection - Gastly - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Only a handful of Pokémon TCG products for the Ascended Heroes expansion are launching right away on 30 January, with the Charmander and Ghastly Tech Collections preorders being the best to buy first — the cheapest being at Walmart for $39.97 each (random), or at <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqJVNw?object_uuid=289eb6e5-519f-468b-9e7b-aed2f1917205&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Amazon </u></a>for around $43 each. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each collection gets you three Ascended Heroes booster packs, a titular promo card, and a tech sticker sheet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pre-orders for individual Ascended Heroes booster packs are sold out over at <a href="https://zdcs.link/QV5AP7?object_uuid=289eb6e5-519f-468b-9e7b-aed2f1917205&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGplayer</u></a> and aren’t listed at Amazon or Walmart, so the Tech Sticker Collections give you the best value for money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ascended Heroes Collection Blisters — Erika &amp; Larry</h2></div><div id="234443"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234443" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Evolution: Ascended Heroes Collection - Larry - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the first Ascended Heroes products releasing with the set’s launch on 30 January, the Erika and Larry blister packs are arguably the second-hottest to buy right now —  and pre-orders can be bought cheapest for <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56y15?object_uuid=289eb6e5-519f-468b-9e7b-aed2f1917205&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>$34.99 at Amazon</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, whichever one you get between the Larry and Erika edition (Larry’s has a Komala promo card, and Erika’s with Tangela).

Plus, keep in mind that whichever one you get of the two will be random. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, The Pokemon Company also announced these collections will be released at a later date of 20 March.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ascended Heroes Booster Bundles</h2></div><div id="234432"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234432" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ascended Heroes Booster Bundle - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Offering a box of six Pokémon TCG booster packs, the Ascended Heroes Booster Bundle is best to pre-order at <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj8Mbp?object_uuid=289eb6e5-519f-468b-9e7b-aed2f1917205&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Walmart — offering the lowest price of $77.95</u></a>, compared to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpBelg?object_uuid=289eb6e5-519f-468b-9e7b-aed2f1917205&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGplayer</u></a> sellers asking for $82.44 plus $200 shipping at best. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We expect better TCGplayer sellers with better offers to be closer to the Ascended Heroes Booster Bundles’ release date, which was also announced as an even further delayed date of 24 April 2026. In the meantime, though, Walmart’s the best go-to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.
