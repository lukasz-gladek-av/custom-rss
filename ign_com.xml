            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Open world is now almost a cliché statement."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The lead designer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim"><u>Skyrim</u></a> is "eternally shocked" at not just the RPG's success, but its enduring appeal, suggesting it's the game's open world and "quirkiness" that keeps players coming back 14 years after its debut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skyrim released way back in 2011. An open-world RPG, it puts players on the precipice of determining the future of Skyrim as the Empire waits for the prophesied Dragonborn to come, a hero born with the power of The Voice, and the only one who can stand among the dragons. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-review"><u>IGN's Skyrim review returned a 9.5/10.</u></a> We called it "a rare kind of intensely personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking on the <a href="https://linktr.ee/frvrpodcast" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>FRVR Podcast</u></a>, lead designer Bruce Nesmith offered his thoughts on why so many people continue to play and enjoy Skyrim so many years later. "I think Skyrim did the open world in a way that nobody had ever done before and very few people have really tried to do since," he said, adding: "By all rights, a year later, some other game should have eclipsed it. And then two years later, three years later, five, 10. It’s like ‘what the hell is going on here?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Todd [Howard, Bethesda boss] would even go to these meetings and show us information, which I can’t give you the details of, about how many people are playing it. It’s like, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me?’ Seriously, still, 10 years later."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploring the game's legacy and lasting community, he added: "I think Skyrim did the open world in a way that nobody had ever done before and very few people have really tried to do since. And one of those things that we accepted, which a lot of developers struggle to accept, is that this means you’re going to have quirkiness. You’re going to have weird stuff happen. And if you say that’s okay, you can get this diamond."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly then, Nesmith believes that if a developer tries to "smooth everything out" to prevent that aforementioned "weird stuff," "you’re going to lose some of that magic" that makes some games so special.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And we didn’t make that as a conscious decision," he added. "It just sort of happened. You know, we kind of prioritize functionally and 'well, okay, that bug’s acceptable. This behaviour is less than ideal, but we can live with it because look what we’re getting over here.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We didn’t put anything off limits. We didn’t try to manage the experience. We let it be <em>your</em> experience, it was a player-driven experience. And very, very few games have mastered that because open world is now almost a cliché statement... ‘Oh yeah, we have open world.’"</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda is of course working on its hotly anticipated Skyrim follow-up, The Elder Scrolls 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield boss Vince Zampella has said that Activision's best-selling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty</a> franchise only exists "because EA were dicks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an eye-opening but typically frank statement from Zampella, who is of course now an EA employee himself once again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over his career, Zampella has ping-ponged between rival publishers EA and Activision, working first on EA's Medal of Honor series, then founding Infinity Ward and helping create Call of Duty — specifically so it could be Activision's Medal of Honor "killer" — before returning back to EA after helping create Titanfall and Apex Legends at Respawn.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks," Zampella told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, reflecting on his career. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zampella initially worked on EA's Medal of Honor franchise from 1999 to 2002, and served as lead designer on the celebrated Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. After this, Zampella co-founded his own studio, Infinity Ward, with initial plans to continue working on Medal of Honor left up in the air when EA decided to take development of its franchise in-house. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For legal reasons I will say things didn't go as planned with it," former Infinity Ward artist Justin Thomas previously revealed of the situation in an <a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/publishing/the-medal-of-honor-killer-a-call-of-duty-story/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MCV</a> interview, back in 2013. "We were left in a situation of unpaid milestones that were delivered and no finances to operate on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was at this point that Activision answered a last-ditch call by Infinity Ward, intrigued by the potential of working with the team behind Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, and driven by the idea of creating a new franchise that could topple EA's own. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6: Single-Player Campaign Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest, as they say, is history. Call of Duty became a behemoth, though Activision and Zampella parted ways following the launch of 2009's Modern Warfare 2, prompting a bitter legal feud over unpaid bonuses and royalties that dragged on for years (until Zampella ultimately earned a sizable payout). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That situation then led to Zampella co-founding Titanfall and Apex Legends developer Respawn, which EA partnered with then ultimately acquired. Zampella was then repeatedly promoted to look after more of EA's gaming portfolio, ultimately becoming boss of the embattled Battlefield franchise, turning its fortunes around to deliver this month's successful release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GQ's interview also includes a snippet on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/10/call-of-duty-elite-enlists-hollywood-talent">now-distant plans for Alien director Ridley Scott to direct a Call of Duty movie</a>, something which ultimately never came to pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ridley Scott came in one time – who's a hero of mine – but he's not connected to games, so he'd ask these questions like, ‘How do you script what happens?’" Zampella recalled. "There was a bit of a talk around him doing a Call of Duty film, but we never really took it seriously. Video game movies at that point were never really that good."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched last week and earned EA its best-ever game launch on Steam, beating that of Apex Legends.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Go's new level cap requirements have leaked, and some fans say the fresh XP total required, as well as the some of the extra tasks involved, are too easy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> will raise its current level 50 cap for the first time in five years, and allow players to reach level 80 for the first time. But this change will come alongside an overall rebalancing of XP — meaning many players will find themselves transported to a much higher level, and potentially far beyond the XP needed to instantly hit level 80.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, players won't simply log on and find themselves at the finish line. As is the case currently, a fresh set of additional tasks will need to be completed to progress through the game's final tier of levels (from 70 to 80, replacing similar tasks required to move from 40 to 50). But even these — which have been datamined by fans — have been dubbed as rather straightforward.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night, a <a href="https://pokemongo.com/post/pgo-leveling-update-details-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on the official Pokémon Go blog listed out the new XP requirements needed after the game's level cap increases tomorrow, October 15.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Go rebalanced XP requirements:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Level 10: 48,000 total XP</li><li>Level 20: 258,000 total XP</li><li>Level 30: 1,083,000 total XP</li><li>Level 40: 3,953,000 total XP</li><li>Level 50: 12,753,000 total XP</li><li>Level 60: 34,353,000 total XP</li><li>Level 70: 85,853,000 total XP</li><li>Level 80: 203,353,000 total XP</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It's interesting to compare these fresh totals with the amounts of XP needed to hit the game's level 50 cap now. Currently, hitting level 50 requires a lifetime total of 176 million XP. (This week, following the game's rebalance, level 50 will require just 12.75 million XP.) This means the new level 80 cap requires just 27 million more XP than the current level 50. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's been clear for a while that Pokémon Go's new level cap will come alongside an overall smoothing of the game's overall XP requirements, hardcore fans have still been surprised to discover that many of them will once again be in Pokémon Go's new endgame, with little to no actual XP grinding required.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to those level up tasks, fans examining a <a href="https://x.com/thepokemodgroup/status/1977819506060759314" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">datamined list</a> of what will be needed have judged the requirements as rather straightforward. Each level requires players hold an increasing number of platinum in-game medals, though these can be earned in a way that reflects your playstyle. Some will take time — Purifying 100 Shadow Pokémon — but with planning there's nothing here which should hold up hardcore players for too long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, there is also palpable relief among fans at the lack of any artificial timegating here — such as requiring a Pokémon be caught on 30 days, holding progress back a month — something which has been found in other challenges previously. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Go Level 71-80 level up tasks</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Level 71</strong><br>Earn 15 platinum medals<br>Power up Legendary or Mythical Pokémon 20 times<br>Make 999 Nice Throws<br>Catch 100 Pokémon in a single day

</li><li><strong>Level 76</strong><br>Earn 38 platinum medals<br>Defeat 100 Team GO Rocket Grunts<br>Explore 300 km<br>Catch 200 Pokémon in a single day

</li><li><strong>Level 80</strong><br>Earn 50 platinum medals<br>Win 80 Trainer Battles in the GO Battle League<br>Make 999 Excellent Throws<br>Win 80 Raids</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">With these tasks, and with Pokémon Go's new XP rebalance, it feels clear that the game is adjusting itself for newer players, and leveling the playing field somewhat so there's a chance for newcomers to  catch up with those who have been playing for almost a decade. As the game approaches its 10-year anniversary next year, its developers will likely want to ensure Pokémon Go continues to welcome fresh blood to its userbase, without giving them too steep an XP mountain to climb. But some veterans are less impressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These are all so easy," wrote Old_Indication_4379 on top Pokémon Go fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1o5tu5q/level_up_requirements_datamined/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> TheSilphRoad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm disappointed beyond disappointment," added another fan, avaible17. "I'm sitting at 352M xp and I doubt that it is very impressive number for most of the old players. I hoped for a challenge and motivation to play, I've got easy and repetitive tasks, that most of them can be done in a day (except walking ofc).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was hoping for introduction of new type of medals, that would make my grind beyond capabilities of human flesh," they continued. "Now I'm writing this and thinking, that they just make it easier for beginners, not more challenging for old dogs."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/14/unnamed-1-1760437722216.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go's new Daily Adventure Egg and Incubator.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh incentives to climbing levels will include permanent boosts to Pokémon, inventory and gift storage, and an improved chance at gaining Lucky Friends status when players are level 70 and above. Finally, and most mysteriously, there's a new 1km Daily Adventure Incubator for players over level 15. Alongside the game's current Daily Adventure Incense item, which rewards players with extra spawns for 15 minutes, this is designed to reward players who walk at least 1km per day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly which Pokémon the Daily Adventure Incubator will hatch, however, remains unknown — though fans are already speculating that the mechanic will eventually include an ultra-rare Pokémon (Manaphy and Phione seem a good bet!) similar to how the Daily Adventure Incense has a rare chance at spawning a Galar Legendary bird.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overnight, Pokémon Go's development team fixed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-pulls-new-weekly-challenge-feature-within-hours-after-completion-bricks-game-fuelling-concern-over-this-weeks-level-80-update">yesterday's major bug which bricked the game for anyone who completed its first Weekly Challenge</a>.
