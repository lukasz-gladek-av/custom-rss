            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yep, I found a way to save $15 on Pokémon Legends: Z-A and the Mega Dimension DLC just as the expansion drops, proper legend I am. Not just that, but Woot has gone mad with discounting loads of First Party Nintendo Switch games, many of which have Switch 2 upgrades. More on that below.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've also been on the lookout for stocking fillers, and Tomy's Club Mocchi Mocchi Plushies are just awesome. There's a few Mario, Sonic and TMNT ones discounted across the web at the moment, so don't miss those.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Happy Cyberpunk 2077 5th anniversary! There's some very cool colaborations releasing for it too thanks to CD PROJEKT RED, Viture, Corsair and of course Secretlab put their Cyberpunk 2077 Titan Evo Gaming Chair in their holiday sale. Happy days, let's get into it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh yeah, and Skyrim came out for the millionth time on a new console, so turn that Nintendo Switch 2 on:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Allpowers R600 299Wh LiFePO4 Power Station</h2><div id="230488" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Allpowers R600 299Wh LiFePO4 Power Station with 100W Solar Panel</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Allpowers is the most popular power station on brand on AliExpress for good reason: it's generally less expensive than other brands while offering the same features. Even the least expensive power station - the compact R600 - boasts a LiFePO4 battery that lasts at least 10 years before you even need to start worrying about battery degradation. Other features include both AC outlets and USB ports, solar panel hookups, and smart app functionaliy. All of the power stations listed include a 5 year warranty and have plenty of reviews commenting on the responsiveness of their customer service. If you're looking to get the highest capacity at the lowest price possible, Allpowers is legit.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Legends: Z-A + Mega Dimension DLC</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Haven't played Legends Z-A yet? Well I can save you some money on Switch 1 and 2. Kick things off with the Woot deals on the region free copy for $44.99. If you're playing on Switch 1, just buy the Mega Dimension DLC for $29.99 and you're fixed up for $74.98.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Switch 2 owners, you'll need to also buy the Switch 2 upgrade pack for $9.99, which brings the total price to $84.98. That's a $15 Switch 1 or Switch 2 savings, you're welcome!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Skyrim: Anniversary on Switch 2</h2></p><div><div id="233532" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Digital Code: Free upgrade to Nintendo Switch 2</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim | Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><div id="233533" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Digital code upgrade: Only for owners of standard Skyrim for Nintendo Switch</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim | Anniversary Upgrade</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd love to say that I found a magical way to knock some money off getting Skyrim for the 15th time, but it would require you to already have the game. Here's how it works, if you have Skyrim Anniversary for Switch 1 already, the Switch 2 upgrade is free. If you have the base version of Skyrim, you need to get the $19.99 Anniversary upgrade that will include upgrading to Nintendo Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't have it at all, it seems the only way to get hold of Skyrim Anniversary on Switch 2 currently is buying the full fat digital code. Nintendo Online and all retailers are rocking that $69.99 price tag, so make of that what you will.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly it's still 30 FPS even when docked but it's a night and day difference when it comes to sharp and crisp visuals in a portable form factor. So if you're on Switch 2 and don't have a gaming PC handheld, you'll get a ridiculous amount of mileage from it!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Woot Nintendo Switch Game Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've got some gaps in your backlog for Nintendo Switch games you've missed, now's the time to top your shelves up. There's plenty of games here with Switch 2 upgrades also, and a lot are either free or included with Nintendo Switch Online. Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild are big ones, with their Switch 2 enhancements locked behind a $10 pass per game or included in Nintendo Switch Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has practically been remade thanks to a free Nintendo Switch 2 update, although I don't think Game Freak would have got away with a paid update thanks to the goodwill lost on S&amp;Vs Switch 1 performance issues. We now get a smooth 60 FPS which clocks at 4K when docked, more Pokémon appear on screen and it's a pleasure to play. The dull textures still remain, but it's the fix we were looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games like Super Mario Wonder will be getting new content and a Switch 2 performance / visual upgrade in January also. Other games will generally run and load a little better, so it's well worth having a look through and checking which titles you're missing.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Club Mocchi Mocchi Plushie Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomy actually came up with a product to rival Squishmallows when it comes to feathersoft huggage plushies, and I'm a big fan of Mocchi Moochi. It's rare you see discounts this good on them, plus you can pretend you're tucking Super Sonic into bed when you get up in the morning, just expect your bed to set on fire in the process. Sorry, it's still a bargain though!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Cyberpunk 2077 5th Anniversary Gear</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've only gone and found the perfect setup for playing Cyberpunk 2077 on PC! Let's start with Secretlabs  TITAN Evo Cyberpunk 2077 edition, which matches the box art perfectly and represents Johnny Silverhands band logo, "Samurai" on the back cover. Awesome right? Both the regular and XL models are on offer, that goes for accessories too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">VITURE and CD Projekt RED have teamed up to bring the most savage set of XR glasses i've ever seen. Limited to 100,000 units, these bad boys project a 152-inch virtual display at 120hz with 1,500 nits of brightness. That's all packed into Sony's latest MicroOLED panels, one for each eye. Forget a gaming monitor or TV, this is a one-stop solution for Street Kids, Corpo and Nomads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Corsair have shown up and killed it too thanks to a new mechanical keyboard, wireless mouse and massive cloth gaming mouse pad. You can get all three at a discount for $269.99, or you can buy them seperatley. If you can I'd go for the bundle and save nearly $50, but these aren't just gimmicks budget products, they're based on the below Corsair products:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>MM300 2XL Anti-Fray Cloth Gaming Mouse Pad</li><li>K65 Plus Keyboard</li><li>M75 Wireless Mouse</li></ul><p id="nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World">Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="80e0ff81-3606-4105-a4f2-43697c5c3b1d" id="233411"><div id="233411" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Amazon going in and out of stock, still in stock at Walmart</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This deal is priced the same as a solo Nintendo Switch 2 console, making Super Mario World a free pack-in game over at Walmart. Amazon seems to be going in and out of stock right now, but regardless it's the same price there too.</p></div><p id="x-arcade-arcade2tv-xr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR">X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR</h2></p><div catalogid="80e0ff81-3606-4105-a4f2-43697c5c3b1d" id="233511"><div id="233511" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Integrated Meta Quest 2/3 Functionality and works on all consoles / PC</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At a generous $205 off, this is a cracking one-stop-shop arcade gaming solution. Want to hook it up to your current gen consoles to play Smash Bros on? Sorted. Want to make your own Meme Arcade setup with a mini PC or Raspberry PI? Sorted. It's two player and complete with authentic feeling arcade buttons and sticks, roller balls and room for upgrades such as a soundbar, pinball haptics and more. This takes the pain out of making a cabinet or spending a fortune on one and allows players to plug and play like you would a normal controller.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Elgato Streaming Gear Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gold brand in streaming and content creation is Elgato, and there's plenty of its high-end gear on sale here such as the power-streamer Stream Deck XL down to $204.99 to one of the best budget-focused condenser microphone options in the $84.99 Wave Neo. Even the Facecam Mk.2 has been knocked down to $126.34, allowing streamers to stop worrying about mirrorless XLR camera setups and have a quality wcamera solution that plug and play. And who doesn't want an Elgato prompter for a marked down $228.99?</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Excentric Christmas Gift Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I thought i'd have a bit of fun today with some cool Christmas or White Rabbit gift ideas with some brilliant discounts. I've already touched on Sony InZone wireless earbuds, but they really are the best all-rounder earbuds i've tried in recent memory, and the included USB-C dongle fits in the charger case and is ideal for connecting to PC and PlayStation 5. And they're $42.99 off, bargain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Saving over $100 on a 300W Kareoke machine with an included 10.1" tablet and wireless microphones is a cracking deal too. Ikario has RGB lighting and hooks up to YouTube or Karaoke app via WiFi for absolute endless banter for house parties this holiday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative might not be the front and center of PC audio like it used to be, but it haven't lost its eye for quality. $69.99 for a soundbar and subwoofer combo is an awesome shout for a gaming setup or smaller home theatre setups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've spotted a loved one forever filming themselves for TikToks or video calling to their friends, the Maono wireless lavalier microphone is USB-C compatible and clips to a users clothes for a pro sound wherever they are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stationary cameras are great for keeping an eye on a room in general, but cats and dogs don't like staying still. Enabot EBO Rola PetPal provides 2.5k video and allows owners to roll about the house to check what their pets are really up too. Attachable feeders and cat toys allow for owners to interact with their pets more than ever before and is a great gift for the craszy cat person in your life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been using the HOZO NeoBlade for a while now whilst cleaning up my 3D prints and creative projects. It's an ultrasonic knife that can take different microblades and is rechargable. This bit of kit just makes cutting jobs miles easier of toucher materials with acrylic, PLA, wood and softer metals. I use it to cut supports off my prints and clean up projects, and I can't go back to regular scalpels and blades. Plus this bundle is $10 off and you get a self healing A3 matt.</p><p id="new-switch-2-games-this-holiday"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="New Switch 2 Games This Holiday">Switch 2 Games Releasing This Holiday</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">December is stacked for Nintendo Switch 2. We gave Metroid Prime 4: Beyond a solid 8/10 for nailing the Prime vibe whilst introducing some interesting mechanics and a pseudo open-world sandbox to explore. Considering how long we've been waiting for it, Metroid 4 is a solid comeback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC drops on Wednesday, which adds a post-game story, brand new Mega Evolutions and new mechanics such as an alternative dimension Lumioise City and Pokémon hitting over the long-standing level 100 mechanic. Insane. </p><p id="audible-holiday-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Audible Holiday Sale">Audible Holiday Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fancy knocking a $14.95 per month subscription to 99 cents for three months? That's what's on offer for Amazon Prime members right now, which can easily be cancelled down before the discount dries if you don't want to continue, win-win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst Audible Plus, the cheaper membership tier, has 10,000 audiobooks to listen too, Premium Plus has 500,000. Premium Plus members get to pick an audiobook to keep in their library indefinitely too, with 30% off purchasable Audiobooks. Usually this crops up as a free 30-day trial, and these trials are only for new subscribers, so this is the best deal you're going to get.</p><p id="mega-evolution-booster-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Evolution Booster Box">Mega Evolution Booster Box</h2></p><div catalogid="80e0ff81-3606-4105-a4f2-43697c5c3b1d" id="233437"><div id="233437" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Evolution Booster Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not often Amazon gets their Pokémon TCG products down to market value, but here we are. Yes, you can save $6.99 at TCGPlayer if you're not bothered about waiting a few days for delivery, but many would argue the extra $6.99 is worth getting it in your hands quicker with 1-day Amazon Prime delivery. The choice is yours but both sites have this at or near market value right now, which is great for one of the box in-demand Pokémon TCG sets right now.</p></div><p id="secret-lab-holiday-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Secret Lab Holiday Sale">Secretlab Holiday Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no secret that Secretlab is one of the most premium gaming chairs and brands available right now, and the brand tax is real. But straight off the heels of Black Friday, Secretlab have dropped their Christmas Holiday Sale across all the favorites. The super premium Titan Evo Nanogen Edition features a Secretlab-exclusive NanGen Hybrid Leathette seat covering and NanoFoam Composite cushioning for one of the best feeling gaming chairs on the market,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the budget-minded Titan Evo Lite has premium features and coldfoam cusioning to make sure you're comfortable all day working and all night gaming. They even do an erganomic recliner add on now, featuring multiple angles of support to keep your legs comfortable for different posture types.</p><p id="alienware-and-lenovo-gaming-pc-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Alienware and Lenovo Gaming PC Deals">Alienware and Lenovo Gaming PC Deals</h2></p><div><div id="233436" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lenovo LOQ AMD Ryzen 7 8745HX RTX 5060 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)</h3></p></div><div id="233428" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 7 265 RTX 5090 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)</h3></p></div><div id="233429" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 9 285K RTX 5090 Gaming PC</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to get carried away with mad specifications on gaming PCs, and if you can afford it that's awesome. But builds like Lenovo's LOQ RTX 5060Ti build has a cracking budget price of $949.99 after using the discount code "<strong>EXTRAFIVE</strong>", capable of DLSS 4 upscaling and the latest Nvidia AI frame generation. The Ryzen 7 8745HX CPU backs up the 5060 Ti well, making this a lean and mean 1080p gaming monster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of the two Alienware builds, i'd save the money and go for the Intel Core Ultra 7 265 build. Both of these builds are going to kill it when it comes to high frame rate 4K gaming, and I simply don't think the extra $350 is worth it for the extra gains of a Core Ultra 9 285K CPU. Of course it's faster and better, but I think the $3,899.99 build is far better value for money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Someone has calculated exactly how many hours of recorded dialogue there are in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, a task so unnecessarily large that even Larian Studios hadn't done it before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/baldurs-gate-3-fan-discovers-the-game-has-nearly-237-hours-of-spoken-dialogue-in-it-and-a-whopping-14-hours-are-narrator-amelia-tylers-alone-though-astarion-gives-her-a-run-for-her-money/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by PC Gamer</a>, Everwhite-moonlight <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1830hh3fNYewVBdqTFRfjL6wvRfGp6DEIZFY_6BbLsOk/edit?gid=1474580599#gid=1474580599" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put together a spreadsheet</a> breaking down all the dialogue in the game: who spoke it, how long the dialogue is, even how many files they speak in.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This survey results in some interesting facts surfacing: it's unsurprising that the narrator, Amelia Tyler, has the most dialogue at 14 hours, 43 minutes, and 55 seconds. Behind her, though, is Astarion, voiced by Neil Newbon, with 13 hours, six minutes, and 23 seconds. And behind him is Shadowheart, with 12 hours, 25 minutes, and 26 seconds. The smallest amount of dialogue is a many-way tie between numerous NPCs that all have only one second of dialogue, including four different Mind Flayer NPCs. In total, the game contains 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds of spoken voice lines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every voice actor is catalogued in here, including small lines by random NPCs and even cut dialogue. One mystery that's arisen, per Everwhite-moonlight, is who exactly voices which Giant Rat NPC in the game. "There are four instances of a character named 'Giant Rat,' and there are four actors credited to have played 'Giant Rat.' I have separated the Giant Rat UIDs and could tell they are played by four different people, but I don't know which one is which." Those actors are Akbar Kurtha, Joseph Capp, Leemore Marrett Jr., and Sean Baker. Now we just have to sort out which actor is which rat.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Baldur's Gate 3 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another fun bit that's surfaced from this is that Larian Studios actually didn't know how much dialogue, time-wise, was in the game. On Twitter/X, Larian boss Swen Vincke shared the news about the finding, saying, "We weren’t really keeping track which I think was for the better."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke did, however, know the word count of the game's script, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-collective-dialogue-has-triple-the-word-count-of-the-lord-of-the-rings-larian-reveals">as we learned back in 2024</a>, saying that Baldur's Gate 3 has triple the word count of The Lord of the Rings, and its cutscene runtime is twice as long as HBO's Game of Thrones. Holy moly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For lovers of Baldur's Gate 3's particular brand of delightful wordiness, it might be worth tuning into The Game Awards tomorrow, as Larian <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-think-we-know-what-geoff-keighleys-weird-desert-statue-is-teasing">seems to be teasing a brand new Divinity game</a> for reveal at the show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>1378837</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you hadn’t already heard, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-mysterious-the-game-awards-statue-reportedly-isnt-teasing-the-elder-scrolls-6-diablo-or-god-of-war-so-what-is-it-teasing">a weird, spiky monolith in the Mojave Desert</a>. Adorned with a massive eye-like orb and a legion of demonic creatures, it’s a hint at something due to be revealed as part of The Game Awards 2025. And, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-think-we-know-what-geoff-keighleys-weird-desert-statue-is-teasing">the registration of a few new trademarks</a>, it seems like we already have the answer as to what it is: a brand new game from Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios called “Divinity”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are one of the millions of players who first learned of Larian through the gargantuan success of Baldur’s Gate 3, then the word Divinity may not mean much to you. Fans of the studio, however, will tell you that BG3’s success is rooted in Divinity, a series of six games that Larian worked on almost exclusively between 2002 and 2017. <em><strong>If</strong></em> this monolith and trademark leak really do point towards Divinity, then the Belgian studio is returning to its original fantasy universe… and likely bringing a whole new fanbase along with it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If such a currently-very-much-hypothetical game would mark your first foray into the Divinity universe, then you may want a quick primer on what to expect. Let us be your guide to Divinity, and be the first to (very pre-emptively) say…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Welcome to Rivellon</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-blogroll-1765383245117.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like how Baldur’s Gate takes place in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons setting of the Forgotten Realms, Divinity has its own rich, original setting: the world of Rivellon. There are broad similarities between the two; both are rooted in Tolkienesque fantasy tropes, with classically styled medieval landscapes and locations. There are multiple races; like in D&amp;D, you can expect to meet humans, elves, dwarves, lizard-like beings, and the living dead. Magic is commonplace in Rivellon, although sorcery is considered more dangerous and is more heavily regulated there than it is on D&amp;D’s Sword Coast.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Baldur’s Gate, Divinity also features a number of more esoteric elements, from steampunk to sci-fi and beyond, that make its world a little quirkier than the lands explored in more traditional fantasy like The Lord of the Rings. Rivellon can also often be a very silly place, and the influence of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels has frequently been felt in Divinity’s writing. In fact, Terry’s daughter, Rhianna Pratchett, even wrote a tie-in novella for the second game. But that’s not to say Rivellon is frivolous – there’s a deep vein of fascinating lore that has been mined over the series’ six installments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Rivellon is the stage for stories similar to those you enjoyed in Baldur’s Gate 3, but is beholden only to Larian’s rules, rather than those set by the owners of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Wizards of the Coast. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Divinity?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-2-1765383400580.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Divinity is an RPG series, but its evolution has been far from usual. Take a quick look at each of the six games, and you’ll find at least four different approaches. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divine-divinity">Divine Divinity</a>, the very first game in the series, and its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/beyond-divinity">Beyond Divinity</a>, are Diablo-influenced action RPGs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-ii-ego-draconis">Divinity 2: Ego Draconis</a>, meanwhile, is a third-person RPG that feels a <em>little </em>closer to the likes of Dragon Age and The Witcher. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-dragon-commander">Divinity: Dragon Commander</a> is a <em>slightly</em> Total War-flavoured strategy game, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-original-sin">Original Sin</a> duology – the most recent games in the series – are classic-style RPGs that bear the most resemblance to Baldur’s Gate 3. Larian has experimented wildly over the years, and so there’s no clear indication as to what format the next game in the series will use (although considering the success of Baldur’s Gate 3, the sensible bet would be on something similar).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another unusual element is its approach to the timeline. While Rivellon does have a coherent history and storylines that are threaded across the series, each game is set years (sometimes even centuries) apart, meaning each one is something of a standalone experience. Similar to how Baldur's Gate 3 demands no experience of the series but has plenty of nods to the two earlier games, you can play Divinity: Original Sin 2 without any experience of its predecessors. I suspect any future game in the series would continue this tradition, especially since Larian now has a legion of new fans who are unfamiliar with the studio’s previous work. If the leaked trademark is to be believed, this new project is simply called “Divinity” – a name that has likely been chosen since it comes with no suggestion that you need to have played multiple other games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Does “Divinity” Mean?  </h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-logo-1765383966045.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The new Divinity logo, trademarked ahead of The Game Awards 2025.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Divinity’s name is drawn from its foundational lore. Thousands of years before the events of Divine Divinity, the first game in the series, Rivellon’s ruling body, the Council of Seven, sacrificed themselves to defend the realm from evil wizards. The “Divine Order” was established in remembrance and assigned to pass on their knowledge to the next generations.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the events of Divine Divinity, a prophecy tells of a messiah who will protect Rivellon from the next existential threat, a demon called Chaos. That messiah, it turns out, is you, and you ascend to become Lucian the Divine – a character that goes on to make appearances in Divinity 2: Ego Draconis and Divinity: Original Sin 2. The concept of the Divine is frequently explored in the stories, although it’s not the central focus of each and every game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Similar is Divinity to Baldur’s Gate 3?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-os2-screen-1765383448435.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the series has changed so much over its lifetime, most of the Divinity series is actually pretty different from what Larian created with Baldur’s Gate 3. However, the Original Sin duology is very clearly the blueprint for BG3. These are isometric RPGs set across multiple regions, with tactical turn-based combat and a similar “hands-off” approach to quest design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While both are worth playing, Original Sin 2 is by far the most accomplished, both in terms of gameplay depth and narrative strength. It is where Larian pioneered the “origin story” characters that would later become the heroes of Baldur’s Gate 3, and Rivellon’s answer to the likes of Astarion, Gale, and Shadowheart are just as brilliantly written. It’s also the game in which the studio established “tags”, the system that provides character-specific dialogue options to help you better roleplay your specific race or class. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the Original Sin duology’s most lauded system is its elemental effects – cast a rain spell to make something wet, and then use a lightning ability to conduct electricity through that sodden surface. Tip over an oil barrel to create a puddle, and then shoot a flaming arrow into it to create a blaze. Stab an enemy, freeze their blood, and watch them slip on their own icy innards. Much of this elemental interplay made it into Baldur’s Gate 3, but it’s much more pronounced in Original Sin. Expect at least a quarter of your battles to result in arena-wide bonfires. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Play the Divinity Games in Order</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-dragon-commander-1765383513679.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned, the timeline gaps that separate the Divinity games mean there are no strictly <em>direct</em> sequels, and you can more or less play them in any order you choose. If you’ve played Baldur’s Gate 3 and are looking to learn more about Divinity, I’d only truly recommend playing Original Sin 2, which is widely regarded as the best in the series. Initially a PC exclusive, it is now available on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and even iPad. But if you really do want to delve into the lore and explore the entire timeline, this is how you’d need to tackle the series:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity: Dragon Commander (2013)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A grand strategy game set thousands of years prior to the events of the RPGs.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity: Original Sin (2014)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A CRPG with turn-based combat, set 1000 years before the original game, focused on a pair of “Source Hunters” tracking down dangerous magic users.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divine Divinity (2002)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A Diablo-like ARPG that chronicles the ascension of Lucian the Divine.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Beyond Divinity (2004)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The ARPG sequel to Divine Divinity, set 20 years later, tells the story of one of Lucian’s servants, who has been soulbound to an evil Death Knight. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity: Original Sin 2 (2017)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A CRPG that’s a sequel to Original Sin in terms of game design, but takes place after the original two games and deals with an outbreak of “Voidwoken” monsters in Rivellon. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity 2: Ego Draconis (2009)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A 3D action RPG set decades after Lucian’s ascension, during an era when the Divine’s adoptive son has become a tyrant, in which you play as a knight who can transform into a dragon.  </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-divinity-larian-studios-baldurs-gate-3]]></content:encoded>
