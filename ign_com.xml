Oblivion, which first launched in 2006, was one of the chief culprits, with objects flying all over the place, characters making poorly-timed (but often hilarious) on-screen interjections, and <em>things </em>happening in the background that, in the context of what was going on in the foreground, were perfect meme material.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly 20 years later, and Bethesda‚Äôs remaster (not a remake, it‚Äôs insisted), has all the ‚Äúcharm,‚Äù of the original, as Todd Howard put it. And that‚Äôs not an issue. In fact, it‚Äôs quite the opposite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúOblivion is back,‚Äù is what players of the remaster are saying in response to clips of the game going wrong in some way, or doing that Bethesda game thing of having a random NPC's face steal the scene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even glitches players exploited in the original Oblivion have been found to work in the remaster.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The permanent bound weapons and armour glitch still works in Oblivion Remastered LMAO <a href="https://t.co/Nzp8gCAucK" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Nzp8gCAucK</a></p>‚Äî Nerbit (@Nerbit_13098) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nerbit_13098/status/1914780386648809874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">And players are recreating Oblivion memes, trying to recapture the hilarity of the game‚Äôs NPC behavior as it was all those years ago.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Original for comparison <a href="https://t.co/egYXGxe438" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/egYXGxe438</a></p>‚Äî crobb üåπ (@corombb) <a href="https://twitter.com/corombb/status/1914864882232475829?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">None of Oblivion Remastered‚Äôs jank is seriously affecting player enjoyment of the game. For some it offers a warm familiarity. Can you imagine if the game had stripped all this out? It would feel‚Ä¶ soulless, somehow, and nothing like the original fans fondly remember. Perhaps such attention on polish is best reserved for The Elder Scrolls VI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bugs, glitches, and memes are just one aspect of Oblivion Remastered‚Äôs success, which has seen players use the character creator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastereds-funny-character-faces-are-going-viral-for-being-total-nightmare-fuel-and-for-looking-like-the-original-fallout-talking-heads">to come up with some hilarious and nightmarish faces</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-starter-pokemon-from-each-generation.1171344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-starter-pokemon-from-each-generation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The most pivotal moment in any Pokemon game comes right at the start ‚Äì choosing your partner Pokemon. The first moment you lock eyes with the creature you‚Äôll spend tens of hours raising, bonding with and sending into battle is a special experience. That decision is usually based on vibes and taste to the point where many fans see it as a personality test. However, in those moments, you have no knowledge of how that decision will affect your journey to becoming a Pokemon master, with the gyms, rivals and secrets of the region yet to reveal themselves to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, we‚Äôve done the research, looked into the base stats, found every strength and weakness of every starter Pokemon and all their evolutions and pitted them against their native regions to determine who is the best starter pick, not just to get you past the first couple gyms, but to take on the Elite Four and beyond. This is the first step to becoming a Pokemon master across all iterations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 1: Bulbasaur</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-bulbasaurpng-1745318747449.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While being the obvious pick to tackle the first gym in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-red-version">Pokemon Red</a> and Blue (Grass beats Rock, as any Pokemon fan knows), Bulbasaur outshines both Charmander and Squirtle as  the best starter pick in any bid to dominate the Kanto region. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Initial analysis might understandably lean towards Charmander. Fire types are a minority in Gen 1, many random encounters pitt you against Flying types (which are strong against Bulbasaur‚Äôs Grass) and the final gym is heavy on Ground types ‚Äì something Charizard is immune to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, those who are Bulbasaur-inclined will find themselves flying through the majority of the game, with the Grass type being super effective against Brock‚Äôs Rock Pokemon, Misty‚Äôs Water collection, and the Giovanni‚Äôs final gym line-up, as well as being the best choice to take out the first two members of the Elite Four. The biggest challenge Bulbasaur will face are Erika‚Äôs Grass type gym, where strategy will be vital to overcoming the barrage of ‚Äúnot very effective‚Äù attacks, and Blaine‚Äôs Fire type gym, which can be defeated thanks to the abundance of water types present in Kanto. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some issues a Bulbasaur trainer will have to contend with, not least the many Pidgeys and Spearows you‚Äôll come across in tall grass, whose Flying typing will provide a problem for anyone looking to grind their way to a high level. Thankfully, the amount of Ground and Rock types in caves will provide ample opportunity for Bulbasaur to wipe out entire bloodlines of Pokemon to gain a few XP. Also problematic are the frequent encounters with Blue, whose Pidgeot and Charmander will be a consistent issue, the latter of which can be helped by a Water type on your team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Bulbasaur, along with having well-balanced base stats, has the added bonus of evolving into Venasaur who also is a poison-type, giving him a solid advantage over the other two offerings from Professor Oak.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 2: Cyndaquil</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-cyndaquil-1745320920819.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version">Pokemon Gold</a> and Silver introduced just eight new Fire types to the series, in comparison to 10 Grass and 18 Water types. That minority means snapping up a powerful Fire Pokemon like Cyndaquil from the start adds a great deal of diversity to your team. More importantly, Cyndaquil proves to be the best matchup for the majority of gyms and Elite Four members that populate Johto. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bugsy‚Äôs (you guessed it) Bug type gym and Jasmine‚Äôs Steel type gym will easily fall before a few Embers and Flame Wheels from Cyndaquil and his subsequent evolutions. The same cannot be said for the cutest of the starters, Water type Totodile, with there being no Fire, Ground or Rock gyms for him to dismantle. Grass type Chikorita (or more likely her third form, Meganium) would have a field day in Pryce‚Äôs Water gym but would struggle with the early Bug and Flying type gyms as well as Morty‚Äôs Poison type gym. Pryce will pose a problem for Cyndaquil, and so you‚Äôll want to put together a well-balanced team to get you through that penultimate gym, but you‚Äôll have many hours to assemble the perfect group before that hurdle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also working in Cyndaquil‚Äôs favour are the Grass and Bug types dotted throughout the Elite Four‚Äôs roster. Though all four of these teams are well-balanced enough to give you trouble no matter who you pick as a starter, the many Poison types and Lance‚Äôs team of Dragon/Flying types makes this a no-go zone for Meganium. Meanwhile Totodile‚Äôs final evolution, Ferligator, would certainly hold its own against many of these Pokemon, but won‚Äôt blaze through a few like Typhlosion will. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking Cyndaquil does come with its issues. There will be many Rock and Ground Pokemon bothering you with random encounters in caves and Lance‚Äôs team containing a Charizard and a Gyrados will require some solid strategy to overcome, but the effects of these are much lesser compared to what ails Chikorita and Totodile. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 3: Mudkip</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-mudkip-1745320946409.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You might pick Mudkip because you just think he‚Äôs neat, but the reasons to go Water type for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ruby-version">Pokemon Ruby</a> and Sapphire run a bit deeper. In terms of gyms, Water type Mudkip has a bit of competition from the Grass type Treecko as both of them are super effective against three of the eight. They both have an advantage in Roxanne‚Äôs and Tate &amp; Liza‚Äôs Rock/Ground gyms, while Mudkip will be best suited to take on Flannery‚Äôs Fire gym and Treeko for Wallace‚Äôs Water gym. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time you get to Wallace, Treeko would have almost definitely evolved into Sceptile, as Sootopolis City houses the final gym. The significance of that can‚Äôt be understated, but Treeko‚Äôs Grass typing sees it at a disadvantage in battles with Flannery and with Winona‚Äôs Flying type lineup. Mudkip, on the other hand, will struggle with just the one gym ‚Äì Wattson‚Äôs (you guessed it) Electric type gym early on in Mauville City. Your third option, Torchic, doesn‚Äôt really enter the conversation here, with Fire types being super effective against none of the gyms and Fighting (a type gained by Torchic‚Äôs third form, Blazicken), only super effective against one, not to mention being at a massive disadvantage for Wallace‚Äôs battle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The makeup of the Elite Four can lend a slight advantage towards Treeko‚Äôs final form, Sceptile, as you come across Glacia‚Äôs Ice/Water Pokemon and a few Grass Pokemon along the way which will cause Swampert (Mudkip‚Äôs third evolution) some issues. However, as Mudkip evolves into its final form, it gains Ground typing and very nicely balanced stats which see it gain a huge defensive boost, becoming immune to Electric and its only weakness being Grass. This makes Swampert able to power through battles where it usually might be the underdog. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another consideration may be the amount of water present in the Hoenn region, meaning random encounters can be a bit of a grind, but Mudkip shows enough advantages in other areas to overcome that obstacle. Bonus points for being the cutest of the bunch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 4: Chimchar</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-chimchar-1745320985367.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Continuing the trend from the very first game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-diamond-version">Pokemon Diamond</a> and Pearl adds far fewer Fire type Pokemon to the series; just five in comparison to the14 introduced for Water and Grass. Though this isn‚Äôt a deciding factor in which starter to pick, it adds to the list of attributes going in Fire type Chimchar‚Äôs favour over Grass type Turtwig and Water type Piplup. Three is the magic number in terms of how many gyms a Pokemon needs to be super effective against to come out on top over its peers, and Chimchar‚Äôs Fire typing helps it overcome Gardenia‚Äôs Grass type gym, as well as the sixth and seventh gyms ran by Byron‚Äôs Steel types and Candice‚Äôs Ice types. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chimchar faces tough competition from Turtwig, who can eliminate Roark‚Äôs Rock type and Crasher Wake‚Äôs Water type gyms with ease. After evolving into Torterra, it also gains Ground typing, making it immune to Electric attacks which will see it waltz through the final gym owned by Volkner. Though they may seem perfectly matched, a lot of Turtwig‚Äôs strengths are most exemplified in the early stages of the game, while Chimchar‚Äôs abilities sees him primed for late game success.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming through the gyms with minimal fuss is important due to the Sinnoh region‚Äôs very well-balanced Elite Four. Chimchar‚Äôs final evolution, Infernape, is perfect to take on Aaron‚Äôs Bug Pokemon, which would be super effective against Torterra, but the Grass type would admittedly be best to dismantle Bertha‚Äôs Water and Ground types. Piplup, despite evolving into the very resilient Empoleon, doesn‚Äôt have a significant advantage over many of the gym leaders or the Elite Four to make a dent here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs a close matchup between Chimchar and Torterra, but due to the frequent battles with Team Galactic‚Äôs Bug types, the advantage falls with Chimchar, who has the gym battle credentials to back it up. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 5: Tepig</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-tepig-1745321009249.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Gen 5 makes for a more clean cut decision, with the Fire type Tepig making the biggest claim for being the smartest pick. Grass type Snivy doesn‚Äôt quite make the cut as it only has an advantage over just the one gym, nor any significant advantages over any Elite Four member, as well as being plagued by the various Bug and Flying types across the Unova region‚Äôs tall grass and boss battles. Water type Oshawott isn‚Äôt as embattled as Snivy, being the best choice to take on Clay‚Äôs Ground type gym and being resistant to Brycen‚Äôs Ice Pokemon, which are super effective against Snivy. But like the Grass type, there are no Elite Four members who lean into a type specifically tailored to Oshawott or its evolutions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Tepig‚Äôs Fire abilities, and its final form, Emboar, also being a Fighting type, allows it to have a smoother ride through Unova. Firstly, Burgh‚Äôs Bug gym and Brycen‚Äôs gym are light work for a Fire type, the latter being the penultimate gym in the game. Alternative solutions will need to be found to make it through Clay‚Äôs Ground-based gym, but the same can be said for Oshawott as it arrives in Elesa‚Äôs Electric gym. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elite Four battles are where Emboar‚Äôs Fighting type comes in handy, being super effective against Grimsley‚Äôs Dark type Pokemon. Emboar is admittedly vulnerable to Caitlin‚Äôs Psychic types, but if you have a strong enough bench, this battle can easily be overcome. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also working in Emboar‚Äôs favour are his strong attacking stats and the presence of Team Plasma, who have an abundance of Steel types. Having to fight the Elite Four twice makes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-black-version">Pokemon Black</a> and White a tough challenge no matter who you choose, but Tepig can put your mind at ease more often than the others. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 6: Fennekin</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-fennekin-1745321043423.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-x-version">Pokemon X</a> and Y continue the dominance of Fire types in this list. The sixth generation has a quirk where you can choose from two sets of starters, first between the new bunch of Chespin, Fennekin and Froakie, and later between the Kanto starters from the original games. For this list, we‚Äôll focus on the starters unique to this game, of which Fennekin is the standout. The Fire Pokemon can almost stroll through the gyms, being super effective against three and resistant to two more. Though two of those gyms are in the early stages of the game, the final three being Fairy, Psychic and Ice based means that Fennekin‚Äôs third evolution, Delphox, now imbued with Psychic typing, can head off to the Pokemon League relatively unscathed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Froakie evolves into Greninja, a Water/Dark type Pokemon, making it super effective against Olympia‚Äôs Psychic team but weak against Valerie‚Äôs Fairy types. Being a Water type mostly gets it into trouble, matching up poorly against Ramos‚Äô Grass types and Clemont‚Äôs Electric types, something Grant‚Äôs early Rock gym doesn‚Äôt make up for. Chespin‚Äôs story makes for similar reading, struggling off the bat with Viola‚Äôs Bug gym and going on to gain a Fighting typing after evolving into Chesnaught which leaves it at a disadvantage against Olmpia and Valerie. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the games progress, the Elite Fours get a bit more balanced. Pokemon X and Y is another example of a series of battles suited to a different type each time. You‚Äôll want Water to overcome Malva, Fire to overcome Wikstrom and Grass to overcome Siebold. Delphox just about has the edge, able to resist whatever Diantha‚Äôs Gardevoir throws at it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 7: Litten</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-litten-1745321072999.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out this Fire type four-peat is Litten from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-sun-version">Pokemon Sun</a> and Moon. Despite having to struggle through the first couple trials (the Alola region‚Äôs version of gyms, of which there are only seven), Litten is the obvious choice for the rest of the battles. Mallow‚Äôs Grass trial is the only lineup where each Pokemon is weak to Fire, but Sophocles‚Äô Electric gym contains two Steel types and a Bug type. And by the time you arrive at Acerola‚Äôs Ghost trial you could have evolved Litten into the Fire/Dark type Incineroar whose attacks will be super effective against the whole lineup, especially the Grass and Ice Pokemon in Acerola‚Äôs team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final trial, in which you must face Mina with her Fairy Pokemon, is a little more complicated because of Incineroar‚Äôs Dark typing. A regular Fire type would be able to resist Fairy attacks, but Incineroar is damaged normally by them. Helpfully, Mina has a Steel, Grass and Bug type in her team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Litten‚Äôs starter counterparts, Rowlet and Popplio, will find success with one of the first three trials, but will cease to have an advantage over any of the late game battles. Rowlet‚Äôs evolution, Decidueye, gains Ghost typing, which is a blessing and a curse for Acerola‚Äôs trial, but doesn‚Äôt garner much of an advantage elsewhere. Popplio evolves into the Water/Fairy type Primarina, but that doesn‚Äôt affect its fortunes with the trials at all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sun and Moon‚Äôs Elite Four are just a small fraction of what awaits you in the Pokemon League. After becoming champion yourself, you face challenges from 10 more trainers looking to take your place. These battles, on top of the Elite Four themselves, are too diverse for any starter to have any advantage over the other, meaning Litten‚Äôs ability to clear the trials is even more vital. The Alola region also introduces just eight Fire Pokemon in comparison to Grass and Water‚Äôs 13 (after the series had become more balanced in that regard) so snapping Litten up early is a great aid.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 8: Sobble</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-sobble-1745321095167.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sobble‚Äôs victory over Grookey and Scorbunny might be the closest of the lot. All three Pokemon are the best picks against three gyms, with Gordie and Raihan‚Äôs Rock and Ground gyms being perfect for Sobble and Grookey, and Melony‚Äôs Ice gym and Opal‚Äôs Fairy gym being tailor made for Scorbunny. Additionally, the first three gyms are Grass, Water and Fire typed, in that order, lending no advantage to any of the three starters. Raihan‚Äôs gym being the final one gives it a bit more importance, so the gym battles give a hair‚Äôs breadth of a lead to Grookey and Sobble. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Galar region‚Äôs version of the Elite Four, The Champion Cup, allows Sobble to just inch past Grookey in the standings. None of these Pokemon‚Äôs final evolutions gain any new types, making them work with what they‚Äôre given from the start. The semi-final opponents don‚Äôt lean any particular way, but Bede's Fairy Pokemon, followed by Nessa‚Äôs Water types and Raihan‚Äôs Fire and Ground heavy Dragon team, favour Fire, Grass and Water respectively. If success against the toughest opponents is most valued, then Sobble just about edges victory here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other considerations like the rivals, Team Yell, and random encounters are even less impactful than normal in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-sword">Pokemon Sword</a> and Shield. Team Yell uses mostly Dark types, which attack and defend normally against Fire, Water and Grass types, and the introduction of overworld Pokemon means random encounters happen less. If there‚Äôs any other factor that tips the scales towards Sobble, it would be that its final evolution, Inteleon, has a nicely balanced set of stats. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 9: Fuecoco</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-fuecoco-1745321116725.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The sixth Fire type to be chosen on this list is one of the clearest winners. You might think that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-scarlet">Pokemon Scarlet</a> and Violet‚Äôs focus on player freedom might allow for little separation between Sprigatito, Fuecoco and Quaxly ‚Äì You can do the gyms and raid Team Star bases in any order you like and you can avoid encounters with wild Pokemon almost entirely. But even with all of that, the Paldea region feels designed to be dominated by Fuecoco. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gyms in Scarlet and Violet don‚Äôt level scale, so if you have a bad matchup, you can just return once you‚Äôre able to power through a disadvantage. Still, the highest level gyms being Psychic/Fairy and Ice types, courtesy of Tulip and Grusha, and the two lowest level gyms being Katy and Brassius‚Äô Bug and Grass types, means there‚Äôs a good reason to go with Fuecoco (and its Ghost type final evolution, Skeledirge) regardless of your strategy. Being a water type, Quaxly isn‚Äôt strong against any gym until it reaches its third form, Quaquaval, where it becomes a Fighting type, helping it in Larry‚Äôs Normal type gym. Sprigatito fares a bit better, evolving into Grass/Dark type Meowscarada, enabling it to best Tulip‚Äôs gym and Ryme‚Äôs Ghost gym. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Team Star base raids place even more importance on what starter you pick, being vital to the story progression of the game. The crews based around Dark and Poison Pokemon have an abundance of Bug Pokemon who have to be cleared before you can face the boss, while crews based around Fairy and Fighting types are perfect for Skeledirge, who is immune to attacks from the latter. Quaquaval and Meowscarada are worthy opponents for the first member of the Elite Four, Rika and her Ground Pokemon, but from Poppy‚Äôs Steel team onwards, Skeledirge finds itself miles ahead of the competition. </p><div id="the-best-starter-pokemon" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Best Starter Pokemon</h3><h3>The Best Starter Pokemon</h3></p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yes, Oblivion is back, and so are those funny faces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>. Bethesda, however, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-comments-on-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-changes-we-never-wanted-to-remake-it"><u>has explained why it went down the remaster route</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda‚Äôs remaster gives Oblivion a new lick of paint, and while everything in the game looks a lot better than it did 20 years ago, there‚Äôs no getting away from that trademark Bethesda face jank.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, as is typically the case with Bethesda games, Oblivion Remastered‚Äôs character creator lets you create some outlandish faces. Some of these have already gone viral across social media, despite the remaster being less than 24 hours old. Here‚Äôs a snippet of our favorites:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">This is my magnum opus in Oblivion Remaster.

That‚Äôs probably because they rekindle memories of the original Fallout talking heads, which, at the time (late ‚Äò90s) looked impressive, but now look, well‚Ä¶ a bit like some of these Oblivion Remastered faces.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">oblivion so funny to me. we finally have the technology to recreate the og fallout talking head renders in real time <a href="https://t.co/SSG5iVLlKq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/SSG5iVLlKq</a></p>‚Äî ü¶áü©∏ùï∏ùñîùñìùñåùñóùñäùñëü©∏ü¶á (@FearMongrel) <a href="https://twitter.com/FearMongrel/status/1914804183661994018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">one thing that's pretty neat is that the way some faces are done in oblivion remastered is similar to faces in fallout 2 which means a fallout 3 remaster could look closer to fallout 2 and have WAY COOLER LOOKING GHOULS <a href="https://t.co/dHVawmh9cl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/dHVawmh9cl</a></p>‚Äî shley died from lavender town syndrome (sad!!)

What would be a big Bethesda game launch without some reliably old face jank? Veteran fans wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it really does look like Oblivion Remastered is a hit. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-launches-big-on-steam-and-its-only-going-to-get-bigger">On Steam it enjoyed an impressive peak concurrent player count of over 180,000 on release day</a> ‚Äî a figure that‚Äôs set to increase as the game heads into its first weekend on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got a comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil"><u>Interactive Map</u></a>, complete Walkthroughs for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Main_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>Main Questline</u></a> and every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Guilds"><u>Guild Quest</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Character_Building_Guide"><u>How to Build the Perfect Character</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/Things_to_Do_First_in_Oblivion"><u>Things to Do First</u></a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://x.com/CAMELCASTOff/status/1914797155300110786" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>@CAMELCASTOff</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
