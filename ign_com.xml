            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/an-item-duplication-glitch-in-elden-ring-nightreign-makes-it-easier-to-share-the-wealth<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has some pretty sick gear drops. And sometimes, you might even want to let other people try out that gear, even though you want to also use them. Well, a gear duplication glitch makes it easy to share the loot, for as long as it's around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I first saw this thanks to the folks at <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-has-a-new-exploit-which-allows-you-and-your-friends-to-duplicate-weapons-and-talismans-until-youre-just-as-godly-as-the-nightlords/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>, who put together a quick guide on just how to tackle the duplication. It's actually fairly simple to execute; if two players try to pick up the same weapon, at the same time, they both pick it up. So now you have the original, and a duplicate. (Don't ask which is which, it'll freak everyone out.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is this fairly simple, it's easy to repeat and there isn't really a downside to "failing" it. If the pick-up gets messed up, you can just try again. In fact, the only danger is that you're basically stopping in one place and coordinating this drop-and-pick-up strategy, and in Nightreign, standing still is rarely advisable. The brief respite between days, or the alabaster alcove before the big Nightlord showdown, is probably the best time to do this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As PC Gamer noted though, they're not the first to stumble onto this trick. Various <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDUPxRrjWR0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTubers</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lbfy3z/duplicating_items/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> users have posted about the easy duplication, too. The proverbial lid is off on this particular exploit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether FromSoftware will take any aim at changing it is anyone's guess. It is somewhat niche-use. There's no voice chat or anything to coordinate with random players online, so it's not exactly feasible to start dropping your best equipment and hope everyone's on the same page.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even for teamed-up players using Discord or some other method to chat, you'd still want to have equipment that other characters would want. Not only is Elden Ring Nightreign fairly generous in drops, at least in my experience, but each character tends to have their own wants and needs for weaponry. Unless you're rolling three Ironeyes, I suppose. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The duplication glitch is nice for characters who want to double-up on specific weapons, like the Executor, but it's not some instant-win trick. For some fun and maybe sharing the wealth around if someone didn't manage to get any solid weapons by the final day, though, it might not be the worst trick to keep in your back pocket.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Eventually, he will start humming a familiar tune — yes, this is Yoshi singing Totaka's Song.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was idling on the Character Select screen when I noticed Mario began humming after enough time passed," wrote reddit user charizardtelephone. "I thought, 'Huh, they could totally hide hidden tunes like that.' Wait. Hidden music? In a Nintendo game? With Yoshi? It was too good to be true."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can take a listen to Yoshi humming Totaka's Song below:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Legendary Japanese video game composer Kazumi Totaka has included versions of the melody in various games he has contributed to, both as composer and as the voice/noises of Yoshi himself. From Super Smash Bros. to Wii Sports, Animal Crossing to Pikmin, Totaka's Song is somewhere inside them all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After a few seconds, lo and behold, Yoshi begins humming Totaka's Song like the idle Yoshis do in Mario Kart 8," charizardtelephone continued, detailing the song's discovery in Mario Kart World. "Very cool Easter egg. Not sure if anyone else has noticed it yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-is-selling-faster-than-og-switch-launch-title-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-in-japan">Mario Kart World is currently beating the physical sales of Switch 1 launch title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> earned back at Nintendo's last console launch.
