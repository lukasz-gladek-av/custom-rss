            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ataris-gamestation-go-rolls-the-trak-ball-paddle-and-keypad-controllers-into-one-handheld-console<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Atari has teased a re-reveal of its handheld console at CES 2025 next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a tweet, below, Atari showed off the GameStation Go device, a portable video game player with extra buttons and a widescreen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Gamestation Go comes complete with the d-pad, face buttons, and shoulder buttons you'd expect on a retro handheld, what makes this stand out is the inclusion of a Trak-Ball<strong> </strong>and Paddle on the left of the device, and a Keypad on the right.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">An icon, reimagined. üïπÔ∏è <a href="https://twitter.com/MyArcadeRetro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MyArcadeRetro</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Atari?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Atari</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GamestationGo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GamestationGo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CES2025</a> <a href="https://t.co/AvqTLuegR2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/AvqTLuegR2</a></p>‚Äî Atari (@atari) <a href="https://twitter.com/atari/status/1874833151580618839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">There‚Äôs little else to go on at this stage, but the GameStation Go looks like the final design for a product Atari revealed a year ago. At the time the handheld was called the Atari Gamestation Portable and was due out during the fourth quarter of 2024 priced $149. This earlier version came with the Atari Trak-Ball, Paddle, and Keypad controllers, and we can see a refined design for these in the GameStation Go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Atari Trak-Ball is commonly used with arcade classics Centipede and Missile Command, with the Paddle used for the likes of Breakout. Atari games such as Brain Games and Codebreaker use the Keypad. The My Arcade logo is on the bottom of the device, which confirms the maker of the product under official license from Atari.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You'd expect the Gamestation Go to play a long list of retro games bolstered by Atari's recent aquisition of the Intellivision brand and certain games from Intellivision Entertainment LLC. The purchase included the rights to more than 200 titles from the Intellivision portfolio and the Intellivision trademarks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That‚Äôs all we have for now. Expect more when CES 2025 kicks off from January 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-wins-igns-2024-peoples-choice-tournament<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The tournament started with 64 entries and crowned one fan-voted champion.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There were some incredible games released this year, and we wanted to know which you thought was the best of the best. So with our partners at Truth, we picked 64 of 2024‚Äôs best games, put them in a head-to-head tournament, and gave you the power to vote for your favorites. After six rounds of voting and more than 1 million votes in all, one game reigned supreme as champion: Black Myth: Wukong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An action game from developer Game Science, Black Myth: Wukong is inspired by the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. You play as the Destined One, an anthropomorphic monkey based on Sun Wukong from the novel. You wield a staff with different stances, have access to several magic spells, and can transform into enemies after defeating them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc"><u>IGN‚Äôs review</u></a>, we cited its fantastic combat, beautiful environments, and well-designed bosses as the areas where it shines. While it may not be a soulslike, its combat can be quite challenging and forces you to weave together quick reflexes, smart resource management, and versatile attacks to take down its many bosses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Myth: Wukong‚Äôs popularity was obvious from the very start of our fan-voted tournament. It had a dominant run, culminating in a win over Marvel Rivals in the final with 59% of the vote. Before that, it had to get through Harry Potter: Quidditch Championship, Star Wars Outlaws, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, Stellar Blade, and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, beating all of them with at least 67% of the vote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals‚Äô run to the final was more contested, with it barely beating out the Silent Hill 2 remake in the semifinals and Astro Bot in the quarterfinals, which was one of the closest matchups of the whole tournament. There were more than 50,000 votes cast in that matchup, and Marvel Rivals won by only 960. Before those close calls, it had to get through some stiff competition in World of Warcraft: The War Within, Batman: Arkham Shadow, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN‚Äôs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2024"><u>pick for Best Game of 2024</u></a> went to Metaphor: ReFantazio, but it didn‚Äôt make it out of the first round of the People‚Äôs Choice Tournament. Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership took it down before falling to Black Myth: Wukong in its path to the title. Indie darling Balatro, one of IGN‚Äôs runners-up for Best Game of 2024 and winner of our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-game-of-2024"><u>Best PC Game of 2024 Award</u></a>, also had a surprisingly short run. After narrowly defeating Still Wakes the Deep in the first round, it got only 26% of the vote in Round 2 against Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 had a very impressive run overall, taking down multiple big names on its way to the Final Four. In addition to its resounding win over Balatro, it also defeated Sons of the Forest, Dragon‚Äôs Dogma 2, and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, another of IGN‚Äôs runners-up for Best Game of 2024. The other member of the Final Four was Silent Hill 2, which won the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-horror-game-of-2024"><u>IGN Award for Best Horror Game of 2024</u></a>. It got to the semifinals by going through Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, Helldivers 2, Luigi‚Äôs Mansion 2 HD, and Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thank you to the many people who logged votes in this year‚Äôs People‚Äôs Choice Tournament. Let us know in the comments below what you think of the outcome. If you disagree with the winner, which game would you have chosen? And here‚Äôs to another great year of gaming in 2025!</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
