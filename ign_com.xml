As with other cuts at EA, those impacted will be given the opportunity to apply for other roles internally prior to being let go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we’ve made select changes within our organization that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth," an EA spokesperson said in an official statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are treating our people with care and respect throughout this process, working to minimize impacts by helping affected employees explore new opportunities within the company when possible and providing support during the transition."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The roughly 100 jobs impacted at Respawn included individuals in development, publishing, and QA workers on Apex Legends, as well as smaller groups of individuals working on the Jedi team and two canceled incubation projects, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-has-quietly-canceled-a-multiplayer-fps-incubation-project">one of which we reported on back in March,</a> and the other of which was, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTk1MzQ2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2NTU4MjY4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVkhVQjFUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Ok9U1G-8KnrQWSRme5JF1VqfCPIxgENs3iq9d32PeRc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">per Bloomberg's reporting</a>, a new Titanfall game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cuts follow a number of other layoffs over the last few years at EA, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">elimination of 50 jobs at BioWare</a> in 2023 and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs">unknown number more at Codemasters</a>, and in 2024 a larger restructuring that resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">670 workers</a> laid off company-wide, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-hit-by-layoffs-amid-eas-ongoing-reductions">around two dozen workers at Respawn.</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has canceled another incubation project at Respawn Entertainment today, and simultaneously laid off a number of individuals across its incubation, Apex Legends, and Star Wars: Jedi teams, IGN has learned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post today from the studio, Respawn announced it has "made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects and make some targeted team adjustments across Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi." One of these canceled incubation projects is the same one <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-has-quietly-canceled-a-multiplayer-fps-incubation-project">already reported on back in March</a>. The other, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reports</a>, was an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe, code-named R7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These decisions aren’t easy, and we are deeply grateful to every teammate affected — their creativity and contributions have helped build Respawn into what it is today," the post continued. "We’re offering meaningful support to those impacted, including exploring new opportunities within EA."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN understands that roughly 100 individuals are affected by the changes, including a mix of developers, publishing, and QA workers on Apex Legends, as well as smaller groups of individuals on the Jedi team and on the incubation projects. IGN also understands that at least some, though not all, of the developers from the incubation project reported on in March have already been moved to work on Iron Man at EA Motive, Battlefield, and other projects. When asked, EA declined to comment on the exact number of individuals impacted, saying it is offering impacted individuals 30 days to find a new opportunity inside the organization and is endeavoring to find roles for as many individuals as it can internally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Internally at Respawn, work will continue on Apex Legends as well as the game's next iteration, the next entry in the Star Wars: Jedi franchise, and support on the upcoming Bit Reactor Star Wars game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-zero-company-officially-revealed-with-2026-release-window">Star Wars: Zero Company</a>. EA declined to say whether or not any other incubation projects are currently in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these changes, Respawn SVP of operations Daniel Suarez is being elevated to general manager of Respawn, and will report directly to Vince Zampella. Previously, Zampella served as GM of Respawn, the studio he founded, in addition to his role as head of the Battlefield franchise. Zampella will continue as group GM and EVP overseeing both Battlefield and Respawn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-isnt-doing-the-business-for-ea-so-its-making-apex-legends-20-to-come-out-after-battlefield">just last February</a>, EA told investors that Apex Legends was "not headed in the direction that we have wanted" and hadn't been for some time. CEO Andrew Wilson said that Respawn is currently working on a major update, dubbed "Apex 2.0".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our expectation is that Apex will also be one of those franchises and that sometime on a longer-term time horizon, there will be an even bigger, more meaningful update to that broader game experience, an Apex 2.0, if you will. This will not be the final incarnation of Apex," Wilson said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These changes continue a trend at EA of canceled projects, layoffs, and restructuring that's been going on for several years now. It began in 2023 with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">elimination of 50 jobs at BioWare</a> and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs">unknown number more at Codemasters</a>, and continued when EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">laid off 670 workers</a> company-wide, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-hit-by-layoffs-amid-eas-ongoing-reductions">around two dozen workers at Respawn,</a> and canceled several projects. More recently, EA restructured BioWare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">moving developers to other projects</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">laying off others</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip? Send it to rvalentine@ign.com.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>A previous version of this article erroneously stated that around 100 people are employed at Respawn. This has been amended above and in the headline. The piece has also been updated to add more detail about ongoing projects at Respawn and developer re-allocation.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s for up to three players (you can play solo with two bots, like in the PvE Operations mode), and, as you’d expect, you fight increasingly difficult waves of Tyranids and Chaos. Your class and weapon levels are based on your PvE levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Difficulty will increase for each wave defeated, so you’ll have to prepare yourself accordingly to vaporize as many waves as you can,” Focus and Saber said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The companies also offered a first look, below, at the Horde mode map, which takes place in Kadaku. Kadaku is the Imperial Jungle World Space Marine 2 players will already be familiar with. The Horde Mode release date is yet to be announced, but it sounds like it’s not too far off.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/sm2-1745946503242.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">That's a big gun on Kadaku. Image credit: focus Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what else Patch 8 will bring, Focus and Saber players can expect more free and premium DLC, including a Blood Angels cosmetic pack, a White Scars Champion Pack, and a rebalancing of the Absolute difficulty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had indicated that they wanted Absolute difficulty to be even tougher in order to differentiate it more from Lethal difficulty, and it sounds like that’s on the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Last month, we did a community poll on Focus Together to collect your feedback and see what you were interested to see on the Absolute difficulty to differentiate it more from Lethal,” Focus and Saber said. “You will see the changes we made as part of the 8.0 update. Expect an even tougher challenge!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect a lot more from Patch 8, the companies said. PTS players will be able to test Patch 8 before it's released.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Focus and Saber had previously confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-moves-to-set-the-record-straight-insists-its-not-abandoning-the-game-following-space-marine-3-announcement"><u>Space Marine 2 </u><u><em>is </em></u><u>getting a new class</u></a>, but there’s no mention of it in the Patch 8 post. Most assume it will be the Apothecary, as close to a medic class as Space Marines have. But there is hope that it could be the Librarian, which would mean super cool warp-powered space magic. Also confirmed coming are new PvE operations and melee weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot happening in the world of Space Marine 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive"><u>despite the surprise announcement that development of Space Marine 3 development had begun</u></a>.

With more than 25,000 people already jumping on it, I would not sit on this too long.</p></div><p id="charizard-ex-super-premium"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Charizard Ex Super-Premium">Pokémon TCG Charizard Ex Super-Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="69f51126-8354-46ab-b22b-cabdf67d8cf0" id="219757"><div id="219757" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG Charizard Ex Super-Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have been trying to land the Charizard ex Super-Premium Collection without paying scalper prices, this is probably your moment. Sam's Club has it for $49.94, and in my opinion, that is about as good as it gets without waiting for some mythical clearance event. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You are getting ten booster packs, three promo cards, a Charizard figure, and a code card for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-game-sale-switch-2-woot">Pokémon</a> TCG Live.
