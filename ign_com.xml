Under normal circumstances it lets each player who does well enough to appear on the podium perform an emote, most of which are either toxic or hilarious depending on your point of view.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6 isn’t the first Call of Duty to feature The Winner’s Circle mechanic, as it’s appeared in the likes of Black Ops 3, Infinite Warfare, and WWII. But it’s impact feels particularly pronounced this year, and the debate around it was only exacerbated by the recent release of fan-favorite map Nuketown, which in addition to the Play of the Game and the Winner’s Circle, shows a short cutscene of the map getting nuked before players return to the lobby.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/05/call-of-duty-20241105104414-1730804227350.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Winner's Circle has proved divisive.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of issues players have brought up with Black Ops 6’s Winner’s Circle. The main one is the time it takes to view: players have to sit through the Winner’s Circle whether they make the cut or not, and the handful of seconds it lasts can feel like an age when all you want to do is get into another match or check your loadout. Because of this, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1f61rz0/the_winners_circle_is_so_fucking_goofy_please_let/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some players have called on Treyarch to add a skip button or even pull the Winner's Circle from the game entirely</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the issue of toxicity, with some saying the ability to taunt your opponent after a victory discourages them from continuing to play having just lost a game. The slow camera zoom into the top player's face doesn't help matters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-all-the-changes-coming-to-multiplayer-for-launch-based-on-feedback-to-the-beta">Treyarch actually nerfed the Winner’s Circle following feedback from the Black Ops 6 beta</a> so it had a shorter overall duration and “mitigated emote spam” for launch. During those preview weekends, players were able to spam emotes in the Winner’s Circle, which was certainly more frustrating to watch. Currently, you’re only able to trigger one emote. Or at least, you’re only supposed to be able to trigger one emote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have worked out that they can still spam emotes here by quickly pausing and unpausing the game. Doing this, they’re able to fit in a few emotes into the Winner’s Circle before it closes, which, yeah, is pretty annoying to watch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But! If you’re sick of watching the shenanigans that go on in the Winner’s Circle, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1gj6dx2/pro_tip_you_can_close_the_winners_circle_by_going/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players have worked out they can make the player avatars disappear by heading to the in-game social tab</a>. This doesn’t make the Winner’s Circle go away any quicker, but it does get rid of the emotes, if you’re feeling particularly put out by them. It’s a bizarre glitch that Treyarch will probably patch out at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been interesting to see how players have reacted to the Winner’s Circle since Black Ops 6’s explosive launch. Some have said they don’t mind it, given <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1gj6dx2/comment/lvb0lmr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it provides them with a bit of time to check their phone</a> before being thrust into the next match (modern gaming!). Others really, <em>really</em> hate it, and want to skip it at all costs. “Goofy” is a word I’ve seen tossed about by many in response to these emotes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the ongoing debate about Black Ops 6’s Winner’s Circle, it seems unlikely that Treyarch will strip it out of the game or even let players skip it. It provides an opportunity to show off players’ elaborate and often costly cosmetics, including premium emotes, to all players still in the lobby — and we all know how crucial cosmetics sales are to Activision’s bottom line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re jumping into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Essential Multiplayer Tips and Tricks</a> to help you get started.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/as-the-world-waits-for-nintendo-to-announce-switch-2-sales-of-the-switch-continue-to-plummet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has slashed its forecast for Switch sales this financial year amid growing anticipation for the announcement of the Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, November 5, Nintendo cut its Switch sales projection for the financial year ending March 2025 from 13.5 million units to 12.5 million units, with the console now in its eighth year on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo also cut its forecasts for sales (1.35 trillion yen down to 1.28 trillion yen) and operating profit (400 billion yen to 360 billion yen).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has said it will announce the Switch successor at some point during the current financial year, which means fans can expect to hear more before April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the second quarter of the current financial year (July to September 2024), Nintendo generated 276.7 billion yen ($1.8 billion) in revenue and a net profit of 27.7 billion yen ($182 million). That’s a 17% revenue drop and a whopping 69% profit drop versus the same quarter last financial year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that last year was a big one for Nintendo, with the release of the Super Mario Bros. Movie and The Legend of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom breaking records. This year, however, has been notably lighter for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo sold 4.72 million Switch units in the six months ending September 30, down from the 6.84 million sold during the same period last year. That’s a drop of 31%. Software unit sales were down nearly 28% year-on-year to 70.28 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Unit sales of both hardware and software were extremely high for the first half of the previous fiscal year," Nintendo said, pointing to the Mario movie’s positive impact on its video game business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There were no such special factors in the first half of this fiscal year, and with Nintendo Switch now in its eighth year since launch, unit sales of both hardware and software decreased significantly year-on-year," Nintendo added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the financials, Nintendo provided sales updates for its recently released games. Paper Mario Thousand-Year Door, released in May, sold 1.94 million units, Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, released in June, sold 1.57 million units, and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, released in September, “got off to a good start,” Nintendo said, with sales of 2.58 million units. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to sell incredibly well, with another 2.31 million units. It’s now up to an eye-watering 64.27 million sold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, Nintendo failed to say anything about the Switch 2, but did say it plans to continue to push the Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“By continuing to convey the appeal of Nintendo Switch, we try to not only put one system in every home, but several in every home, or even one for every person,” Nintendo said. “Another objective is to continually release new offerings so more consumers keep playing Nintendo Switch even longer and we can maximize hardware sales.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming Switch games include Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership later this week, and Donkey Kong Country Returns HD in January 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Anusak Laowilas/NurPhoto via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
