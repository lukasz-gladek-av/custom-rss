            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Try your hand at a five-team race for dominance.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming multiteam MOBA game Project ZETA announced today that signups are open for its next beta test, which will begin on Steam on December 12. This final closed beta will be the last chance to jump in early before the game goes public, and the developers have asked for opinionated players to help shape its future.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/1-zeta-shot-010-bi-lb-1764716012578.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not already familiar with Project ZETA, we can catch you up to speed. Developed by Nirvanana, a team built of former Eternal Return devs, it mixes up the traditional MOBA formula in two key ways. First, instead of the standard of having two teams go head-to-head, it pits five teams against each other at the same time in a race to capture Prisms, the game’s most precious resource. There are multiple ways to get Prisms, giving each team the opportunity to follow different paths to victory. And second, it uses a third-person camera rather than an isometric one, making combat more dynamic and action-focused.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That combat is PvPvE, with monsters and bosses populating the map. Defeating monsters will score you XP and shards, which can upgrade your abilities and provide buffs to your stats, cooldowns, and more. Defeating bosses gets you all of that plus Prisms. However, just picking up a Prism isn’t enough, you need to return it to the center of the map in order for it to actually count toward your score.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/2-zeta-shot-020-bi-lb-1764716056984.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where the PvP comes in. Competing teams can ambush you on your way to deposit your Prisms and steal them from you. And that looming threat constantly affects the strategy your team chooses. Do you blitz bosses and try to rush their Prisms to the center of the map to win quickly? Do you bide your time, taking down monsters to scale your team's power and enter the next fight better prepared? Or do you lie in wait near the center of the map to pounce on opposing teams and take their Prisms after they’ve already done the work for you?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/02/3-zeta-shot-030-bi-lb-1764716093527.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">These are all viable strategies, but the reality is within one match you’ll jump between all three. In Project ZETA, strategies shift dynamically from one moment to the next. With five teams roaming the Aran Plateau, improvisation matters most. Focus too much on one adversary and another might stab you in the back, or worse, run up the score to take a commanding lead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your strategy will also be driven by the heroes your team members choose. There are currently 13 heroes, with more to be revealed in the future, and they’re grouped into four categories: Fighter, Marksman, Assassin, and Mage. Each hero has unique abilities that can synergize with other heroes, some of which can trigger devastating multikills if you pull them off at the right time.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/7-zeta-shot-090-bi-lb-1764782232839.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been six months since Project ZETA’s second closed beta, and a lot has changed in that time. In fact, it’s been the period with the biggest advancements in the game to date. There are two new heroes, reworked visuals and abilities for most heroes, new game-changing equipables, revamped environments, simplified Prism scoring, team respawn fixes, and lots more, all based on player feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final beta test will offer another chance to provide more feedback and further enhance the game. Anyone in North America or Europe can sign up for it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778110/?utm_source=na&amp;utm_campaign=ign&amp;utm_medium=cbt3&amp;utm_content=NAign" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>on Steam</u></a>, and both regions will have devoted servers running on two weekends: the first will be December 12–14, and the second will be December 19–21. For those who can’t stop playing, there will also be a custom game server that will stay live for the entirety of the beta, from December 12–21.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/6-zeta-shot-070-bi-lb-1764782127541.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Project ZETA is also available to wishlist on Steam, and if you want the latest info and updates, you can join the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/zetathegame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Discord server</a>, follow on <a href="https://x.com/ZETAtheGame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zetathegame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Facebook</a>, or check out its <a href="https://zeta.krafton.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">official website</a>.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/moba-project-zeta-announces-signups-are-open-for-final-closed-beta]]></content:encoded>
