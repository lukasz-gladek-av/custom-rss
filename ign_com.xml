            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-the-final-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jurassic-world-evolution-3-the-final-preview.1312522/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">While I've spent dozens of hours building my perfect dino park in Jurassic World Evolution 2, Frontier's prehistoric series always felt like it was sort of a younger sibling to their other park-builders, Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster. There are a lot of features in those two games that didn't make it into the first two Evolution entries. So when I got to play Jurassic World Evolution 3, I was most excited to see that it finally seems like a fully-fledged member of the Frontier flock, with the extremely deep customization and personalization features I've come to expect from the studio. Oh yeah, and the baby dinosaurs are pretty dang cute, too.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Spared No Expense</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Evolution 3's story takes place some time after Jurassic World: Dominion, at a point where dinosaurs reintroduced to the wild in the previous films are struggling to adapt and survive on their own. That brings us as park managers to work with the Dinosaur Integration Network, seeking to help them thrive and, let's be honest, make a tidy profit showing them off to people who definitely, probably, are not going to get eaten. I mean it's honestly very uncommon at this point, and we've learned a lot over the years from myriad disasters, but we are still going to need you to sign this waiver.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And the dinosaurs we'll help to integrate have definitely never looked better, both in terms of textures and animations. Some of them are still stuck with their 1993 designs based on what is at this point 30-year-old paleontology, which is a bit of a shame to me as someone who likes to keep up-to-date on these things. But I suppose you couldn't really make a Jurassic game without the distinctive creature designs from the films, and there are also some more scientifically accurate models like the gorgeous Utahraptor, joining the base game here after becoming the breakout star of Evolution 2's DLC.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The marquee feature for Evolution 3 is the breeding system and juvenile dinosaurs. And they are, as you’d guess, super cute.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the marquee feature for Evolution 3 is the breeding system and juvenile dinosaurs. And they are, as you’d guess, super cute. It's not just the babies adding variety to the roster, though, since adult males and females can now sport subtle differences in size and body shape as well. You can even customize the skin patterns for males and females separately to more easily tell them apart. And this means group dynamics need to be carefully managed, too, since different species will require different ratios of males to females to be content. Some can get along with more than one male in the same enclosure, while others can't. And most species will not like being segregated by sex, so you'll want at least one of each.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Next Generation</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Breeding will also be central to the management gameplay, with the ability to raise a dinosaur's appeal rating by selecting parents with high ratings. You can even breed for specific traits, like a longer lifespan or the ability to coexist with other species more peacefully. Otherwise, wellbeing is a pretty straightforward matter of making sure the dinos have enough space, food, water, and their preferred terrain mix. Smaller herbivores like low ground cover, whereas some flying species actually prefer a barren landscape they can easily scan from above. There's also an added consideration of nest placement, since some species won't, well, do the deed if pesky little mammals with their funny flashing rectangles are watching. You should at least have to pay extra for that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I didn't have enough time in my 90-minute demo to really dig super deep into this. I didn't get a great idea of how the financial management side is balanced, either. We did get to see a little bit of the campaign layer, though, which featured maps based on the Southwestern US, Hawaii, and Western China. And these maps look truly stunning even without prehistoric beasts wandering around them, showing off dramatic elevation changes, towering waterfalls, and unique vegetation. I especially enjoyed the one set in China's Sichuan Basin, which mixed the architecture of an alpine ski resort with the new East Asian building theme and a focus on flying species.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The basic routine feels pretty similar to Evolution 2 overall. You hire scientists, send them out on digs to collect DNA, synthesize new species, then let them out into the enclosure. It's at that point your breeding program takes over, which is the way to attain the highest appeal ratings. Naturally-bred dinosaurs are more interesting to guests than artificially incubated ones, which increases with the number of generations they have been breeding on their own. It's a bit of a challenge at first, since the low compatibility between artificially-incubated males and females makes producing viable offspring more difficult and time-consuming. But this compatibility can be improved over succeeding generations with help from your genetics team.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">All Systems Online</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Your scientists will also be responsible for researching new dig sites, enclosures, guest amenities, park administration buildings, and all the usual stuff. Each has a skill rating in three different areas and a special trait, like making expeditions faster or incubations cheaper, and demands a salary based on their proficiency. I did find it somewhat difficult to get a good spread of skills with the five slots and limited budget I was given, and I'm not sure if staff can develop new skills over time yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Managing the park requires ranger teams to visit enclosures and observe each animal to give you data on their physical and mental state, and you could be missing a major problem brewing if you don't set up your patrol routes well. You'll also need to provide camera coverage across your fence lines, or else you won't be notified if someone starts trying to chew a hole in one. Again, this is rare, but please, you came all this way, so you might as well sign the waiver.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the bulk of the new stuff doesn't have anything to do with directly controlling capture and repair teams, which is still pretty cool. It doesn't even have to do with dinosaur breeding. It's the rich wealth of customization options now available. Terraforming is extremely powerful, with tons of tools that each have plenty of settings for raising, lowering, smoothing, adding noise, and creating ramps. You can paint custom ground textures. You can even build enclosures that use steep cliff edges instead of fences as part of their design to keep the dinos in.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Land Before Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The way water works is a little bit strange. Aquatic species use their own dedicated lagoons, which is a whole other thing. But simply placing ground water isn't quite the same as it is in other park-builders. You can't just build a giant pit and fill it up to a certain height with water. Rather, ground water requires a flat surface as a starting point, and the depth is fixed using the water tool. This does let you create some fairly deep areas for semiaquatic species to wade and fish in. It looks nice! It's just not quite as flexible as what you can do on dry land, and took a bit of getting used to.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But when it comes to buildings, I was almost overwhelmed with all the new options. Similar to Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster, Jurassic World Evolution 3 contains all the rotatable, resizeable, and recolorable building pieces to create just about anything you can imagine. Even the pre-made structures include the ability to select, remove, copy, and remix existing pieces down to the smallest bits like roof corners and floor tiles. Windows can even be edited to make it look like there are various different kinds of shops inside when you really zoom in for a peek.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The editing tools are quite impressive and generally pretty easy to use.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, the editing tools are quite impressive and generally pretty easy to use. It was a ton of fun to mess around with, even in the very limited amount of time I had, and I can't wait to see what other people who are more creatively skilled than me can do with them – especially since you'll be able to upload your creations to share with other players. And if you don't have the time to custom-build absolutely everything, there are several different pre-made building themes to pick from, including the East Asian-inspired set that I especially enjoyed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just about everything I've seen so far of Jurassic World Evolution 3 has me excited to thrill my guests and make my lawyers nervous (seriously, we do need you to sign that waiver). From dino breeding to dramatic and different new park locations to extremely robust customization tools, it feels like it truly deserves its spot at the table with Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster now, rather than relying on the, you know, freakin' dinosaurs to make up for some of what it was missing. We'll be able to decide whether or not to endorse this park in its entirety on October 21.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Target acquired.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has warned PC gamers that they will not be able to play <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> during the beta and at launch if they do not enable TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like rival shooter Battlefield 6, TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are required for Black Ops 7 to run on PC as part of strict anti-cheat measures. These features block modified hardware and unauthorized software, with the goal of creating a fair, secure environment for all players even as cheaters ramp up their efforts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Activision has said it’s well aware Call of Duty cheaters will hammer on the Black Ops 7 beta, insisting: “that’s exactly what we want.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new blog post</a>, Activision suggested PC gamers enable both TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot now to be ready on day one, with the Black Ops 7 beta set to kick off on October 2 for those with early access, then October 5 in open beta form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, some Battlefield 6 players ran into issues enabling TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, preventing them from playing on PC. Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-really-sucks-battlefield-6-technical-director-bummed-out-about-those-unable-to-play-due-to-secure-boot-requirement-believes-anti-cheat-cat-and-mouse-game-will-never-end" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>, Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl lamented the situation. "The fact is I wish we didn't have to do things like Secure Boot," Buhl said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It does prevent some players from playing the game. Some people's PCs can't handle it and they can't play; that really sucks. I wish everyone could play the game with low friction and not have to do these sorts of things."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Maps</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Enabling Secure Boot involves tinkering with a part of a computer not all PC gamers will be instantly familiar with: the BIOS. You need to make sure your Windows disk is GPT and not MBR (not everyone will know what these are), too. All this before you can even enable Secure Boot — and then you may not be able to enable it anyway, which then means you need to refer to your manufacturer for guidance. While this won’t be a problem for more experienced PC gamers, it will be an intimidating process for some.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps with this in mind, <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/trusted-platform-module-and-secure-boot" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activision has released guides to help Call of Duty players enable TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot</a>, including BIOS updates for the top 10 motherboard makers used by Call of Duty players. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, these requirements will combine with our newest RICOCHET Anti-Cheat upgrades,” Activision said. “At that point, we will introduce a remote verification system (known as Remote Attestation) to provide the strongest safeguard possible. This type of attestation is the most secure method of validation, more stringent than the client or local attestation methods found in other games, allowing us to validate TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot settings with Microsoft Azure servers in the cloud.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This creates a tougher environment for cheats to operate in and ensures that the protections these features detect cannot be bypassed or spoofed, which would be possible if we used local verification on a player’s PC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our layered defense that combines TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, and RICOCHET Anti-Cheat’s upgraded detection systems delivers our most advanced anti-cheat protection yet, safeguarding fair play across Call of Duty.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision continued: “We're setting a new standard for gaming security. TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are not optional; they are the foundation of our multifaceted defense system, and with your help, they ensure a fair and secure experience for everyone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty has a reputation for cheating, especially with the free-to-download battle royale Warzone. Activision has spent a significant amount of time, money, and energy in response, even taking on cheat makers in court, although it, like all video game developers, faces an uphill battle in the war on cheaters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Activision knows cheaters will descend upon the Black Ops 7 beta (despite it being a beta, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-are-already-worried-about-cheating-in-the-modern-warfare-3-beta">it happens with Call of Duty every year</a>, and indeed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cheaters-already-spotted-in-battlefield-6-open-beta-despite-secure-boot-requirement">the Battlefield 6 beta suffered the same fate</a>). In the blog post, Activision welcomed the onslaught that is to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Cheaters will try to test the limits during the Beta. That’s exactly what we want because #TeamRICOCHET is here, watching, learning, and removing them as they appear," Activision said. "Any account permanently banned for cheating during the Beta will be banned across all Call of Duty titles, from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to future releases.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Activision has highlighted its new aimbot detection, which it said is “one of the strongest detection systems we have ever built,” and its new wall hacking detections, “making it harder for cheaters who manipulate the game to see enemies through surfaces harder to escape detection.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-reveal-highlights-include-futuristic-tech-18-maps-and-travis-scott">all the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 multiplayer details announced so far</a> to find out what to expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
