            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was a kid, we always had our own homemade version of an Advent calendar. It was a sort of tapestry that my mom had sewn together and she would drop little surprises in each pocket for every day of December. Now that I'm an adult with a kid of my own, this is a tradition I really want to continue with my son. Since my sewing skills are severely lacking, I've been really happy to see how much things have advanced in the Advent calendar market since my childhood. There's even a Clue Advent calendar now apparently, which seems like a cool way to make new holiday memories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This version of the classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board game</a> is an interesting take on the tradition. Instead of a little treat each day, you get a new clue to help you solve a murder. It's something the whole family can partake in or you can enjoy on your own.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Clue Advent Calendar: Secrets of Snowfall</h2><div catalogid="32ea85e6-204d-4404-a416-1d2010930fc2" id="226899"><div id="226899" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Clue Advent Calendar: Secrets Under Snowfall</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Who killed Boddy Black at his winter gala?</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This unique 2025 Advent calendar is now available to buy on Amazon for $29.99. According to the description for it, this game includes 24 days of clues and puzzles all connected to a larger mystery. The calendar itself opens up like a book to reveal a crime board and a map of the mansion. Players have to work together to unfold the mystery of who killed Boddy Black at his winter gala as each day as you open up each daily clue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest downside of this game is that you'll only be able to play it once. Unlike other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-murder-mystery-board-games">murder mystery games</a> that you can pass to other friends or family when you're done, this Advent calendar can only be used during the 2025 holiday season. This is due to some parts requiring folding, writing, or cutting and you won't be able to return them to their original condition. So in that way it functions like any other standard Advent calendar.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clue Advent Calendar 2025 Images</h3></div></output></p><h3 data-cy="title3">The LEGO Advent calendars are pretty cool too</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for more Advent calendar options that aren't just candy, it's worth mentioning that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2025-lego-advent-calendars-where-to-buy">2025 LEGO Advent calendars</a> are now up for preorder as well. Each day includes a new build or minifigure that makes it a great gift for kids that will last beyond one season.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 13, 2025 4:32 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/clue-advent-calendar-board-game-2025-where-to-buy]]></content:encoded>
