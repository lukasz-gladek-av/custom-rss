            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Although there's still a couple of worthwhile Amazon deals</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's time for my weekly Pokémon TCG sealed product price watch. Suprise suprise, the secondary market in TCGPlayer is giving big box retailers like Amazon a run for their money. Let's just keep in mind that TCGPlayer is a marketplace, so this is small to medium sellers undercutting billion and trillion dollar companies here. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'll give it to Amazon, some in-demand products are cheaper on there today too, we're talking Mega Evolution sealed product, Black Bolt and even a premium collection ex box. Don't forget that Pokémon Legends: Z-A drops on Thursday too, and I've got all the preorder links you'll need above and below. There's a song in that somewhere? Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Cheapest at Amazon: Pokémon TCG</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kicking off with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXV21m?object_uuid=682b7621-e317-454a-b32c-f09eeaef2973&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Evolution Elite Trainer Box</a>, we know $92.65 isn't MSRP and Amazon should be selling it as such, but this is how it is in Pokémania 2025 for now. It's <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKwL7?object_uuid=682b7621-e317-454a-b32c-f09eeaef2973&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">7% below the current market value</a> and a good deal if you're struggling to get stock. Meanwhile the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJr2pq?object_uuid=682b7621-e317-454a-b32c-f09eeaef2973&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Evolution three pack blister is only a dollar cheaper</a>, but that dollar is better in your pocket. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5XYO5?object_uuid=682b7621-e317-454a-b32c-f09eeaef2973&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">other savings range between $1 to $5</a>, so fill your boots!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Cheapest at TCGPlayer: Pokémon TCG</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer is really showing up big box retailers. The secondary market is saving trainers a fortune right now, and will continue doing so until the Pokémon Company floods the marketplace with sealed product, which will happen eventually. A good example here is the Surging Sparks ETB, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPVpgZ?object_uuid=682b7621-e317-454a-b32c-f09eeaef2973&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">which is currently $92.94 on Amazon</a>.

That's nearly $20 over market value, and there's plenty more where that came from in the carosel above.</p><p id="mtg-tmnt-preorders-are-live"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG: TMNT Preorders are Live">MTG: TMNT Preorders are Live</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">New game mode aside, MTGs latest Universes Beyond addition is another huge IP with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Play Boosters are available, so getting a box is a great idea before preorders sell out and it becomes harder to build a deck. The Commander Deck is ideal if you want a solid foundation for a game of Commander but want to modify it with single cards down the line. Of course, the TMNT bundle comes with a few goodies including 9 play boosters, foil alt art promo card, 30 land cards and some tidy accessories.</p><p id="pokmon-legends-l-a-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: L-A Preorders">Pokémon Legends: L-A Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's nearly time trainers! Thursday see's the release of the most radiacally different mainline Pokémon game, Legends: Z-A. Set as a continuation of Pokémon X and Y and continuing the game mechanic changes seen in Legends: Arceus, Legends: Z-A is going full real-time combat over it's tried and tested turn-based battle style. It's going to be a landmark moment for the worlds most popular entertainment franchise, so make sure you have your preorder in. </p><p id="xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-months"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3 Months)">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3 Months)</h2></p><div catalogid="7f739e7f-3c2b-4976-a510-23df50a8ef9a" id="229450"><div id="229450" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3 Months)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, Xbox isn't in the good books of gamers worldwide right now, but you can dodge the Game Pass (eventual) price hike with 3 months of Ultimate for $59.99, which is $30 cheaper than the dramatic price hikes. If you're on Xbox, this is a good time to stack up on Game Pass.</p></div><p id="fiinal-fantasy-ix-nintendo-switch"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FIinal Fantasy IX (Nintendo Switch)">Final Fantasy IX (Nintendo Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="7f739e7f-3c2b-4976-a510-23df50a8ef9a" id="229451"><div id="229451" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy IX (Nintendo Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/23/final-fantasy-ix">We gave Final Fantasy IX a 9.2 back in 2000</a>, so $40 for a JRPG classic isn't much to ask, right? Well if the re-release hasn't sold you on it's own, this version comes with high resolution cut scenes, and game modifiers including high speed and no encounter modes topped off with an Auto Save function. Also, character models are high resolution now too, so this physical edition of FFIX should wet you nostalgia appetite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">What next for Sucker Punch now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> is out the door? The Sony-owned studio has yet to say, but based on comments from the boss of the company, it will remain a single-project studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>, Sucker Punch co-founder and studio head, Brian Fleming, said the studio will decide its next project once the multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out in 2026. But, he suggested, don’t expect a flurry of games from the relatively lean developer — it’s one project at a time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The truth is that whatever we do next, whether it’s continuing Ghost or going back to Sly, the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time,” he said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“If we were good at juggling four projects, yeah, we’d have a remaster, and let’s go do one of those, and one of those, and do some fan request, that would be really popular… But we only get to do one thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So it kind of has to be your best idea, right? And that’s really clarifying. It’s not like there aren’t 15 good ideas. But you only get to do one. And by the way, you only get to do one about every five years. So that choice is really important. I mean, that is choosing your college and your major every five years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch has plenty to draw from in its back catalog. As Fleming mentioned, one of its classic franchises is Sly Cooper, which fans have called to return in some form. And what about the inFamous series? Would a remaster then a sequel prove successful? And then there’s the prospect of another Ghost game, following Tsushima and Yotei. Everyone loves a trilogy, after all.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review">Ghost of Yotei review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It took less than one week for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> players to start making Portal lobbies for XP farming – and some believe EA has already caught on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans were quick to call out the progression system in last week’s new FPS entry as a bit of a slog. Although most are walking away from each multiplayer match happy with the package Battlefield Studios has crafted, even some of the most enthusiastic fans believe leveling up takes too long, with an unrewarding weapon unlock system and arduous challenges dampening the experience even further.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The general unlock process in Battlefield 6 is too slow.</p><p>I understand wanting to make it challenging for players to get the best stuff, but I'm dreading how long it's going to take to bring just a few guns up to a decent level for attachments etc, and I'm an engaged player.…</p></div>— Westie (@MrProWestie) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrProWestie/status/1977628190337110471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Do they really think players have that much time and energy to grind endlessly just to get the rewards we’re supposed to earn naturally?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o3jwbb/dice_what_are_you_thiking_weapon_and_character/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one player asked</u></a> in a Reddit post. “It’s exhausting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just days removed from launch, plenty of players already feel the grind is too much to put up with – especially for casual fans – but that’s where Portal comes in. The do-it-yourself mode, which was first introduced in 2021’s Battlefield 2042, allows players to create nearly any match or mode they can dream of. The right build can even allow Portal users to earn experience as if they are playing a standard multiplayer match, so, naturally, it took just days for XP farm servers to crop up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Content creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rFuu5QZPwI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Arekkz Gaming</u></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/4t5Df2dvxC0?si=YkpqCptbOl2dsogJ&amp;t=877" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TheCadWoman</u></a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/mclOIKZ7BOU?si=MDUyyH_mlD_PLN0_&amp;t=434" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>WhosImmortal</u></a>, who are just a few of the many spreading the word, recommend specific Portal lobbies to level up fast. Most relevant lobbies are populated with bots but stick close enough to standard Battlefield 6 modes so as not to alter the rate of gained XP. Players are often then instructed to use double XP tokens (if they have any) and kill AI/bot enemies near objectives to efficiently farm XP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A desire to boost through demanding progression systems has existed long before Battlefield 6, so XP farm servers in Portal were quickly populated full of impatient fans. Some suspect that EA, though, is just as quick.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As more XP farm lobbies fill the Portal community browser, players are finding themselves met with a “Global Game Quota Exceeded” message with little explanation. It’s led fans to believe EA and BF Studios have begun cracking down on suspicious lobbies in order to keep boosters from exploiting Battlefield 6 and its Portal toolkit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The error is certainly keeping some XP farmers from continuing to reap the rewards they desire, but it’s unclear if these messages are the result of direct action to pour cold water on farming. Portal players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o4eyj9/the_global_portal_quota_needs_to_be_upsized/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reported receiving the message</u></a> regardless of their lobby hosting intentions. Some haven’t even been able to start hosting servers at all, suggesting Battlefield 6 Portal servers may simply be struggling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-off-to-huge-start-on-steam-with-over-740000-concurrent-players-just-hours-after-launch">in the wake of massive player numbers from last week’s launch</a>. There’s also been no word from EA or BF Studios regarding any moves to stamp out XP farming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear why exactly the Global Game Quote Exceeded message is popping up around the user-generated community tab, but that doesn’t mean the popularity of XP farming isn’t playing a role. The widespread criticism of Battlefield 6’s progression system has led to an overflow of servers for players looking to unlock content as quickly as possible. Some dedicated Portal creators suspect this large number of individual lobbies isn’t exactly helping unclog the Battlefield 6 online experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, then promptly rocketed its way to become <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-off-to-huge-start-on-steam-with-over-740000-concurrent-players-just-hours-after-launch"><u>the most successful Steam launch for the long-running EA franchise ever</u></a>, reaching a peak of more than 740,000 concurrent users.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to see how EA and BF Studios might address XP farming and progression in Battlefield 6, be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-launched-just-hours-ago-and-players-have-already-recreated-call-of-duty-map-shipment-in-portal">how some Portal players used their power to recreate Call of Duty’s Shipment</a>.
