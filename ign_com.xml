            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"The rest is more detective work."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem's producer has attempted to address the persistent speculation that fan-favorite character Leon S. Kennedy will appear in the game, by branding a particular image as "fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom continues to promote the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> as a new entry in the series starring fresh protagonist Grace Ashcroft, though has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">never explicitly stated that she is the sole playable character</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, when IGN sat down with Capcom at Gamescom 2025 in August, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-resident-evil-requiem-interview-why-the-games-monster-got-supersized-why-its-probably-not-lisa-trevor-and-a-tease-for-areas-beyond-raccoon-city-just-dont-talk-about-leon">we were told that its staff members would not discuss any internet rumors of certain other characters appearing</a>. But now, in an interview with <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stevivor</a>, producer Masato Kumazawa has at least acknowleged the ongoing speculation — and confirmed one particular image is a fan creation. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil fans have recently been debating the veracity of an image shared widely on social media that features an older Leon with an eyepatch. Many had suggested the picture was likely AI-generated, and now, addressing this image specifically, Kumazawa has described it as "fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Apart from any official information that Capcom has released, the rest is more [fan] detective work," Kumazawa said. "So I would suggest to please not take everything at face value. Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don't know what's right or what's wrong. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Players are free to believe what they would like to believe," he continued, "what I'd like to tell is that, please, unless it's officially released from Capcom, we can't give you any confirmation."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Looking at this again, I think this leaked image of RE9 Leon is fake. The pupil in his eye is missing. The eyepatch is blurred and out of place. The hair strands is painted on. 🤔 <a href="https://t.co/KT43m1NOU2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KT43m1NOU2</a></p>— Paintixir (VGen) (@Paintixir) <a href="https://twitter.com/Paintixir/status/1969201826542067884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Another recent source of discussion among Resident Evil fans is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-deluxe-edition-includes-lady-dimitrescu-costume-for-grace-preorders-get-apocalypse-costume">labelling of DLC costumes for Grace Ashcroft found within the game's deluxe edition</a>. This pricier package advertises the fact it contains five additional costumes total, though only a couple for Grace have so far been showcased. As well as that, each in-game item is labelled with the "Grace's Costume:" prefix, something fans have excitedly suggested means that more costumes for other characters (Leon) are being held back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eyepatch, and just basically saying there's a DLC or a new costume for Leon," Kumazawa stated, "but just to make sure, these are all fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, however, Capcom appears to have stopped short of saying Leon isn't in the game — and at this point, if he wasn't, you'd think its developers would want to set the record straight in order to start managing expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S — whether it includes Leon or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

And while some one-off, full-price titles were continuing to be successful, these had become "a few notable exceptions" to the wider trend, it continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remarks come amid a continued period of uncertainty for Ubisoft, which has suffered layoffs and a sizable corporate restructure in the past year. The Paris-headquartered company — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-now-operated-by-vantage-studios-ubisoft-and-tencents-new-business-group-with-full-autonomy-on-creative-direction-and-business-plans">whose biggest franchises are now operated by an independent subsidiary backed by Tencent</a> — has struggled to find its next big hit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-flopped-because-the-brand-itself-was-in-choppy-waters-ubisoft-ceo-says">disappointing sales for Star Wars Outlaws</a> and continued attempts to crack the increasingly-saturated live-service game market, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-chief-quits-industry-entirely-claims-ubisofts-doomed-call-of-duty-rival-had-very-little-marketing-or-the-right-resources-to-make-content">such as with doomed shooter XDefiant</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">pre-emptively cancelled The Division: Heartland</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Assassin's Creed, the company has gone all-in on its biggest brand — though was forced to slow its production line of upcoming games and remakes to give this year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> more time. Still, a slew of upcoming other titles in the franchise are expected over the next few years (including the witchcraft-focused Hexe, a multiplayer spin-off, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stop-removing-the-modern-day-assassins-creed-fans-react-as-black-flag-remake-reportedly-cuts-everything-outside-the-animus">long-awaited Black Flag remake</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Ubisoft dramatically halted trading of its company shares and postponed the wider firm's latest financial report mere minutes before a scheduled shareholder call was due to go live. Days later, Ubisoft is yet to provide more context for the move, as fans of its games — and the vast majority of its staff — wait to hear more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
