            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/moroi-preview-macabre-weird-and-mysterious-in-all-the-right-ways<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the first time I really understood what Moroi was, I mean the down-in-your-bones feeling you get when you’re playing something and the lighting bolt of understanding strikes you right on the noggin, was when my character fed himself to a talking meat-grinder because “something inside [him] screams let's do it!” Admittedly, it would have probably been funnier if Moroi had flashed a game over screen, and most games might’ve as a gag, but Moroi plays it straight. Into the meat-grinder you go, head-first. It chews for a bit and spits you out. You taste terrible, you see, and the grinder’s palate for manflesh is, for whatever reason, a bit more refined. Later on, you can offer it a severed hand (don’t ask) and it’s happy about that, and to grind up the bones and turn the leftover dust over to you so you can use it to help an old woman make “soup” (again, don’t ask), but eating the hand causes it to explode. “You are on fire,” your character remarks glibly as the machine spits binary. But you have your bone dust and it’s not your job to save sentient meat grinders who have developed a taste for longpig, so off you go to break some more stuff. And I said, out loud, “Ah, it’s a game like <em>that</em>.” And I was intrigued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The word moroi comes from Romanian folklore; it’s used to describe a vampire or ghost, or in some cases, a phantom that rises from the grave to draw energy from the living. I don’t know which part of the definition Moroi the game draws from. What I do know is this: your character, a bearded bear of a man, wakes up in a strange prison, in pain, with no memory of how he got there. Everyone else seems to know him, but he doesn’t recognize any of them. But maybe, as a very tall man in a very strange hat tells him, that’s for the best.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screens  -  Moroi</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Your first order of business is to get out, and that means solving simple puzzles, many of which boil down to “acquire item, take it somewhere.” Go talk to the cannibal eating himself as performance art who asks that, if eating himself isn’t his magnum opus, lightning strikes him dead. When lightning strikes him dead, take his severed hand and bring it to the sentient meat grinder, who gives you bone dust before catching fire. Then you take that to the tall man in the funny hat, who tells you to take it to the old lady making soup (she needs some salt; you have bone dust. Same thing, right?) before reminding you that “Death will meet you soon enough” and weirdly offering up that his name is Edgar. So it’s off to the old woman, who gratefully accepts your “salt” and is pulled headfirst into the cauldron by the soup to see what’s on the other side. “I'm starting to think that wasn't soup,” your character says. Noticing a pattern here?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s got Doom’s Glory Kills, which quite literally teleport you across the screen for very satisfying slow-motion execution that drops health.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On and on it goes, whether it’s a toenail from an overfed corpse still being pumped full of… something, or taking the old woman’s spoon and using it to wake up the rat with the important job of running in his wheel and powering The Horrors (and the doors). But then something strange happens. Moroi gives you a sword, and throws a bunch of enemies at you, and that’s where the magic happens. Combat is simple — the top-down, twin-stick perspective seems a little weird when you’re solving puzzles, but then you get to a combat section and it’s like “<em>Oh</em>” — but it’s fast and hits feel weighty and satisfying and it’s got Doom’s Glory Kills, which quite literally teleport you across the screen for very satisfying slow-motion executions that drops health. And then you get a minigun that shoots harpoons. And that’s rad.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When Moroi is flipping between the two — quick, simple puzzles like using the number of corpses in a freezer to work out a door code, and combat sections against multiple enemies howling for blood like it’s Black Friday and you’ve just snatched the last George Foreman grill — it’s pretty grand. But there’s also plenty of weird stuff beyond that, too. At one point, you save a duck with human teeth from being turned into a wide variety of duck-based cuisine and he rewards you with his teeth so you can reinforce your weapon, and then explains the way out through bloody gums. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes messages pop up on-screen offering cryptic hints at something more. Other times, story details are left to collectibles scattered around the environment. I particularly liked the one that listed Duck of Eternal Torment as a type of potential meal prepared from our toothy friend, and the one where the cleaning lady resigns because the furniture is upside down every day and she’s convinced the place is cursed and/or haunted.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s never afraid to be weird. One of my Moroi demo’s last segments thrust me into the role of a strange, winged doll tasked by his mother (another doll) with helping his brothers – an increasingly rude group of trees – survive some incoming horror that’s killing all of them by literally giving away pieces of himself to do it. It’s an odd segment, but a compelling one, and when the credits rolled shortly thereafter, I wasn’t quite sure what to make of it, but I am interested in seeing where it goes from here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some things about Moroi that concern me: my demo was buggy (It crashed once;I got stuck between a door and a bookcase a couple times; once I fell through the floor) and some of the writing is uneven. But those are things that can be ironed out. Moroi marries the macabre and the mysterious, and it often went to places I didn’t see coming in my half-hour demo. I’m still not sure what a moroi is in this context, but I would like to find out. After all, who can resist a game with a meat grinder that lusts for the flesh of men and a duck with human teeth?</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/after-failing-meet-expectations-launch-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-shoots-no3-us-charts-with-steam-debut<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Top spot goes, of course, to Call of Duty again.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">January is always a quiet month for video games, and 2025 was no exception. With only one new game release cracking the top 20 and the predictable domination of Call of Duty, there's little to crow about from last month... except, perhaps, what may be a comeback story for one of last year's alleged sales disappointments: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth debuted February 2024 to No.2 on Circana's charts, which rank video games by dollar sales in the U.S. It dropped to No.7 the following month, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-the-us">finished out the year at No.17</a>. While those numbers are respectable, post-launch there were numerous questions about whether or not the game had done well enough for Square Enix's tastes, or even especially well in comparison to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sales-are-fine-but-its-no-dragons-dogma-2">other major RPGs in the same year like Dragon's Dogma 2 or its predecessor Final Fantasy 7: Remake</a>. Square Enix ultimately came out saying the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-16-and-7-rebirth-profits-did-not-meet-our-expectations">failed to meet its sales expectations</a>, and never even announced a sales figure, suggesting it hadn't done well enough to brag about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But notably, Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth launched as a platform-exclusive on PS5, and exclusives usually face an uphill battle compared to cross-platform releases when it comes to sales. As of January 2025, Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth is exclusive no more, finally debuting on Steam and shooting up to No.3 on the Circana charts for the month from No.56 in December. The Final Fantasy 7: Remake &amp; Rebirth Twin Pack similarly rose from No.265 in December to No.16 in January thanks to the Steam release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all. Circana analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lhc3xrqq7k2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out on Bluesky earlier this month</a> that Rebirth had a "fantastic" Steam launch: "Across physical &amp; tracked digital, Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth was the best-selling game of the week ending Jan 25th in the US market ($ sales), while the FFVII Remake &amp; Rebirth Twin Pack ranked 3rd."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that's just the U.S., but it's likely this is emblematic of similar sales abroad, which when combined could signal to Square Enix that change is needed. This success inevitably invites speculation that swelling sales thanks to a PC launch may shift the company's plans for future Final Fantasy releases to a cross-platform launch. I asked Piscatella for his opinion on the situation, and here's what he said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I mean it's hard for me to say what impact the Steam release has on publisher perception of overall title success. That's subject to all kinds of internal planning and expectations I'm not privy to, of course. But purely looking at consumer response, it was a very good launch month on Steam. This launch does provide yet another benchmark that shows releasing on PC makes a ton of sense at this point regardless of genre or historical release strategies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For 3rd party publishers, it's looking harder and harder to release exclusively on a single platform without significant incentives provided by the platform holder."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll just have to wait and see what Square Enix's reaction is at its next relevant earnings call...in May. Stay tuned.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's looking harder and harder to release exclusively on a single platform without significant incentives provided by the platform holder.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the rest of the charts, it will surprise no one that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was the best-selling game of the month again, followed by Madden NFL 25. The only new release cracking the top 20 in January was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country: Returns</a> on Nintendo Switch, which reached No.8 purely on the basis of physical sales (Nintendo does not share digital sales data for its eshop).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also notable was the return of It Takes Two to the top 20, in spot No.20. There's no single reason for this, Piscatella told me. "There has been promotion happening during the month, including the last week of Jan on both the PlayStation store and eShop," he said. "But really, It Takes Two had pretty steady sales all month. But it was in December that It Takes Two really started its latest rally with both sales and engagement upticks that extended into January."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, much of the promotion for It Takes Two comes ahead of the release of Hazelight Studios' next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, releasing in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, games spending numbers actually look a bit sad in January compared to last January, but there's one potential reason for that. This year's tracking period for January was four weeks long, while 2024's January was five weeks long, so that's a whole extra week to make money. But as a result, overall spending was down 15% to $4.5 billion for the month this year (it was 0.3% ahead of January 2023's four-week period). Accessories spending was down 28% year-over-year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Content spending was down 12% compared to last year, with console content down 35%. Hardware spending was down 45%. PS5 hardware spending was down 38% year over year, Xbox Series was down 50%, and Switch was down 53%. PS5 was the best-selling hardware of the month in dollars and units, with the Xbox Series second in hardware spending, and Switch barely second in unit sales.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The top 20 best-selling games in the U.S. for the month of January 2025, based on dollar sales:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Madden NFL 25</li><li>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li><li>EA Sports College Football 25</li><li>Donkey Kong Country Returns*</li><li>Hogwarts Legacy</li><li>Sonic Generations</li><li>Helldivers II</li><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Dragon Ball: Sparking!
