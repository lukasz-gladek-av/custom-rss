"Huge eyes/head etc. They faxed through examples really late in dev. [Co-creator and designer] Toby Gard really didn't want to alter Lara.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/if-you-like-baldurs-gate-3-this-is-gonna-be-great-larian-boss-swen-vincke-reveals-what-to-expect-from-divinity-in-first-interview-since-the-game-awards-announcement">Last month’s announcement of Divinity</a> has sparked a significant increase in sales of Baldur’s Gate 3 and Divinity: Original Sin 2, developer Larian has said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Divinity, announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">The Game Awards</a> in December with a much-discussed trailer, is the next role-playing game from Larian following the enormous success of its 2023 Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed role-playing game. And it’s Baldur’s Gate 3 that has shown remarkable staying power, particularly on Steam where it is still seeing peak concurrent player numbers above 100,000 despite being two-and-a-half years old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2017's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-original-sin-ii">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, meanwhile, has also seen an uptick in players following the Divinity announcement, with peak concurrents in the tens of thousands rather than thousands in the weeks since. (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-divinity-larian-studios-baldurs-gate-3">If you're wondering what Divinity is, check out IGN's handy explainer</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Larian boss Swen Vincke, it’s not just that people who already own Baldur’s Gate 3 or Divinity: Original Sin 2 are returning to the game. People are buying both games in significant numbers and jumping in for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sales for both BG3 and D:OS2 have been incredible since the announcement of Divinity,” <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2013481225030094906" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincke said</a>. “D:OS2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017. Wish I’d removed the squirrel in time :)”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Typically, multiplayer live service games are expected to retain a large playerbase over the course of years, with revenue generated by the sale of in-game items such as battle passes, cosmetics, and DLC add-ons. Indeed, Steam’s top 10 most-played games are packed with live service games such as Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, and PUBG.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are some single-player games that buck this trend. Bethesda’s single-player RPGs such as Skyrim and Fallout are usually there or thereabouts in terms of Steam popularity. CD Projekt’s The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 remain hugely popular even now, years after launch. And Baldur’s Gate 3 is perhaps top of the single-player tree, with renewed interest in all things Larian following the Divinity reveal fueling it further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Divinity, Larian recently held a reddit AMA to answer questions from fans. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-divinity-from-larians-reddit-ama">Here’s everything we learned about Divinity from it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
