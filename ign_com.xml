In these early days, the most popular on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonagetheveilguard" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus Mods</a> revolve around performance improvements on PC and various character presets, and there’s even one that strips the purple from the game to make it look more like a dark fantasy RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with the latter. Vktrfly’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonagetheveilguard/mods/11" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Fantasy Look-Up Table</a> (LUT) mod is a reshade that aims to remove the purple/magenta elements from the game and give it “a darker, more atmospheric look.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/da-before-1730725760094.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dragon Age: The Veilguard in original form.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/da-after-1730726241106.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Vktrfly’s Dark Fantasy LUT mod enabled.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since BioWare unveiled The Veilguard gameplay, fans have debated its art style, with some lamenting the developer’s decision to go for a heavily stylized, almost cartoony look compared to the more gritty, realistic prior games in the series. The Veilguard, with its smooth, purple-hued visuals, is certainly at the opposite end of the Dragon Age art style spectrum, with 2009’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Origins</a> heavy on mud and blood-drenched medieval fantasy, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Inquisition</a> occupying a place somewhere in-between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the most popular mod so far is ChemBoy1’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonagetheveilguard/mods/1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anti-Stutter - Performance Enhancer - High CPU and Disk Priority - DATV mod</a>, which enables high CPU and disk priority for the Dragon Age: The Veilguard executable. This can help with performance on weaker CPUs and slower disks, and helps reduce stuttering on all CPU and disks, ChemBoy1 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also high on the most downloaded mods list is Nyctaginae’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonagetheveilguard/mods/12" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preset and sliders for their Rook</a> (Veilguard’s customizable main character), Ayse de Riva, a female mage and elf Antivan Crow (“Based on my OC of 15+ years, hope you like her!”).</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/da-again-1730725905246.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nyctaginae’s Ayse de Riva mod for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect more elaborate mods to release as modders get to grips with The Veilguard. We’ve seen the likes of Larian and CD Projekt release official mod tools for Baldur’s Gate 3 and The Witcher 3 respectively, which have unlocked an explosion in each game’s modding scene. Perhaps at some point down the line, BioWare will do the same for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that might be important in keeping the game alive, given BioWare has indicated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">it has no plans to release DLC for Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, with the developer now turning its attention to Mass Effect 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, fans are busy digging into BioWare's latest RPG after Dragon Age's release on Thursday, propelling it to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-beats-jedi-survivor-to-makes-it-eas-biggest-ever-single-player-game-on-steam"><u>new highs for an EA game on Steam</u></a>. They have plenty to find even without DLC — estimates on <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/82090" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IGN sister site HowLongToBeat</u></a> suggest that it can take upwards of 88 hours to complete the main story while doing sidequests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dragon-age-the-veilguard/Major_Choices_and_Consequences"><u>major choices in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u></a> as well as our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dragon-age-the-veilguard/Romance_Guide"><u>complete romance guide</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
