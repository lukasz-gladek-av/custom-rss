            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gaming-peripherals-maker-corsair-clarifies-gta-6-pc-early-2026-release-date-comment<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Corsair has clarified recent comments from one of its executives who claimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> would release on PC early 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During a financial call, Corsair Gaming’s VP of finance, Ronald van Veen, said: “Yeah, GTA 6 is probably the one everyone is talking about. And we’ll get a glimpse of that, I think, later on in the year for console. My understanding now it’s going to come out in the fall for console, and then early 2026 for PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was enough to spark a number of headlines about Corsair’s apparent insider information on GTA 6’s release window, but a representative of the company told IGN that Ronald van Veen’s comments were speculation, and confirmed Corsair does not have release dates supplied from Rockstar or Take-Two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">Take-Two recently committed to launching GTA 6 fall 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only</a>, despite concern around a potential delay. But what does this mean for the PC version, which remains unannounced?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an omission in keeping with developer Rockstar’s playbook for its previous games, but in 2025 feels outdated. And, given the increasing importance of the PC for a multiplatform game’s success, is GTA 6’s no-show on PC a missed opportunity or even a mistake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put that question to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick ahead of the company’s recent financial results, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">in his response he teased GTA 6’s <em>eventual</em> release on PC</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away,” Zelnick said of Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. “With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar fans have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question of how long PC gamers will have to wait for what could end up being one of the biggest games ever remains. Given GTA 6’s fall 2025 release window, it seems likely PC players won’t get to play the game until 2026 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6">Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

R. Martin has issued the strongest tease yet that an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> movie may come to pass, but has acknowledged a significant blocker to his potential involvement with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game of Thrones creator famously dreamed up the world and history of FromSoftware’s Elden Ring, which went on to become one of the best-selling games of 2022. FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco leaned heavily on Martin’s involvement in promotional material, and the game credits begin by saying the Elden Ring world was created by FromSoftware chief Hidetaki Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, would George R. R. Martin be interested in coming back for a sequel to Elden Ring, if he’s asked? That’s the question IGN put to the man himself as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/fanfest">IGN Fan Fest 2025</a>. In his response, Martin sidestepped Elden Ring 2, but did drop a big hint that an Elden Ring movie could be in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Well, I can't say too much about it, but there is some talk about making a movie out of Elden Ring,” Martin said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/21/gettyimages-1472023146-1740134288274.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">George R. R. Martin has hinted that an Elden Ring movie may be in the works.

And indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-open-to-elden-ring-movie-if-a-very-strong-partner-were-to-step-in">FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki has said he’d be open to an adaptation of Elden Ring</a>, but only if a “very strong partner” were to come into play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of Elden Ring, a movie for example,” explained Miyazaki in an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Guardian</u></a>. “But I don’t think myself, or FromSoftware, have the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So that’s where a very strong partner would come into play,” continued Miyazaki. “We’d have to build a lot of trust and agreement on whatever it is we’re trying to achieve, but there’s interest, for sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, speaking to IGN, George R. R. Martin acknowledged that there may be a significant blocker to any heavy involvement he may have with the Elden Ring movie: he’s still working on The Winds of Winter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We'll see if that [the Elden Ring movie] comes to pass and what the extent of my involvement was, I don't know,” he said. “I'm a few years behind with my latest book, so that also limits the amount of things that I can do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy novels have long, long, <em>long, </em>awaited the planned sixth entry in the series, The Winds of Winter. But after more than a decade of delays, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-isnt-sure-hell-ever-finish-the-winds-of-winter-but-its-still-a-priority">even Martin is acknowledging the possibility that it may never come to be</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, Martin said: “Unfortunately, I am 13 years late. Every time I say that, I’m [like], ‘How could I be 13 years late?’ I don’t know, it happens a day at a time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But that’s still a priority," he continued. "A lot of people are already writing obituaries for me. [They’re saying] ‘Oh, he’ll never be finished.’ Maybe they’re right. I don’t know. I’m alive right now! I seem pretty vital!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's only the latest in what's been an increasingly bleak wait for The Winds of Winter, with the most recent entry in the series, A Dance With Dragons, publishing in 2011. That's the same year that HBO premiered the insanely popular TV series Game of Thrones, which is based on the A Song of Ice and Fire series and drew <em>a lot</em> more eyes to the world of Westeros.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Elden Ring, Martin explained his work on the game, telling IGN how he helped FromSoftware on worldbuilding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... when they came to me, FromSoftware, they wanted the world. They knew the action of Elden Ring that the players would get into would be in the ‘present.’ But something had created that present, had created that world. So where did that world come from? And I've done a lot of world building, most notably on Westeros and the backgrounds of A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones. And I like doing world building. So what had happened 5,000, 10,000 years before the current day action in Elden Ring that led them to that place? And I had some ideas about the magic and the runes. There was a lot about runes. And I worked it all out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was interesting that the team flew in and we had a number of sessions and they would fly back and do their magic, and then they would come back here a couple months later and show me what they had, which was always amazing to see what they came up with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Was everything Martin wrote used in the game, or is there more material that could be used in future installments?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, I think especially when you're world building, there's always more that you actually see on the screen,” Martin replied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And that's true of any of these big epic fantasies. I mean, you look at Tolkien and there are hundreds of pages of past history before you get to even the era of the Hobbit and dozens of kings and wars and things like that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Amanda Edwards/WireImage.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
