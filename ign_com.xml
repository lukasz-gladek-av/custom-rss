The launch of this higher age restriction, following the earlier introduction of localised age ratings in 2016, has helped smooth GTA 5's belated path to release — alongside a bit of help from Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive to grease the wheels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A recently-agreed partnership between Take-Two and a Saudi firm, the Advanced Initiative Company, will see the latter now act as the local distributor for all Take-Two titles, including GTA 5, WWE 2K, NBA 2K and Red Dead Redemption. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The countries, with a combined population of around 44 million, will presumably now also become a market in which Rockstar can sell GTA 6, when it finally arrives. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After more than a decade in development and a recent major delay, GTA 6 is currently set to launch on May 9, 2026, pending any further hold-ups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Connelly was also found to have "deliberately inflated" his company's financial position during the first few months of the pandemic in 2020, reporting a turnover of $201,500 (£150,00) in 2019 when it was, in fact, $77,900 (£58,00).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In interviews with the Insolvency Service, Connelly stated that he had been given the opportunity to reimagine the music for the Tomb Raider soundtrack, describing it as a "significant project which had the potential to be very lucrative." He reportedly took out personal loans and sold his car to finance the work, but that "stalled" at the start of the pandemic. By August 2021, Connelly's company, Peter Connelly Limited, had gone into liquidation.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/screenshot-2025-07-18-104937-1752832212394.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Peter Connelly is best known for his work on the Tomb Raider series at Core Design.
