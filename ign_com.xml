We’ve already posted plenty of new gameplay, and today we’re thrilled to announce one of High on Life 2’s brand-new weapons: Say hello to Travis, the SMG-style weapon voiced by Ken Marino, who you might know from The State as well as Wet Hot American Summer. Travis is one-half of a dual SMG pair with Jan – check out the half of a heart pendant around his, uh, neck, I guess? Anyway, they’re married, but it seems the relationship has gotten a bit toxic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take a look at some footage of Travis in action in the video below, and for more exclusive High on Life 2 coverage – including another weapon reveal coming up soon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">High on Life 2 will be released on February 13, 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S – including launching on day one into Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games has announced the next era of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-fortnite-odyssey">LEGO Fortnite</a>, via its huge Ninjago: Rise of the Ninja update which lands later this week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arriving ahead of Ninjago's 15th anniversary next year and in time for LEGO's second anniversary within Fortnite this month, Rise of the Ninja looks to be one of LEGO Fortnite Odyssey's largest ever updates — with a new world to explore, Ninjago weapons to master, and some very familiar faces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zane, Jay, Cole and Kai will all arrive in Fortnite, with the latter ninja part of the Ninjago LEGO Pass. All four characters will also get human-like (as in, not LEGO minifigure) versions for the first time, for use in Fortnite's non-LEGO modes. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Players will be able to master elemental abilities by travelling across the game's new Ninjago island and visiting Sanctums to earn ice, lightning and earth powers. It's the latest move away from traditional weapons seen in LEGO Fortnite, following the addition of class-based hero powers a few months ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that's not to say that ninja weapons won't also be included — the update will add nunchucks and shurikens too. And perhaps in good time, as well, since today's LEGO Fortnite trailer, above, also shows the arrival of a huge fire-breathing dragon boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite clearly has big plans for Ninjago, with a second major game update due in 2026 that is expected to also see the arrival of yet more characters, such as Nya, Master Wu, and Lloyd. Until then, this first drop of Ninjago arrives in-game in just a few days, on December 11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced is the full name of Ubisoft's piratical remake that's had more leaks than a sunken ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's new title is now <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visible</a> on the PEGI European ratings board website, which is about as official as it gets. (The game is rated 18 for violence and bad language.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, there's a mention here that Black Flag Resynced will include the ability to make in-game purchases. It's still unknown how Resynced will plug into the franchise's existing Animus Hub, which lets you buy optional cosmetic content. Alternatively, this could potentially signify the ability to buy DLC further down the line. Is the game's memorable Freedom Cry add-on in line for a remake, too?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's development comes just a couple of weeks after the game's release date was reportedly spilled online. During <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-assassins-creed-franchise-exceeded-expectations-driving-positive-financial-results-but-while-mirage-gets-a-sales-update-shadows-does-not">Ubisoft's latest financial results</a> the French publisher laid out a slate of upcoming games set to arrive before the end of its current financial year, on March 31, 2026. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The name of one of these games was left as "unannounced", though a subsequent report by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a> stated that this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-release-date-reportedly-leaked">not-so-mysterious project was the new version of Black Flag</a>, which is scheduled to arrive during the week of March 23, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-multiple-assassins-creed-remakes-are-on-the-way">years of internal leaks</a>, fan speculation and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-edward-kenway-actor-alleges-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-for-hinting-at-black-flag-remake">hints from the original game's lead actor</a>, Ubisoft still has yet to officially confirm its Black Flag remake exists. IGN has contacted the company again today, in case it has anything it wants to tease. Or, perhaps we'll hear more at The Game Awards later this week?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/screenshot-2025-12-09-151736-1765293471486.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remastered, visible on the PEGI website. Image credit: IGN/PEGI</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Previous reports have suggested Black Flag Resynced will be a substantial remake of the series' beloved piratical entry, with visual and gameplay upgrades that see the game closer in quality to this year's Assassin's Creed Shadows. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">New story content will reportedly be added to flesh out more of hero Edward Kenway's life, though the game's modern day gameplay sections have apparently been excised — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stop-removing-the-modern-day-assassins-creed-fans-react-as-black-flag-remake-reportedly-cuts-everything-outside-the-animus">something that many fans aren't happy about</a>. It will be interesting to see how Ubisoft handles the game's new ending — which previously tied together story elements from its historical and modern day narratives — in light of that change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> on pretty much every platform since it came out in 2011, but now it’s found another: the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda announced and shadowdropped Skyrim Anniversary Edition today, December 9, on Switch 2 just in time for the holidays. Check out how Skyrim looks on Switch 2 in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition includes the base game and the three official Expansions: Dawnguard; Dragonborn; and Hearthfire. Players on Switch 2 get experience enhanced resolution, improved load times, performance optimisation, Joy-Con 2 mouse support, motion controls, Amiibo support, and more versus the OG Switch version, taking advantage of the more powerful hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s more, this edition offers exclusive Nintendo content from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, including the Master Sword, Hylian Shield, and Champion’s Tunic. You’ll also get hundreds of unique Creations Club items, with quests, weapons, armor, spells, dungeons, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda is selling Skyrim for Switch 2 standalone for $59.99, but there’s a free upgrade for Skyrim Anniversary Edition owners on Switch. Owners of the Skyrim (base edition) on Switch can buy the Anniversary Upgrade for $19.99 to play on Switch and Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skyrim’s release on Switch 2 is sure to resurface all those jokes about Bethesda milking the life out of the game by releasing it on all the platforms under the sun. Skyrim has been ported and remastered so many times that it’s become one of the internet’s most enduring memes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda is of course busy working on The Elder Scrolls 6, although development chief Todd Howard has indicated it is still some time away. In a recent interview, he teased that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop">Bethesda could shadowdrop The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, as it did with this year’s The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and now Skyrim on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like to just announce stuff and release it,” Howard told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>. “My perfect version — and I’m not saying this is going to happen — is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear.” The Oblivion Remastered shadowdrop was “a test run,” Howard teased. “It worked out well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
