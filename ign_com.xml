            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/grow-a-garden-codes-may-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lunar Glow update for Grow a Garden finally saw the addition of a code redemption system, and the Roblox experience's first reward code was released. This big change means it's likely there will be more codes released in the future, so IGN will keep you covered with all your Grow a Garden code needs!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Working Grow a Garden Codes</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>LUNARGLOW10</strong> - 3 Basic Seed Packs <strong>(NEW)</strong></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Expired Grow a Garden Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Because codes were just added in the latest Lunar Glow update, there are <strong>no expired Grow a Garden codes</strong> for now! Be sure to make the most of the working codes, so you don't miss out on extra seed packs.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Redeem Grow a Garden Codes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/12/grow-a-garden-codes-1747041583655.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that there's a code redemption system in the Roblox experience, here are the steps you need to follow to use Grow a Garden codes:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Launch the Grow a Garden Roblox experience</li><li>Look in the<strong> top left corner to find the Settings cog </strong>next to the icon of the backpack</li><li>Click settings and scroll down to the bottom</li><li>Copy and paste codes from this article into the Redeem Codes box</li><li>Press claim and enjoy your goodies!</li></ol><h2 data-cy="title2">Why Isn't My Grow a Garden Code Working?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are usually two reasons why a code isn't working. It's either because:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The code is expired</li><li>The code has been entered incorrectly</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">If a code has been entered incorrectly or is expired, it will say the "code is invalid." To stop this from happening, we'd recommend <strong>copying and pasting the code directly from this article</strong>. We check and test each of the codes before we add them to our articles. However, when copying them, you can sometimes accidentally include an extra space somwhere, so always double check there's no additional spaces!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Find More Grow a Garden Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If new codes are added to the game, we'll update this article, so you can always check back here and keep up-to-date with the latest codes. Grow a Garden has its own <a href="https://discord.com/invite/gwQvzBS3Ea" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated Discord server</a> where codes will be announced, as well as game updates.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Grow a Garden in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Grow a Garden is a new Roblox experience that's becoming incredibly popular since it launched. The gardening simulator allows players to show off their green fingers, as you buy seeds and plant a variety of crops from basic carrots to exotic dragon fruit trees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As fruit and vegetables finally sprout, you'll be able to harvest them to sell for Sheckles. To go from a beginner gardener to a pro worthy of awards, you'll want your crops to experience mutations that increase their value. This can happen randomly, with Gold and Big mutations being down to chance, while weather events like snow can increase your luck of a Frozen mutation. There's also gear, and even pets now, that can affect how fast your crops grow, their value, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lauren Harper is an Associate Guides Editor.

This is the same editor the developers use internally for all gameplay development. This first release lets modders work with everything from level scenarios to game modes, tinker with AI behavior, abilities and melee combo logic, user interface and HUD elements, and make much of the general modding work with Space Marine 2 faster and easier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not long ago, I promised we would support the modding scene — and we meant it,” Grigorenko said. “Watching this community grow, push boundaries, and create incredible experiences has been both inspiring and humbling. We’re excited to see what you build next — whether it’s a cinematic campaign, wild new game mode, or something we never saw coming.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To get the ball rolling, Grigorenko released jokey concept art for a "Fishing With Daddy Calgar" mini-game, below, which is technically possible now with these tools. Calgar is Marneus Calgar, the leader of the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/11/fishing-1746999241862.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The race is on to create Space Marine 2's first fishing mini-game mod. Image credit: Saber Interactive / Discord.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To find out what the Space Marine 2 modding community plans to do with this editor, I had a quick chat with Tom, aka <a href="https://ko-fi.com/warhammerworkshop" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Warhammer Workshop</u></a>, the modder behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/massive-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-mod-adds-lore-accurate-classes-a-weapon-previously-locked-to-campaign-and-even-new-operations"><u>Space Marine 2’s excellent Astartes Overhaul</u></a>. Fresh from releasing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-modders-create-12-player-co-op-with-the-developers-blessing-and-now-theyre-working-on-raid-style-missions-with-bosses-that-hit-like-trucks">a mod that enables 12-player co-op in Space Marine 2</a>, Tom told me that he now has access to all the scripting tools that control what happens in any particular mission, as well as for all the different game components like weapons and abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means modders could, for example, create a Space Marine 2 roguelite mode where modders spawn in one of the swarm sequences from the campaign with nothing but a combat knife, and progressively spawn bigger and tougher enemies, with percentage chances to spawn weapons, ammo, and health on death. “Killing a Carnifex might grant you a Heavy Bolter,” Tom suggested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for a brand new cinematic campaign, Tom said that while a Chaos campaign would “definitely” be doable, cutscenes are trickier because modders so far do not have access to the animation tools necessary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Tom is currently planning on adding new factions to Space Marine 2, including the Tau and Necrons, as the modders have the rigs that will fit those. Meanwhile, the Space Marine 2 modding community is racing to actually make the Fishing With Daddy Calgar mini-game mod Grigorenko challenged them to.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction from Space Marine 2 fans is hugely positive, and with good reason. While Space Marine 2 is well-received and has gone down as one of the best-selling Warhammer video games of all time, it is relatively limited in terms of its official offering. That is to say, it contains three factions only: Space Marines, Chaos (a mix of Chaos Marines and some Tzeentch Daemons), and the Tyrannids. Players had hoped for DLC that might extend the faction roster (the Space Marine 2 campaign teased the Necrons), but can now take matters into their own hands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is how you keep a game alive for years like Skyrim,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1kjgnix/comment/mrn2sq9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Mortwight</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a particularly interesting development in the context of Saber and publisher Focus Entertainment’s announcement that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 is in development</a>. Some Space Marine 2 fans have expressed concern about what this means for potential DLC, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-moves-to-set-the-record-straight-insists-its-not-abandoning-the-game-following-space-marine-3-announcement">both Saber and Focus have insisted they’re not abandoning the game</a>. Still, Space Marine 2 is in a much better position now modders have the editor in hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
