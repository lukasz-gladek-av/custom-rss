It's coming to PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and last-gen console systems. It was initially slated to release on September 5 before being delayed to the end of October, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-delayed-proving-that-not-even-skynet-is-safe-from-tariffs"><u>then November 26</u></a>.

And while the "physical components" necessary for all editions have now "finally arrived," the company needs "some time." And even though this only impacts the physical editions of the game, Reef has confirmed this delay also applies to digital editions, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"First of all, we want to start by saying thank you. We know you’ve waited longer than expected for the release of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and we truly appreciate your patience and support throughout this journey," the team <a href="https://x.com/Reef_Games/status/1986003116022493467" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>. "The physical components for all editions have now finally arrived, following the ongoing delays that pushed us off our previous schedules. However, we now have to assemble the physical editions, which we need some time to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Because of this, we are moving the launch date of Terminator 2D: No Fate to December 12, 2025, for all physical and digital versions of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are sincerely sorry for the repeated delays. We don’t take your patience for granted, and we never want to disappoint our community. Our goal has always been to deliver the game that you deserve, and we're almost there.

Some of the original criteria did not fully reflect that intent, and we have updated them to make their difficulty and purpose clearer.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first set of changes went live today, November 5, through a server-side update and are available immediately. Any progress you’ve already made will automatically be applied when you enter a match, unlocking any challenges or assignments you now meet based on the updated criteria.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios said the scale of its plans for Challenges and Assignments is “large and will take place over multiple server-side and client-side updates,” so players can expect additional updates in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Battlefield 6 has enjoyed a record-breaking launch, some have critisized the pace of in-game progression, which this update looks to address. Other hot topics include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more">the size of Battlefield 6's multiplayer maps compared to those in previous games</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-won-battlefield-6-fans-rejoice-as-ea-tones-down-bright-colors-on-monster-energy-skin">out-of-place soldier skins</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got plenty more on Battlefield 6, including word on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-hidden-room-discovery-has-players-developing-theories-and-searching-for-easter-eggs"><u>the hidden firing range room that players are investigating</u></a> for secret Easter Eggs and hints at future content.

Below we’ve highlighted a few examples.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Class Challenges</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon challenges now complete much faster.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Assault 2: </strong>Have Squadmates deploy on your Spawn Beacon.</li><li>Reduced from 50 deploys to 5.</li><li><strong>Support 2:</strong> Revive teammates as Support.</li><li>Reduced from 200 revives to 60.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Weapon Assignments</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">All weapon-type assignments (ARs, SMGs, LMGs, Shotguns, DMRs, Snipers, Carbines) have been significantly simplified.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Rapid Fire 1/Assault Rifle:</strong> Inflict damage with Assault Rifles.</li><li>Reduced from requiring 10000 inflicted damage to 3000.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mode &amp; Unit Assignments</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The majority of our mode-specific assignments (Conquest, Rush, Breakthrough, Domination, and others) have been standardized to require two wins per tier. This change makes it easier to pursue these challenges with clear intent.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Conquest 2: </strong>Wins in Conquest.</li><li>Reduced from 5 wins to 2.</li><li><strong>Conquest 3: </strong>Objective kills in a round of Conquest.</li><li>Reduced from 30 objective kills in a round to 10.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay &amp; Mastery</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">General “Expert” and “Master” assignments that require multi-kills, headshots, kill streaks, or revives have been adjusted to better match the natural rhythm of gameplay. For example, multi-kill and streak goals now align with average round performance rather than rare, outlier achievements.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Explosives Expert 2:</strong> Get Multi Kills <em>(2+ Kills Onwards)</em> with explosives.</li><li>Reduced from 20 Multi Kills to 5.</li><li><strong>Adaptable 2:</strong> Repair damaged Vehicles in a life.</li><li>Reduced from requiring 3000 damage to 500.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
