            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">PS5 users, this is a great time to grab this excellent game for 45% off.</h2></p><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">PS Direct has just dropped an exciting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-launches-a-brand-new-promotional-sale-on-ps5-games-accessories-and-more">variety of deals on PlayStation games, accessories, and more</a>, and it looks like Amazon is joining in on the fun, too. The retailer is currently offering an excellent deal on the fantastic PS5-exclusive game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, dropping it down to just $32.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QPxp2m?object_uuid=64b9e711-fa3f-4f2a-b838-fd953f4f9d68&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D5SM3K4Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it here</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is 45% off its full list price of $59.99, but more importantly, it appears to be the lowest price it's hit at Amazon so far, according to price tracker <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D5SM3K4Q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camelcamelcamel</a>. Previously we saw it drop down to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-delightful-astro-bot-for-ps5-is-back-to-its-best-price-at-amazon-and-walmart">$39.97 back at the start of January</a>, so this is a great chance to add it to your library for even less. It's one that's definitely worth the investment, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Astro Bot for $32.99</h2><div id="235769"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235769" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Astro Bot PS5</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Astro Bot won over many hearts back when it was first released, and for very good reason. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">review</a> from IGN's Simon Cardy called it, "A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities" and said "it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive." He even added that, "Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The praise certainly didn't end there, though. Astro Bot also won <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-wins-game-of-the-year-at-the-game-awards-2024">Game of the Year at The Game Awards back in 2024</a>, and took home our top prize as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-playstation-game-of-2024">best PlayStation game of 2024</a>. In regard to the latter, IGN's Matt Purslow said, "Astro Bot is a Mario-matching 3D platformer that excels on all fronts: tremendous stage design, intuitive movement, fun power-ups, and a smart approach to combining all of those elements in exciting new ways on each world visited."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned before, this isn't the only game deal to explore right now. If you're curious what else PS Direct has to offer at the moment, check out our big <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-launches-a-brand-new-promotional-sale-on-ps5-games-accessories-and-more">rundown of PlayStation's sale,</a> which runs until March 9.
