Both bundles include a digital copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online subscription, marking them one of the best <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday deals available in 2024</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with the anticipated Switch 2 expected next year, this deal is likely to be <strong>extremely </strong>popular. Together, the bundles represent a $155 saving compared to buying each item separately. The inclusion of a full year of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-nintendo-switch-online-cost">NSO membership</a> is also a notable upgrade from past bundles, which typically featured just three months of Nintendo Switch Online.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Switch Black Friday Game Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Phase two of Nintendo’s Black Friday sale is now live, offering plenty of great deals across popular Switch titles. Retailers like Best Buy and Target have already rolled out some standout discounts. Current highlights include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-black-friday-deal-2024">Sonic X Generations for $29.99</a>, Super Mario Odyssey for $29.99, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom for $44.99, and Balatro for $19.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tears of the Kingdom is also discounted to $39.99, though it will drop to <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qbn7WJ?object_uuid=06cddc86-52a2-4f91-b2e5-5cc0f00213e5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$29.99 at Walmart tomorrow</a> for those willing to wait. These deals are expected to sell quickly, so now is a great time to take advantage of the savings.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch Accessory Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch and Switch OLED offer 32GB and 64GB of internal storage, respectively, with some of that reserved for the operating system. To put this into perspective, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> takes up 16GB, while Breath of the Wild requires about 13.5GB. Downloading both games digitally would nearly fill the original Switch's storage, making a high-capacity memory card less of a luxury and more of a necessity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, Black Friday sales make storage upgrades much more affordable. A 1TB microSD card is now <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWdP4l?object_uuid=06cddc86-52a2-4f91-b2e5-5cc0f00213e5&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available for $57.99</a>, while a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QODPx8?object_uuid=06cddc86-52a2-4f91-b2e5-5cc0f00213e5&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">512GB card can be picked up for just $32.99</a>, offering ample space for games, DLC, and updates. Portable gaming needs are also covered, with one of the best power banks on the market dropping to its lowest price ever at $77.99. Additionally, Switch Pro controllers are now just $49.99, making this Black Friday an excellent time to grab essential accessories at significant discounts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Sign Up for Walmart+ Before Nov. 25?</h2></div><div catalogid="ffb2807f-13c0-4d38-a85c-dc765656ace1" id="210375"><div id="210375" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ 12-Month Membership</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the standout deals in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-walmart-early-black-friday-deals-2024">Walmart’s first wave of Black Friday offers</a> is a 50% discount on a 12-month Walmart+ membership. Usually priced at $98, it's now available for $49. The membership includes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-walmart-plus">several perks</a>, starting with 5-hour early access to Walmart's next round of Black Friday deals, which begins at noon ET on Monday, November 25, and notably includes that Tears of the Kingdom deal for $29.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not worth signing up for Walmart+ just to snag that single deal—you’d likely be better off purchasing the game at its regular price. Instead, consider whether early access to Walmart’s upcoming deals or the other benefits of a 12-month membership make sense for you. Take some time to weigh the value of the subscription against your shopping habits to decide if it’s the right choice.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When is Black Friday This Year?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We hope you've prepared your wallets, because it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> season. During the biggest sales event of the year, keep an eye out for price drops on the games you've been waiting to add to your library. The same can be said for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-early-black-friday-tv-deals-2024">TVs</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-gaming-pc-deals-so-far-2024">gaming PCs</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-black-friday-sale-predictions-for-2024">Apple products</a>, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever you're in the market for, right now is probably one of the best times to make your biggest purchases. The sale going live means we are one step closer to Black Friday proper, with deals for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">PlayStation</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-black-friday-2024">Xbox</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-sale-2024">Nintendo</a> already confirmed. Let's dig into all the best PlayStation Black Friday deals.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Free In-Store Switch Events</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is also organizing in-person demo events at Target, Best Buy, and GameStop, giving players a chance to try upcoming games and participate in giveaways.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Dec. 7</strong>: Best Buy Family Fun Day will offer hands-on demos for games like Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Super Mario Party Jamboree, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Just Dance 2025.</li><li><strong>Dec. 14</strong>: GameStop will host demos for the same lineup.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

This isn’t a sign of trouble; Sega often discounts even its top-performing games during Black Friday sales. Instead, this is simply one of the season's best gaming deals.</p><div catalogid="74957b24-98d3-462e-b1e6-43478afe3831" id="210502"><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6pB4?object_uuid=d0029078-ad85-4bd0-9cf7-be97abc1f031&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> - <strong>Amazon UK, £27.99</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">For $30, you’re getting Sonic Generations remastered, paired with the ultimate Shadow experience in Shadow Generations.
