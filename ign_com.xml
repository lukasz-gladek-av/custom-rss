If you've been itching to jump into the world of Space Marine 2, the game is still discounted at Amazon to $49.99 for <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6bZrR?object_uuid=b2afdfa9-1963-45a4-9809-1d07b0bf1160&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0CVSDJNKS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVJ4p?object_uuid=b2afdfa9-1963-45a4-9809-1d07b0bf1160&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0CVSDK499" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>.

He said it's "a terrific third-person shooter with a compelling story, loads of weapons that are a blast to use, and a healthy variety of enemies to use them on. It once again borrows many of its ideas from the Gears of War series, but theyâ€™re good ideas, and Space Marine 2 does a fine job of making them its own."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not the only game deal on our radar right now, either.

While those lines have blurred, Cyber Monday remains the top event for online-focused retailers like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Even traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart roll out exclusive online-only offers. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-best-cyber-monday-deals-2024">Switch</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-playstation-cyber-monday-deals-2024">PS5 deals</a> are also now live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the same deals from Black Friday normally return for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday 2024</a>, including some that sold out or expired. Retailers often stagger their inventory, reserving stock for each major sale event. This means Cyber Monday will bring back popular deals alongside brand-new, never-before-seen offers. But, most importantly, Cyber Monday is the final day of the Black Friday sale season, with most the deals going with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelance writer who works with the Guides and Commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 2, 2024 9:10 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
