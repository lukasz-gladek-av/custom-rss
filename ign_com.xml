"A small example is we had an internal hypothesis that far more people would put their console into rest mode than fully shut it down each time between their play sessions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As it turned out, it was actually about 50/50 between the two options for all our players. So, what that meant was for about 50% of our users, when they booted up, if they were in the US, they were landing on our Explore page. Those outside the U.S. would land on the page for the last game that they have played."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Welcome Hub was therefore developed long after the PS5's release for these players who do not use rest mode, something Sony didn't believe necessary until it looked into these stats. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/big-ps5-update-adds-welcome-hub-party-share-and-more-new-features">It arrived in September and essentially lets players customize their homescreen</a> with different widgets and bits of useful information.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokemon-center-declares-2025-is-the-year-of-eevee<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Forget Year of Luigi. 2025 is the Year of Eevee. At least, according to The Pokémon Center, the official merch arm of The Pokémon Company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/2025-is-the-year-of-eevee-at-the-pokemon-center" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced today</a> via the official Pokémon website, which christened the year by announcing an array of Eevee-themed merchandise such as plush toys and Eeveelution statuettes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, the "Year of Eevee" thus far appears only to impact The Pokémon Center, the official merchandise store for Pokémon. So it's entirely possible this is purely a marketing thing to sell more Eevee plush, and won't impact anything else.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/06/pokemon-center-169-1736187150484.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2025 is the Year of Eevee according to The Pokémon Center. Image credit: The Pokémon Company.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's <em>also</em> possible this celebration ends up extending to other parts of Pokémon. For instance, we know for a fact that a new Pokémon game is planned for later this year: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. We don't have a ton of information about the game so far, apart from its setting (Lumiose City) and its placement in the "Pokémon Legends" series alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>. A Year of Eevee could portend exciting things for Z-A... dare I predict, a new Eeveelution? There hasn't been one of those since Sylveon was added in Pokémon X and Y (where Lumiose City was introduced) over a decade ago. We're long overdue for a new variation. Unfortunately, we probably can't expect an entirely Eevee-focused game. We've already basically had one of those in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/12/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-and-eevee-review">Pokémon Let's Go! Pikachu and Eevee</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it's worth noting that the Eevee theming has already invaded the Pokémon TCG via the recent Prismatic Evolution expansion. The <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/01/prismatic-evolutions-set-guide-full-card-list-secret-rares-cut-cards-products-and-more" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new expansion</a>, which releases next week, centers around Terastal Pokémon like in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, but notably includes some absolutely gorgeous Eeveelution cards and even features a Terastal on the cover. Every Eeveelution is included in the set in multiple forms, including an Umbreon that <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/whats-the-ceiling-on-pokemons-new-tera-type-moonbreon/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some are predicting</a> will be very, very coveted by collectors.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/06/umbreon-ex-sir-1736186128191.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A new Umbreon ex card is already being <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/602681/pokemon-japan-sv8a-terastal-fest-ex-umbreon-ex-217187">listed online</a> for absurd amounts of money for a single card.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, I'm really hoping this means we'll see some exciting Eevee-themed updates to other games. Pokémon's been juggling quite a few ongoing games lately, including Pokémon Sleep, Pokémon  Unite, Pokémon Masters EX, and of course Pokémon Go. Between all of those, surely there will be room for some interesting Eevee-themed updates over the next year to tie into the merch plays. We'll have to see how far The Pokémon Company chooses to take things while we eagerly away for more news about Pokémon Legends Z-A. Don't forget, Pokémon Day is on February 27!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-players-are-reporting-their-new-games-have-been-replaced-withgoogly-eyes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Typically over the holidays, thousands of people will look in their stockings or under the tree to find brand new Nintendo games waiting for them. But this year, a number of Nintendo Switch fans are claiming they unwrapped a far less pleasant surprise on Christmas morning: instead of a Switch cartridge in their game box, some are claiming they found a single googly eye staring at them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the holidays, a number of posts popped up across Reddit and Twitter/X from individuals claiming their seemingly sealed, brand new Nintendo Switch cases contained a googly eye and a black piece of plastic instead of the actual game cartridge. Why a googly eye? The running theory is that the googly eye will rattle if you shake the Switch box, similar to how the box rattles with an actual game inside. And the black plastic around the side fools individuals trying to look through the cracks on the top or bottom to see if the outline of a game is visible without unwrapping it. Without these items, someone might be tipped off that a game has been stolen from the package, but this method ensures that no one notices the crime until they open the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear at the moment how or why this is happening, on what scale, or at what point in the distribution process. Games reportedly impacted included Luigi's Mansion 2 HD, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Mario Party Jamboree, Echoes of Wisdom, and others. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1fqg8gv/this_is_what_i_found_when_i_opened_my_brand_new/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports also seem to go back several months</a>, though there's been a higher influx of them recently likely due to more games being purchased over the holiday. And all of them seem to include a googly eye and the same black piece of plastic, though at least <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1fqg8gv/comment/lpfiwbn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one person is claiming to have only gotten the plastic</a>, no eye included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to several individuals claiming they had received googly eyes instead of games over the last year and a half, but no one we spoke to had taken a video of them unwrapping the shrink wrap and discovering the eye, as they (understandably) didn't know they were unwrapping a googly eye to begin with. As long as all these reports remain unconfirmed, it's always possible this is just some sort of viral prank. Still, through our conversations with the individuals claiming they were impacted, all seemed to be legitimate accounts. A few had return receipts or were able to direct me to specific Walmart, Best Buy, and Target store locations where googly eyes had been acquired, all located in the western United States. One person said they purchased their googly eye game online. Timeline-wise, googly eye claims went back as far as June 2023, though most took place in the last six months. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an effort to confirm these reports, I tried to reach specific stores where googly eyes were allegedly found. One of the Reddit posters claimed in private messages with me that they had returned their googly eye box to a specific Walmart store, so I gave them a call. I was unable to get anyone to answer the phone at the store for over an hour despite calling various different departments. When I finally reached someone in a completely unrelated department, they transferred me to Loss Prevention, who upon hearing what I was calling about offered to have me speak to a higher manager, before hanging up the phone entirely. Multiple calls back to the same departments did not glean any further responses. I tried a second Walmart location identified by posters, where I eventually reached an employee in electronics who had never heard of this happening. However, the incident taking place at their store allegedly happened months ago, and would have been handled by returns and not electronics, so their lack of awareness wasn't much of a debunking.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A very similar scenario unfolded when I tried to reach a specific Target location where someone claimed to have successfully returned a googly eye game. Repeated calls to relevant departments went unanswered, until I finally reached someone in an unrelated department who transferred me to Guest Services. Guest Services then directed me to Target's corporate media line, which I have already contacted and did not receive a response from. All told, I spent about three hours on a Friday afternoon calling various big box stores, but learned absolutely nothing about googly eyes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the direct route failing, I reached out to Nintendo for comment, but did not hear back in time for publication. I also reached out to Best Buy corporate for comment on this story, but similarly did not hear back in time for publication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walmart corporate PR did get back to me on Friday, but the PR representative I spoke to seemed baffled. They told me over the phone that the company had not heard anything about this, and we spent the better part of the afternoon going back and forth over email trying to investigate. The representative said they'd look into some specific stores where googly eyes had been reported over the weekend and return to me with a statement by first-thing Monday, but IGN did not receive any further response to our inquiry by our deadline. We'll update if that changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The takeaway from all this, then, is just a PSA that your recently-purchased Nintendo Switch cartridge may or may not contain a game, or a googly eye. It's unclear if this is a real problem affecting many people, a real problem affecting a very small number of people caught up in a supply chain that has poor communication and no way to confirm these things, or a joke problem invented by the internet. Fortunately though, if it is indeed a real problem, it sounds like most stores are exchanging googly eyes for games if you find yourself the victim of this weird but admittedly quite frustrating switcheroo. Hopefully they manage to catch this Googly Eye Bandit, if they're indeed real, and save future Christmases from disaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
