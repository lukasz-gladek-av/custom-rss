While not everyone may make the connection, you can see what appears to be a boxed copy of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guitar-hero"><u>Guitar Hero</u></a> — or 'Banjo Champion' as it's been rebadged as here, albeit with all the Guitar Hero branding — stuffed into the can. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a particularly curious addition given the developer of the Guitar Hero series from Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock to 2010's Warriors of Rock was Neversoft… which also just-so-happened to have developed the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As fans debated whether or not it was an Easter egg, a joke, or even dig — at Neversoft, or publisher Activision — THPS 3+4 developer Iron Galaxy promptly distanced itself, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IronGalaxyDevTeam/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>writing</u></a>: "We have the utmost respect for anyone who makes games, we’re investigating how that got in there in the first place.
