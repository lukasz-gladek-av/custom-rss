Over on TCGplayer, while both bundles are hovering in the $40-$48 range (which could make them the cheapest, depending on the listing), sellers for the current listings have added shipping costs, which you’ll have to cover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walmart sits in a similar bracket, with listings ranging between $47.85 and $48.87 depending on which bundle you’re after, with limited units left at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason demand is so high comes down to the sets themselves. Black Bolt and White Flare together feature all 156 Pokémon from the Unova Pokédex, a callback to the beloved fifth generation of games, Pokémon Black and White. Filled with alternate art cards and multiple foil variants, these expansions have been must-haves for completionists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even as more fans are looking ahead to the late September Mega Evolution set and the fall release of Phantasmal Flames, the allure of all there is to collect in White Flare &amp; Black Bolt still has plenty to keep your decks and collectable binders buzzing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who missed out at MSRP, Amazon’ &amp; Walmart's current discounts still represent the most affordable way to secure these Unova-themed packs before demand pushes prices even higher. These are sure to sell quickly once more keen collectors hear about these, so be sure to grab them whilst you can if you want them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.
