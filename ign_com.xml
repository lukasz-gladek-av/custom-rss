Splitgate 2 saw a peak concurrent player count of 25,785 on Steam, well below Splitgate‚Äôs 67,724 peak concurrent player count. Steam user reviews remain on ‚Äòmixed.‚Äô</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam stats do not paint the whole picture, of course, given Splitgate 2 launched across consoles as well as PC. Indeed, 1047 Games has said Splitgate 2 has had over 2.5 million players. But clearly, things have not gone as well as the studio had hoped. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">an interview with IGN shortly after launch</a>, Proulx said he was ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù by the reaction, admitting ‚Äúwe didn't expect this to be nearly as controversial as it was and we didn't intend for it to be.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, 1047 Games has suffered a round of layoffs, which it characterized as ‚Äúa small group‚Äù of staff in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/1047games_today-we-parted-ways-with-a-small-group-of-activity-7341958451004088321-0q4q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAJnrdMBkTuB_VYNNnFKqq9kwmzjliqcGN0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>. Also in the post came confirmation that co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have opted not to take salaries, as the studio aims to improve the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here‚Äôs the statement in full:</p><blockquote>Today we parted ways with a small group of valued 1047 Games team members. We‚Äôre still perfecting the Splitgate 2 gameplay experience in response to community feedback, and we are redirecting resources to build the best game for our players. We are sad to see our teammates go, and we are actively working to help them secure new opportunities. Further, our co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have opted not to take salaries as we lock in to deliver the next phase of the project. Thank you to those who‚Äôve built alongside us ‚Äî we are sad to say goodbye and would not be here without you.</blockquote><blockquote>To everyone who‚Äôs playing Splitgate 2, we‚Äôre continuing to work hard to deliver more things we know you‚Äôll love. We are committed to building this game for the long haul.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">While 1047 did not specify how many were let go, or who exactly, a number of key staff have announced their departures across social media platforms. Meanwhile, Splitgate 2 had a 24-hour peak concurrent player count of 10,059 on Steam, with 4,437 players on Valve‚Äôs platform at the time of this article‚Äôs publication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-review">Splitgate 2 secured a 7/10 in IGN‚Äôs review</a>. We said: ‚ÄúSplitgate 2 is a decent successor to the original that expands on it, but never really surpasses it.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
