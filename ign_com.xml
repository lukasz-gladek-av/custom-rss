"And the same goes for all of the fans who played our game, who streamed it, or who worked to build the XDefiant community."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">XDefiant's final S3.0+ update includes the previously announced Assassins class, which are modelled after Assassin's Creed's titular heroes, alongside myriad additional features that were planned for now cancelled future seasons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This includes a total of three new factions, 13 new maps, a new experience called Tactical, a means of gaining experience versus bots, new weapons, new progression mechanics for Faction Mastery and Badges, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">xDefiant is a free-to-play, fast-paced arena shooter that combines intense gunplay with personalized loadouts and specialized factions. But that market can be incredibly brutal, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">and perhaps after PlayStation arena shooter Concord was shut down after just two weeks on the market</a>, some fans of xDefiant grew concerned for its longevity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Rubin said in September that XDefiant "is absolutely not dying," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">Ubisoft announced earlier this month it would be shut down on June 3, 2025</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">XDefiant Update S3.0+ Patch Notes</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Factions</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Faction: Assassins</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Hiding in plain sight through the centuries, the Assassins have waged a clandestine war against their ancient enemies, the Templars, to safeguard human freedom. Assassins combine rigorous combat training, unconventional weaponry, and a sixth sense to track and take out their targets. Their signature Hidden Blade is a one-hit melee elimination.</li><li>The Assassins receive combat guidance from Rebecca Crane, the technical genius who developed the Animus 2.0, an advanced model of the machine that lets Assassins relive genetic memories. She guided some of the Order's most well-known Assassins, including Desmond Miles. With Crane's assistance, the Assassins work in the dark to serve the light, combating oppression with lethal force.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Faction: Wolves</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ex-special forces gone rogue, Wolves employ an arsenal of Skell Tech drones for both offense and defense. The Wolves trait allows the pack to be a sight unseen, undetected by AI abilities and devices. Their Legion drone acts like a homing proximity mine, while the Stolas is effectively a mobile turret. And their ultra, Drone Swarm, is the last word on area denial.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Faction: Blood Dragon</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Super-deadly cyber commandos from a dark future where cyborgs and mutants collide. Use your cyberstrength, throw deadly shuriken, strike with your shock punch, or use the Killstar laser to deal massive damage.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Fixes and Changes:</strong></h3><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Cleaners</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Fixed a couple of glitches with the Cleaners' Incinerator Drone when Hijacked by a DedSec player:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Drone no longer explodes next to the player who Hijacked it.</li><li>The Drone now leaves a complete fire trail back to its point of origin.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Echelon</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>No longer have a 50% reduction in flash grenade duration debuff</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Phantoms</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>AEGIS – Addressed issue with shots not registering at point blank range.</li><li>Blitz – Increased movement speed to truly “Blitz” your opponent.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>DedSec</strong> </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spiderbots 2.0 – We got the message. Spiderbots, DedSec's infuriatingly face-adjacent electro-minions, are now less in your face and more of an area-of-effect threat. When activated, Spiderbots will now dutifully follow their deploying player for 30 seconds, emitting an electromagnetic pulse that disrupts all enemy equipment within a 10-meter radius. And with that, the era of Spiderbot facehugging comes to a close.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Highwaymen</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>M79</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue that would lock the skill when activating right after a weapon swap</li><li>This should now have damage dealt while on different elevations</li><li>Improved handling and reload speed</li><li>Cooldown reduced to 40s</li></ol><ul data-cy="list"><li>Buzzsaw Launcher</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>Increased ammo count</li><li>Addressed issue with damage inconsistency</li></ol><h3 data-cy="title3">Maps</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New S3 Maps</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Mykonos (Arena)</strong>: Experience the island of Mykonos like the ancient Greeks did, except with more rooftop firefights, in this new map for Season 3. Your itinerary includes sprinting by market stalls, seeking roof access for the high ground, and jumping across boat decks in high-risk flanking maneuvers.</li><li><strong>El Barrio (Arena)</strong></li><li><strong>Jorvik (Linear)</strong></li><li><strong>Animus Anomaly (Tactical):</strong> Ancient worlds collide in Animus Anomaly, a new corridor-style map for Season 3. Hunker down among Viking castles, flank around the waterways of ancient Greece, or go out with a boom in the new Defuse tactical variant of BOMB!.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Future Maps</strong> - These maps were scheduled for later seasons but were too much fun not to release!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Arena</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Carlyle’s Lab</li><li>Enchanted Forest</li><li>Killstar Temple</li><li>Razia’s Realm</li><li>Skell City</li><li>West End</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Linear</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Skell Complex</li><li>Esperanza</li><li>Himalaya</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fixes and Changes:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Adjustments were done to invisible collision and areas where players were able to jump to places that are out of bounds for the map.</li><li>Adjustments to some maps where scrap turrets were also being placed where they’re not supposed to be.</li><li>DUMBO has decked the halls to be more festive for the holidays</li><li>Players can no longer climb and leap their way into what was supposed to be an inaccessible area of some maps, where they were using El Remedio to heal allies and doing other sneaky exploits.</li><li>Many maps have undergone improvements to mantling which should now be fixed in several map locations that previously were not.</li><li>Map voting improvements</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Game Modes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Modes:</strong></p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Defuse</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>This season sees the debut of Defuse, a tactical and slower-paced version of BOMB!. Teams take turns planting and defending bomb sites, yet all players only have one life. Defuse is designed for play on a new "corridor" type map, in this case the Animus Anomaly created exclusively for this category.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Vs Bots</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>There’s now a Vs Bots option where you can face off against varying levels of computers. You’ll even earn XP by battling bots. Although at a slower pace with human enemies.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Lum Hunt</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Catch them if you can, Lums (beings of pure energy possessing of a mindbogglingly sunny disposition) have been placed around the Enchanted Forest map in this variant of Hot Shot. Also available in Private Matches.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Tilt</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Now available in our Linear playlists, this mode is a simultaneous battle over who can push around Carlos the most, poor robot.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Turbo XD</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Super jump your way to victory in this gravity defying mode.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Party Modes Playlist</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>From one shot kill, to headshots only, and even no skills allowed, there’s a little something for everyone in this playlist.

These top players are displayed in descending order of total Rank Points earned in the current season. Highlighting a player on the Leaderboard displays the following stats:</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>Current rank insignia and RP total.</li><li>Win/Loss: Player’s ratio of wins to losses.</li><li>Kill/Death: Player’s ratio of kills to deaths.</li><li>Average Score/Minute: Player’s average score per minute.</li><li>MVPs: Number of times the player earned MVP.</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ranked Emblem in HUD</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Proudly display your ranked tier right on your heads-up display for all to see.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Ranked Rewards</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>New S3 specific Ranked Rewards are available (to everyone).</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fixes and Changes:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Matchmaking ranges have been disabled and join in progress has been enabled so that matches are easier to find.</li><li>Reduced the forfeit timer duration from 20s to 5s.</li><li>Players are no longer pulled out of active Ranked game sessions after accepting the Party invite for a Private Match.</li><li>Added a new menu experience, now players will be able to search for games and jump back to the Ranked menu tab to view rewards, info, and the top 500 leaderboard.</li><li>Removed Domination and CTF from Ranked playlists.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Weapons</h3><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Assault Rifle</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>FAMAS - The FAMAS is a burst-fire rifle like the M16A4 but with faster ADS time, movement, and rate of fire. It is slower to reload, however, and inflicts less hurt per shot.</li><li> G36K</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Sub-Machine Gun</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>M1928</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Light Machine Gun</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>MG5 - Despite its shorter range and lower ammo capacity than other belt-fed LMGs, the MG5 with its higher rate of fire makes it a powerful and versatile option for those who can master its challenging recoil.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Marksman</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>M1A - An agile warhorse built for medium-range battles, the M1A offers a speedy rate of fire but deals less per-shot damage compared to other marksman rifles.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Sniper Rifle</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>SRS</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Pistol</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Diceros</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fixes and Changes:Sawed-off Shotgun Balance Adjustment</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The range and damage potential of the Sawed-Off Shotgun have been adjusted to better focus it on its intended role as a short-range kill-finisher and prevent it from killing full-health opponents with a single shot.</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>Short Range reduced from 8m -&gt; 6m</li><li>Medium Range reduced from 12m -&gt; 10m</li><li>Short Range Damage reduced from 12 -&gt; 11</li><li>Bullets Per Round reduced from 12 -&gt; 9</li></ol><ul data-cy="list"><li>Tweaked smoke grenade effects so that some components of cosmetic skins will no longer be visible through the smoke, while also improving the size, shape, and transparency of the smoke particles and radius of effect.</li><li>Adjusted the camera shake so that now it is based on distance to explosion. Removed friendly explosion camera shake.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Attachments</h3><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Tapered Barrel</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Introduced the Tapered Barrel, an attachment for most weapons that increases handling speed but reduces damage. Here are the pluses and minuses:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Pros:</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>25 percent boost to sprint-out time</li><li>15 percent ADS speed increase</li><li>5 percent movement speed increase</li></ol><ul data-cy="list"><li>Cons:</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>20 percent short-range damage decrease</li><li>20 percent medium-range damage decrease</li><li>10 percent ADS walking speed decrease</li></ol><ul data-cy="list"><li>In other words, this barrel will help you scoot around the map at a zippier pace, but you'll likely need to land more shots than normal to get kills.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Reticle Customization</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>New for Season 3: Customized reticules. Players can unlock new reticule shapes and adjust their colors (a helpful feature for players with colorblindness). Custom reticules will be tied to individual loadouts.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fixes and Changes:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed a graphical glitch that let players see parts of their weapon barrel through the Reflex and Holographic sights.</li><li>Fixed a lagging magazine when player reloads weapons.</li><li>Fixed floating when using left-handed skills and reloads.</li><li>Fixed a scope crosshair missing when player ADS in spectating mode.</li><li>Several skins have had their sights adjusted to match the base weapon being used.</li><li>Various visual improvements</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Progression</h3><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Prestige System!</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Introducing Prestige, an optional new progression system that rewards long-haul dedication with flashy cosmetics and extravagant emblems that showcase your experience to other players. Available to anyone who has completed their Base Challenges, Prestige resets player progress in exchange for an eye-catching Prestige Emblem. All starter and owned weaponry are locked – except the M4, M9, and frag grenade – but can be earned as players earn XP and Prestige Tokens to access their original gear plus new weapons until they complete the current Prestige Tier and acquire the next eye-catching emblem. Players can opt out of Prestige at any time and recover their weapons, or they can commit to unlocking the final Prestige Emblem, the ultimate display of dedication.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Badges!</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Badges are part of a mysterious new challenge-based progression system where players earn Badges for performing impressive feats and engaging with the game in creative ways. All Badge challenges have hidden requirements, encouraging players to go online and engage with the XDefiant community.

These new Pristine skins are like unmarred, fresh-from-the-factory versions of these weapons. Pristine skins are retroactively applied to any weapons that have already reached level 50.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Daily Rewards and Credits</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Players can now earn various rewards just for logging into the game. Bigger rewards are granted every 5th and 10th login. The days do not have to be consecutive.</li><li>Credits are a brand new in-game currency. Use Credits to buy cosmetics from previous seasons, giving you the opportunity to get any skins you may have missed back then, but you have everything now, so that’s nice</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fixes and Changes:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Some Challenges, particularly those related to faction characters, weren't progressing on the main menu, but now they are.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Audio</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Battle announcer lines have been tweaked for their frequency of play:</li></ul><ol data-cy="list"><li>Lines announcing death streaks (or dying multiple times without killing an enemy) will trigger less often (now players need to die five times rather than three, and the death streaks will only trigger during the second half of a match).</li><li>Lines related to suffering from fire damage (from the Purifier, (Firebomb, Incendiary Drone–really anything involving the Cleaners) will trigger less frequently.</li></ol><ul data-cy="list"><li>Phantoms – Blitz – Now has sounds for blocking a melee attack and for attacking others with a Blitz Shield.</li><li> GSK – Hardhat – Audio improved for impact confirm headshot</li><li>Highwaymen – M79 – Now has sounds for hit confirm and impact confirm with the M79.</li><li>Other various audio improvements.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Miscellaneous</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Assassin’s video on the main menu</li><li>New Career Stats page</li><li>New Store Layout</li><li>New Weapon Inspect</li><li>Input-based matchmaking is now disabled by default for faster matchmaking times.</li><li>Fixed various crashes and errors</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-%E2%80%93-don%E2%80%99t-miss-these-8-little-things-%E2%80%93-ign-first.1064676/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-dont-miss-these-8-little-things-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The open, medieval world of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was built with even greater authenticity in mind than its historically-grounded predecessor was capable of. Whether you played the first one or not, there are plenty of potentially overlooked details you'll want to pay attention to. Sometimes because it might help you succeed on your journey, and other times because it's just a neat touch of realism. As part of this month’s IGN First, we’ll be taking a look at eight little things you won't want to miss in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">1. Find An Old Friend</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Henry, the hero of the Kingdom Come: Deliverance saga, will get the chance to reunite with a number of old friends from the first game if you know where to find them. And one of them is a four-legged companion who's been given a bit of a special buff for the sequel.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Your very first horse, Pebbles, has somehow managed to survive the turmoil of war brewing in Bohemia. And what's more, he's even learned some new tricks. In KCD1, his stats were… less than impressive, given you got him pretty early on. But in KCD2, he has a secret perk that will allow him to grow along with Henry. The more you ride him, the better his stats will get, so you don't have to say goodbye forever in favor of a more impressive steed.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2. Check the Freshness Date</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While in a game like Skyrim you may be able to pack your coat pockets with fresh fruit and set off into the wilderness for days without worry, KCD2 is a bit more unforgiving in how it simulates perishable foods. But it also provides you with historically-accurate ways to solve this problem.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The longer something like bread or a cabbage has been in your inventory, the more it will degrade. And some foods keep longer than others. If you want things to keep longer, well, you're not exactly going to be able to haul an ice chest around on your back. But you can do what people in the actual middle ages did. Facilities are available around many settlements for smoking and drying foods, extending their shelf lives. This process also reduces their weight, so you can carry more food – or make room for an extra dagger.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Smoking and drying foods extends their shelf lives. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This even works with the herbs you'll use for alchemy. Freshly-picked herbs will always make the strongest potions, but dried ones keep for a long time and will do in a pinch.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">3. Liquid Courage</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Folks in medieval Bohemia loved their drink. After all, we didn't know much about water safety at the time, so alcohol tended to be safer. And there weren't any open-world RPGs around either, so options for entertainment were more limited. In KCD2, booze can be both a blessing and a curse.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Basically any alcohol will give you some positives when you are only slightly drunk and there's a lot of perks that will even improve this," lead designer Prokop Jirsa explained. "But be very careful because if you overdo this and if you get really drunk, it'll give you a lot of negative stats."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a risk of addiction if you imbibe too often in KCD2, with increasing stages of severity. And, of course, you can drink so much you pass out. In most games, this wouldn't be too much of an issue. But in KCD2, NPCs who don't like you might take that opportunity to steal the clothes right off of your back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A situation can happen when you just fall unconscious because you're drunk and when you wake up you see somebody wearing your shoes or your hat," Jirsa said. "So yeah, be careful about it."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">4. Do Your Homework</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of Henry's biggest character moments in the first KCD was learning how to read, which was so rare it was practically a superpower in the Middle Ages. And he can continue his erudite journey in KCD 2. But the Reading skill has been replaced with Scholarship, which is not so much about learning what the letters mean, but what they… well, <em>mean</em>, on a deeper level.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gaining ranks in Scholarship will unlock things like new dialogue options and even the ability to gain more experience in other skills. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Bohemia is full of books, and collecting them will allow you to level up your Scholarship. There are even specific places that are better for reading due to their chill atmosphere. And gaining ranks in Scholarship will unlock things like new dialogue options and even the ability to gain more experience in other skills. After all, understanding the theory behind something like chopping someone's head off with an axe helps you with the practice.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">5. A Likely Story</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And whether you're an academic, a drunk, or both, your roleplaying possibilities will expand to fit your personality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are perks in Drinking skill and in Scholarship that will unlock completely new dialogue options with guards," Jirsa told us. "And you can use these new dialogue options to get away from crime. And they're really funny, especially the one from drinking. Try those. It's really funny, like drunkenly explaining why you didn't kill the chicken is hilarious."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">6. Malicious Makeover</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While Henry's abilities and even attire can affect his chance of success in different social situations, like being well-dressed giving you more play with the nobles and being covered in blood letting you scare off bandits easier, these buffs and debuffs don't only apply to you. What an NPC is wearing and how healthy they are affects their social stats in the same way. Do you see where I'm going with this?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you need to win a charisma challenge against an NPC of high social status, and spiffing up your own wardrobe isn't an option, you can always come at the problem from the other direction and sabotage theirs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the night before you can steal their fancy clothes," Jirsa advised. "Or if you want to intimidate them, it might be easier if you poison them a little bit the day before."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">7. Dress to Impress</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In the first game, it could be a bit of a pain to optimize your fit for every possible situation. After all, it takes quite a while, even on an inventory screen, to squeeze out of heavy plate armor and into something a bit snazzier or sneakier. But KCD2 has made this a breeze. You'll be able to save three different outfits that you can switch between seamlessly. This lines up perfectly with having one set of nice-looking clothes for navigating social situations, a suit of full armor for intense combat, and some dark-colored clothing that doesn't make much noise when you're moving around for sneaky deeds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">8. When in Doubt, Yell</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This far along on Henry's journey, though, he's not necessarily just dressing for the job he wants rather than the job he has. No, he's a bit more of a force to be reckoned with, and it's possible to flaunt this with certain enemies who really don't have any business crossing swords with him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">KCD2 introduces battle cries and taunts, which can influence an NPC's will to fight. In our Survival Tips list, we mentioned how certain enemies might think better of trying to tangle with you if you kill their commander or a bunch of their friends in very flashy ways. Letting out a fearsome battle cry probably won't do much if you haven't even drawn blood yet. But if things are going your way, it might serve as a signal for the remaining opponents to take stock of the situation and decide if this is really still worth it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And, of course, there are unlockable perks that will make your bellowing even more terrifying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are tons more little things to discover in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 for the sharp-eyed explorers out there, so don't hesitate to take it slow and try out new things. For more, stay tuned all December long as our exclusive IGN First coverage of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 continues.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
