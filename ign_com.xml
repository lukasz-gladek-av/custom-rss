            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've been waiting for the right time to bulk up your gaming library, now's your chance. While we're still waiting on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-2025-black-friday-sale">Nintendo's deals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Xbox</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-sale-2025-early-deals">Amazon</a> launched Black Friday sales earlier this week. Now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">PlayStation</a> has entered the fray with a spread of discounts on games, accessories, and even PS5 consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's worth checking your wishlist and doing some scrolling, as a starting point, we're seeing great discounts for anyone looking to start or fill in the gaps on a Final Fantasy collection. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Final Fantasy Games on Sale for Black Friday </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, you’ve got options. The PlayStation Store offers the best discounts on the FF7 Remakes, but Amazon is actually offering physical copies. It really comes down to how much you care about having those games lined up on your shelf vs. sitting in your digital library. If you’re on the PC side, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/playstationpublishersale2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam is also running a PlayStation publisher sale</a> that includes roughly the same discounts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Final Fantasy Pixel Collection is pretty unreal bang for your buck. It includes the pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games for just $30 total with the current price drop, making it a great choice for something you can really dig into over the holidays. The discount also applies to the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrRWl?object_uuid=464cd0b5-f8e2-4b16-a1ca-a7eee5a1762f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch version</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for news on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix">third and final part</a> of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy, you can pick up the first two games at a discount. Remake Intergrade (Intergrade just meaning the PS5 version) has dropped to $19.99 for physical and $14.99 for digital. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, released just last year, has dropped to $39.99 for the physical copy on Amazon and $34.99 through PlayStation. Michael Higham's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">9/10 review of Rebirth for IGN</a> describes how it "impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion as both a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth, and as an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most recent mainline release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-review">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, has dropped to its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BPMTJJ6D" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest ever price on Amazon</a>, which happens to be $5 cheaper than you can find it on the PlayStation Store. While outside of Black Friday deals themselves, Amazon does have a teensy tiny 5% discount on the most recent spin-off release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review">Final Fantasy Tactics: Ivalice Chronicles</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>More PlayStation Black Friday Deals </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation has knocked $100 off both its PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, the only real console deals we’ve so far this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday</a>. There’s also PlayStation Plus discounts and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dualsense-ps5-controllers-black-friday-early-deals">spread of DualSense controllers</a> on sale, including my personal favorite, the limited edition Ghost of Yotei version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blythe (she/her) is an SEO Coordinator at IGN who spends way too much time in character customization screens and tracking down collectibles. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-game-deals-ps5-black-friday-2025]]></content:encoded>
