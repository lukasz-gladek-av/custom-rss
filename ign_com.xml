Taken at face value, Marvel Rivals is remarkably similar to Blizzard’s game; while Marvel Rivals uses Marvel heroes and villains for its playable characters, it is, like Overwatch, a competitive multiplayer hero shooter with some remarkably similar mechanics and gameplay systems. Both Marvel Heroes and Overwatch 2 are free-to-play, monetized as live services, and lean on the addition of new characters to keep things feeling fresh.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days">Marvel Rivals has enjoyed explosive popularity</a> since launching in December, and it is speculated that this has come at the cost of interest in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>. Blizzard’s game, according to the current narrative, is dwindling as NetEase’s Marvel Rivals gobbles up its players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/overwatch-2-director-welcomes-competition-from-marvel-rivals-as-the-team-have-never-really-had-another-game-thats-so-similar-to-the-one-that-weve-created/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller discussed the new reality Blizzard finds itself in, with Marvel Rivals now out in the wild and attracting tens of millions of players.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Overwatch 2 Perks</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're obviously in a new competitive landscape that I think, for Overwatch, we've never really been in before, to this extent where there's another game that's so similar to the one that we've created," Keller said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’d think this would be a bad thing for Overwatch, then, but Keller called the situation “exciting,” and even said it was “really great” to see Marvel Rivals take ideas established by Overwatch in a “different direction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Keller admitted Marvel Rivals’ success had forced a change in attitude within Blizzard when it comes to Overwatch 2, saying: “this is no longer about playing it safe."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode">Blizzard has announced radical changes coming to Overwatch 2 in 2025</a>. While the roadmap ahead includes much of what you'd expect to see in terms of new content, the core gameplay itself will see a seismic shift, including the additions of hero perks and the return of loot boxes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes will be on Overwatch 2 to see if these changes spark a resurgence in interest. We're now nearly nine years out from the debut of Overwatch in 2016, and two-and-a-half from the launch of Overwatch 2. And while Blizzard does not make Overwatch player numbers public, we can see concurrent player numbers on Steam are as low as they’ve ever been since Overwatch 2 launched on Valve’s platform in 2023, with a 37,046 concurrent player peak over the last 24 hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals, meanwhile, remains a top 10 most-played game on Steam, with a 310,287 concurrent player peak over the last 24 hours.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 still has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam. Indeed, in August 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-becomes-worst-user-reviewed-game-on-steam-ever-even-as-tens-of-thousands-turn-up-to-play">Overwatch 2 became the worst user-reviewed game on Steam ever</a>. Most of the negative reviews focused on monetization after Blizzard was heavily-criticised for forcing its premium predecessor to update into a free-to-play sequel, rendering the original Overwatch unplayable, back in 2022. Overwatch 2 subsequently endured a number of controversies including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-canceled-a-difficult-choice"><u>the cancellation of its long-awaited PvE Hero mode</u></a> — the one feature, players said, that justified the sequel's existence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has loads more on Marvel Rivals, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-says-theyre-not-trolling-dataminers-wed-rather-spend-our-time-developing-the-game">the developer's clarification on datamining</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-developer-is-open-to-potential-future-release-on-nintendo-switch-2">thoughts on the possibility of a Nintendo Switch 2 version</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

A Hara-Kiri finisher, first introduced in 2004’s Mortal Kombat: Deception, sees the defeated player cause their own death with a self-Fatality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s interesting here is that InfiniteNightZ found Hara-Kiri animations for recently released DLC characters, such as Ghostface, adding credence to the speculation that they will be added to Mortal Kombat 1 in a future update rather than left on the cutting room floor. “After seeing that they're adding it to the downloaded roster now, I think it's highly possible,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1iqzfw2/harakiri_exit_animations_liu_kang_conan/md4dth1/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfiniteNightZ said</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">InfiniteNightZ then suggested the Hara-Kiri animations could arrive as Quitalities, given that’s how they’re referenced in the game’s code. Quitalities are quick-fire finishers that trigger when a player quits a multiplayer match, and have been in previous games in the series. “They are listed as Quitalities, there's still hope,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1iqzfw2/harakiri_exit_animations_liu_kang_conan/md5ippu/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfiniteNightZ said of the animations</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">High-profile Mortal Kombat 1 dataminer Interloko found additional Hara-Kiri animations, after InfiniteNightZ’s find was made public.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Interloko (@interloko) <a href="https://twitter.com/interloko/status/1891241739215671554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this may all amount to nothing, and it’s worth noting that neither NetherRealm nor publisher Warner Bros. Games has announced Quitalities for Mortal Kombat 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1 recently enjoyed a resurgence with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mortal-kombat-1-community-is-working-together-to-try-to-figure-out-how-to-fight-floyd-but-the-exact-process-remains-a-mystery-for-now">the addition of a secret fight with Floyd</a>, the pink ninja, and the community-driven effort to work out his unlock conditions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-issues-update-on-rares-long-in-development-everwild<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We can give those teams time…"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">What happened to Rare’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a>? It’s been over five years since the game was announced back during Microsoft’s X019 presentation. Repeated no-shows during Xbox showcases and rumors of reboots have caused some to wonder whether Everwild had fallen by the wayside. Not so, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XboxEra</a>, Spencer listed Everwild as one of the games yet to come out that he was excited for, adding he’d recently visited UK studio Rare, which runs live service pirate adventure game Sea of Thieves, to get a look at Everwild and the progress the developers were making. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, State of Decay is just one of the franchises I love back from the original one, so that one stays on the board. I do think the work that Double Fine’s doing and how Tim [Schafer] kind of solicits feedback from the team. And the other one, I’ll say because I was recently out at Rare. It’s nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they’re making.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer said Microsoft had been able to give the developers of those games (State of Decay, the next game from Double Fine, and Everwild) time while still having a packed schedule of releases (bolstered, obviously, by the acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can give those teams time,” Spencer said. “And next week I’m going to be up in Vancouver with the Coalition [Gears of War developer] — and how fun is that?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Everwild, it’s faced concern over the years after the aforementioned reboot rumor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everwild-reboot-matt-booty-comments">which Microsoft has denied</a>, and the exit of creative director Simon Woodroffe in 2020. Rare filled the director's chair with veteran designer Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Pinata, and Sea of Thieves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what is Everwilds? Reports have indicated it’s a third-person adventure game with god game elements, but given how long it’s been in development, that may have changed. The last Everwilds trailer, released in July 2020, carried the following description: “Everwild is a brand new IP from Rare. A unique and unforgettable experience await in a natural and magical world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has a long list of in-development games, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot">Perfect Dark reboot</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name">the next Halo</a>, and Playground's new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-fable-reboot-shown-off-with-new-trailer-and-a-2025-release-window-xbox-games-showcase-2024">Fable</a> game. Meanwhile, Bethesda is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, and Activision is of course working on this year's Call of Duty. In the shorter term, id Software's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> launches in May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
