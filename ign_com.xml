Its choice of setting, picturesque scenery, and expansive map seem to be resonating with local residents, with the developers receiving plaudits for their detailed research and sense of style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch’s standalone sequel to 2020’s award-winning Ghost of Tsushima moves the action to Ezo on Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido. You play as Atsu, a warrior on a quest to take vengeance on the six men who slaughtered her family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, Ghost of Yotei’s scenery is getting a lot of praise from Japanese speaking commenters for its beauty, especially the titular Mount Yotei. However, one <a href="https://x.com/rina_asami_w/status/1973602091873792484" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenter</u></a>, who apparently lives in Hokkaido, shared a photo of the real Mount Yotei, saying: “You were probably thinking they exaggerated its beauty for the game, right? But Mount Yotei really is a beautiful mountain. Please come and visit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up post, they added that the developers’ decision to choose “Mount Yotei instead of (Hokkaido’s highest mountain) Daisetsuzan makes so much sense as a person born and raised in Hokkaido. Mount Yotei isn’t part of a mountain range, it stands alone, and that’s what gives it the ‘wow’ factor.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AA%E3%83%96%E3%83%A8%E3%82%A6%E3%83%86%E3%82%A4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ゴーストオブヨウテイ</a> 、北海道で一番高い山は大雪山なんだけど、大雪山じゃなくて羊蹄山を選んだの、道産子としてめちゃくちゃよくわかる。<br>羊蹄山って山脈の中にある山じゃなくてぽつんとそびえたっていて、それが「うわあ」ってなるんだよね。 <a href="https://t.co/CRKpybvzLU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/CRKpybvzLU</a></p>— ⭕️りなんご⭕️ (@rina_asami_w) <a href="https://twitter.com/rina_asami_w/status/1973604258655469969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The view from the mountain in-game is also getting some love for being extremely beautiful, with one user <a href="https://x.com/YusukeORTtype2/status/1975100964572197129" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>sharing screenshots</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">羊蹄山からの景色バチクソ綺麗なんよなぁ<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GhostofYotei?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GhostofYotei</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B4%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AA%E3%83%96%E3%83%A8%E3%82%A6%E3%83%86%E3%82%A4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ゴーストオブヨウテイ</a> <a href="https://t.co/KBskFi6g2w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KBskFi6g2w</a></p>— 悠介二式/🌟 (@YusukeORTtype2) <a href="https://twitter.com/YusukeORTtype2/status/1975100964572197129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Sharing an in-game screenshot featuring Mount Yotei, another <a href="https://x.com/ngo_nyanko/status/1973441795892847049" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user</u></a> commented: “I live in Ezo but Ghost of Yotei is way more quintessentially Hokkaido than I could have imagined, lol.

I take my hat off to the staff of Sucker Punch for their good taste and successful research. They really know how to hit the right note for Japanese audiences.” Others praised translation and voice acting aspects, saying that Ghost of Yotei has a “perfect localization for Japan.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the making of Ghost of Yotei, the developers took many research trips to Japan. Director Nate Fox <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-director-vows-to-deliver-a-respectful-representation-of-japan-on-par-with-ghost-of-tsushima"><u>previously talked about</u></a> the team’s commitment to creating a respectful representation of Japan to match Sucker Punch's previous work on Ghost of Tsushima. In fact, Fox and Jason Connel were made <a href="https://sea.ign.com/ghost-of-tsushima-ps4/169560/news/ghost-of-tsushima-lead-devs-named-ambassadors-of-actual-island" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>permanent tourism ambassadors</u></a> to the real-life Tsushima in recognition of how Ghost of Tsushima has spread awareness of the place. As more people experience Ghost of Yotei, it will be interesting to see if it gets similar recognition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

That's because fans who would have bought Call of Duty under normal circumstances on PC or Xbox opted to play it through the Game Pass subscription instead. Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is set to launch as a day one Game Pass title this November, but subscribers now won’t get 10% off COD Points or the BlackCell battle pass upgrade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft’s console hardware plans are under intense scrutiny following its seemingly successful multiplatform push for its video games and flagging sales of the Xbox Series X and S.
