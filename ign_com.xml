It's not trying to wow anyone with overhyped discounts or mystery coupons. These are just practical price drops on solid gear, books, and collectibles that people are already buying. If you’ve been holding off on grabbing a Switch 2 case or a LEGO set for your desk, now might be the time to stop putting it off.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the most compelling item here is the illustrated edition of The Hobbit, which adds a layer of detail you don’t usually get in reprints.
