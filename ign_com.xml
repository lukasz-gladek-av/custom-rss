            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has addressed the long wait for Henry Cavill’s Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe, insisting that Amazon is in control of the delivery of the adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Superman actor and Warhammer 40,000 lover Henry Cavill is set to star in and executive produce the live-action Warhammer 40,000 adaptation for Prime Video.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cavill's Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe is shrouded in mystery, and Games Workshop itself has cautioned fans not to expect to see anything of it for some time. But it is now over three years since Games Workshop’s deal with Amazon was announced, and fans have yet to see anything of it, or hear anything tangible about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In its latest financial results (the long and short of it is that Games Workshop is doing tremendously well and making loads of money), CEO Kevin Rountree addressed the elephant in the room: just what is going on with the Amazon stuff?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We continue to work on some exciting projects that will bring Warhammer to screens like never before,” Rountree said, keeping his cards close to his chest. “Our live action endeavour is still in development with our partners: Amazon MGM Studios, Henry Cavill and Vertigo. It is the nature of these things to take several years, and while we wish we could tie down a release the way we can with our core business, the reality is that, as with any licensing deal, delivery is not in our control. We leave it to our partners to manage their own businesses.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That doesn’t help fans much, to be honest. But at least we know the project is still in the works and hasn’t been lost to the Warp. Fans have spent the last few years in a state of enduring excitement about the prospect of finally seeing Warhammer 40,000 brought to life in live-action form across films and TV shows — and with Cavill steering the ship, they’re confident it will be done right. Hopefully we'll get some details, including who Cavill himself will play, soon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, condensing the vast scope of Warhammer 40,000 into films and TV shows while sticking to a reasonable budget may prove a challenge. Warhammer 40,000 is a highly detailed setting with multiple factions, thousands of years of war played out on a galactic scale, and, at the heart of it all, enormous Space Marines who often fight against even bigger monsters. We’re talking space battles that can last hundreds of years, gargantuan land battles that can consume entire planets, and the Warp, a place so unknowable that it can be pretty much anything you can imagine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that context, what story will Cavill tell? Does it need to be more grounded than a big galactic epic? We’re left with scraps to mull over, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-the-mere-mention-of-an-nda-by-a-games-workshop-author-has-sparked-all-sorts-of-speculation-about-what-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-might-be"><u>recent comments from Dan Abnett about NDAs and upcoming books</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In June last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/henry-cavill-says-hes-enjoying-the-challenge-of-creating-the-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-it-is-a-tricky-ip-and-a-very-complex-ip-and-thats-what-i-love-about-it"><u>Cavill himself touched on the “complexity” and “trickiness” of adapting the Warhammer 40,000 IP</u></a>. But, he insisted, he’s loving the challenge, which for fans will be great to hear. Bringing Warhammer to life "is a dream come true," Cavill said, "but it's different from what I've done before, in the sense I haven't had my hand on the tiller of things before. It's wonderful doing that. It is a tricky IP, and a very complex IP, and that's what I love about it. The challenges that come with putting this on the page in a way that is doing justice to that complexity, that trickiness, and that nuance, is a challenge I'm enjoying enormously."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Rountree did have one solid bit of news to deliver: a standalone Warhammer Age of Sigmar episode is in the works. Age of Sigmar is the fantasy portion of the Warhammer universe, as opposed to Warhammer 40,000's far future setting. This new episode follows on from the hugely popular Warhammer 40,000 episode for Amazon’s animated anthology series Secret Level, which starred Titus from Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it sounds like there’s more to come from a potential Secret Level Season 2. “After a successful collaboration with Amazon MGM Studios and Blur for Secret Level (a high-end animated anthology show), we are now meeting with writers to determine our next step to continue the momentum gained from that episode,” Rountree said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the meantime, work is almost complete on a standalone Warhammer Age of Sigmar episode. Again, for Prime Video. We will update you further when we have more significant milestones to share.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

He said GW staff are barred from using it to actually produce anything, but admitted a “few” senior managers are experimenting with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rountree said AI was “a very broad topic and to be honest I’m not an expert on it,” then went on to lay down the company line:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio — hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop owns and operates a number of hugely popular tabletop war games, including Warhammer 40,000 and Age of Sigmar. Its core business is selling miniatures and box sets that are used by fans to play these games, but there are a number of other creative aspects of the hobby that Games Workshop invests in, such as book selling, art sales, and animation production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/displate-denies-warhammer-40000-ai-art-accusations-says-red-flags-in-official-fulgrim-poster-are-the-result-of-human-error">Displate was forced to deny that one of its pieces of official Warhammer 40,000 artwork was the product of generative AI</a>, insisting “red flags” spotted by fans were the result of human error.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-horus-heresy-book-era-of-ruin-gets-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-talking-with-tantalizing-insight-into-the-carrion-emperor-and-the-golden-thrones-true-nature"><u>The Warhammer 40,000 setting is in many ways built upon the evocative and enduring art drawn by the likes of John Blanche</u></a>, who shaped its "grimdark" aesthetic alongside other key Games Workshop staff. This official, human-made Warhammer 40,000 artwork is beloved by fans, most of whom take a dim view of the mere whiff of generative AI “art” sold or released in any official capacity by either Games Workshop itself, or its partners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Games Workshop sells expensive Warhammer 40,000 ‘codex’ rulebooks that are packed with stunning official art as well as lore. Any suggestion that this art was created either in part or entirely by generative AI tools would likely cause a community uproar.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/13/ow852ulpdo731-1751405677082-1766411683253-1768309174083.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The God-Emperor, by John Blanche.
