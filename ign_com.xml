That’s the creation of the Kingdom Come movie," Frývaldský said (via machine translation). "We have been moving the Kingdom Come brand away from video games for some time now. So far we have been in comics, concerts, and tourism, but the film has attracted us the most. That is why Dan and I are working on getting it onto the screen or the big screen. There is also a draft script."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm sure people will wonder if this is some kind of breakup with Warhorse," he added, "No, on the contrary, Dan himself wanted to move on. He made three games that were a global success, he has been wanting to try something different for a long time. Getting Kingdom Come to the screen [...] in the next few years is another milestone that we want to achieve, and that is Dan's new role. You won't see him in the office every day anymore, but in a broader sense he is still part of Warhorse."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked for the latest on those plans to adapt Kingdom Come: Deliverance for the big screen, Frývaldský said: "For a long time, people were around us who would like to make a film of KCD, but then Covid came and everything fell asleep. Now, after the release of the second game, we have returned to the idea with much greater drive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We feel the interest from the film world, negotiations are already underway. We don't just want to sell the rights, we want the film to be what we imagine it to be."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frývaldský suggested that Vávra's new job title could be something like transmedia director as the team pushes to expand the franchise beyond games. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best RPG of 2025</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Kingdom Come: Deliverance video game, released in 2018, was a smash hit, selling over 10 million copies.

Still, in Japan, you can now buy miniature versions of some iconic weaponry — which is nice, we suppose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has played down Zelda and Link's big 40th birthday, with no new game or remaster to mark the occaison and no real fanfare at all. It's a very different situation to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-legend-shigeru-miyamoto-discusses-stepping-back-from-mario-hopes-to-stay-healthy-until-marios-50th-anniversary">Mario's 40th birthday celebrations last year</a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-get-nintendo-switch-launch-next-week-priced-at-20-each">Pokémon's impending 30th anniversary this Friday</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, however, Nintendo's official Japanese The Legend of Zelda social media account has come to life to <a href="https://x.com/ZeldaOfficialJP/status/2026205470034407844" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announce</a> the launch of "The Legend of Zelda Weapon Collection" — a highly-detailed set of miniature weapons, featuring some of the franchise's most iconic gear.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/24/hb5jdw0amaekp1j-1-1771934272840.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Made by Bandai, the nine-piece set includes the Master Sword, Hylian Shield, Royal Claymore, Zora Longsword, Seven Jewels Dagger, Great Eagle Bow, Stonecrusher, Lightscale Trident, and a rarer sheathed Master Sword variant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The items are being sold in candy boxes, and Nintendo says you can find them in Japanese stores within "candy sections in stores nationwide." Or on eBay, were pre-sale listings for the full collection are currently circulating, priced around $100. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Why hasn't Nintendo made more of Zelda's 40th anniversary? Well, with no big Switch 2 game on the horizon (and likely still a few years away yet, considering the still 2023 launch of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and the typical gap between mainline games), the franchise does not have a banner release to hang a celebration on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans remain hopeful for something new-ish on Switch 2 this year (another remake?) perhaps nearer the holidays. 2026 is the franchise's 40th year for a while longer, after all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than that, the franchise's next big moment will likely be the arrival of Nintendo's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-legend-of-zelda">The Legend of Zelda live-action movie</a> which is set to land in theaters on May 7, 2027.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty publisher Activision has issued a rare, if brief, comment to seemingly deny a claim it planned to launch a standalone Zombies game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2025670143184101532" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGhostofHope</a> stated on social media that Activision was prepping two separate Call of Duty games for the launch of Microsoft's next-gen Xbox console (currently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-generation-xbox-could-launch-in-2027-hints-amd">expected to launch in 2027 at the earliest</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The claim described these two launches as "a traditional Call of Duty multiplayer and a standalone Zombies title presumably developed by Treyarch," and likened their release to when "Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered where [sic] both released together."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That leak was then picked up by gaming blog Dexerto, to which Activision has now responded using its official Call of Duty social media account: "The rumor factory working overtime," Activision <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/2026038116364992596" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. "This ain't it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision typically does not respond to rumors or speculation, making this intervention notable. That said, the vague nature of the denial makes it unclear exactly which parts of the original claim Activision is now saying are untrue, or whether some element of this claim was true until plans ultimately changed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On social media, Call of Duty's response comes specifically in reply to a thread of tweets discussing the standalone Zombies title, and the claim it was being prepped as a launch title for Microsoft's next console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original rumor suggested that Microsoft's shifting release plans for its next Xbox hardware had meant that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4, the franchise's most anticipated upcoming release, would no longer be a launch title for the next-gen Xbox, as apparently had been planned. While not yet officially confirmed, Modern Warfare 4 is expected by fans to be this year's Call of Duty entry — but there's absolutely no suggestion that Microsoft is planning to launch new consoles this year. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Call of Duty Campaigns</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some kind of shakeup to Call of Duty's forthcoming release schedule is expected, following Activision's recent pledge to make <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games"><u>significant changes</u></a> to the franchise following the underperformance of Black Ops 7. The publisher has said it will never release back to back games in the same sub-brand (Modern Warfare, Black Ops) again, meaning it will likely need to come up with other options if it continues with an annual release schedule.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Microsoft's plans for new consoles, the company has confirmed it has fresh hardware in the works on several occaisons. In 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console">former Xbox president Sarah Bond said</a> Microsoft was "moving full speed ahead on our next generation hardware, focused on delivering the biggest technological leap ever in a generation." A year later, the company publicly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-first-party-next-generation-xbox-consoles-announces-deal-with-amd-and-promises-full-backwards-compatibility-with-your-existing-xbox-library"><u>confirmed its partnership with AMD on its next-generation Xbox project</u></a>. But a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-2027-launch-reportedly-best-case-scenario-following-amd-hint-that-microsoft-may-ship-new-hardware-next-year">recent report suggested that 2027 was now a conservative estimate for the company's new hardware</a> — which instead could now arrive later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-considering-pushing-back-ps6-release-to-2028-or-even-2029-amid-ai-fueled-chip-crisis">Sony is also reportedly considering delaying the launch of PlayStation 6 to 2028, or potentially even later</a>, due to the ongoing AI-fueled chip crisis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Of course, well-known Pokémon like Pikachu, Charizard and Bulbasaur have their own logos, but newer and more obscure Pokémon are also being shown love, such as Paradox Pokémon Iron Bundle and the matcha-themed Poltchageist.
