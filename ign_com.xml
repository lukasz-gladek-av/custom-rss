As it turns out, casting this character went a bit further, as director Hideo Kojima tried to find someone who could surpass a standout from the first Death Stranding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1899334415807070370" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>, Kojima wrote a lengthy post about the process of casting Italian actor Luca Marinelli to play Neil in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2</a>. "During the pandemic, I was casting for DS2," Kojima said. "Neil would be an important role that replaces Cliff from DS1. The fans would not be satisfied unless the casting would surpass Mads."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima first learned of Marinelli through his role in the Italian film They Call Me Jeeg, and a correspondence sprung up around the Japanese distribution of the film Martin Eden. Marinelli sent an email to Kojima, which read: "I grew up with Metal Gear. I am a big fan of yours. I am very honored that you saw the film I starred in. I wanted to tell you this directly."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2 - Release Date Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After seeing Marinelli in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-old-guard">The Old Guard</a>, Kojima sent the actor an email offer and talked with him after the actor wrapped filming The Eight Mountains. Once pitched, Marinelli agreed and, after learning Kojima was looking for someone to play Lucy, introduced the game director to his wife Alissa Jung.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We did their scan and pcap [performance capture] during the height of the pandemic, but their on-set performance was excellent," Kojima said. "You can see that in the digitized results from even the small bits of the trailer. I can only thank Luca and Alissa for agreeing to perform when we didn't even have a script yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marinelli's character, Neil, has been one of the breakout reveals from the latest Death Stranding 2 trailer. At its conclusion, we see Neil don a bandanna in the same way Solid Snake would in Metal Gear Solid, before directing a squad of soldiers in the same manner as Cliff in the first Death Stranding.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2 Cast</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The casting has clearly been on Kojima's mind for some time, as has the imagery of Luca donning the bandana. Back in 2020, Kojima talked about how Marinelli had caught his attention, adding: "I think if he donned a bandanna, he'd be a spitting image of Solid Snake!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's unlikely Neil is some multiversal Snake, the imagery certainly brings to mind Kojima's legacy with the Metal Gear franchise. Hopefully, he's picked the right man for the job.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-t-1000-packs-3-terminator-2-references-into-one-fatality<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1 developer NetherRealm has revealed a detailed look at T-1000 gameplay, and a look at a new Fatality packed with references to Terminator 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the video, below, we see the T-1000 use various liquid metal abilities to move about the screen, absorb hits, and poke at his enemies. Even shapeshifting sorcerer Shang Tsung praises the T-1000’s abilities during one pre-match trash talk cutscene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The highlight of the video is the look at one of the T-1000’s Fatalities, which includes three references to Terminator 2. The first is the iconic finger point through the eyeball, the second the arm blade through the mouth, then the elevator door parting, except through the T-1000’s foe’s torso. Its animality sees the T-1000 transform into a K-9 German Shepherd, another reference to Terminator 2. In the film, John Connor's foster parents owned a German Shepherd named Max. The Terminator calls the dog Wolfie to trick the T-1000.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The T-1000 in Mortal Kombat 1 is of course based on the liquid metal-based cybernetic assassin from the 1991 blockbuster Terminator 2: Judgment Day film, and features the voice and likeness of actor Robert Patrick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on the T-1000 from NetherRealm: </p><blockquote>Battling for the supremacy of machines, the T-1000 is a state-of-the-art infiltration Terminator designed by artificial general superintelligence system Skynet. Comprised of mimetic polyalloy (a.k.a. liquid metal), the virtually indestructible advanced prototype can shapeshift into objects or people it comes in contact with, mimicking their appearance, behavior, and voice, making it an extremely difficult opponent to detect and defeat. With its superior intelligence and metamorphic capabilities, the T-1000 is an efficient fighter that embodies the ultimate evolution of assassination technology.</blockquote><blockquote>The T-1000’s sophisticated moveset is on full display in the new trailer, including the ability to organically form stabbing weapons, such as spears and hooks, and liquify for high-tech maneuvering and concealment. The video also reveals a new Fatality for the T-1000 and teases the character’s Animality, the brutal finishing move that morphs the machine into a K-9 German Shepherd to annihilate defeated opponents. The fan favorite Animalities are available now as a content update for all Mortal Kombat 1 owners at no additional cost.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The T-1000 Terminator joins the Mortal Kombat 1 roster on March 18 as part of the early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners, followed by wide availability for purchase on March 25.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/11/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-kenshi-1741701745569.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mortal Kombat 1's T-1000 is packed with Terminator 2 references. Image credit: Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, we get another look at the upcoming Kameo character Madame Bo. In the trailer we see her Fatal Blow, a move in which she batters her enemy’s face with her slipper. Madam Bo will be available as a content update for all Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns owners at no additional cost or via standalone purchase on March 18.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 is the final DLC character set to be added to the 5 million-selling Mortal Kombat 1 as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Mortal Kombat development chief <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago"><u>Ed Boon said NetherRealm had decided on its next game three years prior, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
