Today's show was light on Microsoft's biggest franchises — with nothing from Forza, Halo or the upcoming Fable reboot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Xbox boss Phil Spencer promised that 2026 would be the year Gears of War: E-Day arrives, alongside the next Forza game, as the Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next chapter in Xbox's veteran Gears of War series was formally announced a year ago, at the Xbox Games Showcase 2024. E-Day will be a prequel set 14 years before the original Gears of War game, and an origin story for classic heroes Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-will-feature-marcus-and-doms-original-voice-actors">voiced once again by John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it's a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic," Coalition studio boss Mike Crump said previously. Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly-announced-as-co-developers">Bulletstorm and Gears of War: Judgment studio People Can Fly was announced as a co-developer on E-Day</a>, alongside Xbox's own studio The Coalition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until next year, fans have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-reloaded">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>, a remake of the series' original title, to look forward to, which launches for PC, Xbox Series X/S — and, for the first time, PlayStation 5 — on August 26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Xbox Games Showcase also featured a tease by Phil Spencer of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-teases-return-of-halo-in-2026-and-its-reportedly-a-halo-combat-evolved-remaster">long-awaited return for Halo, with potentially a remaster of the series' original title</a>.

It's called Keeper, and it puts you in the wobbly legs of a walking sapient lighthouse driven by a silly-looking bird. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The footage shows a goofy bird landing atop a lighthouse, which then sprouts spindly legs and begins trotting off across the continent with the bird seemingly helping or helming the operation. It's not clear just yet what the lighthouse is after, why or how it can walk, or what it's relationship with the bird is, but the world it's wandering is clearly a fantastical one in the dreamy vein of other Double Fine games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Strange as it seems, we've got high hopes for Keeper after Double Fine's past work. We gave Psychonauts 2 an 8/10, with our reviewer saying that its "weird and wonderfully written story is full of interesting, nuanced characters that I instantly fell in love with." and that "Double Fine has also done a great job of expanding this universe toward both grander and more intimate threats without losing the joyous childhood adventure vibes of the original."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeper is out on October 17 for PlayStastion 5, Xbox, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced-so-far">today's Xbox Games Showcase right here</a>, and keep up on the bevy of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-reveals-from-ign-live-2025">new announcements all weekend at IGN Live here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
