            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-is-teasing-something-nier-related-again-in-a-cryptic-website-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Re-reincarnation.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you enjoyed NieR: Automata and its predecessor, NieR: Replicant, you could be forgiven for not knowing that game actually got a sequel, and a pretty good one too. Unfortunately, that sequel, mobile game NieR: Re[in]carnation, hasn't been available for almost a year after being taken offline in April of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But fortunately, a Square Enix website is dropping some pretty wild in-universe hints that this might be about to change.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As pointed out to us on BlueSky by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewillarowe.bsky.social/post/3lnnoessmzk2k" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">journalist Willa Rowe</a>, an official NieR website that's currently publishing a NieR special movel to commemorate the series 15th anniversary is teasing something NieR: Re[in]carnation-related via cryptic in-text hints and webpage source code. As a part of today's update to the novel, the <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nier-anniversary/15th-novel/e58f8b/space/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just-published chapter 4</a> ends with some strange text that reads as follows:</p><blockquote>[WARNING] : Recovery protocol initialized...[ERROR] : Redirecting to backup node: &lt; https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nierreincarnation/ &gt;[INFO] : Analysis comments added to the source code.<br>[FATAL] : Process forcibly halted.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">What does THAT mean? Who knows? But wait, there's more. If you hit "View Source" on that page, there are even more weird teases in the code comments, as hinted at above. They read, in order:</p><blockquote>SECURITY NOTICE: Unauthorized transmission detected. Signal disruption logged. Countermeasure protocol active. Redirecting to backup node: <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nierreincarnation/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nierreincarnation/</a></blockquote><blockquote>TODO: Optimize rendering efficiency. Contradictions in "Her" emotions may interfere with signal clarity. Ensure transission remains undistorted.</blockquote><blockquote>FIXME: Visibility settings enabled for crashed observer system. He is watching...Adjust access permissions before deployment. His name is............</blockquote><blockquote>HACK: Log discrepancy detected. Records indicate previous modification attempts due to excessive interference from The Cage. Cross-check against original transmission before proceeding.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, there's a lot here, some of which is inscrutable and some of which makes sense. "The Cage", for instance, is the main location where most of NieR: Re[in]carnation takes place. And "Her" is a key character (yes, that's Her name) in Re[in]carnation as well. Between that and the hyperlink, it's pretty obvious what all this is referencing, but what exactly will become of it remains anyone's guess.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two final chapters of the novel are scheduled to publish on May 2, a week from today, and it's possible it may also pull back the curtain on whatever's happening here. Fans are speculating that it may be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NieRReincarnation/comments/1k7l4ym/new_nier_15th_anniversary_web_novel_chapters_14/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leading up to some sort of port or re-release of NieR: Re[in]carnation</a>, which has been completely unplayable anywhere since it went offline last year. They're also pointing out that the chapters of the special novel, which are currently only available in Japanese (but which fans are translating), have some pretty significant tie-ins to all three other NieR games.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screens  -  NieR Reincarnation</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're unfamiliar with Re[in]carnation, I highly recommend keeping an eye on this, especially if the end result is another opportunity to play it. Re[in]carnation is a good game in its own right that many slept on due to its being a mobile gacha game, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nier-3-has-been-in-front-of-us-all-along-per-series-creators-tease">critically, it's also the direct sequel to NieR: Automata</a>, and effectively is NieR 3, for those who have been waiting for it. Who knows? Maybe a new Re[in]carnation release could include some new content that ties the ongoing stream of loose NieR-related threads together at last.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The studio announced today that Expedition 33 has hit a sales milestone of 500,000 copies sold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A milestone for us, reached sooner than we'd ever imagined," the team said in a post on <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1915777375834452273" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>. "Thank you all."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 went live yesterday, April 24, across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. It's also a day-one Game Pass game, and despite launching a few days after the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-finally-revealed-in-first-look-gameplay-and-its-out-today">shadow-drop of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, the RPG still seems to be making waves. When Oblivion dropped, Clair Obscur's publisher Kepler Interactive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-acknowledges-the-barbenheimer-energy-of-releasing-the-same-week-as-oblivion-remastered">even jokingly compared it to "Barbenheimer."</a> The comparison, as it turns out, has been fairly accurate.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by the newly formed studio Sandfall Interactive, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a turn-based RPG that takes heavy inspiration from the genre classics, from Final Fantasy to Persona. It follows a crew of Expeditioners in a fractured, post-apocalytpic world where every year, a giant being called The Paintress etches a new number and erases anyone older than it. The members of the Expedition, the next up on the block, have one goal in mind: travel to the ends of the continent and destroy the Paintress, ensuring she can never paint death again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reception of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been widely positive, sitting at <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">92 on MetaCritic</a> and <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/18026/clair-obscur-expedition-33" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">91 on OpenCritic</a>, putting it alongside Split Fiction and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 as some of the year's most lauded games thus far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">IGN's 9/10 review of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, our reviewer described it as a "modern RPG classic," wearing its inspirations on its sleeve and painting itself into the pantheon of great RPGs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're starting the adventure this weekend, or maybe already have, be sure to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/clair-obscur-expedition-33/Tips_-_Things_Clair_Obscur_Doesn't_Tell_You">check out our tips for the important things to know before going into Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

As spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-fan-runs-into-tsa-by-trying-to-take-monkey-bomb-on-plane-3185682/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dexerto</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1202998258156542&amp;set=a.407732524349790&amp;locale=en_GB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TSA account on Facebook</a> highlighted a replica figurine of the Monkey Bomb from Call of Duty's Zombies mode that officers at Boston Logan International Airport found in a checked bag.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/25/493273042-1202998264823208-4830061258408916107-n-1745593633126.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Transportation Security Administration - TSA / Facebook.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Monkey Bomb, or Cymbal Monkey, has appeared in numerous Call of Duty games, from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-world-at-war">World at War</a> through to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>. This particular figurine is meant to be a controller, with its hands outstretched to cradle your favorite game controller. But it's also a replica of a weapon that, well, looks like it has dynamite and cables strapped to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This monkey may rack up points in a game, but in real life, leave the gear for your loadout screen, not your baggage," the post read. "Replica weapons and explosives, no matter how cool or collectible, aren't allowed in either carry-on or checked baggage."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The TSA website does also go into detail about <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/toy-guns-and-weapons" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prohibited toy weapons</a>, including "squirt guns, Nerf guns, toy swords, or other items that resemble realistic firearms or weapons." Maybe that's some decent advertising, at least, for the quality of the Monkey Bomb replica statue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's good to be aware of if you're heading to a convention or place where you might pick up some merch. Whether a monkey figurine or a set of <a href="https://x.com/TSA/status/1744728996741537919" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Naruto-themed throwing knives</a>, the TSA warns that it prohbiits any item in checked or carry-on baggage if they believe it poses a security threat, even if it's a replica.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Transportation Security Administration - TSA / Facebook.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
