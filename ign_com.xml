            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-trailers-of-summer-of-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The summer is a great period for games, but also kinda weird when you think about it: it’s a few weeks where we’re all more excited about watching trailers for games, rather than playing them. It’s all for a good reason, of course – the multiple big presentations, once the framework that held up E3, showcase the most exciting new games in development and often reveal new projects for the very first time. They’re our first taste of what we’ll be playing tomorrow and beyond, and so naturally they garner a huge amount of interest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To see what’s really caught players’ attention, we’ve combed through every video posted to IGN over the last couple of weeks and picked out the 10 most-viewed trailers from the Summer of Gaming. There are some clear standouts, clocking up millions of views, as well as a mix of highly-anticipated returns and brand new surprises. You can see the biggest and best trailers below. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Resident Evil Requiem</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 2.1 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil 9</a> was the big hit of Summer of Gaming 2025. Resi fans have been waiting a long time for this one, with Requiem’s predecessor – Resident Evil Village – having been released back in 2021. And with Ethan Winters’ story now over, the perspective is switching to a new character. This first trailer provides a solid introduction to FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft, and we couldn’t be more excited because it appears she’ll be heading to a bombed-out Raccoon City. While much of the trailer is set in Ashcroft’s office, the final segment goes hard on the dark and gnarly survival horror tone established in Resident Evil 7 – making it clear that developer Capcom is looking to scare us all silly. We can’t wait.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Invincible VS</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 2.1 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Video’s animated version of Robert Kirkman’s Invincible comics has proven exceptionally popular, so naturally an Invincible video game has captured the imagination of many gamers this week. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs">Invincible VS</a> is a 3v3 tag fighting game that really does seem to capture the bone-crunching, bloody violence of the TV show – more than clear during the shot where Invincible causes Bulletproof’s head to detonate. While the promise of a city-destroying Invincible vs Omni-Man showdown is enough to sell us on the idea, seeing other characters turn up for the tag-style matches – including Atom Eve and Rex Plode – really has us eager to learn more.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Game of Thrones: War for Westeros</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 1.5 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">People may grumble about Game of Thrones’ final season to this day, but that doesn’t mean the fantasy series has lost any popularity. That’s proven by the massive number of views on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/game-of-thrones-war-for-westeros">War for Westeros</a> trailer, which acts as something of a “what if?” scenario. The cinematic trailer sees Jon Snow face off against the Night King in a one-on-one duel, a thrilling event that never happened in the HBO show. As the fight continues, we see other exciting but similarly non-canon moments play out, such as Daenerys and Drogon being shot out of the sky by a huge ballista, and Jaime Lannister fighting in what appears to be a four-way battle between his army, Stark bannermen, the Unsullied, and the White Walkers (the first hint of this being a real-time strategy rather than an action game). The big surprise, though, is seeing Jon killed and turned into a wight. As many in the trailer’s comments have said, this is the big finale season 8 could have been. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. ILL</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 1.3 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil understandably got the most love of any horror reveal this year, but we’re delighted to see the grotesque gameplay trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ill">ILL </a>also struck a chord. This terrifying, rusty-looking survival horror is full of some of the freakiest enemies we’ve seen recently, including multi-limbed monstrosities, bobble-headed babies, and zombies with a desperate need to see a dentist. All of them can be torn apart thanks to an "advanced dismemberment system". Despite all that grossness, ILL knows how to crack a good joke: over in the equally engaging <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ill-official-trailer-summer-game-fest-2025">SGF trailer</a>, the whole sequence ends with a zombie toddler being kicked in the face and punted into a pile of barrels. A little dark humour to brighten up your Summer of Gaming, there.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. The Expanse: Osiris Reborn</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 1.2 million</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG experts Owlcat Games is back with a new project, set in the world of The Expanse. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-expanse-osiris-reborn">Osiris Reborn</a> is very different from Owlcat’s previous projects – where the studio usually develops isometric RPGs that take inspiration from both games like the original Baldur’s Gate and tabletop adventures, this new Expanse game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-expanse-osiris-reborn-from-the-developer-of-warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-looks-a-lot-like-a-new-mass-effect-and-yes-there-is-romance">looks a lot like a modern-day Mass Effect</a>. And considering how long it’s been since we had a good Mass Effect, it’s no wonder the internet has gone wild for this lengthy trailer, which combines exciting cinematics involving flying grenades and face crystals with a healthy gameplay montage demonstrating some good cover-shooting mechanics. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. 007 First Light</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 835,000</strong> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive’s Bond game was announced years ago, but we finally got to see it in action as part of PlayStation’s State of Play stream. The coolest thing about this trailer is how it treats <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">First Light</a> as if it were a brand new 007 film, introducing us to the new cast playing the likes of M, Q, and – of course – James Bond. Our super spy hero is much younger and greener than we’re used to, but it’s clear that IOI knows everything that’s required for a hit Bond mission. There’s exotic locations, expensive watches, a vintage Aston Martin, and more high-stakes action than the entire Hitman trilogy combined. It seems like IOI really does have a license to thrill.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. ROG Xbox Ally X</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 822,000</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">New hardware is always going to draw significant interest, and so it's no surprise to see a handheld Xbox among the most-watched trailers. Of course, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/rog-xbox-ally">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> isn’t <em>quite </em>a true handheld Xbox – this portable PC is developed by Asus rather than Microsoft itself, and is an extension of its existing line of ROG Ally devices. However, it’s still the next step in Microsoft’s “This is an Xbox” project, which aims to allow you to play Xbox games anywhere from your console to your computer, TV, phone, and (presumably, one day) your fridge. And a powerful handheld PC that can directly interface with Xbox Game Pass and the Xbox cloud services is certainly nothing to be sniffed at. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Atomic Heart 2</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 796,000</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first trailers for the original Atomic Heart were big hits with the IGN audience, but a sequel was never a sure thing – reception of the first game was mixed, and it wasn’t quite the BioShock spiritual successor that the trailers suggested. Nevertheless, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/atomic-heart-2">Atomic Heart 2</a> seems to be doing it all over again. This time around things look significantly more expansive; there’s space stations, wall-running, hang-gliding, mechs, and more vehicles, plus what looks like a much more active world with a larger array of characters. It’s all rendered in Atomic Heart’s signature, retro-futuristic Sovietpunk art style, which really is unlike anything else out there. Well, apart from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-cube">The Cube</a>, a multiplayer game set in the Atomic Heart universe that was also announced at Summer Game Fest this year.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 720,000</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’d think that the only kart racing game anyone would care about in June 2025 would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a>, but the latest trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> has truly popped off. That may be down to Sonic going through what is undoubtedly his most significant popularity spike in many years (no doubt thanks to the movies), but it also helps that this new trailer shows off some exciting guest additions to the character roster: Hatsune Miku, Like a Dragon's Ichiban Kasuga, Persona 5's Joker, and Minecraft's Steve. There’s even Minecraft-themed courses, which hints to even larger ambitions when it comes to cross-dimensional races. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Chronicles: Medieval</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>View count: 708,000</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s very little gameplay in the trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chronicles-medieval">Chronicles: Medieval</a>, but those brief few seconds reveal that we’ll be leading an entire army from horseback. That promises an epic scale, perhaps one similar to that explored by the Mount &amp; Blade series. The CGI cinematic proceeding that glimpse of gameplay showcases the life experiences of a medieval warrior, from simple village life, to forging weapons, to bracing against cavalry charges. If Chronicles: Medieval can capture all that, then all the excitement around this trailer will be well-rewarded. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Honourable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also a few other trailers that demand honourable mentions. Naturally, much-demanded sequels and remakes always do well in trailer showcases, and so it hasn’t been surprising to see both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-official-gameplay-trailer-state-of-play-2025">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/high-on-life-2-official-announcement-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">High on Life 2</a> clock up over half a million views each. It’s been far too long since we had a new MGS game, and while Delta isn’t a brand new entry, it is at least a shiny remake of arguably the best game in Kojima’s back catalogue. High on Life, meanwhile, was a breakout hit for Squanch Games back in 2022, and clearly people are excited about wielding even weirder weapons with faces in a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel has also had its fair share of success, but it wasn't ambitious PlayStation 4v4 tag team game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</a> that drew in the crowds. Instead it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/marvels-deadpool-vr-official-reveal-trailer-summer-game-fest-2025">Deadpool VR</a> and its kinetic, violent action. It really seems like an authentic Deadpool experience, from hacking a guy's head off with a katana and then bowling it at another enemy, to forcing someone’s face into a propeller. And because it’s VR, you know this is all player-controlled stuff rather than canned animations. We can’t wait to see the horrible possibilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But returning favourites are perhaps not as exciting as the truly new, and joining MGS, High on Life 2, and Deadpool in the “over half-a-million club” is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-official-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Blood of the Dawnwalker</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/clockwork-revolution-official-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Clockwork Revolution</a>. The former is a new RPG from former CD Projekt Red developers, and looks a little like a new take on The Witcher's recipe with bloodthirsty vampires. The latter, meanwhile, is from the RPG longbeards at InXile, and the five-minute-plus trailer dives deep into its steampunk world, roleplaying mechanics, and time-travel systems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN is, of course, not the only place people go to for trailers on the internet. We’ve also taken a look at the official YouTube channels for PlayStation and Xbox, and you’ll see similar stats there. 007 First Light was the big winner at PlayStation, with almost three million views, closely followed by Resident Evil Requiem. ILL and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/silent-hill-f-official-release-date-trailer-japanese-audio-state-of-play-2025">Silent Hill f</a> also pulled in over a million views each, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/gears-of-war-reloaded-official-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> – which marks the series’ arrival on a Sony console for the very first time – saw in excess of half a million views. As for Xbox, the brand new ROG Xbox Ally X handheld PC was the leader with over a million views, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/persona-4-revival-official-reveal-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Persona 4 Revival</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/super-meat-boy-3d-official-reveal-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Super Meat Boy 3D</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/beast-of-reincarnation-official-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025">Beast of Reincarnation</a> all clocked up hundreds of thousands of views.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what was your personal favourite trailer of the event?
