            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has announced plans to build a new Warhammer World in the United States with a late 2027 target for opening its doors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer World, in Nottingham, England, is the focal point for Games Workshop’s various tabletop games and a social hub for the hobby. It includes an exhibition centre with dramatic, large-scale dioramas featuring everything from famous battles in the grimdark sci-fi setting Warhammer 40,000 to the fantasy world of Age of Sigmar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For competitors, a sizeable castle-themed gaming hall lets fans play matches, often in scheduled tournaments. There’s a themed bar and restaurant, areas to paint miniatures, and an in-house store with exclusive products.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/u6jqjmvz/a-warhammer-world-in-the-usa-get-the-details-here/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, Games Workshop confirmed its plans to start work on the new Warhammer World, to be built just outside Washington DC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This new Warhammer World will be a flagship venue that celebrates Warhammer in all its forms: gaming, painting, modelling, storytelling, events, and community,” Games Workshop said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The original Warhammer World in Nottingham, UK sets a very high bar. We’re not going to replicate it brick-for-brick, but instead build something equally uncompromising on quality and experience, something worthy of Warhammer’s rich settings and of course the title ‘Warhammer World.’ And of course, at the heart of all this is creating something extraordinary for all of you — the Warhammer fans!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now, there’s a lot to do – but with a fair wind, and the might of the Emperor and his inexhaustible armies, we hope to open the doors late in 2027.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With this new Warhammer World, Games Workshop is clearly hoping to reinforce its explosive success and the ever-increasing popularity of Warhammer 40,000 in particular, which in recent years has grown far beyond the confines of a tabletop game. Its loyal fandom fusses over lore, analyzes new novels for fresh insight into the setting, and speculates about future development. The smash hit video game Space Marine 2 boosted interest in all things Warhammer 40,000 — so much so that playable character <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">Titus is now the poster boy of the tabletop game and is even at the heart of its next narrative expansion</a>. And former Superman actor Henry Cavill’s upcoming Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe for Amazon will undoubtedly take it to new heights. It makes a lot of sense to have a Warhammer World in place to capitalize on the army of newcomers Cavill’s Prime Video work will surely rally together. (Cavill once visited Warhammer World in the UK and posted a video of his tour on Instagram.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Warhammer 40,000 fans are bracing themselves for an announcement and release of the 11th Edition of the game, accompanying lore developments, and new model releases. And we’re arguably in the golden age of Warhammer 40,000 video games, with Space Marine 2 still receiving updates, Space Marine 3 in the works, and Dawn of War 4 and Total War: Warhammer 40,000 waiting in the wings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

But while Original Sin 2 has been on Nintendo's system since 2019, Larian's next game, Baldur's Gate 3, never made it to any Nintendo console. Why not? Well, Larian at least says it wasn't its decision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit AMA today</a> conducted by various members of Larian, CEO Swen Vincke took a moment to answer a question about whether or not Baldur's Gate 3 for Nintendo Switch 2 was "even possible". Sadly, his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">answer wasn't a happy one</a>: "We would have loved to but it's wasn't our decision to make."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke is speaking in the past tense because officially, Larian is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-notes-include-final-farewell-message-as-larian-looks-ahead">done with Baldur's Gate 3</a>. It's still supporting the game with minor bug fixes, but there's no reason to expect the studio to do a whole new release on a new platform now, especially since it's moved on to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">new Divinity game</a>. That leaves Wizards of the Coast in charge of the future of Baldur's Gate 3, meaning a port isn't happening without its blessing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which seems to be what Vincke is implying here - that Larian would have done one, but Wizards for whatever reason decided not to. Wizards of the Coast declined to comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is a shame for Switch owners, because Baldur's Gate is a fantastic game. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">gave it a 10/10</a> at launch, saying that "with crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We covered other topics from Larian's AMA today, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-writer-wishes-wyll-had-gotten-more-content-and-a-more-fulfilling-arc-too-explains-what-happened">what happened to Wyll's storyline</a> in Baldur's Gate 3 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-divinity-from-larians-reddit-ama">how Larian will (or won't) use generative AI for Divinity</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Nintendo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-new-switch-2-joy-con-colors-light-purple-and-light-green">recently announced</a> it’s releasing a Light Purple and Light Green color variant of the Joy-Con 2 Switch 2 controllers, and now it's available for preorder.

And since black is still the main color on the casing, they’re not as flashy as the color variants of the original Switch Joy-Con. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the new colors are visible under the thumb sticks, as well as on the connector part of the controllers. The included plastic bumpers for the wrist straps are also the same colors, so they’ll be more visible when the Joy-Con 2s are disconnected from the console or grip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you’re buying an extra pair of Joy-Con 2 for multiplayer sessions, having different colors for each player makes it easier to tell your controller from everyone else’s. For me, if I were in the market for an extra set of Joy-Con 2, I’d definitely get these instead of a second set of red and blue ones.</p></div><div catalogid="c49cc388-129c-45cb-84e8-738834eaacdc" id="228077"><div id="228077" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mario Tennis Fever</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I suspect it’s no coincidence that Nintendo’s next big first-party Switch 2 game is also coming out the same day as these new Joy-Con 2 colors.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">And why his story still seems to be lacking.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the years since Baldur's Gate 3's release, Larian has put a lot of time and energy into updating the game with tons of new content, including new content for some beloved character who got the short end of the wizard staff the first time around, like Karlach. But one character is still coming up short for fans: Wyll. And at least one writer at Larian is just as frustrated by it as you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylf1wn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit AMA today</a> conducted by a number of Larian employees, during which one person asked why Wyll wasn't developed further in post-launch patches, even as other companions got storyline and even personality updates. We've known for a while that the "Blade of Frontiers" warlock Wyll was <a href="https://gamerant.com/baldurs-gate-3-wyll-early-access-story-change-karlach-explained/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rewritten significantly from his early access version to final version</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question was answered by Larian senior writer Kevin VanOrd, who explained that he also wished Wyll had gotten more attention, and that the lack of content compared to other companions was mostly the result of a series of unfortunate timing coincidences. Here's how VanOrd puts it:</p><blockquote>I wish Wyll had gotten more content and a more fulfilling arc too.</blockquote><blockquote>As you probably know, we weren't connecting with Wyll's Early Access recruitment and initial questing, so we started over at a point when most of the other companion stories were fairly solid. A lot of decisions came later in development than was ideal - and there was a key situation near Baldur's Gate that I intended to heavily involve Wyll in (the Red War College) that got cut. That meant back to the drawing board again. We eventually tied him to Duke Ravengard and started to work on that element of his arc just in time for me to get unexpectedly ill. I was out of the office for quite a while, and again after the epilogue's release.</blockquote><blockquote>I think that Ansur's lair was Swen's idea - we did have the resources for a standalone dungeon, so we got to work on tying Wyll to the Wyrmway, but I couldn't get more than a dungeon boss out of it. Once the situations were in place, that was that - I had to start writing them.</blockquote><blockquote>Wyll's content is sparser than I'd have liked as a result. He's also split into two stories, really - the Mizora story and the Ravengard story, and that might have been a mistake in hindsight. I also wish I could given him a stronger endpoint - it always bugged me that he can end up just as he started, as the Blade of Frontiers, without any meaningful difference. All that said, I love the Blade and I am really proud of him, his sincerity, his good nature, and his eager heroism. I'm truly sorry I didn't give you more quality time with him.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that it's not that Wyll received no updates post-launch. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-long-awaited-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-alongside-massive-patch-notes">Patch 7</a> made some light tweaks to Wyll's dialogue that helped those pursuing him romantically have a more interesting time, though it didn't really give him any new story content. But that's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/karlach-is-trending-on-xtwitter-after-baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-because-her-new-evil-ending-is-absolutely-metal">nothing compared to Karlach</a>, who got an entirely new ending in the same patch. Karlach, like Wyll, was considered to be one of the character who had been given the least love in terms of story content in the 1.0 release, and has consistently been a popular favorite. Recently, one fan <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/determined-baldurs-gate-3-fan-calculates-it-has-236-hours-of-recorded-dialogue-and-even-larian-had-no-idea-it-was-that-much">broke down how many minutes of dialogue</a> every character in Baldur's Gate 3 had, and Wyll's down below most of the other companions with just under 9 hours speaking. Still, it's not as bad as Halsin, Minthara, Jaheira, and Minsc, though admittedly those four companions are a little more complex to recruit and you can't even get them until Acts 2 or 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, perhaps cold comfort to Wyll fans, but it's comforting to know that he wasn't intentionally sidelined.

            <guid>1402054</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> fans have made progress towards solving the game's newly-discovered spiderweb mystery, and now believe they've reached its final clue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, attention was thrown on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-discovery-in-red-dead-redemption-2-in-years-rockstar-fans-uncover-spiderweb-mystery-unnoticed-since-release-and-now-the-hunt-is-on-for-answers">major new discovery within Rockstar's epic cowboy sequel, dubbed the biggest uncovering of hidden content in years</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">An intricately-placed breadcrumb trail of spiderwebs was found and plotted, leading to a further set of marked telegraph poles. These then pointed to a collection of guitars within the game's Fort Wallace location, where the trail temporarily went cold. Now, however, fans have pushed forwards — to what seems like a final clue beyond the edge of Red Dead Redemption 2's map, and a sense of what this whole mystery might actually be about. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, progress on the discovery has been brilliantly chronicled by YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COX49Q71y0Y" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strange Man</a>, who picks up the trail back at Fort Wallace by showing that these guitars acted as signposts, guiding players to the roof of the location's tower. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On this roof, two tiny engravings of flying birds were then spotted, pointing in the direction of Giant's Birds, right at the very north of the game's map within Calumet Ravine. Heading here and using binoculars allows you to see a tiny, faint, but unmistakable "?" symbol on a mountain in the distance. The design of the question mark across the far hillside is such that it is only visible from this particular location. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, it's a smart set of clues — which is perhaps why this mystery has taken over seven years to be discovered — and once again, progress has stalled. But there's a sense now, with this latest clue way beyond the boundary of the map, that the trail has reached its final stage. As Strange Man suggests, it now seems likely that the mystery's denoument is right here, though the trigger remains elusive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let's solve this before GTA 6 arrives!" Strange Man wrote, asking for further ideas from fellow fans. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/09/i-found-the-last-step-of-the-spider-web-mystery-rdr2-00-05-49-1767975280217.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Does this mark the spot? Image credit: Strange Man/Rockstar Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the wait for an answer continues, there is at least a growing sense of what this whole breadcrumb trail might be about. With the hunt for clues leading to Calumet Ravine, it's been noted that this is in the Wapiti reserve, amplifying previous suggestions that earlier steps in the mystery were an obtuse reference to Wapiti tribe member Eagle Flies. (Feathers could be shot out of spiderwebs, with five colored black and three colored red. Eagle Flies appears in five story missions, before three more which chart his capture and eventual death.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could it all lead nowhere? Possibly, but earlier this week IGN's previous story on the mystery was shared by former Rockstar developer Adam Butterworth, who provided the first official acknowledgement that the game had included this trail of clues. "Absolutely wild people have found this," he <a href="https://x.com/Adam76511able/status/2008220493266981116?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on social media. "I remember hearing about this and thinking it would never be discovered."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As things stand, this complex and multi-stage mystery has left fans on the edge of Wapiti territory, and has hinted at its tribe member Eagle Flies. What will be discovered next? Here's hoping we aren't waiting until GTA 6 to find out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

It received a glowing 10/10 in its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">review</a>, with IGN's Logan Plant calling it, "a truly groundbreaking 3D platformer, with satisfying movement, powerful abilities, impressive destructible environments, and clever challenges that all come together in complete harmony to create Nintendo’s first Switch 2 masterpiece."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all, though. It also won <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">Best Family Game at The Game Awards</a> and was awarded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-nintendo-game-of-2025">IGN's best Nintendo game of 2025</a>. Plant stated that this is because it, "brilliantly redefines one of gaming’s oldest characters while simultaneously paying loving tribute to every era of the great ape."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It may only be January, but I say it’s never too early to look towards the future and try to predict what the best games of 2026 will end up being. I don’t have a crystal ball or some sort of undiagnosed superpower, but I do have a long list of all the games coming out over the next 12 months and a modicum of taste to guide me, though. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 secured a pretty convincing sweep of wins during the end-of-year 2025 awards, but who truthfully saw that coming before its April release date? So, what could surprise us this year? And will a left-field project have what it takes to steal this year’s IGN Best Game award away from the very obvious contender we can see coming from a mile off? Let’s take a look ahead and try to predict what will be the 2026 game of the year, fully aware that whatever’s here has a not-insignificant chance of being proven completely wrong, and you can all come back here in December and tell me what an idiot I am.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>GTA 6</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The quite enormous elephant in the room is, obviously, Grand Theft Auto 6. But no GTA game, or, for that matter, no Rockstar game, has ever won IGN’s overall game of the year prize. That includes all of those PS2 classics from Vice City to San Andreas, and more recent creations, such as 2013’s GTA 5, which lost out to The Last of Us, and Red Dead Redemption 2 (my favourite game of all time), which got edged out in 2018 by God of War. Sadly for me, the vote doesn’t all come down to my opinion, so I guess I’ll just have to get over it. One day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, does GTA 6 have a shot at taking home our biggest prize? Obviously, it does. It’s arguably the most anticipated game of all time, a feat achieved by Rockstar’s recent trend of receiving 10 out of 10 review scores, and we expect (or at least hope) the studio builds upon those successes with whatever it releases this November. If Rockstar can avoid implementing a delay yet again, we won’t have to wait too long after that release date to see if the IGN staff (and the voters behind other award ceremonies) determine it as the greatest game of 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: Could Rock, and also take the Star prize.</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, Resident Evil is another series that has never won IGN’s game of the year. It did come very close to doing so, though, when the Resident Evil 2 remake narrowly missed out on the 2019 award, coming in as our runner-up to Remedy’s Control. The soonest to release on this list of contenders, Resident Evil Requiem could have a shot at winning this year, though, if it fulfills the promise of its many teaser trailers. Combining the classic third-person action-horror magic of the likes of Resident Evil 4 with the more modern first-person scares from the likes of Village could prove a perfect cocktail to suit everyone’s tastes. We’ll find out just how good it is when it comes out on February 27, but then face a 10-month wait to see if anything rises above it for the rest of 2026. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: Scarier things have happened.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Control Resonant</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the 2019 awards, could Control go back-to-back on game of the year wins when its sequel, Control Resonant, arrives this year? You can always bank on something interesting coming from Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment, and it doesn’t look like it's resting on its laurels either, with the follow-up to Jesse Faden’s supernatural-powered action-adventure mixing things up quite a bit by putting us in <em>control</em> of her brother in a wide-open Manhattan. A switch to melee-focused combat certainly has us excited, as does a story that looks deeply rooted in the events of Alan Wake 2, as Remedy continues to build out its connected universe,  but will it be enough to secure another game of the year win?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: Could be just the Remedy needed after FBC: Firebreak.</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Marvel’s Wolverine</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac has delivered consistently amazing games, but the studio has never quite secured one of our overall game of the year awards. Both Marvel’s Spider-Man games made the shortlist in their respective years, and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart also impressed in 2021, but will the angriest of the X-Men have a better chance? Yes, while it doesn’t yet have a release date locked in, Marvel’s Wolverine is the Sony studio’s project for 2026, and it looks highly impressive from the little we’ve seen so far. It’s actually been a whole eight years since a PlayStation exclusive won the IGN game of the year award, so could Wolverine be set to claw back that record?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: We wouldn’t lose sleep if Insomniac came out on top.</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Saros</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony will have more than one opportunity this year, though, as Saros arrives in April. Housemarque’s follow-up to its critically acclaimed looper shooter, Returnal, hopes are definitely high for this PS5 exclusive. Returnal made our shortlist back in 2021, but ultimately lost out to Xbox, exclusive (at the time, anyway) Forza Horizon 5. If Saros displays the exquisite shooter design skills that Housemarque has honed throughout Super Stardust, Resogun, and many more over the years, as well as a thrilling story and engaging world, then it may well have the juice to claim the number one spot in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: The House(marque) always wins, but will it here?</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fable</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It may have won our award back in 2021, but Playground Games certainly won’t be resting on its laurels when it comes to Fable. A reboot of the long-dormant RPG series originally developed by Lionhead Studios, the Forza Horizon developer will be taking on an entirely different type of open world in this fairy tale-infused universe. Could it be the best game of 2026, though? Well, fantasy RPGs have traditionally done very well when it comes to game of the year, with Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Elden Ring, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and, of course, most recently, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 all winning the IGN vote since 2014. That track record bodes well for Playground, and we can’t wait to see its take on Fable at the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: Would be a Fairy Tale ending to Fable’s development.</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>007 First Light</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no doubt that IO Interactive knows how to make a fantastic assassin game, but how about spies? Well, we’ll find out in 2026 when the Hitman studio turns its attention to James Bond in 007: First Light. Will this stealth action-adventure blend the best of Agent 47 with spectacle worthy of Uncharted? If it manages to, maybe it will find itself in game of the year consideration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: 007 to 1 odds.</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Nintendo</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A big question mark for 2026 is what games Nintendo has cooking as it approaches the Switch 2’s second year in the wild. Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza set the console off to a good start, but neither quite had what it took to win game of the year. So, what could stand a chance? <strong>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Wealth</strong> is the upcoming 18th entry into the tactical RPG series, and while we know little about it yet, FE has traditionally set a high quality marker. There’s also Switch 2 exclusive, <strong>The Duskbloods, </strong>and if there’s anything Hidetaka Miyazaki and the team at FromSoftware know about, it’s winning game of the year awards. Let’s see if this upcoming PvPvE action RPG can do something similar.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it may be fanciful to expect a new mainline Zelda anytime soon, it has been many years (far too many, if you ask me) since a <strong>new 3D Mario game</strong>. Nothing is hinting at one arriving in 2026, but we can dare to dream, because if history is to go by, when that plumber starts jumping, he more often than not enters the game of the year conversation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: A surprise Nintendo hit would Switch things up nicely. </strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Half-Life 3</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Haha, it could happen, couldn’t it? Not that the rumours have ever truly died, but over recent months, whispers have started to get louder and louder about the arrival of a new Half-Life game. A new Steam machine is due out early in 2026, and it would be the perfect launch game, after all. We won’t seriously consider Half-Life 3 a game of the year prospect until we have it in our hands, though, and who knows if that will ever happen. If Valve does decide that the time is now, then it’s certainly a strong contender, as we gave Portal 2 our biggest award back in 2011, as well as Half-Life 2 in 2004.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: Hahahaha</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Potential Breakout Hits</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As I mentioned at the beginning, it’s not always the games you expect at the start of the year that end up taking home the game of the year prize. So let’s look at a few that are a little more under the radar than those listed above. <strong>Replaced </strong>has received a lot of buzz and is a 2.5D action-platformer from Ukrainian developer Coatsink. Its beautiful pixel art depicting a sci-fi city with a distinctly Blade Runner-like look could surprise a few that aren’t familiar with it when it arrives on March 12. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s <strong>Mixtape</strong>, the new coming-of-age retro adventure from Australian studio Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur, who made a few game of the year shortlists back in 2021 with the psychedelic The Artful Escape. Its nostalgia-laced tale, supported by a soundtrack of ‘80s favourites, could hit just right if it all comes together like the trailers suggest it might. And finally, <strong>Mewgenics </strong>is an upcoming roguelike tactical RPG from the creators of Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac that has been in development for many, many years. The buzz is high for it as it finally looks set for a February 10 release. Could the cat get the cream come December time?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Chances: We all love an underdog story. But what about an undercat?</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Verdict</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So, who do I think will actually win? Well, it is impossible to ignore the behemoth that is GTA 6, but seeing as I’m still not <em>100% </em>convinced that it’s arriving this year, <strong>I’m going to go with Saros as my pick</strong>. I think that Housemarque’s reputation has only grown over time, and more and more people have gotten around to playing Returnal since its 2021 release, and would love to give the studio its flowers in 2026 if Saros turns out to fulfill its potential.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you think will win IGN’s game of the year 2026 award? Will it be a game that hasn’t even been revealed yet?
