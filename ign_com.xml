It's coming on September 15, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insomniac.games/post/3mfmnbgtbbg2x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post shared across social media</a> by Insomniac, reading: "Let's cut to the chase: Marvel's Wolverine launches September 15, 2026." A six-second teaser accompanied this:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a sudden, welcome release date announcement after expectations rose for a Wolverine appearance in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-developer-suggests-wolverine-will-skip-tomorrows-big-state-of-play">State of Play earlier this month</a>, only to have those expectations disappointed when it did not show up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wolverine has been a bit of an elusive game since its initial announcement. The game was first teased at The Game Awards was back in 2021 with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-wolverine-game-in-development">brief cinematic reveal</a>.

The Trickster’s Delusion Map is part of the new chapter that launches on March 17, along with new survivor Kwon Tae-young, and an update to K-pop Killer the Trickster himself. If you can't wait, today marks the launch of the PTB for the new chapter on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Woven by The Entity from The Trickster’s twisted subconscious, the new area features shops to browse, a marketplace, and a two-story nightclub, along with scattered details reflecting the Killer’s erratic state of mind," reveals developer Behaviour Interactive.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dead By Daylight's New Urban Map for All-Kill: Comeback</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kpop-demon-hunters-singer-kevin-woo-exclusively-reveals-his-new-dead-by-daylight-survivor"><u>Yesterday IGN revealed that Kevin Woo, who had previously consulted on Dead By Daylight for the first All-Kill K-pop themed chapter, was returning to voice Survivor Kwon Tae-young.</u></a> Even if you don't recognize Woo's name, you've definitely heard his voice, as he provided the vocals for demonic boy band member Mystery in KPop Demon Hunters. His Survivor isn't an idol though, he's a tech specialist working on a virtual idol called MiNA, designed to replicate the original K-pop star turned Killer, the Trickster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Voice acting for KPop Demon Hunters deepened my appreciation for how much storytelling can be communicated purely through tone, breath control, and texture. Without physical performance to rely on, your voice becomes the entire emotional instrument. In a game like Dead by Daylight, that responsibility is amplified," he explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As a consultant, I wanted to ensure that the cultural references remained authentic. As a voice actor, I focused on making every breath, every strained scream, and every moment of fear feel grounded within the brutal, high-stakes environment of the Entity’s realm."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Trickster's update is focused on the Killer's gameplay, with a new Style Rank system "rewarding creativity, aggression, and momentum as The Trickster builds towards unleashing his Main Event and a barrage of blades."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other adjustments players can expect to see are a new Aura Accessibility feature, refined perk descriptions are also getting an overhaul for readability.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Head of Editorial Development at IGN and an elder millennial.

You'll need to have already signed up to the PlayStation beta program to take part (you can <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/?" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jump in here</a>, if you haven't already), and seemingly be based within either North America or Europe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">North American servers will be live from 4pm to 7pm Pacific, while European servers will be up from 7pm to 10pm CET (that's 6pm to 9pm for the UK).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Content available in the playtest includes the hunters Sun, Rem and Axle, as well as two different game modes: the wave-based survival offering Machine Incursion, or the multi-stage dungeon exploration found in Cauldron Descent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is slightly odd that PlayStation is holding this test the same weekend it is already hosting its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> server slam, but perhaps it believes the pools of players for each will be limited enough — or distinct enough in terms of player taste — that it won't matter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony previously described plans for a "small-scale" closed playtest due at the end of February, alongside a few other details about the game. A tactical three-player co-op action title with a focus on adapting your Hunter for intense missions, the spin-off will also feature a narrative campaign that ties into the wider Horizon universe.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to game director Arjan Bak, Horizon Hunters Gathering has a story that "will introduce new mysteries, characters, and threats, but we’re keeping it under wraps for now. What we can say is that Hunters Gathering is fully canon and its story doesn’t stop at launch!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of yet, there's no word on when that launch might be, or how the game will be monetized when it is ready for launch — whether it will be a premium launch or free-to-play.

            <title><![CDATA[Life Is Strange: Reunion Preview: Like Meeting Up With an Old Friend]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-reunion-preview-like-meeting-up-with-an-old-friend</link>
            <guid>1445077</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been nearly ten years since we last saw Max and Chloe together in a Life is Strange game. While the other entries in the series that starred other characters have been pretty good – in fact, its most recent entry, Double Exposure, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review"><u>excellent</u></a> thanks in part to its continuation of the core story of Max Caulfield’s complicated life with her even more complicated best friend Chloe – Life is Strange has nevertheless been missing that one thing that made the original episodic adventure so impactful. Now that the series’ co-protagonist (and sometimes antagonist if you really think about it) is back in the mix, Life is Strange: Reunion looks to not only be the game longtime fans have been waiting over a decade for, it also has the potential to be the strongest entry yet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking place immediately after the events of Double Exposure, Life is Strange: Reunion looks to wrap up Max Caulfield’s time-bending, dimension-hopping adventure by reintroducing the catalyst for the entire series. Chloe is back, and without getting too deep into spoiler territory, she's alive and trying to put the pieces together while Max is simultaneously dealing with the fallout from Double Exposure. While Reunion retains its signature indie sleaze aesthetic and at times eyebrow-raising dialogue (in an endearing way), the storytelling thus far is noticeably better than what we’ve seen from Life is Strange previously. There was a sense of urgency in the roughly two hours I had with the preview version, and I couldn't help but notice how everything had a melancholic vibe to it. The music, character interactions, and general vibe of Reunion makes it obvious that this final chapter in Max’s story is going to be darker and more emotionally charged than anything we’ve seen in a series that explores some pretty grim subjects.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Life is Strange: Reunion Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, it's not all doom and gloom. The visuals are refined such that, to my eyes, a Life is Strange game has never looked better. The facial expressions and performances are excellent, the locations are full of clever environmental storytelling and charm, and every character is designed in a way that's brimming with personality and uniqueness. In my demo I was able to explore Max’s house, the Snapping Turtle, and a new location that reminded me of some of the more grim environments from the original Life is Strange. Conversations with characters felt more real, and while some of the dialogue was cringeworthy, it never took me out of the story like past entries have, and I'm happy to report that in my time with it, nobody said “hella”.</p><p>The world of Reunion feels more alive than ever.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, from some exceptional cues and nostalgic needle drops, the music, which is always a highpoint for the series, is definitely looking to be another highlight in Reunion. There was one needle drop in particular that tugged at my heart strings, and whether this was due to nostalgia or really good song placement (or both), it made me excited to hear what else Reunion has in store for Max and Chloe's latest adventure. The music, visuals, and environmental storytelling suggest that this is Life is Strange firing on all cylinders so far, and the world of Reunion feels more alive than ever.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, presentation isn't everything in Life is Strange, and Reunion takes the series back to its roots with Max’s rewind abilities and Chloe's backtalk choices. While I appreciated the newer dimension-hopping powers in Double Exposure, it was obvious from the get-go with Reunion that bringing back Max’s rewind power is the correct choice; it just felt right for the type of narrative-driven gameplay Life is Strange is known for. The few puzzles I was able to try felt natural and had more challenge than I was expecting. In one instance I had to defuse a room full of explosives before a short timer ran out. Admittedly, I died a few times while trying to find an optimal route between bombs, finding a pair of cutters, and avoiding falling objects. It was refreshing to have to solve a puzzle without it just being another standard <em>find the thing and pick the correct dialogue </em>event. That being said, there were still plenty of instances where I needed to talk to somebody, spectacularly embarrass myself, learn something about them, rewind, and try again. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Chloe’s gameplay, on the other hand, is less supernatural and more urgent. Unlike Max, she doesn't have any special powers and instead has to rely on her wits and quick thinking. Paying attention to the surrounding environment and remembering details from Chloe’s observations and conversations is integral here. When Chloe’s backtalk was prompted, I had to quickly make a dialogue choice and earn points over whoever I was being confronted by. If I made the correct choice when confronted by a security guard then I would win the conversation, if I didn't, then things wouldn't go my way. Adding this additional layer to Reunion’s dialogue choices is a breath of fresh air, since playing as Max can sometimes be a little too forgiving. I hope that we see this mechanic used more throughout Reunion, because its potential to force the player to make difficult permanent decisions without the option to magically rewind time could lead to some pretty interesting character outcomes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The series’ dialogue is still a high point here, and I was given the choice to play with a specific set of outcomes from the first Life is Strange. While there is no canon ending to the first game, being able to pick my outcome from 2015 was pretty cool and has me excited to see what other outcomes and consequences the characters will face from that single choice I made a decade ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I only had about two hours with Life is Strange: Reunion, it was clear to me that developer Deck Nine is pulling out all the stops for the long-awaited finale of Max and Chloe’s story. The expanded gameplay, presentation, and overall vibe stands a good chance to become a series high point and hopefully lead to a fitting end to a story that's sat with fans for over a decade.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-reunion-preview-like-meeting-up-with-an-old-friend]]></content:encoded>
