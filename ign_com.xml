That’s pretty wild. What the hell are they doing??”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne is of course one of the biggest conundrums in the video game industry. The FromSoftware masterpiece launched on PS4 to critical and commercial acclaim, but since then Sony hasn’t touched it. Fans are desperate for an official next-gen patch that would make the game run at 60fps, up from 30fps, but there are also calls for a remaster and a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recently, fans managed to get PS4 emulators to deliver something akin to a remaster on PC. The tech experts at <a href="https://youtu.be/-zjzBbdl7hk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry released a video</u></a> covering “a breakthrough in PS4 emulation” via ShadPS4, which means Bloodborne is now fully playable start to finish in 60fps. Could this breakthrough have triggered an aggressive response from Sony? IGN has asked Sony for comment, but it has yet to respond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1886240870560899319" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offered</a> what he called his “copium theory,” though: that Sony could be working on an official remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My copium theory is that Sony DMCAed the 60fps patch and the video about the Bloodborne demake so that when they announce a 60fps remake, google searching for ‘bloodborne 60fps’ and ‘Bloodborne remake’ won’t have collisions with our fan projects,” McDonald said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Let me cope.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then: “Like if they plan on trademarking ‘bloodborne 60fps’ and ‘Bloodborne remake’ they need to actually clean up in order to actually file a trademark request. Right??”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite these latest aggressive actions by Sony, the company has so far offered no indication that it plans to return to Bloodborne in any way. Last month, former PlayStation executive Shuhei <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory"><u>Yoshida delivered his Bloodborne no-show theory</u></a> in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with Kinda Funny Games</u></a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bloodborne has always been the most asked thing,” Yoshida began. “And people wonder why we haven’t really done anything, even an update or a remaster. Should be easy, right? The company is known for doing so many remasters, right, some people get frustrated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have only my personal theory to that situation. I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory. And the PlayStation team respect his wish. So that’s my guess, right? Theory. I am not revealing any secret information, to be clear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Bloodborne remains dormant nearly 10 years after the first game came out. But is there hope? In interviews, Miyazaki often deflects questions about Bloodborne, pointing to the fact FromSoftware does not own the IP. But in February last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5"><u>Miyazaki at least admitted the game would benefit from a release on more modern hardware</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-art-book-leaks-on-a-hentai-site-of-all-places<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">New details about the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> are circulating online after an artbook purportedly leaked on, among other places, a hub for hentai.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spotted over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ig5byz/assassins_creed_shadows_art_book_leaked_on_hentai/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</u></a>, an artbook entitled "The Art of Assassin's Creed Shadows" has been spreading like wildfire around the internet. It contains several hundred pages of concept art, quotations, and development info surrounding the next Assassin's Creed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The leak itself is notable, but the post on Reddit also alleged it originated from a site known for hosting hentai. Bizarre, to say the least. IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gallery had already been removed from the site in question, but has since been archived in other file-sharing sites and galleries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Several interesting details are shown throughout, including concepts for famous historical characters, major cities, and a variety of weapons. The art also, presumably, leaks some potential spoilers for the plot of Assassin's Creed Shadows. We can't confirm as much until the game is actually out, but the images we have seen seem real enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The leak arrives <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-this-time-by-another-month"><u>just ahead of Assassin's Creed Shadows' launch on March 20, 2025</u></a>, after a previous delay pushed it out of 2024 into February.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a recent preview event for Shadows, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-says-recent-delay-was-to-polish-parkour-especially-on-super-complex-roofs">IGN spoke with Assassin's Creed Shadows game director Charles Benoit</a>, who confirmed that the month delay was "mostly about polishing" and did not change any big systems. The team did update "a couple of things in progression to make it more engaging, also balancing a bit more," Benoit added, but the main feature that needed extra tweaking was the parkour system, which was running up against an obstacle unique to Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Japanese architecture, the roofs [are] super complex," he said. "Probably the most complex thing that I ever worked with if we compared to Odyssey and Syndicate. We needed specific codes and specific animations to support something super fluid, changing the transition of the parkour to make it even more fluid. So that's one of the specific feedback that we heard that we wanted to address, and it really improved since the last few months."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-dev-firaxis-remains-coy-on-nintendo-switch-2-mouse-joy-con<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you watched the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">Nintendo Switch 2 reveal video</a>, you’ll have spotted what looked like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-mouse-theory-is-looking-pretty-good-right-about-now">a ‘mouse’ mode for the Joy-Cons</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the reveal trailer, there's a moment where a pair of detached Joy-Cons are lowered onto a surface, attachment side down. They connect to a pair of connectors that seem to have relatively flat bottoms, and then slide across the surface like a mouse on a mouse pad. If you look closely, you can even see something that looks like a slider pad on the bottom of one of the connectors, leading further credence to the theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors had been flying in the lead-up to the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal that this would be possible due to a sensor on the inside of the Joy-Cons similar to the sensor on the bottom of a computer mouse. But thus far, Nintendo hasn't officially confirmed this is true, nor what it would mean if it is.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 - First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the first upcoming video games that came to mind following the reveal was Firaxis’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a>. The 4X strategy game is already confirmed as coming to the original Switch, and it’ll no-doubt work on the Switch 2 via backward compatibility. But will there be a bespoke Switch 2 version that takes advantage of the new Joy-Con and lets you play Civilization 7 as if you were using a mouse?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN brought up the Switch 2 reveal and that apparent mouse functionality in a recent interview with Civilization 7 lead designer Ed Beach and executive producer Dennis Shirk, and while Beach remained silent, Shirk offered a coy response that is sure to spark even more speculation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is definitely intriguing,” Shirk teased. “You always do some trade-offs when you have to deal with pure console controls. And the announcement has some great stuff in it. I love what they're doing with the controllers. It's all very cool. That's about all I can say about it in terms of an opinion. I think it looks awesome and they're not wrong, so it would be cool for something like that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course Firaxis isn’t going to announce a Nintendo Switch 2 version of Civilization 7 — it’ll leave that to publisher 2K Games. But with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announced-for-april">Switch 2 Direct</a> set for this April, perhaps we will find out either way soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For all we don't know about potential mouse support for the Switch 2 (as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-still-dont-know-what-the-nintendo-switch-2s-mysterious-new-joy-con-button-does"><u>what the mysterious new Joy-Con button does</u></a>), we do know Nintendo's next-gen console is coming out in 2025 (probably between June and September) and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-game-is-seemingly-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2"><u>there's a new Mario Kart in the works for it</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/with-nintendo-switch-2-waiting-in-the-wings-sales-of-the-original-switch-and-its-games-continue-to-tumble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has revised its hardware forecast down yet again as sales of the Switch and its games came in “below expectations.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first nine months of the current financial year, sales from Nintendo’s dedicated game console business decreased by 31.7% year-on-year to 895.5 billion yen (approx. $5.7 billion) following a significant decline in sales of both the Nintendo Switch and software.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, mobile and IP related income decreased by 33.9% year-on-year to 49.7 billion yen (approx. $320 million), mainly due to the tough comparison with 2023’s blockbuster <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, gross profit declined by 27.3% year-on-year to 565.5 billion yen (approx. $3.6 billion).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has now revised down its financial forecast for the year ending March 2025, the second time in a row it’s done so. It expects to sell even less Nintendo Switch hardware than previously forecast, too, revising its Switch expectation down by 1.5 million to 11 million, and software by 10 million to 150 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given the Nintendo Switch is in its eighth year, declines are expected, although they are clearly more dramatic than Nintendo predicted. Still, the Switch is now over 150 million units sold, which is an astonishing success for Nintendo. Overtaking Sony’s PlayStation 2, which has 160 million sold, to become the best-selling video game console of all-time may be beyond the Switch now, but the Nintendo DS’ 154 million is in sight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo itself described sales of Switch and software in its third quarter ending December 31, 2024, as “stable given the fact that the platform is in its eighth year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall sales for the entire Nintendo Switch family of systems were down 30.6% year-on-year at 9.54 million units. Sales of software declined by 24.4% year-on-year to 123.98 million units. But Nintendo pointed to sales of new games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> (3.91 million), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> (6.17 million), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> (5.38 million), and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> (2.63 million) during the three month period. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> is on 1.4 million sold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Party Jamboree in particular sounds like a big hit. Nintendo said that during the first 11 weeks after its release on October 17, 2024, Super Mario Party Jamboree surpassed the pace of sales for previous titles in the Mario Party series for Nintendo Switch, namely Super Mario Party and Mario Party Superstars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, perhaps more importantly for Nintendo as it prepares to release the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> later this year, more people are playing Switch now than ever before, with 129 million ‘annual playing users’ in 2024. This suggests fans are continuing to play Switch even now, nearly eight years after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nintendo Switch unit sales declined year-on-year, but even in the eighth year since its launch in March 2017, Nintendo Switch continues to attract the interest of consumers, and sales in some weeks during the holiday season exceeded same-week sales of the previous year,” Nintendo said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Nintendo’s latest financial report, investors will be keen for Nintendo Switch 2 to come out sooner rather than later. But Nintendo itself listed the OG Switch games it still has up its sleeve: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> will be released on March 20, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> are scheduled for release in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch 2 even got a mention, although Nintendo did not say anything new here. “On January 16, we announced that Nintendo Switch 2, the successor to Nintendo Switch, will be released in 2025,” Nintendo said. “On the same day, we offered a first look at Nintendo Switch 2 in a video introducing the hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo plans a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announced-for-april">Switch 2 Direct</a> for April 2, where it will reveal more. Nintendo will also hold <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-invites-go-out-to-fans-today">Switch 2 hands-on events</a> in cities around the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
