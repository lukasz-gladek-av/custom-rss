This includes the new Winter Tokens event, more auras for the Armored Titan raid, and the addition of Roblox chat in the central 2D lobby. Long story short, there’s not really one major change aimed to blow you away, but there are enough smaller changes that should help things feel smoother and look better overall.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/23/attack-on-titan-revolution-update-3-1737654586020.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Attack on Titan Revolution Update 3 Lays Foundation for the Future With Bug and Balance Fixes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some bug fixes, for example, tackle strange titan behavior, including enemies T-posing after they strike a building and titans not attacking players who stand directly beneath them. There are also a few skill bug fixes that affect the Charge and Founder’s Will skills. Additionally, players will find Thunderspear tweaks galore as the team looks to refine the new tool’s effectiveness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Attack on Titan Revolution Update 3 takes aim at a sea of issues that have plagued the anime-inspired Roblox experience for months, but it’s relatively light on new content additions. While there will be more future updates to keep players entertained, this foundational patch arrives only a few weeks after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/attack-on-titan-revolution-update-25-introduces-thunderspears-and-armored-titan-raid"><u>the content-heavy 2.5 update</u></a>.

The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-review"><u>PlayStation 5</u></a> and the more powerful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-pro-review">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> are built for stunning graphics and ultra-smooth gameplay, and to fully experience that, you need an HDMI cable that can handle all that power. Fortunately, there are some great options out there that will ensure you're getting the best possible performance from your console in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR – These Are the Best HDMI Cables for PS5:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 supports 8K@60Hz or 4K@120Hz, so you’ll want to choose an HDMI cable that’s designed to support the latest features of the PS5, including 4K resolution at 120Hz and even 8K resolution for future-proofing. Whichever cable you go for, upgrading to a high-quality HDMI cable can really enhance your gaming experience on the PS5. Clearer visuals, smoother gameplay, and reliable performance –  what’s not to love?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While an improved connection is a great start, you'll also want to upgrade to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">good PS5 TV</a> or one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-monitor-for-ps5">best monitors for the PS5</a> to get the best possible experience.</p><p id="best-overall"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best overall" id="powera">1.

Yes, it comes with a premium price tag, but if you want the best of the best, you’ll have to part with a bit of cash. Supporting HDMI 2.1, this HDMI cable can output 4K@120Hz, and even 8K@60Hz.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Matching the console’s simple, clean, and white aesthetics, the PowerA Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable is durable, minimalist, and sports gold-plated connectors. And, at 10-feet long, you’ll have plenty of wiggle room between your console and your display should you need it.</p></div><p id="best-high-speed"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best high-speed" id="belkinhigh">2. Belkin HDMI 2.1 Ultra High Speed</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best High-Speed HDMI Cable</h3><div catalogid="daa9c4e2-1993-4e7f-800e-8fe74d192871" id="210394"><div id="210394" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Belkin HDMI 2.1 Ultra High Speed</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Capable of 48Gbps speeds, it far exceeds what the PS5 is even capable of outputting. </p></div></div><div><p>Features</p><p>2-layer shielding</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Belkin HDMI 2.1 Ultra High Speed is one of the priciest HDMI cables for PS5, but that’s because you’re paying to future-proof your setup. With HDMI 2.1, the cable can handle speeds of up to 48Gbps, more than your PS5 or PS5 Pro will ever output. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With slim profile connectors, this HDMI cable fits nicely into the back of your PS5 and your TV. Everything here is high quality. Knowing you can game in 4K@120Hz with a compatible display, or watch videos in 8K@60Hz warrants the higher price tag. It's likely you'll even be able to use this for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-6">PlayStation 6</a> when it eventually arrives, making this a worthwhile long-term investment.</p></div><p id="best-angled"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best angled" id="ugreenangle">3.

Enter the Ugreen Right Angle HDMI Cable. Instead of taking a risk and bending your HDMI cable, why not invest in a right-angle cable from the offset?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You do sacrifice a few things with this cable, however. For instance, it’s much shorter than many HDMI cables at only 3.3 feet. This might be fine for some people, but you should double check how much cable you need to connect your PS5 to your TV first. There’s also the fact that it only supports HDMI 2.0, so you won’t be able to enjoy the 120Hz refresh rate the PS5 is designed to be capable of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, if you need a right-angle cable at a very affordable price, the Ugreen Right Angle HDMI Cable is your best bet.</p></div><p id="cheapest"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cheapest" id="basics">4.

The Amazon Basics HDMI Cable does what it says on the box – there are no fancy features, braided cable, or right angles – it costs a little over $6 and is capable of speeds of up to 48Gbps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the length could pose a problem to some users, this HDMI cable is also available in 6-foot and 10-foot options. It’s incredibly affordable and can easily be a suitable replacement for the included HDMI cable you get with the PS5 if you have lost it, broken it, or need a spare.</p></div><p id="best-everyday"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best everyday" id="anker8k">5.

Since it’s HDMI 2.1, you could use it to connect your monitor to your PC, too, should you need to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are definitely more affordable HDMI cables available, if you want a solid cable that’s going to last a long time, Anker’s is a no-brainer. The only thing you might want to do is spend a little more and get a slightly longer 6-foot or 10-foot cable.</p></div><p id="best-premium"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best premium" id="cablebraided">6.

Featuring a double-fiber nylon braid, this cable is incredibly durable.

Snowkids claims the cable can withstand up to 25,000 bends – while we weren’t going to test it to that extreme, there’s no doubt the Snowkids 8K HDMI Cable is going to last a long time.</p></div><p id="how-to-pick-a-ps5-hdmi-cable"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="How to pick a PS5 HDMI cable">How to Pick the Best HDMI Cable for PS5</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You could spend a lot of money on a HDMI cable for your PS5 when you don’t have to. With lots of marketing jargon, it’s easy to get lost and spend over and above for what you actually need. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 can output 4K@120Hz; HDMI 2.1 is the standard that supports this, so if you have a TV capable of this resolution, you should look for a HDMI 2.1 cable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re on a tight budget, don’t have a compatible TV, or just need a spare, then you could get away with a HDMI 2.0 cable – but this can only reach 4K@60Hz.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, though, for around the same price, it’s not hard to find a suitable HDMI 2.1 cable. You just need to assess the distance between your PS5 and TV, ensuring you invest in a cable that gives you plenty of room. This is especially true of you don't have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-stand">good TV stand</a> that has holes in the back for cords to slip through,</p><p id="faq"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FAQ">PS5-compatible HDMI Cables FAQ</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Are expensive HDMI cables worth it?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have a modern 4K or 8K TV, you shouldn’t get sticker shock when looking for an HDMI cable. At these high resolutions, the amount of data the PS5 is pushing to your PC is massive, and cheaper cables run the risk of corrupting that data by using lackluster materials. However, if you’re playing your PS5 on an older display, you might want to consider either upgrading your TV, or opting for a cheaper HDMI cable.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What kind of HDMI cable does the PS5 use?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">To get the most out of your PS5, you should use a HDMI 2.1 cable. This supports 4K@120Hz, or 8K@60Hz, providing the best gaming experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Does the PS5 come with a HDMI 2.1 cable?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, the PS5 does come with a HDMI 2.1 cable. You don’t need to buy any additional cables unless you want a longer cable, one with features like braiding, or you need a spare.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Is HDMI 2.1 backward compatible?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, HDMI 2.1 is backward compatible.
