Wonder Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is joining the party soon. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-edition-release-date-plus-elephant-mario-and-captain-toad-amiibo">upgraded version of the 2023 Switch game</a> includes some fresh enhancements alongside a new expansion called "Meetup in Bellabel Park" and some new characters joining the fun. It's quite the upgrade, and it's still a couple of months away (mark your calendars for March 26), but preorders are already live at select retailers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to other Switch 2 Editions that have released, there's a digital upgrade pack for those who already have the original Switch version, alongside a standard, complete version of the game's Switch 2 version for those who don't currently own the original. We've included where you can preorder a full physical copy of the game (<a href="https://zdcs.link/aA8MpL?object_uuid=72bd9bc9-9d5d-4d0a-a341-e18d21ab0bb9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">for $79.99</a>) and this upgrade pack (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QrJeGD?object_uuid=72bd9bc9-9d5d-4d0a-a341-e18d21ab0bb9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">for $19.99</a>) below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Super Mario Bros.

As for the digital version, that hasn't gone up for preorder yet, for some reason. We'll be sure to update it once it's available, though.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Super Mario Bros. Wonder Switch 2 Upgrade Pack</h2></div><div id="234698"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234698" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park Upgrade Pack</h3></p></div></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you already have Super Mario Bros. Wonder on Nintendo Switch and are just hoping to get the upgrade pack to use it on your Switch 2, that's currently available to preorder right now at the Nintendo eShop. For $19.99, this will set you up with all of the extras from the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition when the game is released on March 26.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save on Super Mario Bros.

Wonder</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering the pricey cost of the physical Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, this is a neat little hack you can do to save a little cash. At the moment, Woot is offering the original version of Super Mario Bros. Wonder for $46.99. If you don't already own it, you can buy from Woot at this good price and then purchase the upgrade pack, which brings your total cost to $66.98. Compared to the $79.99 price tag for the physical Switch 2 Edition, this is a great little deal to take advantage of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

Lorwyn has been part of Magic’s locations since 2007, and there are some great cards in the set - including some that are already spiking in value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Most Expensive Cards From Lorwyn Eclipsed</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got the most valuable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-where-to-buy-2026">Lorwyn Eclipsed</a> cards you can find right now listed below, with the caveat that this is based on pre-launch pricing taken as close to release as we can, courtesy of data from the lovely folks at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aA8Mq0?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGplayer</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll ensure this list is updated next week as well, so bookmark this page and check back in again soon. For now, let's check out what's hot on release weekend for Magic's latest set, Lorwyn Eclipsed.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">10 -  Glen Elendra Guardian (Showcase) - From $33.55</h3><div id="234631"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234631" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Glen Elendra Guardian (Showcase)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This three-cost Faerie Wizard has some absolutely stunning artwork, and can be cast with Flash. It’s a 3/4 with flying, but arrives with a -1/-1 counter, which can be removed as an activated ability that also counters a noncreature spell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot to remember, but if you find <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj8wZp?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Glen Elendra Guardian in Showcase art</u></a>, you could earn around $34, or up to $47 in foil.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">9 - Bitterbloom Bearer (Showcase) - From $42</h3></div><div id="234632"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234632" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bitterbloom Bearer (Showcase)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wBZYb?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Bitterbloom Bearer is another Showcase card</u></a>, and it’s sitting at $42 but can reach as high as $85 in foil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a two-cost Faerie Rogue, again with Flying and Flash, but saps life on your upkeep to create Faerie creature tokens with flying.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">8 - Selfless Safewright (Showcase) - From $45.03</h3></div><div id="234633"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234633" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Selfless Safewright (Showcase) </h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one is already dropping in price, but the <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56025?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Showcase version of Selfless Safewright</u></a> is now $45.03 in foil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a 4/2, five-cost Elf Warrior creature with (you guessed it) Flash. It’s also got Convoke, and turns creatures of your chosen type hexproof and indestructible until end of turn.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">7 - Harmonized Crescendo (Showcase) - From $63.62</h3></div><div id="234634"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234634" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Harmonized Crescendo (Showcase)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This six-cost Instant has Convoke, and lets you draw cards based on the number of cards you have in that type. There’s great artwork, too, showing merfolk singing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It looks as though the price will drop, but for now, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QK8bVE?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Showcase version of Harmonized Crescendo</u></a> is north of sixty bucks.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">6 - Moonshadow (Showcase) - From $76.71</h3></div><div id="234635"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234635" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Moonshadow (Showcase)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With some amazing artwork that extends from beyond the card’s borders, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj8wZq?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Showcase treatment for Moonshadow</u></a> is awesome - and could net you upwards of $75.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a one-cost Elemental with 7/7 (yes, you read that right) and Menace, but it enters with six -1/-1 counters. You remove those counters when permanents enter your graveyard.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">5 - Bloom Tender (Showcase) - From $114.62</h3></div><div id="234636"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234636" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bloom Tender (Showcase)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of writing, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOj18O?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Showcase Bloom Tender</u></a> is being sold for $600, but its current market value is closer to $110 according to TCGPlayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a 1/1 Elf Druid, but it taps for mana from permanents you control. Could be a good inclusion if you’re upgrading the Dance of the Elements precon.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">4 - Winnowing (Showcase Fracture Foil) - From $228.50</h3></div><div id="234637"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234637" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Winnowing (Showcase Fracture Foil)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QrJOkD?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>This version of Winnowing</u></a> breaks the $200 barrier, with some gorgeous, colorful art and that always impressive Fracture Foil treatment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what it does, this six-cost Sorcery has Convoke and allows you to essentially boardwipe all but one of your opponents’ creatures.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">3 - Moonshadow (Showcase Fracture Foil) - From $295</h3></div><div id="234638"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234638" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Moonshadow (Showcase Fracture Foil)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yep, that’s a big jump for this version of Moonshadow, which is functionally the same as any other Moonshadow card in the set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a07Yjr?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>This Fracture Foil variant</u></a> commands a fee of almost $300 at pre-launch prices.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2 - Selfless Safewright (Showcase Fracture Foil) - From $452.50</h3></div><div id="234639"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234639" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Selfless Safewright (Showcase Fracture Foil)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer marks the current market value of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN37vV?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Selfless Safewright in Showcase Fracture Foil</u></a> at $452.50, but it’s been sold for around $100 less already.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">1 - Bloom Tender (Showcase Fracture Foil) - From $657.08</h3></div><div id="234640"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234640" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Bloom Tender (Showcase Fracture Foil)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aD8ymb?object_uuid=05b37f9c-0ec2-4cae-8165-6adf0eaf1b1c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>This version of Bloom Tender is gorgeous</u></a>, and could net you a sizeable windfall if you open a pack and find it waiting for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s sitting at around $650 for market value, and the most recent sale is around the same amount.

Then there's our first Commander decks since Edge of Eternities, and both look pretty great. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to pick up the rarest cards going, then you'll want to invest in the Collector Booster Box, as it has the highest pull rates going. Good luck, and let us know if you manage to score anything good when cracking those new packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

You'll also get the Time Attack Car Pack, Car Pass (which adds 30 more cars to your game, one per week), plus VIP Membership and a Welcome Pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This offering is nothing new for the Forza Horizon series, though is $10 more than the $49.99 Premium Upgrade offered for Forza Horizon 5 — an increase that has not gone unnoticed among the franchise's fanbase on social media and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ForzaHorizon/comments/1qkcq7f/why_is_noone_talking_about_the_staggering_price/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pricing is even more remarkable in other territories, too — in the UK, the Premium Upgrade is £59.99, the exact same cost as the game itself. In Australia, the Premium Edition is AU $190, up from AU $150 for the Premium Edition of Forza Horizon 5.</p><span data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="xbox-games-series-tier-list"><p><span><span><span><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></span></span><span></span></span></p></div></span><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah that's absolutely cooked," wrote Aussie Forza fan Pretty_Leather4803 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ForzaHorizon/comments/1qk9xro/190_aud_for_the_premium_edition_of_h6_is_a_joke/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>.

"In November 2021 FH5 Premium was $99.99. Adjusted for inflation, that's $116.58 in December 2025 dollars. They are charging $119.99. In the UK in 2021 FH5 cost £84.99. Adjusted for inflation, it would be £106.58. They are charging £109.99. I know a lot of people are feeling sticker shock, but the price increase is just a hair over inflation. The world we live in is more expensive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, just to cover all bases, there's the Deluxe Edition of the game — which is less deluxe than the Premium Edition.

It all comes with what Embark teases will be a steady flow of new quests, trials, items, cosmetics, and quality-of-life features, priming Arc Raiders with a content-filled start to its first new year in players’ hands.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/23/arc-raiders-keyart-roadmap-updated-500kb-1769182043700.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Arc Raiders Roadmap for January - April 2026. Image courtesy of Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to icons, which may tease an update’s contents, each month is assigned a title. Despite having just one week left, the same goes for January, which has been labeled Headwinds. The big inclusion players can expect in the coming days is a level 40+ matchmaking option, giving PvE and PvP Raiders more freedom to raid without fear they’re being matched against those of a higher skill level. A new map condition featuring a bird icon and a new player project are also set to arrive before January is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">February (Shrouded Sky) keeps the ball rolling with a wider collection of slightly small – but still consequential – updates. A new map update, Raider Deck, Expedition Window, and player project seem to be par for the course in terms of regular updates for the future, and they’ll be present in February, too. Next month’s more intriguing additions lie in the promise of a new map condition that eerily features what appears to be a wind icon, as well as a new Arc threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">March (Flashpoint) brings another arc threat, player project, and map condition, with everyone’s favorite resource-collection rooster, Scrappy, also set to receive an update as winter comes to an end. It’s April (Riven Tides) that promises the biggest bombshells for eager fans, with Embark delivering a new Arc Raiders map and a new large Arc threat. Only a skull is shown to tease whatever monstrosity will be joining the likes of the Matriarch and Queen, but judging by the umbrella icon and month title, it appears the new location may feature beaches or watery areas that will inevitably be polluted with lost loot and Raider flares.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark has big plans to kick off 2026, with its roadmap from May onward still being kept a secret for now as the studio aims to launch new content every month. A new Arc Raiders map, which will surely come with its own hidden mysteries to uncover, is no doubt the update players will be penciling into their calendars, though it’s unclear when the team will be more willing to show how the new location will fit into its PvPvE formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The increased ARC presence continues to trouble Shani as the Rustbelt grows more overwhelmed," the blog post says, "but no one holds all the pieces. The scale of the impending escalation remains unknown. Venture topside into an increasingly volatile Rustbelt—and make sure you’re prepared for what’s to come."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched October 30, 2025, and delivered its first new map, Stella Montis, in November. That puts a distance of about five months between its launch and the release date of the next new map. It’s unclear if Embark intends to keep with this pace in the months and years ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the studio works to keep the content faucet on following its winter break, the team has also spent recent weeks <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters"><u>playing Whac-A-Mole with Arc Raiders cheaters</u></a>.

The Japanese game studio requires those applying for game designer positions to submit screenshots of their Steam libraries as part of the hiring process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent <a href="https://x.com/urokuta_ja/status/2014593734827246006?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweet</u></a> on X / Twitter, CEO Takuro Mizobe shed some light on how Pocketpair hires new game designer talent (as spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-requires-game-designer-candidates-to-provide-screenshots-of-their-steam-libraries-and-playtime-according-to-ceo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>). Mizobe explained that Pocketpair has prospective game designers submit screenshots of their Steam play history. Furthermore, Mizobe noted that applicants who <em>don’t</em> use Valve’s game platform don’t get considered for interviews: “Those who haven't played anything on Steam don’t pass the document screening stage.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a reason why Pocketpair wants to see what their job applicants are playing though. As Mizobe explained: “in the interview, we question candidates about the top most-played titles in their Steam libraries, for example, we ask them to explain the game mechanics, to say why they think specific mechanics were adopted, and what makes the game stand out against others in the same genre. Pocketpair is recruiting game creators who are true Steam players!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/urokuta_ja/status/2014594862075805927?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>post</u></a>, Mitobe said that while applicants who are prolific console players are also encouraged to submit their Playstation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch play data, Steam is still the priority. “We basically turn down those who have played zero Steam games,” Mitobe explained. “We want our colleagues to be playing indie games that are only available on Steam.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This makes sense considering Pocketpair’s background as an indie developer whose main distribution platform so far has been Steam. The developer’s biggest hit Palworld, as well as its previous game Craftopia, have their main playerbase on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on social media, Pocketpair Head of Publishing and Communications John “Bucky” Buckley <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/2014706549982409060?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>weighed in on</u></a> the CEO’s comments: “So hilariously true. When I first joined, I was grilled if I knew games like Slay the Spire. Pocketpair is a company that truly is built by gamers, and our CEO is very adamant to keep it that way.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld: Palfarm First Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Launching in open access on Steam and Xbox back in January 2024, Palworld skyrocketed in popularity, selling over 8 million copies in just six days and amassing over 25 million players in its first month. It wasn’t long before Pocketpair <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>teamed up with Sony to launch Palworld Entertainment</u></a> with the aim of expanding the new IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair is continuing to build upon Palworld’s success. As well as updates to the game, it is currently developing Palworld: Palfarm, an upcoming online co-op farming sim set in the same universe. In a surprise announcement last week, it revealed that Palworld is also getting its own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/they-really-are-going-the-pokmon-route-palworld-is-getting-an-official-trading-card-game"><u>physical Trading Card game</u></a>, which is set to drop this June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, Palworld is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit between Pocketpair and Nintendo/The Pokemon Company. Since the dispute kicked off in September 2024, there have been numerous developments, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why"><u>Nintendo rewriting a patent mid-lawsuit</u></a>, arguing that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-as-theyre-not-full-games-attempting-to-sway-judge-in-palworld-lawsuit?_gl=1*1e31uc1*_up*MQ..*_ga*Njk4NDIzNjQ2LjE3NjkxNzk5ODk.*_ga_4L6HY9G8XE*czE3NjkxNzk5OTIkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjkxNzk5OTIkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>mods should not count as prior art</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-companys-monster-capture-patent-rejected-may-signal-problems-for-their-palworld-lawsuit"><u>getting their monster-capture patent rejected</u></a>. The case is expected to continue this year even as Pocketpair works towards the 1.0 release of Palworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
