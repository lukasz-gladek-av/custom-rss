            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s one thing beyond doubt after more than 35 hours with Dune: Awakening, it’s that Funcom has done its homework in crafting the most authentic take on the Dune-iverse imaginable. As a longtime fan of Frank Herbert’s iconic sci-fi setting, that’s an incredible thing to experience more often than not, and my time on Arrakis has been filled with moments of genuine shock. It’s very clever how the harsh environments and empty space are repeatedly used as progression checks, turning what seem like they should be weaknesses into strengths. Other times, that stubborn adherence to established lore results in annoying or just plain boring irritations, like how you’re all but forced to adopt a nomadic lifestyle in a genre where putting down roots and building up your base is one of the fundamentals. There have also been plenty of technical issues and bugs in the days immediately following launch, plus combat hasn’t landed with me much so far (though I’m admittedly still early in crafting my combat build), but on balance my friends and I are having an absolutely awesome time nerding out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever played a survival game (and have seen a Dune movie) before, you’ll know most of what you need to feel at home among the giant sand worms: you gather materials from the world, build your own ugly-as-heck home, and upgrade your equipment to gain access to more dangerous areas with rarer materials. Like plenty of survival games, including Funcom’s own Conan Exiles or last year’s Once Human, all of this is happening on a server full of similarly sunburnt players in a perpetually online world, where cooperation and limited instances of PvP are both a distinct possibility, and which account for most of its best moments.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Where this game sets itself apart, though, is by just how much it adheres to its legendary setting, and that has a major impact on just about everything you do. For example, intelligent use is made of Arrakis’ harsh environment, which is weaponized against you quite literally every second you stay within its atmosphere. Standing directly in sunlight unprotected will bake you alive in a matter of seconds, sandstorms blow on a regular basis and will kill you if you aren’t able to get to shelter first, and most notably, there’s the issue of those pesky enormous man-eating worms which gobble you up if you dare tread upon their domain for too long. By leaning into the unforgiving world as much as it does, Awakening puts you in a constant battle against the planet itself. So instead of casually trotting around collecting resources at your leisure and settling your own little piece of the world, you’re frantically ducking behind rocks to avoid the sun’s harsh rays and drink what little water you have left, and playing a never-ending game of “the floor is lava” as you rush from one place to another with a shai-hulud hot on your heels.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Arrakis’ harsh environment is weaponized against you quite literally every second.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these hazards give you obstacles to overcome. For example, early on you’re unable to leave the tutorial area thanks to a massive gap of empty space where sun exposure or, more likely, a massive worm would certainly kill you if you attempt to go on foot, so you have to craft your first vehicle in order to safely cross it. Later on, you start to encounter places that are too hot or irradiated to explore without proper equipment. There are plenty of examples just like this, where the unique nature of the setting is turned into an interesting mechanic. Similarly, you’re constantly starved for water, which is used both as a crafting material and a resource to keep yourself alive, and usually Awakening is a better, more interesting survival game for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are other times where this fanatical adherence to Dune conventions can be quite obnoxious, like how you’re encouraged (and in some cases required) to move your base of operations from place to place as you unlock access to higher-level regions. Pulling up stakes means you either have to abandon all you’ve built up to that point or tediously relocate as much of your equipment as you can, piece by piece. Then there’s stuff like the fact that guns are often useless, since many enemies make use of the all-important Holtzman shields that completely protect from ranged attacks. This creates a weird situation where you’re juggling back and forth between guns and melee weapons depending on which enemy is currently running towards you, oftentimes having to choose between addressing the swordsman barreling down on you or the guy a few feet behind him with a chaingun, which can create a really oppressive rhythm to combat. I honestly kinda respect how much Dune: Awakening sticks to its guns by making its guns ineffective to keep with Dune lore, even as it sometimes comes at the expense of me having a good time. Even when this stuff annoys the hell out of me, I can’t help but respect it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Like almost every single one of its survival MMO peers, Dune: Awakening has pretty awful combat.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s just part of the reason that, like almost every single one of its peers, Dune: Awakening has pretty awful combat. I knew going into a survival MMO that would be the case, but it’s still a particularly bitter pill that never gets any easier to swallow. I’m still quite early in unlocking all the options for battle and seeing some of the more interesting weapons and builds available, but so far gunplay is sloppy, melee combat is repetitive and janky as heck, and I’ve mostly just been trying to get through it as quickly as possible. It’s such a low point in a game I’m otherwise enjoying.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening - January 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the combat miss is more than made up for by the absolutely stellar survival mechanics, which are some of the most thoughtful and polished I’ve seen in a while. There’s a constant stream of new technologies to research, equipment to craft, and material to hunt for with almost no filler or grind along the way. Every time I’ve collected the right materials to craft the latest shiny thing I want, I’ve immediately had another enticing item to chase, and with unique schematics dropping left and right, I’m always making interesting decisions on whether to spend my rarest materials on a cool item with a special effect versus taking the more conservative route and just crafting common items to save those resources for a rainy day. (It's bound to rain on Arrakis one of these days.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s especially impressive that they accomplished this loop so well in a desert world where there are no other locations aside from hot sand, and almost no plants or wildlife available to harvest. A major hallmark of survival games is punching trees, and there are no trees on Arrakis – instead you’re making tools to pull water from morning dew collecting in the world at night and by pulling it from the air, which is just really smart and a welcome change of pace that embraces the weird and barren setting, even if it is still essentially the same thing.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Survival Games</h3><p>If you're interested in building, exploring, and refilling your hunger meter before dying, here are TieGuyTravis' recommendations for the best survival games you should play!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When I played the beta for Dune: Awakening, I ran into tons of bugs and hoped the delay of its launch would improve things a bit. That certainly seems to be the case, as I’ve had a significantly more stable experience so far, but even as improved as it is, it’s still fairly troubled in the technical department. I’ve had disconnects, seen entire mountains disappear and reappear before my eyes, and even had a few hours where all sand worms just up and deleted themselves from existence, making everyone on the server swarm to the resources normally protected by their constant threat. It’s not been the smoothest launch by any stretch – but also far from the worst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After more than 35 hours I still feel like I’m fairly early into my Dune: Awakening adventure, and still have new zones to visit, haven’t gotten very far into the main story, and have only had a few encounters with PvP. There’s a ton for me to do, so look for an update sometime this week as I work my way through to the endgame.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

There's also the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Secret Lair set to consider on June 9</a>, but that's a whole other beast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, suppose you picked up a prerelease box at your local game store last weekend, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">you've got some more boosters on the way this week</a>, you may be wondering <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-mtg-final-fantasy-cards-tcgplayer">which cards are seeing demand</a>, particularly if you’re looking to offload some or just get the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-magic-the-gathering-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-june-6">sweet satisfaction of owning what's hot</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let's take a deep dive into the best-selling Final Fantasy presold cards right now, all according to the trading card marketplace TCGPlayer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10: Jumbo Cactuar</h2><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222474"><div id="222474" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Jumbo Cactuar</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Novelty factor of racking up 9,999 extra damage, I was lucky enough to pull one of these over the weekend. It’s going for between $7.50 and $8 right now, with players keen to do big damage with this prickly customer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9: Summon: Primal Odin</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222475"><div id="222475" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Summon: Primal Odin</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Summons just had to be a big part of the Final Fantasy set, and they essentially arrive as Sagas. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big focus with Primal Odin is step two, which can literally remove a player from the game, and is likely to be ridiculously lethal in just about any Commander pod.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s available for under $2, too!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8: The Darkness Crystal</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222476"><div id="222476" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering The Darkness Crystal</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one will set you back around $5, and for good reason. Not only does it reduce the cost of Black spells, but it gives its owner life while creatures around them die.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact you can then bring any creature exiled with that second effect has me particularly tempted to buy it for a zombie deck I’ve been planning for months.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7: Cecil, Dark Knight</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222477"><div id="222477" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Cecil, Dark Knight</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of a few two-sided cards, Cecil has Deathtouch but deals damage to his owner, eventually transforming to Redeemed Paladin, gaining lifelink and making other creatures indestructible until end of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that from a single black mana casting cost? That $2.99 might be a small price to pay.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6: Self-Destruct</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222478"><div id="222478" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Self-Destruct</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to really burn down an opponent’s creatures, or the opponent themselves, Self-Destruct can turn the tide of battle at Instant speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As TCGPlayer points out, using it in conjunction with Screaming Nemesis makes it a perfect counter to lifelink-focused decks, and Self-Destruct is under 50 cents at the time of writing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5: Fire Magic</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222479"><div id="222479" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Fire Magic</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Want a Vivi card but don’t want to pony up? We get, it, but while Fire Magic has the diminutive spellcaster in its artwork, it’s also a great card that makes use of the new Tiered mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For under 50 cents, you can cast an increasing amount of damage to each creature, making this an ideal card to have in your back pocket as Commander players around you build their board states.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4: Starting Town</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222480"><div id="222480" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Starting Town</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Get Starting Town out early and it can kickstart a board state in any format, particularly if you’ve got a deck with multiple colors, but it’ll cost you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting Town is currently $14 for the normal version, or just under $17 for the foil one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3: Tifa Lockhart</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222481"><div id="222481" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Tifa Lockhart</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not to be confused with the variant in the Final Fantasy 7 Commander Deck, this Tifa has a Landfall trigger that doubles her power alongside her existing Trample keyword.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As TCGPlayer points out, you can grow her attack power with something like Titanic Growth and then use Fabled Passage to double it again. She’ll set you back between $7 and $9.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2: Sazh’s Chocobo</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222482"><div id="222482" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Sazh's Chocobo</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I got a couple of Sazh’s Chocobo in my packs, and while it’s adorable, it can grow quickly with a landfall trigger that’s similar to Tifa’s, above.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s under $2, too, so fill your boots.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1: Adventurer’s Inn</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222483"><div id="222483" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Adventurer's Inn</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A land that gives life and doesn’t enter tapped? You love to see it. It’s also super cheap right now, at around 50 cents for the foil version or less than 30 cents for the non-foil.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>These cards are set to</strong> <strong>release on June 13</strong>, but you can preorder them right now and it'll arrive this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scroll to the left to see quick buy links for each MTG: FF configuration.
