            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It might not have the same kind of ambition or bells and whistles as its contemporaries, but Styx holds a special place in my heart as one of very few pure stealth game series we have left. Will you find the incredibly creative scenarios of Hitman or the insane level of polish and replayability of Dishonored? Nope. Instead Styx contents itself with simply being a reliable way for stealth fans to get their fix, and Styx: Blades of Greed is no exception. More often than not, the usual playbook of sneaking around, stealing and assassinating everything in sight, is as fun as it’s ever been, and this sequel makes some important tweaks, like removing weak multiplayer mechanics to refocus on a solo stealth experience and swapping smaller, mission-based maps for absolutely massive regions. But it’s also saddled with quite a few of the same issues it’s always had, finicky movement, performance issues, and an unremarkable story, which are as disappointing as they are completely expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its predecessor from 2017, Blades of Greed puts you in the leather boots of an elderly, grumpy goblin as you sneak into small spaces, stab humans, elves, and monsters in their soft places, and use an arsenal of gadgets and special abilities to overcome the fact that getting spotted will get you killed in two seconds flat. There are some modest additions, like a couple of new gadgets and abilities that let you do things like mind control NPCs from afar or use a grappling hook to close large gaps in a short period of time, but for the most part there’s very little that’s changed about the moment-to-moment gameplay. You’ll still find, for example, the ol’ reliable ability to turn yourself invisible for a short period of time, and will still find yourself hiding inside closets and barrels before popping out to slit the throat of some idiot guard. Good times. As ever, stealth is absolutely the star of the show, and Blades of Greed has the same high quality sneaking around that you’d hope it would.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Styx: Blades of Greed Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story in Styx has never been very good, and Blades of Greed lives up to those low expectations by having a completely forgettable story in spite of the fact that its protagonist is inherently interesting and unique. After developing a craving for magical abilities granted to you by quartz crystals found throughout the world, you begin a repetitive journey to, well, find more of it, and 90% of the campaign is just going from place-to-place stealing these glowing rocks to power yourself up with little in the way of plot in between those scavenger hunts. You meet some characters along the way, like a gadget-obsessed dwarf and an orc who becomes your spiritual guide, but they don’t get enough screen time to leave much of an impression and what they do get isn’t used effectively, with everyone spouting off explanations of telling you what you need to do next and little else. You’re unlikely to have come to the Styx series looking for an engaging story, but just in case you were hoping to be pleasantly surprised: I wouldn’t count on that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though the vast majority of Styx’s bones remain the same, one major change is that instead of treading (and sometimes retreading) through mission-specific levels, Blades of Greed lets you loose in three extremely large maps filled with both mandatory and optional areas to explore, pilfer, and fall to your death within. It’s a neat idea that allows for significantly more freedom over prior adventures, and it’s quite easy to become distracted and assassinate your way through an entire region before realizing you didn’t even really have any objective behind any of it, except that it’s just hard to see a guard walking by unaware and not take him down. These huge levels also allow you to express creativity in how you navigate the area and solve the problem of getting around when every 10 feet there’s someone who could kill you by breathing on you. When you’re staring at an objective that’s a mountain’s distance above you, you’ll need to just creep around and try things to figure out how to get there – maybe you’ll find a nice spot on the side of a tower to make daring leaps while avoiding the notice of guards along the way, or maybe you’ll find a quieter path via a sewer system that leads you to the same spot, but is infested with giant bugs that will swarm you if you get too close.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">That can be a really interesting stealth challenge to figure out, but comes with some unique drawbacks as well. For one, it can be exhausting to have to cross such a massive area slowly sneaking along all the while, and if you try to just sprint past everything to get to the objective, you should be prepared to reload a whole bunch as you work through the trial and error process of doing so. That travel time feels significantly less focused and curated than the more linear model for level design as well, and oftentimes you’re kinda just half-assedly sneaking through ruins and across rooftops with no real obstacles along the way until you get to the place that the objective marker wants you to be, at which point things start to feel much more focused. In other words, it’s a whole lot of fat before you get to the meat of the main objectives. I actually spent the vast majority of the more than 20 hours it took me to beat Blades of Greed trying to figure out where exactly my next objective was and how to get there, rather than actually pulling off the heist in question.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that each of these maps is pretty awesome across the board. The Wall is an absurdly cool vertical labyrinth of concrete castles and rickety slums, Turquoise Dawn is a jungle of trees, swamps, and massive, deadly roaches swarming in dark areas, and the Akenash Ruins are a ruined, kingdom where everything floats in the air unnaturally and enemies are extremely weird monsters, like something out of Elden Ring. Each visit to these places throughout the story unlocks new areas to explore, though you’ll also do quite a bit of backtracking through areas you’ve already been, which is a bit of a drag. Still, these are some of the more interesting areas I’ve stalked the halls of in a stealth game and highlights the unique, strange, and magically-infused world that this curmudgeonly goblin calls home.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Stealth Games</h3><p>If you like to remain unseen, here are the best games for you to see.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/Tieguytravis/lists/tieguytravis-favorite-stealth-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Though the huge amount of space these maps have can be pretty great to explore, they sometimes feel a bit too big for the much smaller objectives within them. The story’s main objectives are much smaller than a typical stealth mission, usually just requiring you to steal a key and open a locked door, or shut down a machine so you can reach your objective – miniature quests that usually only take a couple minutes to complete, if that. Once you’ve checked it off your list, you’re back to the mostly uneventful traveling stealth as you find a way to the next objective, often requiring you to backtrack through some of the same spots in the process, which is how I have spent the bulk of the adventure so far. On the bright side, this format means you’re basically just locked into a constant stream of pure, unadulterated stealth scenarios for hours on end as you work your way through each set of missions, and since that’s Blades of Greed’s strong suit, you’re getting exactly what the doctor ordered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re familiar with the shortcomings of the previous Styx games, then you’ll probably be less-than-stoked to hear that Blades of Greed doesn’t address most of these. Combat, which is a last resort, but sometimes required, is quite sloppy and overly simplistic, and moving around, especially jumping onto ledges and the like can be finicky at times and caused me to fall to my death or get caught out in the open dozens of times by this point. Worse than those though, are the usual performance issues and technical challenges, like NPCs becoming invisible while talking to them and frames dropping to horrifyingly low levels after extended play sessions. Framerate issues are actually a fair bit worse than I remember them being in previous games, presumably due to the significantly larger maps, and it can get pretty bad for long stretches when there’s a lot happening on screen. Most of these issues are sort of baked into Styx by this point, but it’s still worth shouting out that the bulk of this stuff has mostly gone unaddressed, seemingly.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Styx: Blades of Greed offers strong stealth mechanics and some truly awesome maps to explore decorated by the usual jankiness we’ve come to expect from the series. When you’re sneaking through these vast regions, slitting people’s throats and pulling off badass heists, it’s just as rad as ever, and the additional bag of magical tricks offers some new ways to outsmart your pursuers. Those good times are offset by a whole host of drawbacks, from the weak story, the extra fat added from large areas where objectives are miles apart, and performance issues that can be quite annoying. Blades of Greed still makes for a good time and offers a pure stealth experience that’s harder to find these days – you’ll just have to sneak around its rough parts to enjoy it.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/styx-blades-of-greed-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen are coming to Nintendo Switch next week to celebrate the series 30th anniversary. And while The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-thought-it-would-be-fun-nintendo-has-a-whole-faq-on-why-its-selling-pokmon-firered-and-leafgreen-separately-for-20-each">answered a number of questions about the releases</a> that probably shouldn't have been necessary to ask to begin with, there's one question we still don't know the answer to: Will these games be compatible with Pokémon Home?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the non-Pokénerds out there, Pokémon Home is a cloud-based, paid subscription service that allows users to store Pokémon from various games, as well as move them between certain compatible games. The service has been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-home/Pokemon_HOME_3.0_Update">directly compatible with every new Pokémon game on the Nintendo Switch</a>, as well as Pokémon GO, and it also works with Pokémon Bank, a similar program that existed on the 3DS. The explanations and rules are a bit convoluted, but essentially, it's only through Bank and Home that Pokémon from older games such as Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold/Silver/Crystal (in their Virtual Console on Nintendo 3DS incarnations) can be brought forward to modern games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, with some finagling, Pokémon fans can essentially bring a beloved monster from any mainline Pokémon game they've ever played (except the original Game Boy cartridges for Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold/Silver/Crystal) to Pokemon Home and, if it's compatible, transfer it for use into a modern game and continue their adventures. It's been a cool way for collectors to track their PokéDexes, and for long-time fans to keep beloved monsters from their childhoods by their side as adults.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original FireRed and LeafGreen are compatible with Home in this way too, though the process is, as suggested above, a bit complicated. In order to get Pokemon OUT of FireRed and LeafGreen into Home, you first have to use the Pal Park feature to transfer them to Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum using a Nintendo DS system. Then, you have to use the Poke Transfer Lab (which requires two Nintendo DS systems) to move them from that game to Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, or White 2. From there, you can move them into Pokémon Bank on a Nintendo 3DS, and then from Bank they can be transferred to Home. It's convoluted, but it's possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen on Nintendo Switch are compatible with Home directly, players can skip all that and bring monsters directly from those games into Home without having to own three different DS systems and multiple old game cartridges. However, players are concerned that this may not be the case. Earlier today, when the eShop page went live for FireRed and LeafGreen, it initially included the line, "Support for Pokémon HOME is coming soon. You'll be able to bring the Pokémon you catch and train to the place where all Pokémon gather-support for Pokémon HOME is coming to Pokémon FireRed/LeafGreen Version!” However, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans noticed that line was almost immediately removed</a>, leaving the compatibility up in the air.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/20/screenshot-2026-02-20-134922-1771616985303.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The lack of compatibility would be irritating enough if it was just a matter of convenience, but it's actually possible that Home not being available could cause issues with the gameplay itself. FireRed and LeafGreen are remakes of the original Pokemon games Red and Green. Players are thus able to complete the "Kanto" PokéDex just by playing them and trading a few monsters back and forth with a friend who has the other version of the game. Though <em>online</em> features are apparently not available in these Switch ports (even though they were in the 3DS ports of Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold/Silver/Crystal!), <em>local</em> trading is, so that's not the problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What <em>is</em> the problem is the National Dex. In FireRed/LeafGreen, the "National Dex" was, at the time, the "full" Pokedex, containing all 151 original Pokemon as well as all new Pokemon added in the second generation (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-gold-silver-crystal-version/List_of_Gen_2_Pokemon_(Johto_Pokedex)">Gold/Silver/Crystal</a>) and third (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-omega-ruby-alpha-sapphire/Pokedex">Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald</a>). The National Dex unlocks in FireRed/LeafGreen's post-game, and with it comes the ability to catch many of these Pokémon in the wild in-game. However, not every Pokémon is available. The Johto and Hoenn starter Pokémon, legendaries like Mew, Celebi, and Jirachi, and dozens of others were only obtainable back in the day by trading from Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Colosseum, or XD. And none of those games are currently available on Nintendo Switch in a way that would be locally compatible for trade with FireRed/LeafGreen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which means that, upon release, FireRed/LeafGreen will not be completeable, at least not in the 100% sense, because the National Dex will be impossible to fill out. While that probably won't bother most casual players, it's a pretty notable oversight, especially given that the releases of other classic games on Virtual Console on 3DS seemed so well thought-out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, it's entirely possible this is a lot of hullabaloo over nothing. Maybe the games<em> are </em>compatible with Home and Nintendo was just cleaning up language on the eShop page a bit. Maybe Home compatibility is coming in a few weeks or months, and Nintendo didn't want to set expectations too early. Maybe we're about to get an announcement of Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald on Nintendo Switch Online next week, and they'll be compatible locally. Maybe Colosseum and XD are coming to Switch Online (Nintendo has already teased them!), though these two games alone wouldn't canvas all the missing Pokemon. Maybe there's some other explanation! But it's weird that given Nintendo's extensive FAQ, they didn't address this glaring issue specifically. IGN reached out to both Nintendo and The Pokémon Company today to try and find out what the deal was. The Pokemon Company declined to comment, and we didn't hear back from Nintendo in time for publication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if neither company Koffings up an answer soon, we'll know more next week when the games actually launch and as the dust settles from Pokémon Day and all its announcements. Regardless, the rollout of FireRed and LeafGreen on Switch has been <em>real weird</em>, especially in light of past efforts to preserve classic Pokémon games. Only Nintendo and The Pokémon Company knows why they don't just dump all these things on Switch Online and make the people happy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
