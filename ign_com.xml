It's called TMNT: Empire City, and in the new developer diary video above, you'll get a look at some first-person parkour/traversal gameplay in this early look at the upcoming co-op action-adventure starring your favorite heroes in a half-shell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative director Ace St. Germain gives some insight on the first-person VR parkour mechanics of Empire City: "Movement through sewers is slower and stealthier, while above-ground movement emphasizes parkour, allowing for fast and vertical exploration. We’re not recreating the full New York City but are focusing on key areas. The city's haze and mist are narrative devices, rather than invisible walls. The architecture is inspired by real New York buildings, like the Confucius Plaza (renamed “Wise Man Building”). Using hands for parkour, players can grab ledges, dash mid-air, and launch themselves dynamically. Zip lines and uninterrupted momentum mechanics enhance freedom of movement. This verticality is essential for exploration, combat, and player expression.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3713650/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Empire_City/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlist</a> TMNT: Empire City on Steam or <a href="https://vr.meta.me/s/1L2KRVYie9Nqfgj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the Meta Store </a>if you're interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.
