Unless you're mega lucky, of course.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10: Lillie's Clefairy ex - 184/159</h2><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223150"><div id="223150" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Clefairy ex - 184/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst Lillie's Clefairy ex SIR is considered the main chase card of Journey Together, it's quite affordable now. Due to the overhype surrounding this set and scalpers not being able to get the same astronomical amounts for it, this card soon crashed to around the $150 mark. It's a gorgeous card and a no brainer decision for your binder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9: Team Rocket's Moltres ex - 229/182</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223151"><div id="223151" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Team Rocket's Moltres ex - 229/182</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">How can anyone not love this card? It's got action, stunning detail and eye popping color that represents the Team Rocket vibe of Destined Rivals perfectly. It's a beast in battle too, with Flame Screen doing 110 damage whilst reducing damage from the opposing Pokémon by 50. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Evil Incineration allows trainers to discard a Team Rocket's Energy in order to immidiately discard an opposing active Pokémon and all attached card. Play this right and it could turn battles on their heads, especially because its a basic Pokémon, so it can be built up straight away on a trainers bench without evolution mechanics getting in the way. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8: Latias ex - 239/191</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223152"><div id="223152" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Latias ex - 239/191</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sharing a dual artwork with <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgqVj?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Latios Illustration Rare</a>, Latais ex is holding it's value of nearly $200 and is an absolute stunner playing on a sunset background with Latios. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's ability allows you to switch out basic Pokémon to hit swiftly with Eon blade, which does 200 damage and stops it from attacking next turn. All trainers need to do is survive the next turn and switch out with another Pokémon for free. Rinse and repeat, love to see it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7: Roaring Moon ex - 162/131</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223153"><div id="223153" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Roaring Moon ex - 162/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Roaring Moon ex SIR has held it's value out of the gate since Prismatic Evolutions dropped, which is frankly amazing. The linework in this card is ridiculously intricate, giving it that cave painting vibe that goes well with ancient Pokémon found deep in Area Zero, Paldea. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a cool moment too, seeing Roaring Moon seemingly escaping some sort of cosmic calamity. The more you look at it the better it gets.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6: Cynthia's Garchomp ex - 232/182</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223154"><div id="223154" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cynthia's Garchomp ex - 232/182</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm calling Destined Rivals as the best Scarlet and Violet set for it sheer amount of detailed and expresive artwork, and Cynthia's Garchomp ex SIR is a fantastic example of this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With calls to the Pokémon League in the early anime (See the fire lamps at the top of the stadium) and big screen behind trainers on platforms, Garchomp can be seen lunging forward and breaking ground as it goes. Amazing card and well worth the money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5: Pikachu ex - 238/191</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223035"><div id="223035" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pikachu ex - 238/191</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $289.86</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Pikachu ex SIR is partially to blame for the Pokémon TCG boom that kicked off at the end of October 2024 and is still going today. After peaking at $485 at the end of 2024, it's finally stabalized at a much for reasonable $295 at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a good time to snap it up, if you've got the cash, but the amount of nostalgia and detailed yet soft artwork on this card will make it climb back up as we move away from the Scarlet and Violet era over the years to come. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4: Ethan's Ho-Oh ex - 230/182</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223155"><div id="223155" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ethan's Ho-Oh ex - 230/182</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This was one of my main chase cards from Destined Rivals, just look at it. Not only have we got mental amounts of nostalgia for Pokémon Gold and Silver OGs, but it reminds me so much of the first ever episode of Pokémon when Ho-Oh was revealed for the first time (which was before Pokémon Gold and Silver released). It's a stunning illustration that means so much to plenty of trainers, and I half expected the $300 market value before release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3: Greninja ex - 214/167</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223034"><div id="223034" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Greninja ex - 214/167</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $288.31</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Greninja ex SIR is my favorite in this article as I have it graded in a 10 and I'm being completely bias. Joking aside (I'm not) but this is one of the best artworks outside of Prismatic Evolutions in the Scarlet and Violet era. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Twilight Masquerade was a slept on set in my opinion, but the chances of pulling this are stacked. If you have the money upfront, i'd put it into this card instead of trying to rip packs. But I also obviously hate having fun, so the choice is yours.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2: Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex - 231/182 </h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223038"><div id="223038" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex - 231/182 </h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $378.76</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What a beast of a card! Mewtwo ex SIR captured that Mewtwo's Revenge energy so hard, immense amounts of nostalgia in this card for me. It looks like everyone agrees considering it's currently over $450. Destined Rivals cards are up and down day after day, so no doubt we'll see this settle at a cheaper pricepoint before it crossed the vintage checkpoint in years to come.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1: Umbreon ex - 161/131</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223040"><div id="223040" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Umbreon ex - 161/131</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $1,162.95</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We always knew it was going to be insanely priced, and we needed a cheaper Umbreon chase card after <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/246723/pokemon-swsh07-evolving-skies-umbreon-vmax-alternate-art-secret?page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umbreon VMAX (Moonbreon)</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Granted, it's still a mental market price, and over $1,000. But it won't get cheaper solely because it's<a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAxJx?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Umbreon</a> and almost anything linked to this dark type Eeveelution holds it's value, trust me on this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're brave enough to drop $1,000 on Prismatic Eeveelutions boosters, or even this card standalone, I salute your efforts, and your bank account.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions: Even More Eeveelutions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The money in Prismatic Evolution chase cards is insane, and it always will be, which is why the rest of the Eeveelutions need a dedicated section to themselves! These could've dominated the whole article, otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G1yP?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon ex SIR</a> is a stunner, but I always prefer seeing Pokémon cards with a bit of movement and action in them. I have to say though, the ornate ice patterns and overall terastalisation of <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G1yP?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon</a> is dipicted so well. It's also one of the less eye-wateringly expensive Eeveelution cards from Prismatic Evolutions at the minute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping up the trend is one of my favorites, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G1yR?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jolteon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions. There's been some banger Jolteon Cards in the past, for me that would be <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/264213/pokemon-swsh09-brilliant-stars-trainer-gallery-jolteon?Language=English&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolteon from the Brilliant Stars Trainer Gallery</a> and the <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/253418/pokemon-swsh-sword-and-shield-promo-cards-jolteon-v-swsh183?Language=English&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolteon V Sword and Shield Promo Card</a>, but this one has unlimited energy. Just look at how expressive this card is, perfectly showcasing Jolteons speed and agility with one of the coolest backgrounds i've seen in a Pokémon card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cell shading mixed with comic book artstyle of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAxmp?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vaporeon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions is a stunner. Just look at how light is captured in every drop of water and crystal. Plus I think this is one of the cutest depictions of this water-type Eeveelution we've had for some time. Absolute banger of a card and would do a flip terribly if I pulled this beast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another beautiful pastel artwork with <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWM4r?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Espeon ex SIR</a>. On top of Espeon being a fan favorite, it's easy to see why this card is now over $300. I've never seen that many shades of purple in such a small space before, such a stunning piece of art, imagine pulling this, getting a 10 then getting it in your slabbed collection? Stuff of dreams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I love me a good woodblock print, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8MYX?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon ex SIR</a> gives me massive tradition Japanese art vibes. The bold colours, thick lines and the overall beauty of this makes it worth the price tag.Verdant storm for   a grass and colourless energy can be devestating too, 60 x damage for every energy attached to all of your opponents Pokémon. Lethal!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's such a shame Fairy typing didn't come back for <a href="https://zdcs.link/znx5ej?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sylveon ex SIR</a>, because I can't think of a more Fairy type Pokémon card ever. It's another stunner with a cute stance and a pastel color pallete that just makes it. There's that much pink it just works, a fantastic card and its easy to see why it's over $400, especially as it's one of the most popular Eeveelutions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
