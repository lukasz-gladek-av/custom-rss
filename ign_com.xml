For that final the top ten The Hunt: Mega Edition competitors will be invited to Roblox HQ for their shot at the jackpot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The full list of 25 different Roblox experiences that make up The Hunt: Mega Edition Event are:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A Dusty Trip</li><li>Arsenal</li><li>Basketball Legends</li><li>Bayside High School</li><li>Blade League</li><li>Clip It</li><li>Car Crushers 2</li><li>Chained [2 Player Obby]</li><li>Drive World</li><li>Eat the World</li><li>Fisch</li><li>Hell's Kitchen</li><li>Infection Gunfight</li><li>It Girl</li><li>Metro Life</li><li>Natural Disaster Survival</li><li>Pet Simulator 99</li><li>PRESSURE</li><li>Regretevator</li><li>RIVALS</li><li>SpongeBob Tower Defense</li><li>Tower Defense Simulator</li><li>Untitled Boxing Game</li><li>Untitled Tag Game</li><li>World Zero</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">That's quite the variety, meaning to get to the big prize players will need to show their skills in games like life sim Bayside High School, cook up a storm as Gordon Ramsay's next executive chef in Hell's Kitchen and survive zombie FPS Infection Gunfight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only catch is to win the money you need to be 13 years-old or over, but even if you out of the running for the cash there are still special ultra-rare digital items created exclusively for The Hunt: Mega Edition to win. For all the terms and conditions head on over to the official <a href="https://www.roblox.com/the-hunt-mega-edition" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hunt: Mega Edition site.</a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is IGN's Managing Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was also confirmed Silent Hill f was being written by Ryukisshi07, the acclaimed Japanese visual novel writer behind the Higurashi and Umineko series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After almost three years, we are finally learning a lot more about Silent Hill f, and you can read all about it below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Silent Hill f Aims to 'Find the Beauty in Terror' and Present Players With a Beautiful Yet Terrifying Choice in 1960s Japan</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami shared a brand-new trailer for Silent Hill f and a ton of new details, including that it will aim to "find the beauty in terror" and present players with a beautiful yet terrifying choice in 1960s Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team wasn't ready to spoil what the decision would be, but it did unveil a bit of the story, and we'll leave it to Konami to set the stage;</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Shimizu Hinkao was living her life as an ordinary teenager," the official description reads. "That is, until her town is suddenly shrouded in fog and begins to change in a horrific way. Now, she must explore a town she no longer recognizes while solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and doing everything she can to survive... in order to face the ultimate decision that she must make. This is a tale about a beautiful yet terrifying choice."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new game will be an original story that will be a great place for new players to jump in, but there will be certain Easter Eggs waiting for series veterans. Konami also discussed a few more details on the game, including that it will take place in the fictional Japanese town of Ebisugaoka - which is based on a real place called Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, creature &amp; character designer kera presented a message that should excite fans, as it teases what horrors await them in Silent Hill f.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I love the Silent Hill series, and it's been a big influence on me," Kera said. "In particular, I am constantly remembering Silent Hill 2, and the messages on the walls, the music, and the monster designs. So, when it came to Silent Hill f, and bringing the setting to Japan, we had to come up with something that felt just a little different, and I had to really think about how to get that feeling. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The monster designs were the hardest. I had to consider everything that's come in Silent Hill before, and figure out how to take this game in a different direction, but still be Silent Hill. It might not be the exact same blood-smeared, rusting scenery, but I sincerely hope you'll enjoy our vision and the world we've created."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Music will also be a very important part of Silent Hill f, and the team is bringing together long-time Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka and Kensuke Inage (Dynasty Warriors series and more) to create music for both the Fog World and Otherworld, respectively. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I have composed music for an unsettling yet beautiful world that uses imagery from shrines, blending ancient Japanese court music with ambient echoes," Inage said. "I wove in various techniques that will connect the player to the protragonist's agony, internal conflict, fear, and other emotions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we didn't get a release date, it was confirmed that Silent Hill f will be released on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Have a tip for us?
