            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning: </strong></em><em>this article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for Donkey Kong Bananza. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza is now out in the wild, and one of the biggest burning questions ahead of launch centered on DK’s new best friend: Pauline. She’s a teenager in Bananza –  13 years old, to be precise – and this has led to rampant speculation that Bananza is a prequel to Super Mario Odyssey, which features an adult Pauline living in New Donk City. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve played through the main story of Bananza and completed most of its major post-game beats, which means we now have the answers to that question and more. But be warned, we’re about to <strong>spoil the entirety of Donkey Kong Bananza's finale</strong>. So if you’re still working your way to the Planet Core, turn back now, and join us once you’ve seen Bananza through to the end yourself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/new-donk-1752851646893.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pauline and DK arrive in New Donk City. | Image credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza eventually reveals that 13-year-old Pauline does, in fact, call New Donk City home, just like her Odyssey counterpart, and the story’s grand finale takes place in the metropolis after it’s been completely overrun by the returning King K. Rool. When DK and Pauline break through to the surface, Pauline exclaims “This is MY city!”, confirming the fan theory that Bananza would end by returning Pauline home to Odyssey’s most iconic location. But is this city connection enough to confirm that Bananza is a prequel to Super Mario Odyssey? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some background on Pauline, who is central to this mystery. In Odyssey, Pauline (who’s a full-grown adult) is the Mayor of New Donk City, perhaps most memorable for her performance of Jump Up, Super Star! at the New Donk City Festival. Teenage Pauline and Mayor Pauline share a lot in common: Beyond their shared name, they are both singers and performers, with much of Teenage Pauline’s character arc revolving around gaining enough confidence to perform in front of her hometown. She also sings the Bananza Transformation songs, and Void Kong is obsessed with the power of her voice… at least until King K. Rool boots him out of the story entirely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on Pauline’s age, most expected Bananza would be a prequel to Odyssey, and potentially an origin story for New Donk City itself. It would make sense that DK, acting as Pauline’s hero and best friend, would prompt the people to name the town after her savior once she was safely returned. But in Bananza, New Donk City is already established before DK and Pauline arrive, and during one of Teenage Pauline’s monologues at a Getaway, she references New Donk City’s nickname “The Big Banana”, a Kong-inspired parody of New York’s “The Big Apple.” It’s a nickname we’ve heard before, first uttered in Mario Odyssey by a New Donker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using all that as a starting point, it seems that there’s actually more evidence to suggest that Bananza is a <em>sequel </em>to Odyssey, and that Teenage Pauline is Mayor Pauline’s daughter, and the granddaughter of original Pauline (who we’ll call Arcade Pauline). Let us explain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teenage Pauline regularly references her grandmother throughout Bananza, including one time directly in the main story. After the pair run into Diddy and Dixie Kong in the Racing Layer, Pauline says to DK during the dive to the next layer, “I’m glad you got to see your friends again! But if I don’t get home, Grandma will worry.” Teenage Pauline’s Grandma is the only family member she directly mentions in Bananza, so Nintendo clearly wants us to think about who her grandma is.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/cutscene-1752851935120.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pauline says her grandma is at "home", later revealed to be New Donk City. | Image credit: Nintendo </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most likely answer becomes clear when we consider Donkey Kong’s grandfather: Cranky Kong. It is well-established that Cranky Kong is the original Arcade Donkey Kong that kidnapped Arcade Pauline way back in the day. Bananza reinforces this lore, as Cranky rants about his old rival who wore overalls, clearly referencing Mario… or Jumpman, as our favorite plumber was originally known. Cranky and Wrinkly Kong’s son is Donkey Kong Jr., who - despite what the Super Mario Bros. Movie may have tried to tell you - is not actually our current Donkey Kong. Junior starred in the Donkey Kong Jr. arcade game and made various other playable appearances before being essentially wiped from the face of the earth. The tie-wearing Donkey Kong we know and love – first introduced in Rare’s Donkey Kong Country – is actually Donkey Kong <em>the Third</em>, son of Donkey Kong Jr. and an unknown Kong mother. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we’ve established three generations of DK, which brings us back to Pauline. Arcade Pauline and Mayor Pauline don’t look like the same person. Arcade Pauline has blonde hair, while the Mayor is a brunette. You could argue this is just a character redesign, but a billboard in Odyssey’s New Donk City shows a blonde version of Pauline. Perhaps that’s just a fun easter egg, but perhaps it’s a clue to canon, and we have to use all the evidence we can. The New Donk City Festival – which sees Mario recreating gameplay from the Arcade Donkey Kong game – is held to “tell the story of our city's beginnings," according to Pauline. This implies that New Donk City was founded after the events of the arcade game, built on the foundation of the girders Jumpman climbed up towards Donkey Kong.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/easter-egg-1752851969004.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This image of Pauline in Super Mario Odyssey is a reference to the original Pauline from the Donkey Kong arcade game. | Image credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">New Donk City is a sprawling metropolis, and it likely took the course of at least a human generation to build it up to such an enormous size. That, combined with the different appearances, leads us to believe that Arcade Pauline and Mayor Pauline are two different people. Perhaps, dare we say, they are mother and daughter? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I suppose it’s possible that Bananza could still be a prequel, that Mayor and Teenage Pauline are one and the same, and that Arcade Pauline is her grandmother with a missing generational link between them, but it feels cleaner to suggest that there are three generations of Pauline: Arcade, Mayor, and Teenage, just like there are three generations of DK: Arcade/Cranky, Jr., and the main DK of today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We really hope our theory that Teenage Pauline is the granddaughter of Arcade Pauline is true, because it’s absolutely adorable that the grandchildren of two of the oldest Nintendo characters have now teamed up and become best friends in Bananza. It’s very cool to think that Nintendo has found a clever way to redefine one of its oldest character dynamics over 40 years later. Unfortunately, completing the bulk of Bananza’s postgame content – which are called Bananza Rehearsals and leads to Bananza’s true final platforming challenge – doesn’t really shed any more light on this. Pauline returns to the surface to perform a song for her city, but all we see of that is a new piece of art that appears after the credits have rolled. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/1000006378-1752850870617.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Completing Bananza's post-game content unlocks this bonus art that... doesn't really tell us anything new. | Image credit: Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So while Bananza’s position as a prequel may make a lot of sense, it ultimately can never be more than a theory. There’s just not enough concrete evidence from Nintendo. This theory does raise some concerning, perhaps even supernatural questions about Mario, though. If he has really interacted with multiple generations of Paulines and Donkey Kongs… does this mean Mario never ages, while those around him do? Or are there multiple generations of Mario? Is Nintendo implying that Mario and Jumpman are two different characters? It’s probably best not to think about it too much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, and perhaps most crucially, it’s important to remember that Nintendo historically doesn’t care about lore and continuity across its games. Even The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild – has lore inconsistencies that are ultra-hand-waved away. So it’s quite possible Nintendo doesn’t even have a truly established timeline between the original Donkey Kong, Odyssey, and Bananza, and just loves to keep fans guessing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you think is going on in Donkey Kong Bananza? Is Teenage Pauline the daughter of Mayor Pauline and granddaughter of the original Pauline Cranky Kong kidnapped all those years ago, or are we being completely ri-Donk-ulous? Let us know in the comments!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">indie.io is a video game publishing platform that works with lots of different developers and publishes games in a variety of genres. They’ve published dozens of games, several of which are discounted on Nintendo Switch right now as part of a sale that will run through July 30.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with indie.io’s library as a whole, the sale includes a wide range of genres. There’s cozy adventures, tactical RPGs, creature collectors, management sims, and more. You can check out the full sale <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/sales-and-deals/indie-io/#sort=df&amp;p=0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>here</u></a>, but we thought we’d highlight six games that showcase the diversity of titles that are available. Let’s get started:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/c60f2d286cca1b53dc4a30f52f70ca80da94835ae2297b81e3ec14893b86046b-18001013-07-18-2025-11-38-am-1752863926860.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/echoes-of-the-plum-grove-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Echoes of the Plum Grove</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 20% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cozy farming sim genre has been thriving in recent years, and Echoes of the Plum Grove adds to the formula by letting you experience multiple generations. Initially, you wash up on an island shore and start with a modest plot of land. Over time, you can expand your homestead, start a family, and grow that family. You can befriend or insult your neighbors, form an alliance with a local witch coven, or poison people who cross you. As the generations pass, these decisions will shape your descendents’ experiences and ultimately define your legacy. The game world is fully hand drawn, with 2D characters in 3D environments that heighten the cozy feel. And while forming relationships through the generations is the central core of the game, there are also mysteries across the island for you to uncover.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/27a7c9cc1a10206916f1d18b8d7340a182f602a5c43711113b15024ecec6d14f-18001013-07-18-2025-11-39-am-1752863980107.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dark-deity-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Dark Deity</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 75% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Deity is a strategy RPG that was clearly inspired by classics of the genre. You build up an army, lead your soldiers in turn-based combat, and choose what classes to promote them into as they grow stronger. There are 30 playable characters, and if one of them falls in battle, they’ll suffer grave wounds that drop their stats. So you need to be careful and strategize as you lead your squad from rookies to heroes. The main story is told across 28 chapters that take more than 20 hours to complete, and the “Suns Out, Swords Out” DLC is also available for 20% off as part of the current sale. It adds seven additional levels, each telling a story from before or after the events of the base game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/778f5d494b38cab2cc5e5e2d834aec4594c160ff025b2e40e10e42c8ad85a29d-18001013-07-18-2025-11-40-am-1752864071071.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/coromon-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Coromon</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 50% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another modern game that takes inspiration from and builds upon the classics of the genre, Coromon is a monster tamer with more than 100 monsters to catch and train. Each monster is defined by its element, traits, and skills. The battle system is stamina-based and every skill costs SP, so you need to be strategic about when you use your most powerful skills. Meanwhile, traits are inherent to a monster and can trigger when certain conditions are met. They don’t sap stamina when they trigger and differ between monsters of the same species, so they can be an important factor of building your perfect team. The story of Coromon takes you across six biomes as you try to stop a mysterious threat, and there are more reveals and plot twists than you might expect in a typical monster tamer.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/aaed8882d691d0f6920791bbe29c0276e710ec58867defd9b941d8d906bb9d69-18001013-07-18-2025-11-41-am-1752864126105.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cat-cafe-manager-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Cat Cafe Manager</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 40% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game titles don’t get much more clear than this one. In Cat Cafe Manager, you … manage a cat cafe. You inherit an old, rundown cafe in the town of Caterwaul Way, and you’ll need to rebuild and renovate it to give the local stray cats a proper home. You can decorate and expand the space to fit your personal tastes, as well as hire new employees and refine their skills. You can make plenty of feline friends, but you’ll build relationships with humans too. It is a cafe, after all. The villagers will want to stop by and take a load off after a long day, and you can travel across the town to chat with the locals and discover new recipes and other opportunities for your cafe. Who knows, you might even uncover a mystery or two in need of solving.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/52131427f1e6fcb529f5060bd6c12056d8129d7565f008ae75862f7cdbe37ee1-18001013-07-18-2025-11-42-am-1752864169029.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/9-years-of-shadows-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>9 Years of Shadows</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 35% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, for something completely different. 9 Years of Shadows is a side-scrolling Metroidvania where color has been drained from the world for almost a decade (hence the name). You play as Europa, a warrior bent on fighting her way to the mechanical giant Talos and stopping the corruption seeping out of it before everything is swallowed in darkness. You’ll befriend a cute floating bear called Apino who has the ability to bring back color, and together you’ll wield elemental armors, restore vibrant hues, and try to free the world from the colorless curse that plagues it. And as you do, enjoy a soundtrack from composers Michiru Yamane and Norihiko Hibino, known for their work on Castlevania and Metal Gear Solid, respectively.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/73436094b39ccee444a40a85b45e169ce1b377fc45f7a3f150c57e4197ab78cd-18001013-07-18-2025-11-43-am-1752864212426.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mail-time-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Mail Time</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sale: 30% off</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our list ends by circling back around to a cozy, relaxing game. Mail Time is a cottagecore adventure set in a whimsical forest where you’re a courier who uses light platforming to deliver letters. You can customize the look of your character and run, jump, and glide your way across the forest to make deliveries to the critters who live there. Relaxation is the focus of the game, with gameplay that doesn’t saddle you with anything stressful. There’s no time limits, pressure, danger, or fall damage. You can just chill, make your deliveries, upgrade your gliding, and do it again. Simplicity can be nice sometimes.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/6-diverse-games-in-the-indieio-publisher-sale-on-nintendo-switch]]></content:encoded>
