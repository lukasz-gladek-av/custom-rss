Instead of trying to cram the massive video game’s story into a box, Gangs of Night City instead puts you in control of one of the universe’s various gangs (each gang having unique asymmetric abilities), and you wage war as you and the other players try to carve out more territory. </p><p id="cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City ">Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City The Board Game</h2></p><div catalogid="b1abd622-deb3-40e8-8b58-fb95dd597f8d" id="224519"><div id="224519" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City The Board Game</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>1 to 4 players take on the roles of rival gangs struggling to expand their territory in the universe of Cyberpunk 2077 with Cyberpunk 2077: Ganges of Night City The Board Game </p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This game isn’t just a bloodbath, and while you can expect some good ol’ shootouts, Gangs of Night City will reward strategic planning more. For those of you who may be hoping for some story, this does manage to inject some narrative elements into the mix, thanks to the scenarios you play with. These will mix things up for you and your fellow players with some new rules or mechanics, or even some alternative victory conditions. That said, this game is about seeing who is best at dishing out the most pain, and it just feels fun to cause some chaos with some friends over some drinks during a game night.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">Board game adaptations of popular video games</a> have become pretty commonplace these days, and we have covered a bunch, including Gangs of Night City!
