Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed"><u>high-profile flops</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices"><u>layoffs</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled"><u>studio closures</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-delays-cancellations-were-because-it-was-making-too-many-games-at-once"><u>game cancellations</u></a> in the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-plots-protest-outside-paris-hq-accuses-company-of-failing-to-reveal-discussions-with-microsoft-ea-and-others-allegedly-interested-in-acquiring-ips"><u>reportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investors</u></a> on a buyout deal that would let it preserve control of the company's intellectual property. So, the video game world is watching Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ early performance closely for signs of its success — or failure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a lot of attention on Shadows’ Steam concurrents, which are being compared to those of other triple-A single-player games that recently released, as well as previous Assassin’s Creed games on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows became the most-played Assassin's Creed game ever on Steam over the weekend with 64,825 peak concurrent players, although it’s worth noting that it was the first game in the series to launch day-one there since 2018's Odyssey. BioWare’s single-player RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard"><u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u></a> saw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to make a call on whether Shadows is below, meeting, or exceeding Ubisoft’s expectations without knowing what those expectations were, a revenue figure, or a sales figure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Money talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adventuring across feudal Japan?

It’s due out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This co-op beat 'em up rekindles memories of the arcades of the ‘90s, and features the likes of Wolverine, Captain America, Spider-Man, and Storm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The debut trailer is below:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Opening with spectacular hand-drawn animation reflecting the game’s visual homage to colorful '90s era Marvel comic books, Dotemu revealed the first set of playable characters from the roster: Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Phyla-Vell, Venom, and Nova. The trailer’s sneak peek at gameplay finds these legends uniting to throw down against menacing enemies in classically inspired side-scrolling brawls.</blockquote><blockquote>In Marvel Cosmic Invasion the immortal Super Villain Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, threatening all life as we know it. Fighters both Earth-born and cosmic must now join forces in a star-spanning adventure against the deadly Annihilation Wave. Brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos.</blockquote><blockquote>Choose and control your own team of two characters while tagging between them mid-fight with the innovative Cosmic Swap system, capitalizing on distinct superpowers and special attacks to create unique team-ups and dish out devastating damage. Unlock stellar powerups and rewards while experimenting with different duos and bash through a fantastic collection of locales and nemeses from the Marvel universe. Marvel Cosmic Invasion’s action includes a range of accessibility features, empowering the whole family to be Super Heroes (or villains), and supports four-player drop-in/drop-out local and online co-op with crossplay.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Nintendo Direct March 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

So you may encounter wild Pokemon that you can capture or battle when you're just wandering around Lumiose City.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More importantly, we learned a bit more about the cryptic tease at the end of the last Z-A trailer. At night, Lumiose City's streets are flooded with trainers battling in a tournament called the "Z-A Royale". You begin in the tournament at rank Z, and work your way up to rank A, with the promise of having a "wish granted" if you succeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this feature, we got a look at more trainer battles, including the ability to "surprise attack" other trainers from behind to get an advantage in battle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon Legends: Z-A was first announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-pokemon-game-pokemon-presents-2024">last year's Pokemon Presents</a>, with a cinematic trailer showing off a futuristic<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-wont-let-players-explore-all-of-kalos"> Lumiose City</a>. At the time, we were given very few details: just that it would be coming to Nintendo Switch this year, and some light Pokemon teases. We have since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-trailer-reveals-rooftop-running-gameplay-and-late-2025-release-window">gotten a longer look at the game</a> in a Pokemon Direct earlier this year, including seeing many of the Pokemon that will be available, a number of new characters, and the protagonist running all over the rooftops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, fans have been piecing together little hints from the trailer and their own experiences with  <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-arceus-review">Pokemon Legends: Arceus</a> and its unique spin on the Pokemon formula. While we can expect Legends: Z-A to have some similarities with Arceus, we're hoping it's a little more polished than both it and Scarlet and Violet when it launches later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">today's Nintendo Direct right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Announced during Nintendo Direct March 2025, Rhythm Heaven Groove is set to launch on Nintendo Switch in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhythm Heaven's last appearance was almost a decade ago back in 2016 with Rhythm Heaven: Megamix, which similarly showed up on the 3DS riiiight as the console was starting to wind down. Megamix featured 70 returning games and 30 brand new games, and until now was the best and most comprehensive place to play Rhythm Heaven. The series itself has long been beloved for its fun, intuitive rhythm mini-games and delightful original music by Japanese singer Tsunku and Nintendo composer Masami Yone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Tsunku was listed on the Rhythm Heaven Groove splash screen as returning to compose once again. Tsunku <a href="https://www.vgmonline.net/rhythm-heaven-music-producer-tsunku-recovering-from-cancer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced in 2014</a> that he had laryngeal cancer, and underwent surgery to have his vocal cords removed. He has since stepped away from a number of his past projects, so his return for Rhythm Heaven is a hopeful sign that he may be doing better and is still up for crafting the excellent music that makes Rhythm Heaven as good as it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Nintendo Direct March 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
