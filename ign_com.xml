This Red, White, and Black deck is helmed by Terra, Herald of Hope, and the Final Fantasy 6-themed package is all about bringing cards back from the graveyard with her abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are 25 new card designs inside, with Terra coming in foil.

Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme,” said Hawley. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true.

Details on the release date or content are still under wraps, but the games have given us everything from Montana, USA to the Himalayas and cults, insane dictators and pirates, so there's plenty to work with.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realized," added Mac, who also worked with Ubisoft on Apple's Mythic Quest, where he played a game developer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created.
