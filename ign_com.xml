            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I finally played Hollow Knight: Silksong. No, I don’t mean to brag, but instead find myself having to type it out just to convince my eyes that it actually happened. Yes, it may have only been for around 20 minutes, but the long-awaited sequel shows little sign of disappointing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During my demo at gamescom 2025, I was faced with a choice of two areas to play in: Moss Grotto or Deep Docks. Of course, I was going to try both, but first went for Moss Grotto — based on nothing apart from green being my favourite colour — which turned out to be the right decision. This sunlit grassy zone appears to be the very beginning of Silksong, as I fell into it following a brief cutscene in which a caged Hornet (the playable princess-protector protagonist) breaks free from the metal wagon she’s held captive in by collapsing the bridge it’s being paraded on. Developer Team Cherry seems keen on immersing us straight back into the world of Hollow Knight right from the very beginning, teasing lore via a passage of Conductor Romino's Pharloom Folly.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Moss Grotto itself, it felt very much like a (re)introduction to the core mechanics of Hollow Knight. A mixture of rudimentary platforming and simple battles was littered across its grassy floors in a short but sweet section of Silksong’s presumably sprawling labyrinth of a world. It all ended with a boss fight against a large queen-bee-like insect that attempted to lock me in her lair. Moss Mother gave me little boss bother, though, dispatching them by unlocking that long-dormant Hollow Knight muscle memory as I leapt over darting diagonal attacks and evaded crumbling rocks falling from the sky. It was action platforming 101, but still felt incredibly satisfying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I then swiftly moved onto Deep Docks, which turned out to be an entirely different proposition. Tools such as kunai, which can be thrown horizontally to pierce foes, were added to my arsenal, along with skills such as a familiar dash ability. Things naturally get more complex with more items to juggle, which is reflected in Deep Docks' level design that comprises a maze of clanking metal elevators and the numerous semi-hidden levers that operate them. I may have only spent a handful of minutes there, but I could already see myself getting hopelessly lost without the aid of one of Cornifer’s ever-valuable maps.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Discovering the secrets of Hollow Knight's world was maybe the purest of its joys to me; I wouldn't want Silksong to feel like running into a brick wall too often.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon unlocking a boss arena, I was confronted by an enemy of far greater threat than any I had encountered yet. Lace, a balletic white insect, not too dissimilar in look to Hornet herself, dazzled me with intricate combos delivered at a speed my poor brain could not compute quickly enough. Defeated, I moved on, knowing this would be a battle for another day and not one I particularly wanted the dozens of people waiting in the queue behind to witness me losing again and again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's too early to gauge the overall difficulty of Silksong, the jump up in this later area was noticeable, with enemies capable of far more than simple prods and darts. I usually welcome added complexity and evolution of combat when it comes to sequels, so I have no great issue here. I just hope that in totality, fights won't become too tiresome with exploration and progress being halted too often. Discovering the secrets of Hollow Knight's world was maybe the purest of its joys to me; I wouldn't want Silksong to feel like running into a brick wall too often.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are concessions to make you feel more powerful compared to the original, though. Health regain is now divorced from skills, meaning you can throw those kunai liberally without having to sacrifice a potential life-saving heal. Attack is still the best form of defense, echoing some of my favourite systems from the likes of Control, Doom Eternal, and, of course, the original Hollow Knight. This is emphasised by the fact that you can only trigger health regen when your silk-white bar is full, encouraging even more offensive maneuvers to build that up quickly. Dodging will only get you so far in Hollow Knight Silksong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these tweaks and changes tie together to create a more aggressive minibeast, and, although I certainly have a soft spot for the original Hollow Knight, I’m finding myself instantly drawn to Silksong more. 2018's game often placed you on the back foot, but here I felt instantly more empowered and ready to go toe-to-toe with my aggressors. As someone who traditionally enjoys the push of faster-paced action games as opposed to the pull of more modern examples of the genre (I’m really trying my hardest not to use the term soulslike here), I’m left encouraged. Creature design is still one of the highlights in the sequel, with the borderline adorable adversaries <em>almost </em>being too cute to stab. At one stage, I got locked in a room with some flying nuisances with pots over their heads who lobbed molten rocks at me, as well as a pudgy little round lad with a saucepan for a shield. I almost felt bad killing them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in truth, combat was never the highlight of Hollow Knight for me anyway, but rather the layers of exploration and discovery lurking beneath each of its beautifully crafted environments. And while I’ve barely scratched the surface of what secrets Silksong has stored in this regard, initial impressions promise a similar bounty of nooks and crannies packed full of insect friends and foes. Platforming through these mazes is still a joy; a delicately delightful balance between precision and floaty jumping that tests your skills, that crucially never feels unfair when dropping into a gap unwillingly. The addition of mantling in the sequel helps this massively, with edges freely within grasp even when slight misjudgments are made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was instantly taken by how much more colourful the environments are this time around. Cinders dance around caves dripping with lava and glowing green moss dresses earthy overhangs, themselves floating precariously above pools of glistening water. Hornet's red cape billows against the painted backdrops, both acting in harmony to form the sort of Saturday morning cartoon look you'd expect if one were to hang in the Louvre. Hornet also feels bigger on the screen, dominating the frame to a greater degree than her meeker-yet-still-mighty forebearer. That visual design feels like a deliberate choice, one aimed at creating more of a power trip sensation this time around. It's these ideas — from revamped combat design to its repainted world – that appear to be acting in concert to a magical degree, and impressive proof, even in this small dose, of what Team Cherry has been brewing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, we've been waiting many, many years for this sequel, but everything at this stage points to it being worth it. Each aspect feels authored and prescribed to a clear vision — a piece of playable art that is as fun to wield as it is to watch (I should know, the gamescom queue was very long). It may have been the shortest of demos, but so far, Silksong is very much singing to me, maybe even more than the original.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher series really did well to capture that sense of exploring a brutal fantasy world as a protagonist who knew how to get their hands dirty. But in the upcoming dark fantasy RPG The Blood of Dawnwalker, a new game from a team of former creatives behind The Witcher 3, it leans further into a morally ambiguous setting as you decide which path its protagonist will take – one that maintains his human form and ideals, or one that embraces newfound powers as a half-vampire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just ahead of Gamescom 2025, we got an extended walkthrough of The Blood of Dawnwalker from the devs at Rebel Wolves that put a spotlight on the parallel playstyles of human and vampire action-RPG gameplay. So far, The Blood of Dawnwalker is putting forth some strong concepts for its take on a dark-fantay RPG that's all about navigating two different worlds in cunning fashion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Blood of Dawnwalker - Gamescom 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of what makes vampires so compelling as horror characters is that they can be tragic figures. Having to contend with supernatural forces that potentially put them at odds with humanity is a concept that can be great to explore in video games. That idea is at the heart of The Blood of Dawnwalker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in a supernatural version of 14th-century Europe, The Blood of Dawnwalker focuses on Coen and his vendetta against a powerful coven of vampires that seek to take over Europe with violence and even some old-fashioned medieval-era politicking. After Coen has a violent encounter with the vampire leader Brencis following the abduction of his family, the protagonist develops a special strain of vampirism that transforms him into a half-vampire that can navigate the increasingly blurry line between human and supernatural. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The protagonist develops a special strain of vampirism that transforms him into a half-vampire that can navigate the increasingly blurry line between human and supernatural.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Our extended preview focused on a quest called "A Monk and a Saint," which saw Coen travel to the settlement of Svartrau to uncover a hidden tomb – and the town's more nefarious side. This quest features a round of combat sequences against some foes capable of withstanding Coen's abilities in both his human and vampire forms. It initially seemed standard fare for an RPG quest, but where Dawnwalker differs is in how the quest can change depending on the time of day and which form you take on to complete it. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The leading narrative hook carrying players forward is the month-long time limit, giving Coen only a limited period to rescue his family. You can largely advance the day at your choosing, and Dawnwalker doesn't necessarily pressure you to make some time-specific choices. That said, your approach to progression will very much influence the course of events in Coen's journey – especially with which side of Coen is taking the lead. Time is essentially a resource that you spend with each passing quest and activity, and depending on what you do and when you do it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers gave us a run of the preview's main quest from two different sides, as both Coen's human and vampire forms. When playing as the latter, Dawnwalker shifts to a stealth-action playstyle, where the protagonist must avoid detection from guards and civilians. Coen's vampire abilities are also unleashed in this state, allowing players to walk on walls, teleport, and use blood abilities and vampiric claws to cut down foes. And yes – you'll also be able to drain the blood from humans, foe and non-combative alike, for stealth takedowns or outright executions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was impressed by how much the action and pacing looked like a mix between The Witcher's grand scope and the immersive-sim elements of Dishonored when seeing Coen in his vampire form – you can truly leap across rooftops and get the jump on some foes, which was very satisfying to see. However, it shows how players will have to grapple with some moral choices, as Coen, who needs to feed to maintain his vampire abilities during the night, must do. While you can feed on animals to offer some temporary relief, the larger payout comes from human targets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The vampire form looks to present a more direct and action-heavy approach to engaging with the quests. However, Coen's human form presents an interesting contrast by focusing more on investigation and tactical methods. Because Coen can blend in with others in his human form, there are far more opportunities to engage with the different characters and uncover pathways for success without the need for bloodshed. It was also fascinating to see how the characters react to knowing that vampires are now in control of the region and that life is, understandably, far worse off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When things pop off, combat shows the stark differences in Dawnwalker's playstyles. I adopted the tactical-action approach, which feels like a blend of The Witcher 3's versatile swords and sorcery combat flow, combined with the calculated nature of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's swordplay. It presents an opportunity for players to feel powerful as Coen, where they have to exploit vulnerabilities. In his human form, Coen relies on his swordplay, along with gadgets and hex spells, to overcome some enemies. Similar to The Outer Worlds, you can pull up a tactical menu to target an enemy to execute attacks that can stun foes or deliver killing blows.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Coen's massive claws can tear into enemy defenses, and he can pull off combat finishers where he can lay into foes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat gets a bit more hectic when in Coen's vampire form, which sees him unleash his supernatural blood-based abilities. In addition to his sword, Coen's massive claws can tear into enemy defenses, and he can pull off combat finishers where he can lay into foes. However, Dawnwalker still presents some challenges with elite foes, such as the human Blood Guards who have armor and weapons to stand up to Coen's vampiric abilities, along with some more dangerous monsters and the rival vampires that can overpower the protagonist if you're not careful.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An interesting detail that the developers highlighted during the presentation was that players could make a beeline to the primary goal of the game early on – think of how players might try to defeat Ganon in the opening hours of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However, the team stated that it'll be a challenge to pull off, as the core game is all about powering up Coen with new gear and abilities. Still, I’ll be curious to see if it'll be possible for players to clear the campaign early on in Coen's journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I wish we had more of an opportunity to see what the larger world would be like, but so far, The Blood of Dawnwalker captures that feeling of navigating two different worlds as a half-vampire, which is a very compelling premise for a role-playing game. Compared to The Witcher 3 or developer Dontnod's Vampyr, The Blood of Dawnwalker captures that open-ended, freeform nature of classic role-playing games like Gothic 1 and 2, which is exciting to see. Hopefully, the full game will be able to deliver on the concept of a vampire RPG with some world-changing stakes.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-offers-2-very-different-rpg-playstyles]]></content:encoded>
