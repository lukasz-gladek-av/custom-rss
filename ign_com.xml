            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/vtuber-usada-pekora-is-in-death-stranding-2-and-while-some-japanese-fans-hate-it-others-note-hideo-kojima-games-always-have-unexpected-crossovers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima Productions recently announced that VTuber Usada Pekora will be making a guest appearance in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>. However, this surprise cameo seems to have ruffled the feathers of some rather vocal Japanese Death Stranding fans on social media, some of whom are now proclaiming that they won’t buy the game anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Usada Pekora is a Hololive VTuber whose carrot-loving avatar is an anime girl with rabbit ears. As well as singing, she often streams games and has recently been playing Elden Ring: Nightreign. Fitting with her hungry, mischievous rabbit girl avatar, she is known for frequently adding the made-up word “peko” into her sentences (which probably comes from the casual Japanese expression “pekopeko,” which means “very hungry”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As seen in Kojima Productions’ video below, Pekora will appear as a hologram in Death Stranding 2, calling out greetings to Sam and thanking him for his hard work (she says “otsu<em>peko</em> deshita<em>”</em> instead of the actual Japanese phrase “otsukaresama deshita<em>”</em>).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">新たな繋がりを確認🐰<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeathStranding2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#DeathStranding2</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%87%E3%82%B9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%882?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#デススト2</a> <a href="https://t.co/Xy5lsFS2FK" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Xy5lsFS2FK</a></p>— KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS (@KojiPro2015) <a href="https://twitter.com/KojiPro2015/status/1928043652758036711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Some Japanese fans reacted strongly to the announcement of Usada Pekora’s cameo, with some commenters on X saying “I won’t buy Death Stranding 2 now.” Others elaborated on their reasons. “Death Stranding 2 is done for. When a game I planned to buy gets treated like this, I definitely won’t buy it,” said <a href="https://x.com/Usagi_chan_n/status/1928092742992941172" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one user</u></a>. “Stop pandering to VTubers. I won’t buy it now,” added <a href="https://x.com/Matatab21859902/status/1928105131398287510" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another</u></a>. It could be that these users find the VTuber and her affected speech annoying, or feel that Pekora doesn’t match Death Stranding’s more serious tone. In response, defenders have been giving equally terse replies such as, “Then don’t buy it then!” and, “If you are not going to buy DS2 just because Pekora is in it, then don’t!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is not the first time that Usada Pekora and Hideo Kojima have crossed paths. As reported by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/news/2505292o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Denfaminicogamer</u></a>, Pekora visited Kojima Productions back in August last year, posing with Kojima for the obligatory snap in front of Ludens.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">兎田ぺこらさんと🐇 <a href="https://t.co/S0JuGcBqVe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/S0JuGcBqVe</a></p>— 小島秀夫 (@Kojima_Hideo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/1829421334730092634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Players familiar with Kojima’s work will know that his past games feature many unexpected crossovers, Easter eggs and bizarre elements. These include fourth wall-breaking mentions of other games, as well as the inclusion of real-life products and people (creepy developer “ghosts” in MGS2, anyone?). Metal Gear Solid 3 introduced the Kerotan frog character and featured the real-life Japanese snack Calorie Mate, both things that technically don’t match its 60s jungle setting — not to mention the Ape Escape monkeys that pop up in Snake Vs. Monkey. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the first Death Stranding got Horizon: Zero Dawn-themed holograms, with the PC version getting even more crossover references to other games (Half Life, Portal, and Cyberpunk 2077) in the form of items. With Kojima’s penchant for putting all kinds of references and crossovers into his games, it seems likely that Usada Pekora will be one of many that players can discover in Death Stranding 2 when it releases on June 26.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, we reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach"><u>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</u></a>'s ESRB rating, which suggests players will be able to use an unconventional melee weapon. Hideo Kojima is also working on a live-action <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-movie-coming-from-a24-kojima-productions"><u>Death Stranding film with A24</u></a>, and we recently learned that a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-is-getting-an-anime-adaptation-hideo-kojima-says"><u>Death Stranding anime is also in the works</u></a>.

Up until now, even beta players have only seen around 25% of Hagga Basin, so the stream showcased "these huge and diverse landscapes" in all their glory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Before even considering the vast dunes and dangers of the Deep Desert, players will experience a full-scale survival game," Funcom teased.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They will rise through the ranks of the Atreides or Harkonnen; build powerful strongholds; brave Imperial Testing Stations; craft advanced schematics; explore and harvest in a variety of vehicles, and much, much more."
