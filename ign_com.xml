His videos and his mod hit the headlines in January as information-starved GTA fans flocked to experience a fan-made approximation of what they can expect to play officially when GTA 6 launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S this fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, last week, Dark Space received the dreaded strike notification from YouTube after Take-Two issued a copyright removal request. If a YouTube channel receives multiple copyright strikes, it runs the risk of being terminated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Dark Space removed all download links to his mod, despite the fact he has yet to be asked to do so by Take-Two, and published <a href="https://youtu.be/7LmLfJAuR_U?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a response video</a> on his channel calling out the company for its actions and suggesting it was the result of the mod's take on GTA 6's map being "probably a little too accurate."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Space was more philosophical in a follow-up interview with IGN. “I expected this would happen based on their past takedowns,” the modder said. “I went into this project knowing it was a possibility, and the fact that it happened does not surprise me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Space said he believes Take-Two went after his mod because it was based on an online GTA 6 community mapping project that uses leaked coordinate points to “perfectly” map out the upcoming virtual space, and as a result might have ruined the surprise for players and the internet at large.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's probably the biggest red flag, although most of the work in my map was based on the trailer shots,” Dark Space added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get. If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Dark Space’s GTA 6 mod project is no more. And that’s not just for YouTube videos of it, that’s for the entire thing. “Well they clearly do not want this project to exist,” Dark Space said. “So it's not just under threat, it's eliminated. There’s no point putting more time into something that goes directly against what they’re willing to allow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm just going to keep making videos that people hopefully like. I probably won't do anything else modding GTA 5 in relation to GTA 6, since it seems dangerous.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are now concerns that the GTA 6 community mapping project could be next in Take-Two’s sights. IGN has contacted the group for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Key Art's Hidden Map..?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two has a history of taking down fan projects, most recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/defiant-modders-release-gta-vice-city-nextgen-edition-despite-take-two-takedown"><u>the YouTube channel belonging to the makers of the ‘GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition,’</u></a> which ports the world, cutscenes, and missions from 2002’s Vice City into 2008’s GTA 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One former Rockstar developer has defended the company’s actions here, saying both Take-Two and Rockstar are protecting their business interests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Take2/R* are a commercial company,” former Rockstar Games technical director Obbe Vermeij <a href="https://x.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1883238047015149881" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a>. “They will take down mods that interfere with their business interests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The VC NextGen Edition mod for GTA4 directly competes with the Definitive Edition. The Liberty City preservation project (GTA4 in GTA5 engine) would interfere with a possible GTA4 remaster. (No idea whether they’re working on that. I think they should.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s no point getting angry about it. This is what companies are supposed to do. The best we can hope for is that they allow mods that don’t interfere with their business. Such as DCA3 (GTA3 for Dreamcast). Afaik they have recently been decent about letting these projects continue.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait for GTA 6 to come out, check out IGN’s coverage of an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, Take-Two boss Strauss <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6"><u>Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-has-been-refused-classification-in-australia<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Automated RC rating is unlikely to be the end of the story.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> There is added confusion over Silent Hill f's classification in Australia. The rating reported below has been removed, and the Australian Classification Board has confirmed it has not actually been rated at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> Konami’s upcoming Silent Hill f has been refused classification in Australia, meaning the game would not be able to be sold within Australia at this time. However, Silent Hill f’s RC rating has been assigned by an automated rating tool and not via actual Australian Classification Board members so, based on precedent, it’s unlikely this is the end of the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami does not distribute its own games locally in Australia, but IGN has contacted its third-party distribution partner for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The specific reason for Silent Hill f’s RC rating has not been supplied at this time. Since the introduction of an adults-only category for games in Australia (R18+) in January 2013, games that have been refused classification in Australia are only typically flagged for sexual activity with a person who appears to be a child under 18, visual depictions of sexual violence, or tying incentives and rewards to drug use. 2008’s Silent Hill: Homecoming was initially refused classification in Australia in the lead up to its release due to a high impact torture scene but that was several years prior to the introduction of the R18+ rating, which now accommodates high impact levels of violence. Silent Hill: Homecoming was later released in Australia with altered camera angles for the problem scene, rated MA15+.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What we already know, however, is that Silent Hill f’s RC rating in Australia has actually been assigned by an online tool maintained by the International Age Rating Coalition – which is a classification system designed for mobile and digitally delivered games. The IARC classification tool is an online questionnaire where applicants simply answer a series of questions about a game’s content. The IARC tool will subsequently assign an automated rating from each territory based on the classification standards from each participating country. In Australia's case, the IARC tool then sends the decision to be published automatically on <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/silent-hill-f" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Australia’s National Classification Database.</a></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/24/iarc-1742775870177.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Australia, the tool can only be used for digitally-distributed games (it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/29/major-australian-classification-amendment-passes-senate"><u>adopted in 2014</u></a> due to the fact that, while the Australian Classification Board was rating an average of 755 games per year, over 40,000 games were being released annually on the iOS app store alone at that time). There have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/08/22/no-kingdom-come-deliverance-we-happy-few-are-not-banned-in-australia"><u>a number of instances where automated IARC ratings have demonstrated a tendency to trend higher than human ratings</u></a> from the Classification Board. For example, in 2019 Kingdom Come: Deliverance and We Happy Few were widely reported to have suddenly been banned in Australia when they had not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IARC tool is free to use, which particularly benefits small publishers and developers. Importantly, all physical releases are still required to be rated by the Classification Board itself so, if Silent Hill f is planning to have a physical release in Australia, a submission to the Classification Board was always going to be mandatory, anyhow. The Classification Board itself can override any classification given by the IARC tool if it disagrees with it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Australia, game publishers can either have staff members who are accredited classifiers or authorised assessors. Accredited classifiers are in-house staff who complete training from the Classification Board and can classify games themselves, and their decision will take effect as an official Classification Board decision. Authorised assessors are staff or contractors who have similar training, but their classification decision is limited to a recommendation made to the Australian Classification Board, which must then decide whether to apply it or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, it’s too early to say whether Silent Hill f’s RC rating in Australia will be upheld after further actions or not. It is, however, the first Silent Hill game to get <u>an 18+ rating certification in Japan</u>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.
