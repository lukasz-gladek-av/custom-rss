            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-developers-discuss-the-consoles-tech-and-iwatas-lasting-legacy-on-its-development<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Editor’s note: This interview was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior to </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs"><em>Nintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the United States due to the potential impact of tariffs</em></a><em>. Parts of this interview were edited for clarity.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">After getting hands-on with Nintendo Switch 2 at last week’s reveal in New York, IGN spoke with the hardware leads spearheading the development of Nintendo’s newest console. Kouchi Kawamoto and Takuhiro Dohta from Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning and Development Department, along with Tetusya Sasaki from Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, talked to IGN’s Brian Altano about the technology behind Switch 2, the classic Nintendo handhelds that have inspired them and the impact former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata’s legacy had on the development of the console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Can you talk about the SOC system on a chip the Nintendo Switch 2 was running? Is it Nvidia Tegra? If not, can you reveal which graphics architecture it's based on?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I think you'll find a lot of the details in NVIDIA's information that they've shared.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> One of the notes in the direct suggested to hit 4K in dock mode, upscaling may be required. What kind of upscaling is this system using? Is it using AI upscaling?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I think probably the main kind of easiest upscaling to use is the DLSS that Nvidia provides. So from that standpoint, I guess you could say this AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> That said, we're planning on providing other options of upscaling through software and so ranging from something that uses AI to something that's not. I think you'll see that as time passes. And lastly, I'll add that even though there is upscaling, there's also the option to not upscale and just output natively. So that's also an option that developers can use.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>What about ray tracing? Is that something that your team experimented with?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> Just like DLSS, that's when we're kind of making the graphics of a game. We consider ray tracing as just another tool to do that – it's not that we're going to try to use ray tracing on everything, but really trying to figure out what types of graphics, what types of screens, what types of situations are best suited for ray tracing, and then trying to apply that. That's the approach we took when we did all of our researching and experimenting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> We saw that the switch two supports third party cameras. What about third-party mice?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> You're talking about USB mice, things like that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Yeah, not the animal!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> [Laughs] It really depends on the game software with the structure. So if that software supports third-party USB mice, yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I have a six-year-old daughter. She took my Switch and I don't get to play it anymore. She also has dropped it a lot and it's okay. What have you done with Switch 2 to make sure that it can survive a kid dropping it on the floor or dropping it down the stairs?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo: Nintendo has made very sturdy devices through the ages and I believe that this time around as well, we've made something that will be sturdy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> Yeah, you can drop it a little bit. I don’t recommend it though!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I also have a Steam Deck and I like it, but the fan gets very loud when I'm playing high end games. It's almost distracting. What did Nintendo do to make sure that that was taken into account when designing the hardware for Switch 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> When a fan is loud it really does affect one's gameplay, so that is definitely something we had in the back of our mind during the development of the Nintendo Switch 2. The system is made to adapt depending on the processing capability so I'm kind of curious to hear from the others here what their experience has been like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> When I was playing it it's not like, “Wow, there's a fan in there”. It hasn’t really gotten to the point where, even through development of the hardware, it has bothered me in any way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> The hardware team put quite a lot of effort into making sure the airflow was smooth. So a lot is coming in but there's a lot coming out, and as such the fan noise isn't too significant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Nintendo invented the directional pad and it's been important for video games for my entire life. What did your team do to ensure that the Dpad on the Switch 2 was great for fighting games, puzzle games, platformers, all that fun stuff?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> You may think that every time you see the directional pad that it's just the same button being reused, but the truth is we do make small adjustments and add small changes every time. I have people – our development and game development teams – try them out when we make a new one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> This is a more detailed point but for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller directional buttons, we made it so that it's even more difficult to have mistaken input. Of course, it doesn't completely eliminate that possibility but it should reduce it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I'm a big fan of Nintendo handheld systems and always have been since the original Game Boy. What are each of your personal favorite classic Nintendo handhelds?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I have fond memories for each of the systems that have come out but for me personally, I think the original Game Boy really has a special place in my heart. Part of the reason for that is that since then there's obviously new systems that came out, like the Game Boy Advance for example. But I just distinctly remember my mother with the original Game Boy playing Tetris, and that’s just burned into my memory.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It was Mr. Iwata's concerns about the magnets that meant it didn't come to fruition [for the original Switch]</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Some of you worked with the legendary Satoru Iwata. Is there any specific part of his legacy that inspired the Nintendo Switch 2 design?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> There are various aspects but what comes to mind first is the magnet connector. We originally didn't adopt it for the Nintendo Switch because it wasn't as secure as we would've liked. However, we put a lot of effort into this aspect and that has come to fruition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> It was Mr. Iwata's concerns about the magnets that meant it didn't come to fruition [for the original Switch]. So being able to actually address all of the issues and create something that probably would've met his standards is moving and meaningful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I love it. I think I took the JoyCon on and off 20 times yesterday!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I actually have a question for you. You saw the footage of the JoyCon 2 snapping on and off. Was the impression you got from that footage different from actually snapping it on and off?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Yes. I thought it was going to be like a refrigerator magnet and it was going to be wobbly loose and instead it just goes ‘snap’ and clicks in. And I was like, “Oh, that feels really nice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nintendo:</strong> I'm very relieved to hear that!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Yeah, they told me I had to stop doing it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Brian Altano has been playing Mario Kart for 30+ years, and it's crazy that 10 of those years were spent with Mario Kart 8. We haven't seen Battle Mode for Mario Kart World yet, but he's still holding out hope that Block Fort can come back. Bring back Block Fort!</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a game set to launch alongside the Switch 2 in June that offers a guided tour of the console itself in video game form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is described as a "virtual exhibition" of the new hardware. Per Nintendo: "through tech demos, minigames and other interactions, players will get to know the new system inside and out in ways they may never have known about otherwise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Direct showed footage of a small player avatar exploring a super-sized Switch 2, reading about the different features and facts about the console. It also includes mini-games such as Speed Golf, Dodge the Spiked Balls, and a Maracas Physics Demo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN can now confirm that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-will-be-a-paid-tour-of-your-new-nintendo-switch-2"><u>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</u></a> costs $9.99 and is a digital-only product. That’s significantly cheaper than other Switch 2 games, but IGN has already reported to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-would-you-make-people-pay-for-that-nintendos-decision-to-charge-for-switch-2-tutorial-game-welcome-tour-sparks-backlash">the complaints from some Nintendo fans that Welcome Tour costs money at all</a>, with many saying it should be Switch 2 pack-in, as DualSense tech demo game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astros-playroom-ps5-review"><u>Astro's Playroom</u></a> was for PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN interviewed Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience, Bill Trinen, at a recent Switch 2 preview event in New York, and asked him if Nintendo discussed making Welcome Tour a pack-in game, and why the company made the decision to price it as a separate digital product.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We need to point out here that our interview with Trinen was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior to<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs"> <u>Nintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the U.S. due to the potential impact of tariffs</u></a>, and subsequent concern that Nintendo may raise the price of the console and its games further as a result.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Trinen said there’s more to Welcome Tour than it appears based on the showing during the Nintendo Direct and even during recent hands-on opportunities the media had access to. Based on what’s actually in the game, Nintendo decided $9.99 “is not an exorbitant price,” he continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's an interesting product,” Trinen began. “We're actually getting ready today, we're going to be doing some Nintendo Treehouse Live segments and covering a lot of games in detail. That's one of them. And I think people will be able to see through Treehouse Live probably a little bit more maybe than you were able to see on the show floor. It's a pretty robust piece of software. There's a lot of great detail in there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For some people, I think there are people who are particularly interested in the tech and the specs of the system and things like that, for them I think it's going to be a great product. It's really for people that want more information about the system rather than necessarily a quick intro to everything it does.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And for that reason and just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, 'Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Welcome Tour is of course just one part of Nintendo’s next-gen push to become embroiled in controversy, and we’ve also got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">Trinen’s response to questions surrounding the company’s decision to go for $80 Switch 2 games</a>, as well as going for $450 for the Switch 2 itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen">IGN’s interview with Bill Trinen in full</a> to find out more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The real shock, though, is that Mario Kart World costs $79.99 — $10 higher than the most expensive Nintendo-published game on Switch, Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Nintendo is bundling Mario Kart World with a Nintendo Switch 2 for $499.99, cutting the cost of the game by a huge $30 in the process. However, Nintendo has indicated this bundle is a limited-time offer, and it remains to be seen if the bundle holds at $500, given the uncertainty surrounding the tariff situation and Nintendo’s pre-order delay in the U.S.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Mario Kart World isn’t the only Nintendo Switch 2 game to cost $80 — some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games"><u>Switch 2 Edition games</u></a> announced during the Nintendo Direct also cost $79.99, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world"><u>Kirby and The Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv"><u>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition"><u>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games improve upon their original Switch versions in various ways. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, for example, gain additional support for the Zelda Notes service in the Nintendo Switch App that provides game help. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-are-getting-achievements-on-nintendo-switch-2">They also have achievements on Switch 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has plenty of reaction to Nintendo’s jump to $80 for the Switch 2 generation, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">from analysts who have helped us understand why this has happened</a>. But what does Nintendo have to say about it? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen">IGN interviewed Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience, Bill Trinen</a>, at a recent Switch 2 preview event in New York, to ask about Nintendo’s pricing strategy for Mario Kart World to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We need to point out here that our interview with Trinen was conducted on April 3, 2025, prior to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs"><u>Nintendo’s announcement about delaying Switch 2 pre-orders in the U.S. due to the potential impact of tariffs</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In his response, Trinen insisted Mario Kart world justifies its price tag, and pointed to the upcoming dedicated Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct where fans will learn more about the game and what it has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value?” Trinen said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn’t find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We also asked Trinen about the $80 cost of some of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games. While there is a $10 upgrade path for existing owners of these games on the Switch, and both The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ($69.99) and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ($79.99) are available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, Nintendo is not offering any sort of discount to newcomers on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trinen’s answer here echoed his Mario Kart World response, pointing to the value Nintendo sees in its games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?' " he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you're looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that's the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game. For somebody who has bought Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, the upgrade packs for those are $9.99. And if you happen to be a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack member, both of the Zelda upgrade packs are inclusive within that membership. So there's no additional charge for those.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Trinen is saying here is that Nintendo believes its next-generation push is worth a price hike when you consider what the video games themselves have to offer. And that’s a point echoed by Piers Harding-Rolls, Research Director, Games at Ampere Analysis. He told IGN Nintendo has form when it comes to going high for the cost of its games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo has a bit of a history of pricing games higher than other platforms when coming to the market later than other platforms - in this case PS5 and Xbox Series,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember back in the day N64 titles being more than PS1 titles for example. Some of that is related to cost of goods, but Nintendo also likes to follow its own approach and price based on its own appreciation of value."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the current $450 price tag of the Switch 2 itself, Trinen again pointed to value, but also highlighted the increasing costs associated with releasing a video game console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously the cost of everything goes up over time, and I personally would love if the cost of things didn't go up over time,” he told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I think any time you're building a new system that's got new features and new tech, there's costs associated with that. So again, we look at what is the experience on Nintendo Switch? What's the experience on Nintendo Switch 2? What are the new features that it offers? And certainly there's the cost of goods and things that factor into that, but we try to find the right appropriate price for a product based on that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As IGN has reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-fear-impact-of-tariffs-on-switch-2-price-i-shouldnt-as-an-average-person-be-priced-out-of-this">some Nintendo fans have expressed concern that they may be priced out of the next-generation</a> if the company goes even higher than the already controversial prices for the Switch 2 and its games such as Mario Kart World due to the tariff situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is increasingly clear, however, is that despite calls from the community for Nintendo to drop the price, the Switch 2 and its games are much more likely to get even more expensive than cheaper in the United States.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
