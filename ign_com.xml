            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">After parent company failed to make a loan repayment.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">AA publisher and developer Nacon has filed for insolvency, raising questions over the future of games such as GreedFall 2, Hell is Us, RoboCop, and Test Drive Unlimited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nacon, which is home to 16 development studios as well as a publishing arm, said it was forced into the decision after its majority shareholder, Bigben Interactive, failed to make a loan repayment. It has now asked a French court for permission to restructure its debt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The aim of this procedure is to assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Company's activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework,” Nacon said. This procedure will enable the Company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan.” The Court is expected to make its decision at a hearing in early March.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nacon has a number of AA games under its belt, including GreedFall 2: The Dying World, which will release in its full 1.0 version on March 12. Nacon this week alerted press to its annual showcase event, dubbed Nacon Connect, which was set for March 4. It is expected to show off the likes of Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, The Mound, Edge of Memories, and Endurance Motorsport Series. And just this morning Nacon launched the third major update for Dragonkin: The Banished, which is still in Early Access.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher just released Styx: Blades of Greed last week. RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business came out last year, as did Rogue Factor’s Hell is Us. IGN has asked Nacon for comment on its ability to continue to release its games and maintain and support those it has out already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BBI, which currently holds 56.72% of the share capital and 65.79%% of the voting rights of Nacon, announced last week that it was unable to make a partial repayment of €43 million “due to the unexpected refusal of its banking pool to respond to the drawdown notice.” At the time, Nacon issued a warning to the financial markets, and suspended trading in the company’s shares.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nacon’s hope now is that it gets approval from the court to restructure its debt. If it is successful, its existing liabilities will be frozen for a period that could last up to 18 months. During this time, the debtor will present a continuation plan for its activities by restructuring its debt, hopefully ensuring its recovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

The low visibility brought about by the Hurricane makes it hard to get a good look at the lights, making it seem as though the Raider is watching two groups of drones moving quicker than normal. Watch again, and you’ll see those lights are attached to an enormous ship, gliding through the storm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The AI entity known as the Arc is capable of many things. Drones, death orbs, giant spider-like robots, and more are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to enemy types, but players haven’t seen anything quite like the UFO shown in the clip. Studying it hasn’t been easier either, as only a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdjr0s/arc_ships_soon_in_arc_raiders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>few</u></a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdtzgs/new_cloaked_arc_on_new_event/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>others</u></a> have managed to capture and share their sightings online while developer Embark Studios remains silent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It feels reminiscent of the time game developer Arrowhead Studios launched an update for Helldivers 2 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-just-quietly-added-flying-bugs-ceo-insists-bugs-cant-fly"><u>quietly added flying bug enemies</u></a> without notifying players in its patch notes. As players spun a web of theories, that team denied that such creatures could possibly exist. Now, Embark seems to be following a similar strategy, leaving players to try and piece together what a building-sized UFO could mean for the future of Arc Raiders. Some even believe these sightings could be tied to the new large Arc <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026"><u>teased to arrive with the Riven Tides update this April</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Is that the f***ing mothership???” one player <a href="https://x.com/MartonPiller012/status/2026315685253583170?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>guessed</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No explaining the thing will be murdering people probably in April,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdgkdw/comment/o753bi6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>theorized</u></a>. “Who knows it could be the new ‘large arc threat’ they roadmapped.

In a new interview, Asha Sharma, a Microsoft executive who previously oversaw some of the firm's AI initiatives, kept things frustratingly vague, but did indicate that nothing is off the table when it comes to big decisions about recent controversial policies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Microsoft sent shockwaves throughout the video game industry when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive">it confirmed Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond were leaving Xbox</a>, with Sharma in place as new CEO of its gaming business. Fans are split, with some choosing to believe in the promised "return to Xbox," others expressing concern about the future of Microsoft's gaming business. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-is-being-sunsetted-seamus-blackley-one-of-the-creators-of-xbox-thinks-recent-shakeup-spells-the-end-for-microsofts-gaming-business">Even the ‘father of Xbox’ is worried about what happens next</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big questions fans have for Sharma is whether Microsoft will reverse some of its recent policies, many of which have alienated the core Xbox fanbase. Fans have criticized Microsoft for leaving Xbox game exclusivity behind in favor of a multiplatform approach that has seen the company’s biggest brands — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-for-the-xbox-exclusive-but-in-truth-the-ps5-version-comes-as-no-surprise">including Halo</a> — make the jump to PlayStation.

About the 'why' of these decisions, what we were optimizing for, and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That's the honest answer. I'm looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan's the plan until it's not the plan."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does that mean? It’s hard to tell. It feels like a holding statement, the kind of thing you might say when you don’t want to commit to anything either way. But it’s hard to see Microsoft all of a sudden pulling out of multiplatform game releases, especially when its studios have put so much effort into making Microsoft's policy a reality, and in some cases seen great success on the likes of PlayStation. Halo is coming to PlayStation this year, and that’s unlikely to change.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/xbox-1772003073393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Microsoft's new gaming boss Asha Sharma.

Information about playable pianos and beard cosmetics was all there, but what they also found was that the studio behind the massively popular multiplayer game had upped the crafting requirements for one of its most iconic tools: the Wolfpack.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/24/arc-raiders-wolfpack-requirements-1771970287801.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Wolfpack now requires one Rocketeer Driver to craft. Image captured in-game by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As outlined in Shrouded Sky’s accompanying patch notes, the Wolfpack, a throwable equipment that showers Arc enemies with homing explosives, now requires one Rocketeer Driver to craft. Now, players will need the component, as well as two Arc motion cores and an explosive compound, to make just one Wolfpack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The changes fall in line with a series of new adjustments to resource requirements, which see Arc components also added to the recipes for the Deadline mine, Trailblazer, Showstopper, and Vita Spray. It’s the Wolfpack tweak that has Raiders up in arms, though, mostly because Rocketeer Drivers are infamously rare and hard to collect. The most consistent way to find one of these epic items is to kill a Rocketeer – a task that currently takes two Wolfpacks to accomplish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rditsw/hot_take_wolfpacks_were_too_easy_to_craft_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some believe the change is understandable considering the previous recipe asked relatively little from players</a>, much of the community online has already started voicing their concerns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Let me just kill a rocketeer to get 1 wolfpack that can half kill another rocketeer,” one Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdd2f7/comment/o746rwv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t even want the blueprint anymore,” another player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74jteq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First time I’ve said this but if they keep going in this direction people will stop playing,” a X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/gmanskiyoutube/status/2026377384056725559?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. “It’s hard enough to gather some of these resources.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Doesn’t quite add up <a href="https://t.co/1KLOMIWnQe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1KLOMIWnQe</a></p>— ARC Central (@TheARCcentral) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheARCcentral/status/2026389327081578664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 24, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The grenade can’t lock on to other players but can tear through hordes of small Arc, making it one of the best PvE tools Raiders have at their disposal. It can also quickly dismantle the armor featured on large Arc, such as the Matriarch, Queen, Leaper, and Bastion, but it’s the math asking players for two Wolfpacks to kill one Rocketeer that has fans questioning Embark's judgement. While showing concern about how update 1.17.0 asks players to work harder for crafting materials, some have started chiming in with their own recommendations for how to fix the issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If rocketeers start consistently dropping more than 1x driver, we can talk,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74eo6f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They need to up the drop odds on drivers,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74ffry/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. “Right now you’re lucky if you get two. Make two the base with higher odds of 3+. Otherwise wolfpacks will basically just be used when looted on the map.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players are asking for more rewarding Rocketeer loot and reduced requirements for the Wolfpack, but others are still exploring all Shrouded Sky has to offer. The February update launched today, focusing on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embark-shows-off-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-with-first-look-at-two-new-threatsand-beards"><u>map changes for Dam Battlegrounds and the new Firefly and Comet Arc threats</u></a> as its latest additions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund shared more about how the studio plans to continue building on Arc Raiders in the months ahead during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> earlier this month.
