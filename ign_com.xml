            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-failed-to-resonate-with-a-broad-audience-gamers-increasingly-want-shared-world-features<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA CEO Andrew Wilson has commented on the financial failure of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, saying it failed to "resonate with a broad enough audience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams"><u>EA restructured Dragon Age developer BioWare to focus on Mass Effect 5 only</u></a>, meaning some who worked on The Veilguard were moved to projects at other EA studios, while other staff were laid off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The decision followed EA’s announcement that Dragon Age: The Veilguard had underperformed on its expectations for the long-awaited action RPG. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-15-million-players-in-first-two-months-ea-expected-3-million"><u>EA said Dragon Age "engaged" 1.5 million players</u></a> during its recent financial quarter, which was down nearly 50% from the company's projections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade"><u>chronicled some of Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s development challenges</u></a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs"><u>layoffs</u></a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-4-creative-director-left-bioware"><u>departure</u></a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-casey-hudson-mark-darrah-to-leave-studio-all-current-projects-planned-to-continue"><u>several project leads</u></a> at different stages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lh2qmeuwuc2p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>According to Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier</u></a>, BioWare staff believe it was a miracle Dragon Age: The Veilguard released a complete game “after EA forced live-service into it, then reversed course.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking in an investor-focused financial call, Wilson suggested its role-playing games need to have “shared-world features and deeper engagement alongside high-quality narratives.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In order to break out beyond the core audience, games need to directly connect to the evolving demands of players who increasingly seek shared-world features and deeper engagement alongside high-quality narratives in this beloved category,” Wilson said in prepared remarks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Dragon Age had a high-quality launch and was well-reviewed by critics and those who played. However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reading between the lines, Wilson is suggesting that if Dragon Age: The Veilguard had “shared-world features" and “deeper engagement,” it might have sold more copies. But it’s hard to understand that position when you consider EA backed BioWare’s major reset of Dragon Age. As IGN has reported, this reboot saw Dragon Age shift from the skeleton of a multiplayer game with repeatable quests, a tech base, and the outline of a story, to a full-blown single-player RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are already saying EA has learnt the wrong lessons from Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and are pointing to the enormous success of single-player only RPGs that have been released recently, including Larian’s all-conquering Baldur’s Gate 3. Either way, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-dragon-age-fans-fear-the-death-of-the-series-one-former-bioware-developer-offers-words-of-reassurance-dragon-age-isnt-dead-because-its-yours-now">it seems Dragon Age is now dead</a>, at least for the foreseeable future. But what does this all mean for Mass Effect 5?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA CFO Stuart Canfield touched on EA’s decision to restructure BioWare to focus on the next Mass Effect, which has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dev-bioware-reportedly-down-to-fewer-than-100-employees-following-layoffs-and-staff-exits">reportedly involved cutting the 200-person studio down to less than 100 people</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Historically, blockbuster storytelling has been the primary way our industry bought beloved IP to players,” Canfield said. “The game's financial performance highlights the evolving industry landscape and reinforces the importance of our actions to reallocate resources towards our most significant and highest potential opportunities.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that single-player only games make up a tiny portion of EA’s overall revenue. The bulk of the company’s cash comes from live service (74% in the last 12 months). Ultimate Team is doing the heavy lifting here, but there are live service contributions from everything from Apex Legends to The Sims. The upcoming Skate is a live service, and the next Battlefield will inevitably be treated as such, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

This month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/immortals-of-aveum">Immortals of Aveum</a> headlines the bundle, with seven other games like Total War: Pharoah Dynasties, Fabledom, and more included. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars to grab these games individually, you can get all eight games for just $11.99 at Humble Bundle for this month only.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Humble Choice Games for February 2025</h2><div catalogid="0687e5ea-609a-4b6c-9fb6-791577e0cc24" id="214728"><div id="214728" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Humble Choice - February 2025</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Immortals of Aveum</li><li>Trepang2</li><li>Total War: Pharoah Dynasties</li><li>Fabledom</li><li>Griftlands</li><li>Tales &amp; Tactics</li><li>Naheulbeuk's Dungeon Master</li><li>My Little Universe</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Each month, Humble Choice curates a selection of games for members to redeem. These games are sent as Steam codes, which are yours to keep forever. You can even send them to a friend if you already have the game or want to gift one! For February, Immortals of Aveum is well worth the price of this package alone, receiving <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/immortals-of-aveum-review">an 8/10 in our review</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Immortals of Aveum is an impressively confident first-person shooter that successfully trades muzzles and magazines for mages and magic. Its fast-paced, spellcasting combat is both satisfying to master and spectacular to look at, and it features a lengthy and hearty campaign packed with secrets to keep us going well after the story has wrapped. As someone who desperately hopes that unapologetically single-player shooters will live forever, these Immortals have done a great job of making sure they’re definitely not dead yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these games, you can also score up to 20% off select games on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Store</a>. The longer that you have an active subscription, the more rewards you can unlock. 5% of each Humble Choice purchase also supports a charity that rotates monthly, with February's supporting United Negro College Fund, an organization that works to increase the total annual number of African American college graduates. Don't miss out on this month's Humble Choice selection!</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Feb 4, 2025 10:15 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While that does mean there are only a few tangible additions, such as that new island and fruit, the team made sure to include a solid group of balance adjustments to help keep its swashbuckling Roblox experience smooth across the board.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/04/grand-piece-online-mini-update-1738634012107.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Piece Online February mini update adds new island, fruit, and balance changes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can find Turtleback Cave north of Rose Kingdom in the Second Sea. Those who make the trek will find a new boss: Juzo the Diamondback. Defeating the enemy rewards players with the Turtleback Armor and Turtleback Helmet, with kills also including a 5% chance to drop the Kira fruit and a lower chance to drop a Mythical Fruit Chest. There’s also a new player list that shows crew and player names, as well as a list of crew adjustments, which include five new crew shop items, eight total crew shop slots, and the option to purchase current and out-of-rotation battle pass outfits from the crew shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for those Grand Piece Online balance tweaks, players will find that Arena Storm has been removed in favor of a new countdown system. The change will see winners determined by damage dealt and stocks remaining at the end of the countdown. There have also been adjustments to Tori, Pteranodon, Buddha, Venom, Yuki, Gold, Zushi, and many more, as Grand Quest Games aims to level the playing field.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Piece Online launched all the way back in 2018, and although the patch does fall under the “mini update” category, it shows the team is still going strong as it sails into 2025. The last notable update brought Water and Travel changes on January 17, so while there is no date regarding when players can expect to see the next update run aground, we likely won’t have to wait too long for more news.
