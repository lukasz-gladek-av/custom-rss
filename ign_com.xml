            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Rock Band 4 DLC will also begin to vanish, fate of legacy DLC will be figured out over the coming months.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rock Band 4 is being delisted from both the Xbox and PlayStation digital stores this weekend due to expiring lusic licenses, developer Harmonix has confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news was posted across the game's official Discord channel and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rockband/comments/1nv83uo/rock_band_4_game_and_dlc_delisting_information/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its subreddit</a>. The warning has come with just days to act, and arrives on the eve of the game's 10th anniversary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"On Sunday, October 5, 2025, Rock Band 4 turns 10," reads the team's statement. "What a ride it's been."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this milestone comes one big change: the original licenses for the core soundtrack are expiring. Because of that, Rock Band 4 will be removed from the PlayStation and Xbox digital stores. If you already own the game, nothing changes â€” you'll keep full access and still be able to download the game and songs to any new, compatible devices. The same applies to Downloadable Content (DLC): songs will come down as they hit the 10-year mark, but anything you've purchased will remain in your library.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're so grateful for the passion this community has shown. From the team, it's been a special experience to serve you with Rivals challenges, a super deep DLC library and a best in class band sim. If you've been meaning to grab a few last songs, now's the time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of Sunday, Rock Band 4 and the Rock Band 4 DLC songs that were specifically released on its launch day will no longer be available to purchase. It has been clarified on Discord that DLC tracks from <em>prior </em>Rock Band games (released before Rock Band 4) are not being delisted "yet", but the team "will be figuring those out over the coming months."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rock Band's unique approach to DLC has resulted in the ability for owners to carry their libraries of songs (plus exports of the tracklists of past Rock Band games) across three generations of console hardware. The approach has seen thousands of pieces of bespoke DLC released for the series since 2007, almost all of which can be played within Rock Band 4. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last DLC of the Rock Band 4 era was released in January 2024, after eight years of weekly content. The news that the axe is now looming for all Rock Band content, however, marks a sad moment in the history of the 18-year-old series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.
