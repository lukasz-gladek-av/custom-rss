Leadership from both Crystal and The Initiative spent the following two months looking for a new publisher and funding source. While multiple parties expressed interest, the most likely candidate turned out to be Take-Two interactive.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty players have a welcome surprise today after Activision handed out a whopping 20 free battle pass tier skips to Warzone and Black Ops 6 players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a social media post, below, Activision said the free handout was ‚Äúin celebration‚Äù of the Black Ops 7 reveal. But Call of Duty fans are entirely more sceptical, based on the replies to the social media announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Comments include everything from the typical ‚Äúdead game‚Äù accusations having sparked the generous offer to convince lapsed players to return to the game, to pressure from Battlefield 6 forcing Activision into more pro-consumer behavior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a degree of frustration from some who had just spent money to unlock tier skips before this announcement. And there are of course plenty of fans who are just happy to get free stuff.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Has the player retention been THAT bad this season üò≠üôè</p>‚Äî Reality (@realityuk) <a href="https://twitter.com/realityuk/status/1962925067198660998?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, Activision has handed out free tier skips and XP tokens before. Indeed, around this time last year it gave 10 tier skips and 20 XP tokens to players who downloaded last year's Season 5 Reloaded update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the case, this year's Season 05 Reloaded launches on September 4. It adds a new Multiplayer map, new and returning modes, new armaments, events, Reckoning Directed Mode in Zombies, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-season-05-reloaded" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Activision warned that the Season 5 Reloaded download will be larger on some platforms, and blamed it on ‚Äúreorganizing‚Äù Call of Duty content to prepare for the Black Ops 7 beta on October 2. Does that mean Call of Duty's infamous file size will shrink for this year's game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a ‚Äúthank you‚Äù for downloading the update (how big is it going to be?!), Activision is gifting players a pack of 2XP Tokens across all platforms. Players who complete the download and log into Call of Duty from 10am PT on September 4 until October 1 will receive:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Five 1-Hour Double Player XP Tokens (5 hours total)</li><li>Five 1-Hour Double Weapon XP Tokens (5 hours total)</li><li>Five 1-Hour Double Battle Pass XP Tokens (5 hours total)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">There‚Äôs a lot happening in the world of Call of Duty.
