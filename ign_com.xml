This year's event certainly didn't disappoint, as we got glimpses of a wide range of upcoming products, ranging from less than $20 to over $1500. What can we say? Being a Star Wars collector is nothing if not an expensive hobby. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From Sideshow's epic Luke Skywalker Red 5 statue to Hasbro's nostalgia-heavy Episode III figures to Hot Toys' mind-bogglingly detailed Jar Jar Binks figure, these were the coolest figures and collectibles revealed during Star Wars Day 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hot Toys' Star Wars Figures</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hot Toys' Star Wars Day 2025 Figure Reveals - Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot Toys revealed quite the impressive lineup of 1:6 scale figures for Star Wars Day, including a couple of major characters who have surprisingly never gotten the Hot Toys treatment before now. The real surprise is definitely<a href="https://zdcs.link/av4eXq?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> the Jar Jar Binks figure</a>. Love him or hate him, there's no denying that this Jar Jar looks like he walked right off the screen. He's even got seamless arm joints and two swappable face sculpts for recreating all those wacky poses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot Toys is also filling a glaring hole in the Sequel Trilogy lineup by finally releasing <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXO73?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a Poe Dameron figure</a>. Fittingly, Poe is wearing his Resistance X-Wing jumpsuit. We're also getting another of the fan-favorite Republic Commandos in the form of Clone Commando Boss, and the company's new Star Wars Rebels-inspired line of animated figures is getting <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqw2Xq?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a Darth Vader</a> to accompany the previously announced Stormtrooper figures.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hasbro's Star Wars Toys</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hasbro's Star Wars Day 2025 Figures - Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro revealed a number of new figures in both the 6-inch Black Series line and 3 3/4-inch Vintage Collection line. Hasbro continues to capitalize on the 20th anniversary of Revenge of the Sith by releasing new Black Series figures in packaging based on the classic RotS toy line. Next up are Aayla Secura and a Magnaguard droid. Black Series collectors can also augment their Imperial trooper collections with a Rogue One-themed 2-pack that includes both a Shoretrooper and a Death Trooper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Vintage Collection front, Hasbro has a couple very interesting multi-pack releases in the works. The "Stormtroopers of the Empire 3-Pack" features a Snowtrooper, Scouttrooper and a Sandtrooper. The "Cantina Adventure 4-Pack" includes four aliens from the iconic Mos Eisley sequence, including Hammerhead, Walrus Man, Greedo, and Snaggletooth. It should go great with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hasbro-reveals-massive-mos-eisley-cantina-playset-for-hardcore-collectors">Hasbro's crowdfunded Mos Eisley Cantina playset</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Star Wars prop collectors will be happy to know that a new ForceFX Elite lightsaber based on the weapon used by Rebels' star Ezra Bridger is in the works. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sideshow's Star Wars Figures and Posters</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sideshow Collectibles' Star Wars Day 2025 Reveals - Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not to be outdone,. Sideshow Collectibles had a wide lineup of figures, statues, and art prints to reveal. Undoubtedly the showpiece of their Star Wars Day lineup is <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbMOG?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Luke Skywalker: Red Five, Standing By Premium Format Figure</a>. This massive 1:4 scale, mixed media statue features Luke decked out in his X-Wing jumpsuit and climbing up the ladder to his trusty ship. What really makes this piece special (and especially expensive) is that Sideshow went to the trouble of actually sculpting a portion of the X-Wing so that it hangs in mid-air.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sideshow is also continuing to release 1:6 scale figures alongside distributing Hot Toys' releases. Sideshow is focusing on its "Scum and Villainy" line, which highlights the many aliens and creatures that don't necessarily receive attention from Hot Toys. The second wave of Scum and Villainy figures is focused on characters from Jabba's Palace in Return of the Jedi, like Bib Fortuna, Klaatu, and Vizam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Sideshow showed off the latest 1:10 statue from Iron Studios, which happens to be <a href="https://zdcs.link/akK2Rg?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a shrunken-down version of their 1:4 scale Darth Vader statue</a>. This Empire Strikes Back-inspired piece still looks mighty cool in the new, smaller scale. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let us know in the comments below what your favorite Star Wars Day 2025 reveal was, and why it's Hot Toys Jar Jar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more Star Wars collecting fun, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-action-figure-buying-guide">our ultimate guide to Star Wars figures</a>, and check out <a href="https://store.ign.com/collections/star-wars-collection?srsltid=AfmBOoq2K47zHS8E-dixwmL2QU3V17lhK9-dv5HG8_tj5Haha876zuN-" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the many Star Wars Collectibles available on the IGN Store</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.
