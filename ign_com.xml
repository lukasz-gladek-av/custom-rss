            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-creator-says-its-time-for-aaa-studios-to-move-away-from-safe-bets<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The 15-person team behind Tales of Kenzera: ZAU was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-team-put-on-redundancy-notice-amid-funding-struggles"><u>recently put on notice</u></a>, following struggles to find funding for their next project. But Surgent Studios isn’t shutting down, its staff aren’t gone forever, and it’s not asleep at the wheel, according to its founder, Abubakar Salim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They are, he says, “literally raring” to go the second money comes in, like a “cocked gun.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We still have so much more to say and so much more to build on,” Salim tells IGN. “And the audiences that we've already started to build as well, and the players and the people who want to champion us, they want to hear more…We are ready. We're so ready. It is just about taking that leap of faith with us.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Leap of Faith</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So what’s the leap of faith? It’s called Project Uso, and it’s a single-player, isometric, Afro-gothic action RPG. You play as a vampiric android containing the spirit of Eshu, the Yoruba god of chaos. As Salim explains, the idea is to explore the idea of two minds in one body through the mechanics of tabletop RPGs. But rather than rolling against a dungeon master, in Project Uso, the player sometimes must roll against themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Uso is about the concept of identity, with Uso meaning “face” in Swahili. It’s inspired by Salim’s exploration of his own dual nature in the wake of his daughter’s birth. While ZAU was about who he is <em>without</em> a parent, Salim says that Uso is about asking who he is <em>as</em> a parent.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Project Uso Early Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a parent, I always used to find myself being like, I love my daughter, cleaning her dirty nappy. I also want to go see my mates to the cinema, go outside with my mates or whatever. You know what I mean? There's a battle of freedoms here. And there's that sense of, do I do this or do I do that? Or even when I'm talking to my daughter and I'm making choices, how do I make sure that she listens to me? Am I strict or am I soft? You are having this battle within you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Salim is candid that he’s relatively new to game development. Tales of Kenzera: ZAU was the first game he’s made, having come into the industry from acting. He’s best known in gaming spaces as Bayek in Assassin’s Creed: Origins, and has held a number of other gaming roles since then in addition to his numerous film and TV acting credits (including the most recent season of House of the Dragon). But the last four years of working on ZAU have been a learning experience for him, particularly in how games are typically funded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I've learned is that mainly when you get funding for a game, that funding is really there to get you to launch and maybe just a bit more after,” he says. “Maybe. And you are supposed to have your next project turned up and done and signed either before you've even launched the first game or maybe just afterwards. That gap in between is frightening because you can see that coming like a train.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The way that you entice people to go to somewhere different and somewhere new is by doing something different or something new.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this, he explains. While gaming companies briefly poured funding into new projects, there’s been an industry-wide wake-up call in the last two years resultings in mass layoffs, financial struggles, and funding drying up. As a result, Salim explains that companies have become far more cautious in the bets they’re willing to make on new games. That includes EA, whose EA Originals label published Tales of Kenzera: ZAU but which hasn’t picked up Salim’s next project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Salim says he understands, but doesn’t agree that it’s the best strategy. On the contrary, he thinks now is the time for companies to take risks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Why would I, as a player of Call of Duty or as Fortnite, want to leave that to go to something new when I've already established myself in this space?” he says. “I totally understand that. It's like going to your favorite cafe or going to your favorite restaurant. The way that you entice people to go to somewhere different and somewhere new is by doing something different or something new, by being bold, by being creative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think a great example of this is Animal Well. You look at Animal Well and it's completely unexpected. You didn't know what you were getting into. And that was a risk that was taken by a YouTuber. I think we need to see more of that from people in positions of power and in positions of stability.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bouncing Back</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Surgent Studios and Salim have had a rough time finding funding for Project Uso, but there’s been another layer to their struggles: harassment. Tales of Kenzera: ZAU has found itself the target of ongoing, racist attacks online, largely targeting the game for its Black protagonist and its Bantu inspirations. But none of this has discouraged Salim from pitching Project Uso. On the contrary, he’s of the belief that it’s important to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-director-addresses-constant-targeted-harassment-lowers-price-of-game-on-switch"><u>address such attacks directly</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think that the anti-diversity, equity, inclusion sort of movement, it's about not having the right information,” he says. “I think we are seeing a lot of gaps being filled with conspiracy theories, like ticking boxes and all this sort of stuff, which isn't actually true when you look into it. And that dialogue needs to happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Salim acknowledges that directly speaking with harassers can be dangerous, and isn’t for everyone. Both parties, he says, have to come to the discussion in good faith, and harassers often don’t. But he believes such engagement can change hearts and minds, and is worth doing for those able. And on a higher level, he adds, companies have a responsibility to take even firmer action against harassment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“There is definitely a fear of having a stance, I feel, when it comes to businesses. They kind of want to be neutral, which again, totally understand. But there is a level where it goes a bit too far…We're in a time right now where someone can post a YouTube video and say my garb is like a Rafiki outfit and call my studio Spear-Chucker Studios, and I don't know whether there's going to be repercussions or not. I have to call them out on it. And it's like, come on. It should be down to the [company], be it YouTube, or be it Twitch, or be it even Valve, for example, to be like, ‘Yeah, that's not cool. Get out.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Surgent Studios is currently in a holding pattern with Project Uso, Salim has faith that the industry will bounce back from its rough patch, and he’ll bounce back with them. He believes that while video games are both art and business, they are art first and foremost, and “the arts always survive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The beauty though, about games, I feel, is that the conversation and dialogue is a lot more open,” he says. “And so I feel that bouncing back can happen sooner and bolder and more brilliant than any other art form. And that's what gets me, that's what inspires me. That's what kind of drives me to continue going on even after everything that's happened. Because it's a beautiful space to be in. It really is. And don't get me wrong, the amount of times I've wanted to be like, ‘I should just stay as an actor, man. I'm in a big TV show. I should just be really comfortable here and just doing my thing here.’ But there is something inside me that just says, ‘Nah, man, I wouldn't be happy. That's just not enough.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-unlimited-finally-suspends-boba-fett-leader-basically-because-it-was-completely-broken<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Stick that in your bacta tank.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fantasy Flight Games has finally suspended the Boba Fett, Collecting the Bounty leader from the Star Wars Unlimited trading card game, basically because it was completely broken.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boba Fett is no longer a legal card to use in the leading Star Wars Unlimited format, Premier, as of tomorrow, November 8. It can't be used in Competitive or Casual organized play events, though will still appear in Twin Suns, Draft, and Sealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suspension comes exactly eight months after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-star-wars-unlimited-release-date">Star Wars Unlimited was released</a>, as Boba Fett debuted in the original set Sparks of Hope. Lead game designer Danny Schaefer said in a lengthy <a href="https://starwarsunlimited.com/articles/a-leader-suspended" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> that "the dominance of Boba Fett" is now "too much to ignore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaders are the main piece Star Wars Unlimited players build their decks around and Boba Fett was almost immediately discovered to be incredibly overpowered, a poor advertisement for a trading card game in just its first set.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The dominance of Boba Fett is too much to ignore.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fantasy Flight Games endured through a secondary set release but Boba Fett's dominance continued, representing 40% of Top 8 decks at the Planetary Qualifiers and a staggering 55% of winners. This comes in a game which has 32 total leaders (before the third set adds another 18 tomorrow), meaning Boba Fett should represent just 3% or 4% of the winners if everything was balanced well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boba Fett was banned altogether because it's "clean and easy to understand; it’s timely, in that we can take immediate action when problems arise; and it’s precise, allowing us to target only the most problematic cards without collateral damage elsewhere," Schaefer said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He called the card "the most severe power level outlier" and said a ban of supporting cards instead wouldn't work becasue Boba Fett is powerful enough to dominate with their replacements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Unlimited players quickly noticed the huge power disparity in Boba Fett. Like Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, and several other trading card games, Star Wars Unlimited relies on mana generation and management.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means players slowly amass an increasingly large pool of mana over the course of the game, using it to play more and more powerful cards. Any card that can generate extra mana or recover used mana is therefore incredibly powerful, and Boba Fett did just that.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/07/boba-1730998151694.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all though, as Boba Fett could be deployed with just five mana himself despite having high stats more equitable to a leader that deployed at six resources. Boba Fett is also the only hero to have multiple support cards designed to work with it specifically, with cards such as Fire Spray and Boba Fett's armor boosting it even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Unlimited players will therefore have mixed feelings about its banning. Many, if not most, competitive players will have lost their main deck, but many others will be relieved the meta will balance out a touch by Boba Fett's banning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The competitive scene will also enjoy a boost through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-unlimited-tcgs-twilight-of-the-republic-decks-spotlight-ahsoka-and-general-grievous">the release of the aforementioned third set, Twilight of the Republic</a>, which brings new heroes such as Ahsoka from The Clone Wars and General Grievous from Star Wars: Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-unlimited-card-game-review">In our 7/10 review of the base game</a>, IGN said: "Star Wars Unlimited delivers a solid core game, with plenty of opportunities to look at deck building strategy and in-game tactics."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Act 3 in particular, with its dense city area filled with NPCs, caused the game’s framerate to struggle. Performance has improved with various updates, but clearly the PS5 Pro will be the platform of choice when it comes to console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Baldur’s Gate 3’s PS5 Pro update is a “quick” multiplayer fix, detailed in the patch notes below:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Baldur’s Gate 3 PS5 Pro patch and multiplayer fix:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IMPROVEMENTS</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>On PS5 Pro, Quality mode now runs at native 4K (2160p) 30fps.</li><li>On PS5 Pro, Performance mode will upscale from 1440p to 2160p 60fps.</li><li>Split screen on the PS5 Pro will now offer either 30fps or 60fps depending on whether you’re using Quality or Performance mode.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>CRASHES AND BLOCKERS</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue on PS5 preventing you from downloading or subscribing to mods when loading into another player's multiplayer game with mods enabled.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian has of course said it’s moving on from Baldur’s Gate and the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons to develop something entirely new.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After admitting its video games business “is substantially underperforming its potential right now,” Warner Bros. has said it plans to double down on four key titles, namechecking Batman in particular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2024 has been a brutal year for Warner Bros. Games, with Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure sparking a $200 million hit to revenue, and then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business">Smash Bros.-style brawler MultiVersus flopping to the tune of $100 million</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a total writedown of over $300 million in Warner Bros.’ games business so far in 2024, and it doesn’t look like the company has a game coming out any time soon that will reverse the trend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s the plan? During a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, the company plans to double down on just four titles, and significantly reduce the number of video games it releases in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those games are Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC “in particular Batman,” Zaslav added.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Batman: Arkham Shadow Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re through some of the worst — and it hasn't been pretty on the gaming business — but we have four games that are really powerful and have a real constituency that love them, and we’re going to focus on those four primarily,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re going to go away from trying to launch 10, 12, 15, 20 different games. I think we have a real chance now with focus to have the gaming business be steadier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have four strong and profitable game franchises with loyal, global fans: Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC in particular Batman. We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The obvious highlight there is Batman. Controversial live service looter shooter Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure was in part due to it not being yet another single-player Batman Arkham game, which developer Rocksteady is best-known for. Warner Bros. Games just released a VR-exclusive Batman Arkham game. Could Rocksteady now be set to return to Batman after Suicide Squad’s struggles?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> reported that staff at Rocksteady were currently working on a director’s cut of the phenomenally successful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy"><u>Hogwarts Legacy</u></a>, while leadership pitches a return to single-player following its live service misstep. Could that pitch have involved Batman, and been successful?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be some time before we find out. In the shorter term, Warner Bros. has confirmed development on a Hogwarts Legacy sequel and it has a Wonder Woman game in the works at Monolith Productions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetherRealm’s Mortal Kombat 1 released in September last year, and fans are wondering what it’s up to next. In September, NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago">the studio had decided on its next game three years ago</a>, but insisted it was “still fully committed to supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come.” Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor owner and publisher Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
