While we said it has "awesome worldbuilding and stellar character writing", it also "plays it quite safe with a by-the-numbers fantasy adventure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Avowed's move to PlayStation is part of a larger trend of Xbox releasing its first-party games on its competitor platform, including recently Forza Horizon 5, Doom: The Dark Ages, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and even Halo.. It's a strategy that seems to be working for them okay in some respects - in one quarter of last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/6-of-the-10-best-selling-games-on-playstation-last-quarter-in-the-us-were-published-by-microsoft">six of the ten best-selling games on PlayStation were Xbox-published</a>. And its leadership has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-idea-of-locking-it-to-one-store-or-one-device-is-antiquated-for-most-people-xbox-president-says-microsoft-is-seeing-players-evolve-way-past-big-blockbuster-exclusive-games">publicly embraced the idea</a> that consumers find platform exclusivity to be "antiquated."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will this strategy serve them well as hardware prices skyrocket and players gravitate more toward forever games? We took a stab at guessing how Xbox's 2026 will go, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-xbox-in-2026">you can read those predictions here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios says it ‘should do a lot more’ with trading in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a>, but some players are worried about how a potential in-game market might affect the experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CEO Patrick Söderlund expressed interest in a more robust trade feature for the popular extraction shooter during a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesBeat</u></a>. The chat, which took place during an Arc Raiders session that lasted nearly two hours, saw the studio head touch on everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-arc-raiders-movie-and-tv-show-offers-are-already-coming-in-and-the-boss-of-embark-studios-sounds-up-for-it"><u>movie deals</u></a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-confirms-it-recently-added-aggression-based-matchmaking-but-its-not-a-full-science"><u>aggression-based matchmaking</u></a>, but it’s the topic of trading that managed to get the community riled up.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">keep it out. there’s no need for trading. All it will encourage is RMT or cheater services. leave out any type of player developed economy. Pls</p>— 𝖘𝖍𝖆𝖜𝖓 (@shawnsafk) <a href="https://twitter.com/shawnsafk/status/1985232848094138650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re going to want to do more [with trading] because it’s fun. It’s a good part of the game,” Söderlund teased. “I agree: We should do a lot more of the trading component in the game, and also allow people to trade amongst each other, etc. I think it’s fun. It’s something that we absolutely have to look at long term.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although some players have found their own ways to swap weapons and other rare loot between each other, proper trading support is largely absent from Arc Raiders. While Embark is interested in changing that, portions of the community aren’t thrilled about how something like an in-game marketplace, or even auctions, could impact the sci-fi shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Söderlund’s comments made their way to the internet, so, too, did posts from users concerned that trading could take away from the thrill of extracting. For these players, it’s a matter of keeping the fundamental Arc Raiders gameplay loop intact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The entire point of this game is to find loot and extract safely with it,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q4r1as/that_ceo_gameplayinterview/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user explained</u></a>. “If you add a system where people can stockpile coins and then purchase everything without any risk, what is the point? Where will be that moment where you find something you're looking for and rush to an extract on the edge of your seat?”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I hope they won’t add a player to player trading system,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q6kwqk/we_dont_need_a_player_tradin_g_system_pls_dont_do/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another added</u></a>. “There is no need for that. All we need is nice events, new content/maps once in a while and a fix for micro stutters. Love the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fear of a fleshed-out trade system for Arc Raiders also seems to stem from those who believe players will simply be able to purchase any weapon or item they want. Some Escape from Tarkov fans have also stepped in to warn of how they feel trading affected that game, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q4r1as/comment/nxunt59/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one player saying</u></a>, “Once trading is added, everything turns into a dollar value and that’s all that matters.” Others question how additional trade support would even work in Arc Raiders in its current form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What the hell am I supposed to trade with people?” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q7e9oc/comment/nyeytog/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>post asks</u></a>. “Reset was 3 weeks ago and I have pretty much everything again. There's not nearly enough loot in this game for a trading system to work. Unless they introduce items with random attributes, like in Warframe or Diablo, which would destroy balance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a section of the Arc Raiders player base concerned about trading, but there are also those who believe slight changes for player-to-player exchanges could actually improve the experience. Some have already organized trading services outside of the game itself, with others believing that an in-game system, if done right, could encourage the more casual fans to stick around.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders Cold Snap Update Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, players should note Embark has far from confirmed that official Arc Raiders trading additions are on the way, nor has it explained what shape something like that could take.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s nothing that we’ve decided yet, but that’s the fun part of building something like this: This is really the start of something,” Söderlund added. “We believe that there’s so many things that we can look into and do and add to the game. It’s fun.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that the holidays have come to an end, Arc Raiders is gearing up for 2026. Today, Embark <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters"><u>outlined its plan to tackle cheaters</u></a> after fans and streamers began publicly voicing their concerns online. The studio is also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-looking-into-balance-updates-for-trigger-nade-stitcher-and-more-after-holiday-delays"><u>looking into balance updates</u></a>, with a new patch set to roll out soon, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-isnt-about-shooting-other-players-arc-raiders-dev-explains-why-it-wont-add-additional-pvp-mechanics-like-leaderboards"><u>don’t expect any leaderboards</u></a> to make their way into the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-fans-are-trying-to-solve-a-three-year-old-arg-that-may-give-clues-to-a-beloved-characters-fate</link>
            <guid>1401091</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey, fellow Undertale and Deltarune fan. Did you know there was a Deltarune ARG going on? Did you know it's technically been going on for three years now? Yeah, neither did I!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I first learned about the Deltarune ARG (Alternate Reality Game) earlier this week, when a video about it surfaced in my YouTube recommendations. I started out just mildly curious, but I quickly fell down a rabbit hole that had me digging through massive spreadsheets, scouring Reddit threads, and pouring over weird corners of the official Deltarune website. And now, I'm going to infect you with it too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In order to fully unpack the entire ARG in a way that covers every little bit of what's happened and what it could mean, I would have to spoil all four chapters of Deltarune, probably some bits of Undertale, and dive into a deep, deep, <em>deep </em>pit of Deltarune fan theories. So I'm going to try to keep the explanation as high level as is possible while still making sense. But as a warning ahead of time: <strong>this will contain spoilers for Chapters 1 and 2 of Deltarune, especially the "Weird Route", and some very light allusions to characters and events in Chapters 3 and 4. Read on at your own risk:</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Deltarune ARG actually began in September 2022, during an event called the <a href="https://deltarune.com/sweepstakes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spamton Sweepstakes</a> celebrating Undertale's seventh anniversary, which raised money for the charity Child's Play. Most of the event was fun, silly, and non-ARG-related, themed around the eccentric Chapter 2 character Spamton and including a lot of fun new merchandise courtesy of Fangamer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, at the time, the ever-vigilant Deltarune community stumbled upon some unusual hidden content within the pages on the Deltarune website dedicated to the sweepstakes. At the time, most of it consisted of fun Easter Eggs, and I don't want to get into it all, but it was the first major sign that something was up. It wasn't until May of 2025 (two and a half years later) that things really kicked off. Fans suddenly noticed that there were <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5RKswkbmF_Jp7BaCuJ75ei5Xieu_yPMcMP5gEcaonQ/mobilebasic#h.iky9p49ddxoo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even more secrets</a> on the Deltarune website dedicated to the sweepstakes. There were a number of new <a href="https://deltarune.com/chapter5/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hidden pages</a>, all of which made reference to the game's deeply eerie and hidden "Weird Route", but the one that matters most to the ARG was <a href="https://deltarune.com/chapter4/thankyou/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deltarune.com/chapter4/thankyou</a>. At the time, the website consisted of two very small blanks where users could input text, and a blank button that allowed them to submit it. There were no clues as to what needed to go into the blanks, save for a single question:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>"How long did it take her to smile?"</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune fans very quickly guessed that the "her" being referenced was Noelle, a beloved character and the childhood best friend of Deltarune protagonist Kris. She's also the focal point of the aforementioned Weird Route, in which the player (a separate character from Kris) manipulates Noelle into doing something terrible in the interest of becoming stronger. Fans also figured out that the first blank was looking for an email address, with the second blank being for the actual "answer" to the question. Unfortunately, the form was only open for a day, before being replaced with text that just said "Thank You." Those who had submitted their email in the form began receiving effectively a confirmation email that just contained "You answered [THEIR ANSWER]." No further explanation. Nothing! For months!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, when all this happened, Chapters 3 and 4 weren't out yet. Those released earlier this year, and with them, more Weird Route content and a couple of horrifying, hidden scenes focused on Noelle in particular. Then two weeks ago, those who had received the confirmation email the first time received a new email that just said, "Second chance," and found that the form had been reopened. The community efforts were more coordinated this time, with people experimenting with different combinations of time amounts in days, seconds, years, as well as other textual responses they felt made sense. A number of community members tried to document submissions to avoid duplications, though given the short notice and short time period the form was open, this was once again difficult to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The form closed again, and once again, participants received emails. But this time, they were different. Individuals were getting one of a collection of different responses that seemed to be based on what they submitted. For instance, those who said "1 Day" received back "Then, 'The next day you'll see her smile.'" People who inputted very small numbers, such as 4 seconds, got back, "So, 'she never stopped smiling'". There are a bunch of other creepy answers, like "Do you think that means she still can?" and "Then, 'It was the first time she ever smiled in her life.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many emails ended with another sentence: "Move forward with this answer," seemingly indicating the submission was on the right track.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/08/screenshot-2026-01-08-144646-1767905239635.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Screenshot from FlamingLily's spreadsheet: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That was two weeks ago, and the form has been closed ever since. There's no indication of whether anyone got the right answer, what the next step is, or if the form will ever open up again. In preparation for a third attempt, a number of content creators have been rallying fans into communities to track what answers garnered what responses, and piece those responses together to try and figure out a "correct" answer if the form reopens. There are <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple massive spreadsheets</a> out there cataloging confirmed responses, as well as others assigning different answers to each participant ahead of time, so no one wastes an answer on a duplicate.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/08/screenshot-2026-01-08-144601-1767905276669.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Screenshot from Flaming Lily's spreadsheet: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nIlJUDv7Iok4LgwJkDi5yHO0KEfw4icEBCxd5rMcBAs/edit?gid=1019143298#gid=1019143298</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what does it all mean? We're...not exactly sure. The general consensus is that all this has something to do with where Chapter 4's "Weird Route" leaves Noelle, and speculation about what's to come in Chapter 5 at the "festival" event we know is going to take place during it. But even though that's the most likely context, it's a pretty unusual one: the Weird Route is extremely hard to figure out without assistance from the internet, and its dark consequences make it unlikely that the vast majority of players would ever see it or understand what any of this is about. If this ARG is going to reveal some deep lore, or even impact the game somehow, it's likely that very few people will understand or even care about the result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That may be by design, though. Critically, the second time the form opened, only people who participated and received feedback from it the first time were able to use it again. If you're just learning about this (as I am), you may be entirely too late to participate at all. It's also possible there's no progress on whatever this is for months, even years. We've already waited along time just for this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm really just scratching the surface here, and probably sound like I'm completely crazy. If you've played Deltarune and didn't know about any of this, you probably had a pleasant time with a cool, well-written RPG with funny, lovable characters, and left it at that. That's an extremely normal way to enjoy this game, and probably will be most people's experience! But since Deltarune's Chapter 1 release, there's been a whole ecosystem of secrets, fan theories, and conspiracies surrounding the question of what this game actually <em>is, </em>how it relates to Undertale, and what the implications of its hidden, darker narrative might be for the game's lighter side. It's complex, weird, and fun as hell to dig into, and we probably won't know the full scope of it for years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is all to say, good luck to the secret hunters, and I'm genuinely sorry I can't help. I've inadvertently gotten invested in this mystery even though I will not personally touch the Weird Route with a ten-foot holiday pencil. Deltarune chapters 1-4 are out now and combined make a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">very good place to jump in</a> if you've been holding off thus far. Chapter 5 is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapter-5-release-date-likely-second-half-of-2026-toby-fox-says-thats-not-a-surprise-right">expected to come out this year</a>, likely in the second half.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios has outlined its plan to deal with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> cheaters after they became a hot topic in the community earlier this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cheaters are a concern for nearly all multiplayer games, but they’ve become an especially controversial subject amongst players recently. Reports of cheaters seem to be increasing in recent weeks, as players share clips and stories of others shooting them through walls and from unreachable areas. The conversation then reached a boiling point when popular streamers like <a href="https://x.com/Ninja/status/2008707896918372595?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ninja</u></a>, <a href="https://x.com/Nadeshot/status/2007926647295492467?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Nadeshot</u></a>, and <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/2008969384073810136?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Shroud</u></a> began publicly voicing their concerns.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>"This might be my last day playing for a very long time... Embark has zero control over their game right now"</p><p>Shroud says he might quit ARC Raiders due to how bad cheaters have gotten <a href="https://t.co/zJfXO4xAg0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zJfXO4xAg0</a></p></div>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/2008969384073810136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 7, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Embark confirmed it is taking action against the cheating problem in a message posted in its official Discord server. The note comes with an acknowledgement of the discussion surrounding cheaters in the community, promising that the studio is “taking this issue very seriously” as it awaits further feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Over the next few weeks, we are implementing significant changes to our rulesets and deploying new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters,” Embark said. “This includes updating our Anti-Cheat systems for improved detection and bans, as well as applying client-side fixes specifically addressing the ‘out of map’ glitch.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear if Embark’s efforts will be enough to deter the most problematic Arc Raiders offenders, but it’s at least a sign the studio will take action through January. The message also comes with a promise specifically for streamers, saying the team is “introducing tools for streamers to help mitigate stream sniping.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you for your valuable feedback and for helping us make ARC Raiders a fair and fun experience for everyone,” the message concludes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 30, 2025.
