(Notably, Kill Bill <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair-to-hit-theaters-later-this-year-complete-with-all-new-anime-sequence">is set for re-release on December 5</a> as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair">Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</a>, a fresh, newly-combined version of the two Kill Bill films — something that would be well-timed for a Fortnite crossover.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a separate tease, a collection of Fortnite characters appeared yesterday at a LA Dodgers victory celebration, holding up signs and posing for photos with fans. Banana hero Peely, hotdog man The Brat, and rapper pickle Big Dill were spotted by fan <a href="https://twitter.com/Reetlol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1985521856028565880%7Ctwgr%5Ecf08f4a5fb977123883191ca1ce2b3f06cd9c585%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Ffortnite-chapter-seven-teases-kill-bill-crossover-points-to-usa-setting" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reetlol</a>, and can be seen holding signs saying "Game 7 first, Chapter Seven Next!!," "Seven," and "Nov 29" — a date fans now think is when we'll get a first glimpse at Chapter Seven.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr">👀 <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Fortnite</a> <a href="https://t.co/GHAsz9OuzC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GHAsz9OuzC</a></p>— JOGO Reet (@Reetlol) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reetlol/status/1985521856028565880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite has always labelled the different incarnations of its battle royale map as different "chapters" of the game (which are then sub-divided into seasons). But this one, fans have noticed, is being referred to as Chapter <em>Seven</em>, spelt out, rather than the usual Chapter 7 numbering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seven holds a big significance in Fortnite lore (and thankfully no, it's nothing to do with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skrilla-claims-viral-hit-doot-doot-6-7-is-in-gta-6-im-going-to-be-my-own-person-on-there-playing-my-own-music">the 6-7 meme</a>). Throughout Fortnite's first five years, The Seven were slowly revealed as a heroic team of characters who defended the game's multiverse, and who led the charge during the game's big story events (such as the one where the original Chapter 1 Island got sucked into a black hole). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, The Seven's helmeted heroes were revealed to include characters played by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Brie Larsen, though after Chapter 3's grand finale, the team's story was abruptly concluded, with their members seemingly defeated and dispursed. More recent Chapters have acted as something of a reset of the game's narrative, following the departure of Epic Games' previous creative lead Donald Mustard, though fans have long held out hope of seeing The Seven once again. In a Chapter named after them, surely it's finally time?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, numerous Fortnite leakers have claimed that the Chapter Seven map will include a large desert biome, with mention of an "Area 51" style location. FortniteLeaks, meanwhile, has specifically reported that the game will feature a weapon called the Gambler Shotgun — "which is related to one of the major themes of the map."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, fans are putting two and two together and arriving at the idea of Chapter Seven featuring a Nevada-style location, and have suggested a crossover with another upcoming franchise: Fallout. The game has already featured Fallout in the shape of an outfit sporting the franchise's power suit. But with new episodes of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout TV series</a> scheduled to debut from December 17, fans have wondered whether a larger collaboration is also now on the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until then, there's three weeks left of Fortnite's really very enjoyable The Simpsons era to enjoy, before a big live event on November 29 that's expected to usher in Chapter Seven — and whatever it holds — in style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Medios y Media/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto fans have known for some time that Rockstar Games worked on a single-player DLC for GTA 5 that would have seen Trevor assume the role of a secret agent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, voice actor Steven Ogg said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-5-had-trevor-dlc-before-rockstar-scrapped-it-voice-actor-steven-ogg-says">Rockstar originally planned to make a story expansion focused on his character, Trevor</a>, with it thought to have fallen by the wayside as the developer focused on the cash cow that was GTA Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ogg was joined by Michael actor Ned Luke and Franklin actor Shawn Fonteno in a Questions and Answers session with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtW3WXxA0pY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Streamily</u></a>. The trio shed light on what they claimed was scrapped downloadable content for GTA 5 that starred Trevor as a Federal Investigation Bureau agent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Originally they were gonna do continuing stories of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor," Luke said, and Ogg expanded on his version. "We also had that really cool s**t of — and I forget if it was DLC, I have no idea — but where Trevor was gonna be undercover, he works for the FEDs," Ogg said. "And we did shoot some of that stuff with James Bond Trevor. He's still kind of a f**k up but he's doing his best. And we shot some stuff and then it just disappeared and they never followed up on it."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA 5 and GTA Online</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Also last year, Joe Robino, who was a senior camera artist and virtual cinematographer working at Rockstar’s New York office from 2010 to 2016, spoke to <a href="https://youtu.be/Uikfph7oQoE?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the SanInPlay YouTube channel</u></a> about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-5s-kick-ass-story-dlc-scrapped-because-gta-online-was-so-much-of-a-cash-cow-ex-rockstar-dev-claims">why the GTA 5 story DLC was canceled</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of the team went to do Red Dead Redemption 2 right away and I took on this other project that was a standalone DLC for GTA that never came out and it was kick ass,” Robino revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That was my thing. I was one of the main editors, camera artists, and on-stage stuff. We split our teams into two. I stayed on GTA Online and then this DLC, which Steven Ogg [the actor who played Trevor Philips] was a very important part of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then some of the team overlapped and went to RDR2 early on, and then we just kind of did this [flipped motion], because when that game got shelved, we spent so much money… a lot of that stuff though did end up making it I believe into later iterations of GTA Online, I think. So it’s not like they wasted it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was really really good. But when GTA Online came out it was so much of a cash cow and people were loving it so much that it was hard to make an argument that a standalone DLC would outcompete that. I think looking back now you could probably do both. But that was a business decision they made. I was a little upset about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That actually was a lot of the reason for me being a little sour at that time. Because I was like yo, WTF guys? This s**t’s awesome. Let’s keep going. Let’s finish this s**t.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have had snippets of information about GTA 5’s fabled story DLC over the years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-gta-6-waiting-in-the-wings-fans-find-possible-evidence-of-cut-gta-5-story-dlc-canned-bully-2"><u>GTA dataminers have also discovered a reference to Trevor with a jetpack</u></a>, which suggests story mode DLC was repurposed into GTA Online, as Robino said. In 2018, Rockstar finally unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/The_Doomsday_Heist"><u>GTA Online's Doomsday Heist missions</u></a> alongside the Thruster jetpack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=-F5wXQ6TeJHbbkfI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lex Fridman podcast</a>, Rockstar Games co-founder and former lead writer Dan Houser has addressed this DLC for the first time, insisting that if the developer had continued with it, it wouldn’t have been able to make 2018’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The internet knows we made a DLC… single-player DLC for GTA 5 that never came out,” Houser said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was one when you played as Trevor, but he was a secret agent. It was cute. It never quite came together, and it was never finished. It was about half done when it got abandoned. But I think if that had come out, we probably wouldn’t have gotten to make Red Dead 2. So, there are always compromises.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the first time Houser has addressed the canceled GTA 5 story DLC, but it turns out there’s another project he would have loved to have made while he was at the studio: GTA Zombies. “I liked the idea of it, it was a GTA zombie game,” he said. “That would have been funny. I think that could have been quite fun.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every GTA Game Ranked</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA fans often lament the loss of single-player story DLC for GTA 5 after it did so well for previous GTA games. Houser said he remains a big fan of single-player DLC, and is hoping to make some as part of his new company, Absurd Ventures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like making the stories,” he said. “For me, I love the model of GTA 4 when you had the extra stories coming afterwards, or Red Dead 1 when you had the zombie pack coming afterwards. I like just doing these extra things. So, I would personally like to have done more of that in that company. And with stuff we’re doing in the future, we’re going to try and come up with worlds where we can add more stories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like single-player DLC. I just think the audience loves it, and it’s really fun to make.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/gettyimages-2237849657-1762257766339.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dan Houser at 2025 Los Angeles Comic Con.

In September, he said he felt "absolutely nothing" inside for GTA 6 because he’s never been a fan of video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of revelations in Lex Fridman’s Dan Houser interview, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-question-if-you-can-even-make-a-good-open-world-spy-game-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-finally-explains-why-agent-never-happened">the fate of canceled PS3 exclusive Agent</a>, and Houser’s thoughts on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-needed-guns-you-needed-these-larger-than-life-characters-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-explains-why-grand-theft-auto-wont-leave-the-united-states">why GTA won’t leave the United States in terms of setting</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Squires, who only became director of the USPTO in September, has personally ordered a reexamination after he "determined that substantial new questions of patentability have arisen" to certain claims made by the patent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Squires' description of the claims in question:</p><blockquote>"The '397 patent issued with claims drawn to controlling the movement of a player character in a field of a virtual space, causing a sub character to appear in the field, controlling a battle in a manual mode when an enemy character is present in the location the sub character has appeared, and when an enemy character is not present in the location the sub character has appeared, automatically moving the sub character, and controlling a battle in an automatic mode when an enemy character is placed at a designated location."</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In his order, Squires pointed to two older U.S. patent applications — one filed by Konami in 2002, the other by Nintendo itself in 2019 — as “prior art” references. Both, Squires said, would be “important in deciding whether the claims are patentable,” and each “raises a substantial new question of patentability.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mueller, writing for Games Fray, said Squires' order was down to the “public outrage” at the award of the patent, and concerns about the reputation of the U.S. patent system as a whole. While this reexamination isn’t a revocation order, Mueller insisted it is now “highly likely” that the USPTO will revoke Nintendo’s ‘397 patent. Nintendo has two months to respond.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this mean for Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s high-profile legal battle with Pocketpair over Palworld? Mueller said it “further undermines the credibility” of Nintendo’s patent assertions against Pocketpair's game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the latest legal blow for Nintendo in its battle against Palworld. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-companys-monster-capture-patent-rejected-may-signal-problems-for-their-palworld-lawsuit">one of the Nintendo patents related to its monster capture patents filed last year</a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-companys-monster-capture-patent-rejected-may-signal-problems-for-their-palworld-lawsuit"> was rejected by the Japan Patent Office (JPO) for lacking originality</a>. The office’s reasoning for the rejection made reference to older games with similar mechanics that were released even before 2021, including ARK (released in 2015), Monster Hunter 4 (2013), and Japanese browser game Kantai Collection (also 2013). Ironically, Pocketpair’s Craftopia (2020) and Niantic’s Pokémon Go (2016) were among other examples of games that were used to argue that the patent lacks originality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three main patents</u></a> granted by the JPO: two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May this year, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment. The case has rumbled on, with Nintendo even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why?_gl=1*9gbndy*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTEzNjgzNTkxNi4xNzYxODIzODEz*_ga_4L6HY9G8XE*czE3NjE4MjM4MTQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjE4MjM4MTQkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>rewriting a mount-related patent mid-lawsuit</u></a>, and arguing that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-mods-dont-count-as-prior-art-as-theyre-not-full-games-attempting-to-sway-judge-in-palworld-lawsuit"><u>mods should not count as prior art</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/gettyimages-2174642895-1762250885224.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pocketpair is soldiering on with Palworld development despite the Nintendo lawsuit.

Mueller said there may not be any further developments this calendar year relating to Nintendo’s lawsuit against Pocketpair or patents that are related to it. But decisions are expected next year. All eyes will be on Presiding Judge Motoyuki Nakashima, who leads the patent division of the Tokyo District Court. “It is ever more likely that Nintendo will lose,” Mueller said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood"><u>IGN sat down for an extended conversation with John “Bucky” Buckley, communications director and publishing manager for Palworld developer Pocketpair</u></a>. We spoke following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals (a claim that the person who originally made it has since retracted). He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-capcom-designer-yoshiki-okamoto-sparks-backlash-in-japan-by-saying-palworld-has-crossed-a-line-that-should-not-be-crossed"><u>former Capcom game developer Yoshiki Okamoto issued comments seemingly against Pocketpair and Palworld in the legal battle</u></a>, sparking a backlash from viewers.

It now expects to shift 19 million units of its new console before the end of March 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put Switch 2's success into perspective, Nintendo has doubled the launch sales of Switch 1 (which sold 4.7 million units in its first six months back in 2017) and is also well ahead of the PlayStation 5's own impressive arrival (which sold 7.8 million units back in November 2020, though was limited by stock availability).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, the Switch 2's flagship launch game, has now sold 9.57 million copies, with 8.1 million units of that total from the console's bundle. (So yes, more than a million people paid $80 to buy it separately.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's second biggest Switch 2 title, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, has notched up 3.49 million sales since its July debut. Super Mario Party Jamboree — Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, meanwhile, has sold 1.16 million copies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no word in today's data on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, which launched too recently to be included. However, we already know the new Pokémon adventure has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-sells-58-million-in-launch-week-half-were-bought-for-nintendo-switch-2">sold 5.8 million copies in a week</a> — enough to ensure it will certainly be one of the console's best sellers in Nintendo's next results.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, sales of Switch 1 game Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continue to remain strong — with another 1.37 million units sold over the last six months (seriously, who doesn't own a copy by now?). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Nintendo Switch now stands at 154 million units, meanwhile, meaning it is just 10,000 sales away from overtaking Nintendo's current best-selling device — the Nintendo DS. But can the aging console shift another six million units to finally dethrone the best-selling console ever, PlayStation 2? Nintendo says it expects Switch 1 to have reached a lifetime total of 156 million by the end of March 2026, so it will come close.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
