            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> has suffered numerous leaks throughout 2025, and now, just three days before launch, the game itself may have leaked its way into the public’s hands, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nzhg5l/it_is_finally_in_my_hands/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>grecea_vlad</u></a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1nyqbnc/see_out_there_boys/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SS-Enter-Thighs</u></a> shared they had recently managed to secure early copies, posting images of what seem to be Phantom Edition versions of the game that have been unintentionally released days before Battlefield 6’s October 10 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Box art highlighted in both posts features labels from the European video game ratings board, PEGI, suggesting both copies were sold by European retailers. It’s unclear which store(s) could be responsible for the alleged leak or how pre-release copies of Battlefield 6 could have slipped through the cracks and into the fans’ hands. Of course, that may not be a concern for the two – or maybe even more – Battlefield 6 fans who now have the game in hand days before everyone else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-global-release-times-confirmed"><u>global release times for Battlefield 6 yesterday</u></a>, confirming there would be no early access for players who pre-ordered certain versions of the game. Despite outlining firm launch times, both Reddit users say they are able to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-preview-chaos-destruction-and-surprising-variety"><u>access the campaign mode</u></a> and even some online features, including online play with bots, as grecea_vlad says <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nzhg5l/comment/ni2iofv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>servers are already online</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear which features these supposed early Battlefield 6 adopters have access to, so for everyone else still waiting for official launch, it’s probably best to be wary of spoilers for the next few days, just in case.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, EA and the four-company team that makes up Battlefield Studios recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-day-one-patch-includes-changes-to-movement-weapon-recoil-rush-and-more">previewed some of the changes set to be introduced with the Battlefield 6 day one patch</a>. It’s a tease for this Friday’s patch that also came with an update regarding the debate between Closed and Open Weapons, as the developers insisted that “the vast majority of players” prefer the latter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042"><u>spoke to the Battlefield team at Ripple Effect</u></a> to learn more about how BF Studios has prepped for the launch of Battlefield 6 last month.
