Matt Cox, General Manager of Call of Duty, insisted that “as a team, our vision from the start was to create a back-to-back series experience for our players that embraced the uniqueness of the Black Ops sub-franchise.” It's set to star Milo Ventimiglia, Kiernan Shipka, and Michael Rooker, with Ventimiglia portraying David Mason, Shipka as new character Emma Kagen, and Rooker reprising his Black Ops 2 role of Mike Harper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We know it'll feature the Skirmish and Overload multiplayer modes as well a 20v20 wingsuit option as details of a developer-only <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</u></a> playtest were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-developer-accidentally-posts-private-playtest-details-to-public-cod-app"><u>accidentally released to all fans on the Call of Duty app</u></a>.
