Here’s everything that was confirmed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Black Friday Switch Game Deals – Starting Nov. 24</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Beginning November 24, several Nintendo Switch games will be available at lower prices at major retailers like Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Walmart. This includes $20 off games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and other games down to at least $29.99. We predicted we'd see very similar deals in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-game-deals-predictions-for-black-friday-2024">"What to Expect" for Nintendo Black Friday</a> column. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/12/nintendo-holiday-offers-1731423438423.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also worth mentioning that the deals over Black Friday will likely extend beyond what Nintendo has discussed, so stay tuned for even more updates. Moreover, on Nintendo’s digital storefronts, including the eShop and My Nintendo Store, holiday sales on select games will be a few days ahead of the other deals on November 19. But retailers could start to price match on this day instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Switch games on sale for Black Friday:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/98bW1L?object_uuid=1a2a0f56-456f-4f5d-9c60-712dd750ddc0&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> – $49.99 ($20 off)</li><li>Super Mario Maker 2, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Pikmin 4, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and the physical version of Nintendo Switch Sports – $39.99 each</li><li>Super Mario Odyssey and Pikmin 1 + 2 – $29.99 each</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Accessories will also see price drops:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Neon Red/Blue Joy-Con controllers and the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller – $20 off</li><li>Tears of the Kingdom-themed Nintendo Switch Carrying Case &amp; Screen Protector – $10 off </li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Black Friday Holiday Console Bundles</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-nintendo-switch-mario-kart-8-deluxe-black-friday-2024-bundles">Black Friday Holiday Switch bundles</a> are something we already knew about and are already available, but it has now been triple confirmed by Nintendo. You can now purchase a Nintendo Switch: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Bundle for $299.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6Pol?object_uuid=1a2a0f56-456f-4f5d-9c60-712dd750ddc0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Best Buy</a>), or a version with the Switch OLED for $349.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QKDm0Y?object_uuid=1a2a0f56-456f-4f5d-9c60-712dd750ddc0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Best Buy</a>).

We recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-breaks-nintendo-amazon-freeze-black-friday">reported on how there's been something of a Nintendo-Amazon freeze out over much of 2024</a>. This was recently broken with the listing of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom sold and shipped by Amazon, but there's currently no indication as to whether the freeze out will still continue despite that anomoly. While Amazon will certainly have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2024-when-will-the-sale-start-this-year">its own Black Friday sales</a>, you might be better off finding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">Switch deals</a> at Best Buy, Target, or Walmart.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of <strong>Black Friday in 2024 falls on November 29</strong> this year, but the deals season will begin a lot sooner than that. Leading up to the big event, retailers will begin to open deals online. This usually <strong>starts in the last week of October</strong>, just before Halloween. Each week leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to massive discounts on Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

"This is why Link doesn’t talk either." But with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-nintendo-switch-with-zelda-as-protagonist">the role of Zelda supporting Link reversed in Echoes of Wisdom</a>, it now fell on Link's shoulders to guide Zelda along.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Legend of Zelda Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo therefore gave Link a voice for the first time after nearly four decades of Zelda games. "We made Link talk a bit at first but it felt really wrong," Aonuma added. "We kept thinking, 'He'd never say that.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Terada expanded: "Whatever we tried to make him say, it just didn't feel right. No one knew the answer to the question, 'What would Link say?' And of course we wouldn’t; he has never spoken before. Because of that, we needed a setting where he couldn’t talk, and that led to a part of the game’s storyline being formed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question of Link talking will presumably be answered by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-live-action">the live-action The Legend of Zelda movie</a>, which Nintendo has said will be released before the end of the decade. While we know next to nothing about the movie itself, director <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-director-wants-it-to-be-live-action-miyazaki"><u>Wes Ball has said he wants it to be "live action Miyazaki,"</u></a> referencing beloved filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, the director of Studio Ghibli and creator of myriad anime classics such as My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle, and Spirited Away. Ball still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-live-action-movie-director-aiming-to-make-serious-adaptation-feels-real"><u>plans for the Zelda movie to be a "serious" adaptation</u></a> that feels real, and has made clear <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-director-not-planning-much-motion-capture-grounded-adaptation"><u>he doesn't intend to use much motion capture</u></a> in the "grounded" film. Casting has yet to be announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Echoes of Wisdom arrived as a new take on the beloved franchise by, as mentioned, putting Zelda at the heart of the adventure. It also focused on creativity, letting players create copies of anything in the game and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/echoes-of-wisdom-players-are-finding-creative-new-ways-to-win-horse-races">spawn them as "echoes" to solve myriad problems</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">In our 9/10 review</a>, IGN said: "The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is far more than some second-tier spinoff, combining the expertly crafted dungeons and item progression you’d expect from a 2D Zelda with the wild creativity provided by Tears of the Kingdom."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
