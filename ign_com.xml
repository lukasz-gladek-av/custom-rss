            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has chalked up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws"><u>Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>' lackluster performance to the "choppy waters" of the sci-fi saga's fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Addressing shareholders at a recent <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/zzxygofu/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Q&amp;A</u></a>, Guillemot didn't reflect on the game's own performance issues, bugs, or complaints about repetitive gameplay, instead saying: "Outlaws was released at a time when the brand that it belonged to was in a bit of choppy waters." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I's true that the Star Wars brand has taken a bit of a battering of late, with a middling reception to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and lower-than-hoped viewership of various Disney+ spin-offs like Book of Boba Fett and The Acolyte. But attributing Outlaws' mixed reception to broader issues with the fandom has raised a few eyebrows among fans for feeling slightly reductive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Guillemot did not make note of the game's own technical problems on arrival, for example. IGN's own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review"><u>Star Wars Outlaws review</u></a> — in which we awarded the sci-fi game a "Good" 7/10 — highlighted repetitive combat and "a few too many bugs at launch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, the game was mired in controversy when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-our-goal-is-not-to-push-any-specific-agenda"><u>Ubisoft was accused of "pushing an agenda," resulting in "polarized comments"</u></a> around the developer/publisher and the game long before the game released. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-is-a-love-letter-to-hondo-ohnaka"><u>Star Wars Outlaws got its first story expansion in May</u></a> with the release of the A Pirate’s Fortune DLC on PlayStation, Xbox and PC. A Pirate's Fortune gives players the chance to join forces with Hondo Ohnaka, head of the Ohnaka Gang. Hondo will be a name familiar to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-the-clone-wars"><u>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</u></a> fans and readers of the 2017 comic book series Star Wars: Darth Maul, and has even done time as one of the animatronic characters at the Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge attraction. This time around he'll be Kay's ally as she takes on Stinger Tash and her gang, the Rokana Raiders, checks out a mysterious tomb and does some smuggling for the Miyuki Trade League.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2">Star Wars Outlaws is getting a Nintendo Switch 2 release on September 4</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
