Players will still be able to access all earned and purchased content while offline via the local gameplay mode and training mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While real-money transactions for MultiVersus are no longer available, fans can still use Gleamium and character tokens to access in-game content until support ends on May 30. MultiVersus will also be delisted from the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, Steam, and Epic Games Store at this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the announcement, and without word of a refund policy, MultiVersus players who bought the $100 premium Founder's Pack hit out at Warner Bros. and Player First Games, with some saying they felt “scammed.” Based on online reports, there are a number of disgruntled customers who have character tokens that are now rendered useless, given they had already unlocked all playable characters in the game. Predictably, MultiVersus is also getting review-bombed on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tony Huynh, co-founder of Player First Games and game director of MultiVersus, <a href="https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1886119648480915954" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to address player concerns and call out threats of violence directed at the team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Huynh’s statement in full:</p><blockquote>Hey all, I wanted to say a few words as I reflect on the recently announced news about MultiVersus. While I'm sad about the outcome, I will forever be grateful for the opportunity given to us by Warner  Bros. Games and to each and every developer on the Player First Games and WB Games teams. Also to every IP holder thank you for entrusting us with your babies, we hope we made the characters true to themselves and felt authentic to your fans. I couldn’t be prouder of the work the PFG team did. Their endless creativity and passion never ceased to inspire and amaze me. And of course I wanted to thank every player who has ever played or supported MultiVersus. Delighting and serving players is Player First Games objective.</blockquote><blockquote>I apologize for not addressing things sooner, there’s been a lot going on and I’ve been focused on the game and the team, but now more-so the team.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for sending us all the great fan art, character ideas, and personal stories. They were the highlight of every day and always excited the team.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m sorry if we couldn’t get to your favorite character. I do think Aquaman and Lola are really cool and I hope you all check them out. Character selection comes down to bunch of things including development time, listening to what the community wants, working with IP holders and approvals, if there is a cross-marketing opportunity available to support, and of course if the team is inspired to make the character. So a lot goes into to it.</blockquote><blockquote>For instance BananaGuard came about because the team was enthusiastic about making it and on their own produced it over the weekend as a fun, quick-to-make character. When inspiration and enthusiasm spark we want to reward that and we got BananaGuard because of that. It wasn’t at the expense of another character. It was because the team was excited about making the character.</blockquote><blockquote>I don’t have the power some you think I do. PFG is a highly collaborative team and ideas are encouraged and can come from anyone and we promote delivering value to players</blockquote><blockquote>I also hope that the community notices that we try to listen and act. Like any developer we’re limited by time and resources.</blockquote><blockquote>I know that this is painful for everyone, and I know every member of PFG feels it too, but I have to call this out, you’re entitled to what you say and think, but when there are threats to harm it’s crossing the line. I hope that you can take a step back and realize that this is an extremely sad time for the team. I am in deep mourning for the game. Nobody wanted this outcome and it wasn’t from lack of caring or effort.</blockquote><blockquote>I sincerely hope that Season 5 is enjoyed with the time we have left and that you will all continue supporting other platform fighter and fighting games as these games have impacted me in many positive ways. I’ve made so many friends and created so many great memories because of these games, and a big reason why we worked so hard at PFG was to share that with you. I hope that we played a small part and that you can look back on MVS and find some joy in the friends you made and the memories you shared.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for allowing this dream to become a reality even if for a briefer time than we would have wanted. I don’t know what the future holds for any of all of us, but I just wanted to say thank you. It has been an honor to work alongside the team at PFG to serve our community and players.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Player First Games community manager and game developer Angelo Rodriguez Jr. took to <a href="https://x.com/AJAX_HQ/status/1886134953546838238" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> to defend Huynh, stressing: “Receiving threats of physical harm against him is not and will never be the way.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've legitimately been losing sleep over the past few days watching as all of these has been happening to Tony,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The man who would stay up past midnight with us watching streams and listened for fun ideas from the players. The man who took the time to read so many messages and respond to so many people when he didn't have to. The man who spent countless hours working with every department to try and improve things we could in the weeks we had to do it. The man who went out of his way to hire so many of us from the community and gave us a shot at being involved in something so special. Tony is not who he is being painted out to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know things aren't the best right now and everyone is looking for answers. Receiving threats of physical harm against him is not and will never be the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“PFG poured their heart into this game and we still hope everyone enjoys season 5. We never stopped pushing for improvements and again you will see 50 pages worth of them this season. I hope everyone can take the time to read through what Tony has to say, and I hope you will all think things through.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MultiVersus’ demise is the latest high-profile failure for Warner Bros. Games, following Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s disastrous launch last year. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-is-leaving-the-company-a-year-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disastrous-launch">the departure of Warner Bros. Games boss David Haddad was revealed</a> after what had been a troubling 12 months for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure contributed to a $200 million hit to its business</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business"><u>MultiVersus added another $100 million on top</u></a>. Warner Bros. Games' only new game release during the third quarter of 2024 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions"><u>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</u></a>, which failed to make an impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav said: "We recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League post-launch content has come to an end with the delivery of its year one roadmap. Warner Bros. has yet to announce Rocksteady’s next game, but it is reportedly helping out on a director’s cut of Hogwarts Legacy. The legendary British studio has suffered a number of layoffs in recent months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also question marks over Mortal Kombat 1’s financial performance, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-chief-ed-boon-teases-t-1000-fatality-and-future-dlc"><u>NetherRealm chief Ed Boon recently announced over five million sales and teased future DLC following the release of the T-1000 Terminator guest character</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Zaslav said Warner Bros. was doubling down on four games: Hogwarts Legacy (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines"><u>a sequel is already in the works</u></a>), Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, "in particular Batman." Warner Bros. recently published the VR game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-shadow"><u>Batman: Arkham Shadow</u></a> exclusively on the Meta Quest 3, and has a Wonder Woman game in the works at Monolith Productions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio," Zaslav added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
