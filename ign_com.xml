            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">PC version when?</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has highlighted the performance of PlayStation 5 exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, insisting it outsold predecessor <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> during the same period, and made a “significant” contribution to its financial results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Yotei went on sale October 2, 2025,<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-sells-33-million-copies-in-its-first-month-on-sale-sony-confirms"> and sold 3.3 million units as of November 2</a> (at the 32 day mark). Reporting its financials for the quarter ending December 31, 2025, Sony failed to provide an updated sales figure, but did highlight the game in its webcast, reviewed and transcribed by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the studio business, Ghost of Yotei, a tentpole title we released in October, exceeded the sales of the previous title in the same period of time and significantly contributed to the financial results of the quarter,” Lin Tao, Sony's chief financial officer, said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our established live service titles like Helldivers 2 and MLB The Show also contributed stable recurring revenue.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement here is a little vague (we assume “same period of time” reflects each game's first quarter on sale, which would be the first three months of availability), but Sony sounds happy with Ghost of Yotei either way. How exactly does it compare to Ghost of Tsushima? Ghost of Tsushima, which was initially released for PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, sold 2.4 million copies in its first three days, then hit 5 million after 118 days (just shy of four months). Latest sales figures provided by Sony show Ghost of Tsushima on 13 million copies sold, including sales of the PC and PS5 Director’s Cut, as of August 11, 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We should consider that Ghost of Tsushima came out on the PS4, which in the summer of 2020 had a much bigger install base than the PS5 does today, and released into the stay-at-home gaming boom fueled by lockdowns. Ghost of Yotei also sold for $70, which means its dollar sales are greater compared to the cheaper Ghost of Tsushima, whose standard edition launched at $60.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out at some point this year, which will undoubtedly give Ghost of Yotei a shot in the arm. And we all know that Ghost of Yotei, like Ghost of Tsushima before it, will eventually launch on PC in Director’s Cut form. Perhaps there will even be a PS6 version, whenever that console rolls around.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PlayStation Game of 2025</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review"><u>Ghost of Yotei review</u></a>.
