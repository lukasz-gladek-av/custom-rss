The viral Grow a Garden sees players purchasing and growing plants, including rare varieties only available for a limited time, something which encourages huge player spikes as users rush to log in. Steal a Brainrot, meanwhile, tasks players with hoarding Pok√©mon-like creatures, and nabbing them from rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox's popularity comes amid continuing work by the platform to try and improve player safety, following a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">string of controversies tied to the experiences of its typically young audience</a>. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robloxs-new-safety-features-include-an-ai-that-will-guess-your-age-based-on-a-video-selfie">Roblox announced a new age estimation technology to help verify teens</a>, and the ability for them to allow "trusted connections" with whom they will be able to chat on the platform without filters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
