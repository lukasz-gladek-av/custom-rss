"Civ 7 is officially Steam Deck verified," it said. "Make history on the go."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next entry in the beloved franchise promises a "revolutionary new chapter" as it "empowers you to build the greatest empire the world has ever known." Its release is finally just a few weeks away, with a lengthy eight years between it and Civilization 6.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Civilization 7 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-civilization-game-officially-announced-by-firaxis">Firaxis announced "the next iteration of the legendary Civilization franchise" was in development</a> as of February 2023 before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-unveiled-at-summer-game-fest-releasing-in-2025">fully unveiling it as Civilization 7 in June 2024</a>. Fans were relieved to hear they didn't have further years to wait thanks to a 2025 release window, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-release-date-announced-gameplay-trailer-revealed-gamescom-2024">Firaxis soon after confirmed the February 6 date</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN called it "a more daring, risky take on the formula than any of the past few iterations have been," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-the-first-preview">in our first preview</a>. We "think that's definitely the way to go, considering those older games aren't going anywhere and are still quite playable. From ages that completely transform your chosen civilization, to a bold, readable, but grounded new art style, Firaxis is already putting their best foot forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's coming to PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X and S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam. Those wanting to play on its release date will need to pay $99.99 for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Deluxe Edition</a>, while those only willing to pay $69.99 (or $59.99 on Switch) will need to wait until February 11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Now, they know exactly what they missed out on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During <a href="https://youtu.be/C_ebmhxyR20?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an episode of the From Script to Life podcast</a>, Human Revolution and Mankind Divided writer Mark Cecere discussed where protagonist Adam Jensen’s story would have gone in the third game, were it not canceled. The writers planned for Jensen to take out one member of the Illuminati rather than the Illuminati itself, which would have caused “Bob Page to become Bob Page.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bob Page is the antagonist of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deus-ex">the original Deus Ex game</a>, Ion Storm’s hugely influential 2000 cyberpunk adventure. So, in this way, Jensen’s fate is to <em>cause</em> Deux Ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He can never catch up to the Illuminati,” Cecere explained. “We know this. We know the Illuminati keep going until 2050. We know some of those same characters that are in the Illuminati inner circle are in 2050. So Jensen can never get there and do something concrete.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, what can happen? That was the question we were trying to answer at some point. So we did have one name that we could get rid of, and that was the one that Jensen would have caught up to and done something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The repercussions were that by Jensen doing this, it causes Deus Ex, if that makes sense. And that’s the tragedy of Jensen, is that he causes what happens after — by doing something — he causes Bob Page to become Bob Page. That was where we were heading.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, it seems unlikely we’ll ever get to see this version of events. After the release of Mankind Divided in 2016, previous owner Square Enix had Eidos-Montréal shift to other projects, including 2021's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guardians-of-the-galaxy">Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a>. Then, in 2022, Square Enix sold Eidos-Montréal and the Deus Ex franchise to controversial umbrella company Embracer. Work on a brand new Deus Ex game had already begun, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embracer-group-reportedly-cancels-deus-ex-video-game-as-layoffs-hit-eidos-montreal">but this too was canceled in 2024</a>, resulting in signifcant layoffs at Eidos-Montréal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deus-ex-actor-elias-toufexis-says-goodbye-to-adam-jensen-following-game-cancellation">Elias Toufexis, who played Adam Jensen, waved goodbye to the character seemingly for good, saying</a>: “alas, his story seems done.” While Toufexis confirmed he had not worked on this latest canceled Deus Ex game and expressed hope that another company might pick up the Deus Ex licence, it felt final.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/1877082236400640098" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reacting to Cecere’s comments, Toufexis said</a>: “Hey this would have been fun huh?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Thankfully Amazon and Walmart are already offering up some great discounts, including a first-time price drop on the physical edition of Black Myth: Wukong for PlayStation 5 (see here at <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5d30?object_uuid=7cfb93d6-059d-4c0d-8b43-8d0d27503139&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DKFX8THB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>, see here at <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXZjO?object_uuid=7cfb93d6-059d-4c0d-8b43-8d0d27503139&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Normally this game runs for $64.99 but you can grab it today for $56.99 at both retailers. This physical edition is well worth picking up as well considering it comes with a digital deluxe upgrade with some extra items. Check out the deal and more information on the digital deluxe items included below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Black Myth: Wukong for PS5 Down to $56.99</h2><div id="213973" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="d7d43c07-9f78-4d18-a95b-3a913d566364"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Black Myth: Wukong - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><div catalogid="d7d43c07-9f78-4d18-a95b-3a913d566364" id="213974"><div id="213974" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Black Myth: Wukong - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside a physical disc with the base game, this copy also comes with a digital deluxe edition voucher code that'll get you some cool items featured in the digital deluxe edition of the game. Those are:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Bronzecloud Staff</li><li>Folk Opera Mask</li><li>Folk Opera Almsgiving Armor</li><li>Folk Opera Leather Bracers</li><li>Folk Opera Buskins</li><li>Wind Chimes</li><li>Selected Digital Soundtrack</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">We had plenty of praise for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc">Black Myth: Wukong in our review</a>. IGN's Mitchell Saltzman said that, "Combat is fantastic thanks to a great balance of careful resource management and lightning-fast, twitch-reaction gameplay that tested my skills as much as Elden Ring ever has, despite being a more traditional action game than FromSoftware’s style. Not only that, but there are a ton of exciting boss battles, a great variety of enemies, and the world they inhabit is an absolute treat for the eyes and ears."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for even more physical game deals to take advantage of right now, look no further than Best Buy. Right now the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-ubisoft-game-sale-january-2024">retailer has a sale on Ubisoft games</a>, so you can score discounts on the likes of Star Wars Outlaws, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 10, 2025 3:10 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
