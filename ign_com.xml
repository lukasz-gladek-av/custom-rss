While they're out there, they might discover some magical items and dangers, and apparently, a little bit of love after all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the pre-release run-up for Avowed, Obsidian said the game wouldn't feature a dedicated romance system, and would instead focus on building "thoughtful relationships" with companions. Here's a quote from an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-explains-why-avowed-wont-let-you-romance-your-companions">IGN interview with Avowed game director Carrie Patel</a>, explaining the thought process:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are building thoughtful relationships with our companion characters," Patel said at the time. "Ultimately, I personally am a fan of making that an option, but I feel like if you're going to do it, you really, really have to commit and make sure that you're giving all to fulfilling that in a way that feels both true to the character, but also creates an engaging player experience. So not something we're doing for Avowed, but I wouldn't say never."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early players and reviewers of Avowed are reporting that, actually, at least one companion has eyes for your player character. <strong>Spoilers ensue </strong>for specific interactions with the companion Kai, so if you're looking to avoid that, turn back now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Avowed spoilers follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/obsidian-insisted-that-avowed-wouldnt-have-romance-but-that-wasnt-quite-true-because-theres-at-least-one-eligible-bachelor-and-hes-voiced-by-an-iconic-mass-effect-heartthrob/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a> reports that Kai, voiced by Brandon Keener (also the voice of Mass Effect's Garrus Vakarian), can wind up in a romance with the player. Complete his own personal quest line, confess your feelings, and apparently you'll get a confirmation of your happily-ever-after in the credits roll.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm not far enough in my personal Avowed playthrough to confirm as much, but <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/those-mad-lads-at-obsidian-were-bluffing-us-avowed-does-have-a-tiny-bit-of-companion-romance-as-a-treat/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer encountered similar dialogue</a> in their playthrough. The romance seems gender-agnostic too, as PC Gamer played as a male character, and GamesRadar's reported success was with a female character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a nice little treat, especially for all the Garrus fans. It does make one wonder what shifted in development, but if love wins in the end, that's all that really matters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Avowed is out now in early access, so if you're looking for a take on it, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review">be sure to check out our Avowed review</a>. Once you're done with that, check out IGN's guide to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/avowed/Things_Avowed_Doesn't_Tell_You">Things Avowed Doesn't Tell You</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
