            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bottling the kinetic energy of a first person shooter video game and successfully transferring it to the tabletop is a herculean task. Publisher Glass Cannon Unplugged is up to the challenge, presenting Apex Legends: The Board Game in the form of an overstuffed box that spills cardboard and plastic onto the table like a body lit up by a VK-47 Flatline. This analog translation defies the odds, legitimately capturing some of the visceral action of its namesake with unique and clever design work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> the video game is a hero shooter battle royale. It has a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/Characters_(Legends)">full lineup of protagonists</a> with their own suite of abilities and playstyles. This identity is likewise the heart of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">board game adaptation</a>, forming the basis for its team-based skirmish action. Characters such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/bangalore">Bangalore</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/mirage">Mirage</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/bloodhound">Bloodhound</a> all make an appearance, with each of their roles expertly captured and adapted to the turn-based setting. Everything is powerful and awe inspiring, and it feels extraordinarily faithful to the property.</p><div catalogid="59f120e6-93ee-456b-ada0-ea76f3f22000" id="223645"><div id="223645" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apex Legends: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The standard format is either two-versus-two, or three-versus-three, with each player fielding a single character. While there are a bevy of miniatures skirmish games on the market, including popular titles such as Kill Team, Infinity, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-shatterpoint-board-game-review"><u>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</u></a>, none offer this particular style of team-based small-unit approach. Distinctly, this is not a game of armies or squads – it’s one of personalities and legends. The result is an altogether different tone, one charged with dynamic abilities that form the centerpiece of a violent gunfight on a fully rendered board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The board is quite the looker. Verticality is a core tenet of gameplay, as players are able to scale and fight from 3D cardstock buildings. Other elements pop off the map, including cardboard trees and boulders, loot containers, and even fully operational ziplines. The environment is active and responsive. It feels every bit a playground, albeit one with shrapnel and taunts whizzing by your dome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This dedication to elevation fuels the aggressive FPS-style play, but it also is the root of Apex Legends: The Board Game’s primary challenge. I’ve mentioned the game’s bloated componentry, which contributes to a lengthy setup time, but all of these options and details add up to a relatively complex system. The central turn-to-turn action sequence is surprisingly simple and direct. One team activates all of their characters with each committing to two actions. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This board game defies the odds, capturing the visceral action of its namesake with unique and clever design work.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But that streamlined activity fragments into many intricate pieces. Line of sight is a strong example. Measuring from center square to center square and assessing any blockages is standard for this style of game. But when you consider elevation, all of a sudden there are three pages of lengthy examples displaying potential situations. Thankfully, the rulebook's diagrams do a good job of illustrating what you need to consider, but the downside is that line of sight can be difficult to assess on the fly and it can slow down the pace of play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also tough to remember the difference between some of the keywords, such as "adjacent" versus "neighboring." Terrain items and cards use a similar library of tags that must be referenced. There are specific timing windows for reactions and a sub-system for handling abilities and cooldowns. None of these are overly burdensome on their own, but taken together they can become tricky to navigate. It’s important to understand that this is not a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">board game for beginners</a>. Instead of going for wide appeal with a similar approach to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-review"><u>Mass Effect: The Board Game</u></a>, Apex Legends aims to satisfy hobbyist gamers familiar with sophisticated systems. If a 40-page rulebook scares you, then you’re not going to hack it on this battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most interesting element of Apex Legends: The Board Game is also the most convoluted. Instead of a sophisticated physics engine handling the shooting mechanism, this game opts to zoom in on the firefight and simulate multiple factors, including recoil, stability, and rate of fire. Most games opt for a handful of dice and some quick arithmetic, but Apex Legends uses a sideboard and a dedicated set of cards to resolve gunshots. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s actually a pretty stellar system. Different guns have various rates of fire. They list a number of cards that are drawn from the shooting deck and placed alongside a track. Each card is placed in a slot representing an individual shot. Cards drawn later in the sequence have more recoil affecting their ballistics, which results in an escalation of penalties. The penalty is applied to the strength of the randomly drawn card, and then compared to the necessary hit value on the weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the quick and dirty explanation. In reality, it’s more nuanced as each drawn card also has a possible icon which can inflict headshots, bonus hits, or cause an automatic miss if the target is behind cover. Weapons that hit exceedingly hard with slower rates of fire – such as a shotgun or sniper rifle – may draw multiple cards to a single shot slot, thus avoiding the recoil penalties the system tries to emulate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This can be a wonky process to resolve – it’s certainly slow going with new players. Until you get used to it, this is another part of the game that stunts the tempo of action. Obviously this is a cost of modeling the video game with a high level of detail, but it can be an outright turnoff as it highlights the shortcomings of board games and their inability to obfuscate and resolve math.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this level of detail isn't all bad. What you sacrifice in momentum, you gain in realism. This system acutely captures the unique qualities of various firearms. Sub-machine guns spray several weak shots. Battle rifles fire tighter groupings and hit with power. Light machine guns spray all over the place but can level a building. Weapon attachments are mixed in with the loot, allowing you to alter a firearm’s properties mid-game. This includes optics, barrels, magazines, and stocks. It’s exceedingly cool and really juices up the impact of scavenging for supplies in the battle royale mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end result is a weapon system that actually boasts gunplay. No other board or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tabletop-game-alternatives-to-warhammer-40000">miniatures game</a> I've played has so meticulously modeled this key feature of first person shooters. It’s a fantastic accomplishment and absolutely the standout feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this wonderful feat, Apex Legends: The Board Game offers several other killer features. Characters are expertly modeled. They have asymmetric tactical abilities and ultimates that affect the battlefield in various ways. You can pop smoke, call in airstrikes, and deploy drones. Each character is also paired with a unique deck of cards that can be played to tweak actions and react to opponents’ maneuvers. This creates a nifty fog of war, although again, at the cost of possibly slowing down the pace of play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another crowd pleaser is the variety of modes on offer. The battle royale option is the key offering, including a distillation of the final moments of the video game’s finale. This includes a barrier that closes on the battlefield, forcing combatants into tighter and tighter area. But there are also deathmatch, VIP, and capture the flag options. Each of these is fully realized and not at all an afterthought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those sickos who can’t get enough, this game also will be arriving with expansion products for additional characters as well as a new board and environment. Most notably, there is a sophisticated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solitaire</a> / <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-op</a> addition that adds AI behavior trees to each of the core game’s protagonists. This mode works fairly well, producing mostly logical enemy actions that sometimes surprise and dazzle. Again, much like the rich base game ruleset, it can be a sluggish pace to familiarize yourself with this additional layer of rules, but it certainly settles down once you’ve become comfortable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a first-person shooter airdropping to your tabletop, Apex Legends: The Board Game is a solid effort and certainly a success. There are challenges involved and the tempo can really drag as players learn the systems and assess the wide swath of options on their turn. Once familiarity sets in and the game starts collapsing towards that 60-90 minute estimated playtime, the bliss of gunplay coupled with dynamic action and a multi-faceted loot system truly shine. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXVy?object_uuid=1a4cdcfc-6638-451d-b767-27674f9d015b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 26, 2025 7:34 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Apex Legends: The Board game is a huge, intricately designed game that can be both overwhelming and thrilling. All of the moving parts make for occasionally clunky and slow gameplay, but it’s reliably a fierce one full of individuality. There’s nothing quite like this on the market, and that makes up for any shortcomings.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-the-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

This game just made its way to PC in late January, and it's one of the best RPGs to release in the last five years. If you haven't yet played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, you can grab both games together in the Twin Pack for $59.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, you can save $10 off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>.

Bethesda also has a solid deal on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and now is the best time to jump in and prepare for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-dlc-the-order-of-the-giants-finally-has-a-release-date">The Order of Giants DLC</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also save on three major 2025 indie games: R.E.P.O., Schedule I, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-review">Blue Prince</a>.

Finally, R.E.P.O. is a wonderful time with friends that is sure to cause both laughs and headaches. All of these smaller games are generally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-steam-games-on-your-phone">great to stream to your phone</a> if you want a more mobile experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for deep discounts, I recommend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/29/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-review">Crash Bandicoot N.

While you'll only save $5 during the Steam Summer Sale, this is the lowest we've seen this game yet. If you've been on the fence about picking this one up, it's not likely to dip much further until late this year, especially since it is one of the highest-rated games of the year.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Amazon Prime Day Arrives at the End of the Steam Sale</h3><div catalogid="a568cc81-560f-48fe-bbf9-5308ce73a03f" id="223504"><div id="223504" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>All Early Prime Day Deals</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Steam Summer Sale is ongoing right now, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-everything-we-know-so-far">Amazon Prime Day</a> is set to kick off on July 8.
