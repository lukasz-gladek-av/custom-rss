"If you look up at the sky at night in a hot spring, you can see a very beautiful sky," Kojima said. "If you zoom in there, various things will appear, so please play around with it." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What you find may not be to everyone's taste, however — "it might cause certain people to cringe hard," Kojima admitted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We recently learned that Kojima <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-made-significant-changes-to-death-stranding-2-because-playtesters-thought-it-was-too-good">changed the game halfway through because playtesting results were "too good,"</a> and he doesn't want his work to be "mainstream."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review"><u>Death Stranding 2 review</u></a> returned a 9/10. We said: "Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a triumphant sequel that emphatically delivers on the promise of its original."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't forget, Hideo Kojima is also working on a live-action <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-movie-coming-from-a24-kojima-productions"><u>Death Stranding film with A24</u></a>, and we recently learned that a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-is-getting-an-anime-adaptation-hideo-kojima-says"><u>Death Stranding anime is in the works, too</u></a>.

The result was seen as a win by Helldivers 2's community, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-fan-makes-cape-design-out-of-steam-reviews">got to work designing their own versions of the game's commemorative capes</a> sporting the game's then-plummeting Steam review score graph.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, a year later, Arrowhead has finally released an official version for all players — with the graph-like design now dubbed the "Pillars of Freedom".</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In honor of their unquestioning commitment to the defense of Managed Democracy, the Helldivers have been awarded a commemorative cape," Arrowhead wrote via a new, in-universe update posted on social media.

"I'll be wearing this one for a while.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Sonic and friends will get three Secret Lair drops, and we've got the first look at one of them.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering has had plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-lair-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Secret Lair crossovers this year,</a> from SpongeBob to Deadpool, and one more is speeding onto the scene next month. Sonic the Hedgehog is getting three individual Secret Lair drops, and we've got the exclusive first look at one that's all about artifacts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the gallery below to see all 7 cards in the Turbo Gear Secret Lair drop:</strong></p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering – Secret Lair x Sonic: Turbo Gear</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-best-sellers">Final Fantasy crossover</a>, which is an entire draftable Magic set alongside four pre-constructed Commander decks, this Sonic crossover follows the blueprint of similar tie-ins by being limited to three Secret Lair drops. Secret Lair is what Magic calls its series of timed releases that contain just a handful of specific cards with special art, and they are all sold direct by Wizards of the Coast rather than in randomized packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In this case, the Turbo Gear drop has six exisiting Magic cards redone with new Sonic-themed art and names, as well as one token card. That includes a few fitting staples of Magic's most popular format, Commander, like Swiftfoot Boots and Lighting Greaves – because of course Sonic's shoes deserve their own cards. Also of note, a legendary vehicle called the Weatherlight is here as Tornado, Sonic's Biplane, and thanks to a recent rules change, you could actually have that be your Commander if you are so inclined.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">WOTC says this drop is designed to complement the cards in another one of the drops that focuses on Sonic's characters themselves. While we don't have those to reveal, an example given in Turbo Gear's store description is equipping The Reaver Cleaver, reimagined here as Knuckles's Gloves, to Knuckles himself. This idea goes hand-in-hand with other crossover drops, like 2023's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-magic-the-gathering-crossover-secret-lair-spoilers">Tomb Raider</a>, where the reprinted cards are meant to fit nicely with the new Legendary creatures, almost like a little "build your own Commander deck" starter kit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Turbo Gear Secret Lair drop (as well as the other two) will go on sale on July 14 at 9am PT on <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official Secret Lair website</a>, and will cost $29.99 for the non-foil version or $39.99 for foil. You better get there on time, too, because they will only be available in a limited quantity – and if other recent crossovers are any indication, they will likely sell out fast. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.
