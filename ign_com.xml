            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Gotta' get them all.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon is one of those franchises that has infiltrated pretty much every medium. Whether you're a fan of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order">Pokémon games</a>, anime, or the trading card game, there is a seemingly endless amount of new content for you to peruse at any given time. There's so much, in fact, that it can almost be hard to find the perfect Pokémon gift for yourself or the fan in your life without trudging through piles of search results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, if you're specifically looking for a really cool Pokémon jigsaw puzzle, I have scouted out this specific topic for you. Below I've listed out some of the very best options currently available on Amazon for both adults and kids of varying ages. Some of these puzzles are a <em>lot</em> more challenging than others, so just make sure you check the piece count before you bite off more than you can chew.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ravensburger Pokémon Challenge Jigsaw Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">A good challenge for adults</h3><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218908"><div id="218908" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ravensburger Pokémon Challenge Jigsaw Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Pokémon puzzle I'd recommend is for more advanced puzzlers. It's 1,000 pieces and is stamped with the Ravensburger "Challenge" title, meaning it's not going to be a quick one. Featuring all of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-version/pokedex">original 150 Pokémon</a> all in one picture, it's a nostalgic blast from the past and fun to put together. It also comes from Ravensburger, which is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">most-trusted jigsaw puzzle brands</a> out there. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buffalo Games Retro Pixel Pokémon Chart Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">For fans of the video games</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218909"><div id="218909" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buffalo Games Retro Pixel Pokémon Chart Puzzle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Great for fans of the original video games.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're anything like me, you likely have fond memories of playing Pokémon on your Game Boy for hours on end and this puzzle hits a similar nostalgic vein. This glorious 2,000 piece jigsaw puzzle from Buffalo Games showcases the original 150 Pokémon once again, but this time they are pixelated and perfectly organized. With the higher piece count and nice blue border around the edges, this Pokémon puzzle is a great option for anyone looking to proudly frame and display their completed work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like the piece count on this puzzle, you should also check out our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">largest puzzles available now</a>. They scale up beyond 40,000 pieces.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buffalo Games Pokémon Fan Favorites Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">For younger kids</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218910"><div id="218910" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buffalo Games Pokémon Fan Favorites Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first two puzzles on this list are targeted more toward adults, but if you're looking for a good option for younger kids, this 100 piece puzzle is my top pick. It features a ton of fan favorite Pokémon, primarily from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation. You can see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-diamond-pearl-platinum-version/Rayquaza">Rayquaza</a> right in the middle there and Pikachu all the way at the bottom. At 100 pieces it's fairly easy for younger kids to piece together while still providing a really cool image for fans of the franchise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buffalo Games Four Pokémon Puzzle Boards</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Starter option for preschoolers</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218911"><div id="218911" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buffalo Games Four Pokémon Puzzle Boards</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Starter puzzles for preschoolers.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for a good puzzle gift for kids just getting into puzzles, this four pack is an excellent option. It says it's made for ages 4+, but I got this same pack for my niece and nephew when they were around three years old and they had no problem putting it together. Each puzzle depicts a different set of Pokémon and features between 12 and 48 pieces so kids can scale up the difficulty if they are really into it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3D Master Ball Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">The best Pokemon puzzle gift</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="219020"><div id="219020" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3D Master Ball Puzzle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>A good gift for all ages.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the absolute <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-toys">best Pokémon toys</a> on the market are Poké Balls. So naturally, there is a 3D puzzle version available. At only 54 pieces, it's fairly easy to put together and even easier to display. It comes with a stand that will hold your completed puzzle up on a shelf or a desk. This is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">best puzzle gifts</a> currently available for Pokémon fans right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tips for Buying Pokémon Puzzles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who has done quite a bit of puzzle research (and quite a bit of puzzling), I have a few suggestions to help you narrow down your search for the perfect fit. Here are a couple of key things to look out for when buying a Pokémon puzzle:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Make sure it's a trusted brand</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first thing you'll want to do before you buy <em>any </em>jigsaw puzzle online is check what brand it's from. There are some puzzle brands that are more trusted than others, many of which I've featured on this list already. A good brand tends to have higher quality puzzles, which means higher quality materials. And for Pokémon puzzles specifically, they will likely be selling the puzzles in an official capacity via licensing the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When in doubt, I'd suggest reading through Amazon reviews to see what people thought. Things to watch out for are missing pieces, thin cardboard, and obvious AI usage.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Get the right piece count for the occasion</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Another important thing to think about is who you're buying the puzzle for. If it's a gift for an experienced puzzler, 1,000 pieces and above is probably ideal. But if it's for a novice or a younger audience, then 500 or below is probably your best bet. Larger puzzles tend to take a <em>lot </em>longer and if you don't have a dedicated space set up for puzzling you'll likely never finish. This is where a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-tables">decent puzzle table</a> really comes in handy.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 3, 2025 2:30 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="article-subtitle">Not yet available for streaming.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-puzzles]]></content:encoded>
