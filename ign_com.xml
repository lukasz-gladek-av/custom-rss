            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cygames and Konami Digital Entertainment announced today that they have resolved their patent disagreement regarding Cygames’ mobile title Umamusume: Pretty Derby.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umamusume: Pretty Derby is a hugely popular anime racehorse-girl management game in which racehorses are reborn as cute anime girls, complete with equine ears and tails. The franchise started off in 2018 as an anime, followed by a Japan-only release of the mobile game in 2021. In the game, players can talk to, train and manage horse-girls like Special Week and Mejiro McQueen, sharing in their triumphs and losses. As a result, the Umamusume franchise has inspired a cult following, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-dev-reminds-fans-to-follow-the-rules-when-visiting-the-real-life-japanese-racehorses-behind-their-favorite-anime-horse-girls">many fans have become interested in the real-life Japanese racehorses behind their favorite characters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in March 2023, Konami filed a lawsuit against Cygames, claiming that Cygame’s Umamusume: Pretty Derby infringed upon 18 of its patents. Konami originally called for over 4 billion yen (approx. $26 million at current exchange rates) in damages, and for Cygames to cease all production, usage and distribution of the mobile game. In response, Cygames requested invalidation trials against all the patents involved.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cygames revealed in a <a href="https://pdf.cyberagent.co.jp/C4751/lAG8/V61w/TjOR.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>press release</u></a> today that it has decided to settle the disagreement to ensure that players can continue to enjoy Umamusume: Pretty Derby in the long run. Despite this decision, Cygames “remains confident that no patent infringement has occurred.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both Konami and Cygames expressed respect for each other’s creators and games in their press releases about the settlement. Cygames stated that their group company “respects the efforts of creators at companies in the game industry, including Konami Digital Entertainment, and the numerous games they have created.” In turn, Konami <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/release/20251107/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a> that “we will respect each other’s creative works and strive to provide content and services that please our customers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a <a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/news/id-23172/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>press release</u></a> from 2023, Cygames had been in discussion with Konami about patent rights “pertaining to certain aspects of Umamusume: Pretty Derby’s game systems and programs,” however, it seems Konami disagreed with Cygames and filed the lawsuit. Both companies have been secretive about exactly which aspects of Umamusume: Pretty Derby caused the disagreement. Considering Konami’s history of making sports management games like Powerful Pro Baseball, it is possible that Umamusume: Pretty Derby’s in-game system for training its anime horse girls was part of the issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both companies stress that due to a confidentiality agreement, the details of the settlement will not be made public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid confirmation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026"><u>GTA 6 really has been delayed again</u></a>, we have word that Rockstar's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2"><u>Red Dead Redemption 2</u></a> has become the fourth best-selling game of all time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As detailed in publisher <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/2b782ec8-e583-4f7b-a213-86f2d1dbce40" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Take-Two's investor call</u></a> yesterday (November 6), the sequel has sold over 79 million units — making it the "best-selling title of the last seven years in the U.S. based on dollar sales" — and taking sales of the entire series to 106 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To give that some context, think of all the hugely successful games that have been released in the last seven years — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons"><u>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy"><u>Hogwarts Legacy</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring"><u>Elden Ring</u></a>, to name but a few — as well as everything that's released over the last few <em>decades</em>. Apart from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/minecraft"><u>Minecraft</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v"><u>GTA 5</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wii-sports"><u>Wii Sports</u></a>, which have sold 350 million, 220 million, and 82.9 million copies, respectively, Red Dead Redemption 2 has outsold everything.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With 79 million sales, that puts Red Dead 2 just ahead of the prior fourth-place Mario Kart 8's estimated 78.02 million sales, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pubg-battlegrounds"><u>PUBG</u></a> (75 million), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-oregon-trail"><u>The Oregon Trail</u></a> (65 million), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terraria"><u>Terraria</u></a> (64 million), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt"><u>The Witcher 3</u></a> (60 million), and the original 1985 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros"><u>Super Mario Bros</u></a>. (58 million).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You'd think then, that Red Dead Redemption 3 is a dead cert. But Rockstar has yet to announce a sequel. Earlier this week, Rockstar Games co-founder and former lead writer Dan Houser said he’d feel more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-says-red-dead-redemption-3-will-probably-happen-and-hed-feel-a-bit-sad-about-it-because-it-was-a-cohesive-two-game-arc"><u>sad to learn Red Dead Redemption 3 was in development without him than he feels about GTA 6, but admits the game "will probably happen."</u></a> As lead writer, Houser wrote almost all of Rockstar’s games, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-co-founder-leaves-company-dan-houser-red-dead-redemption-gta"><u>having left the company over five years ago</u></a>, Houser recently confirmed to IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dan-houser-says-gta-6-will-be-great-but-thinks-the-world-probably-had-enough-gta-from-me-in-first-comments-since-leaving-rockstar"><u>GTA 6 won’t have a story or a character set he developed</u></a>, but expects the game to be great nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Of course, letting go of something I worked on in one way or another for like 20-odd years, and wrote on them for the last 10 or 11 that came out, wrote all of them, or you know, lead writer on all of them, whatever it was… letting go of that is a big change. And sad in a way,” Houser said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because each of the [Grand Theft Auto] games was a kind of standalone story it’s not quite the same as… I think probably it would be in some ways sadder if someone continued on Red Dead, because it was a cohesive two-game arc. That might be more sad to hear someone working on that. But again, that will probably happen too. I don't own the IP. That was part of the deal. It's a privilege to work on stuff, but you don't necessarily own it.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, Roger Clark, who played Arthur Morgan, the main playable protagonist of Red Dead Redemption 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arthur-morgan-actor-certain-rockstar-will-make-red-dead-redemption-3-eventually">said he was “certain” fans will see Red Dead Redemption 3 “one day,”</a> but qualified that statement by saying he had no idea when that would be. Clark also ruled out the return of Arthur Morgan in the game, should it come to be. If you’ve played Red Dead Redemption 2, this might seem like stating the obvious, but there’s always the chance Rockstar may consider another prequel of some kind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m certain we will see Red Redemption 3 one day,” Clark said. “When that will be — I have absolutely no idea. Don’t count on Arthur’s involvement either. His story has been told, I feel.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/before-rockstar-i-was-just-a-jobbing-actor-off-broadway-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-on-the-red-dead-redemption-2-effect">a subsequent interview with IGN</a>, Clark expanded on his thoughts: “Yeah, that got really picked up! I would have thought that was obvious though. Wouldn’t you? And it’s not like I have any insider information whatsoever, but of course there’s going to be another Red Dead. It sold over 60 million copies!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two said it himself. He said GTA and Red Dead are prominent franchises for Rockstar Games and that they will be returning to them in the future. So there’s no doubt there will be another Red Dead. But if Arthur Morgan will be involved? I highly doubt it, to be honest. And I think it’s going to be quite some time before we even see a snifter of anything new Red Dead related. I have no idea how it would pan out, but I wouldn’t bet on Arthur being a part of it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Red Dead Redemption 2 is widely considered to be one of the best video games of all time. We thought it was a masterpiece, too, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-review"><u>IGN's review returning a 10/10</u></a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-winners-and-losers-of-the-gta-6-delay.1347028/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not sure if you’ve heard, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">GTA 6 has been delayed again</a>. Yes, Rockstar has pushed back Grand Theft Auto’s return to its Miami-inspired setting of Vice City to November 19, 2026. I, for one, am sad about this, as I’m sure you may well also be. But this announcement isn’t necessarily bad news for everyone. So, let’s see who may profit and who might take a hit from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6’s</a> latest change of date. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Spring 2026 Game - Winners</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saros">Saros</a>, and any other game currently planning on a March or April 2026 release. I’m sure a huge sigh of relief was let out at the South Korean headquarters of Pearl Abyss and the Scandinavian studios of IO Interactive and Housemarque. Not only should it benefit the sales of these games due to players’ money that was set aside for GTA 6’s previous May date now being freed up to be spent elsewhere, but it may even give them a little wiggle room to delay a few weeks themselves and avoid that dreaded crunch in order to get out before Rockstar’s behemoth — something <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-beyond-early-2026">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has already done by moving “beyond early 2026”</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">PC Gamers - Losers</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sorry, PC gamers, but if history is anything to go by, then the wait for GTA 6 has just got even longer for you. If Rockstar is to follow its normal pattern of releases, it could well be a couple of years yet until the state of Leonida makes its way to Windows. For reference, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> launched on consoles on October 26, 2018, but didn’t find its way onto Steam until a whole year later November 5, 2019. The wait for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> on PC was even longer, with its April 14, 2015 release coming 19 months after its original September 17, 2013 console arrival. So, apologies again, but if PC is your chosen place to play, you may well be looking deep into 2027 or even early 2028 to play GTA 6.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GTA 6’s Developers - It’s Complicated</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In theory, delaying GTA 6 is a good thing for the development team at Rockstar, hopefully preventing excessive crunch impacting the studio as it races towards deadlines. But this week also saw 30 to 40 Rockstar employees fired from their positions at the company for what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-studio-rockstar-accuses-fired-employees-of-leaking-confidential-information-in-a-public-forum">Rockstar describes as leaking “confidential information in a public forum”</a>. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-dev-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-in-sudden-firing-of-dozens-of-staff">Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claims this was "blatant" and "ruthless" union busting</a>, though. This is a developing situation with no clear answers at the moment. What <em>is </em>clear, though, is that having a few dozen fewer employees definitely won’t ease the burden on the developers still at the studio. Let’s hope that the theoretical crunch time saved by the delay won’t have been completely negated by this reduction in workforce.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Mandalorian and Grogu - Winners</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Pedro Pascal wins again. Yes, The Mandalorian’s feature film debut alongside his little green friend, Grogu, is scheduled to release on May 22, 2026 — the same week as GTA 6’s previous release date, May 26, 2026. Well, the upcoming Star Wars film now seemingly has a clear runway to rake it in at the box office, with people being more likely to leave their house now that the distraction of Grand Theft Auto glueing them to their TV screens is being taken away. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Microsoft - Loser</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft and its Xbox Game Studios are due for a big 2026. But with no release dates currently known for its big hitters — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable">Fable</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War E-Day</a>, and 2026’s Call of Duty included — could this spell a problem for the publisher? We can safely assume that Call of Duty would’ve been eyeing up a similar release date to GTA 6’s new November one, which would no doubt impact its playerbase, and surely at least one other game from that list has a late 2026 window pencilled in. Could this scupper Microsoft’s plan for the end of next year and mean one or two games have to get pushed back to early 2027? Of course, it would be wise to get something out the door before Grand Theft Auto arrives, but there’s only so fast developers can work, and I’d much rather wait than hear more horror stories of studio crunch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Summer Game Events - Winners</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The bad news? You won’t be playing GTA 6 in late May. The good news? You’re now free to attend IGN Live in early June, our special event in Los Angeles, open to the public to come and enjoy all the fun of new and upcoming video games. But apart from that, it also means that all of the summer shows, such as Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, are in no trouble of being overshadowed by the release of Grand Theft Auto just a couple of weeks prior. This means we can enjoy all of the new game announcements and looks at gameplay without having to tear ourselves away from Vice City. I’d just recommend that nobody pick November as their chosen release date at the end of those trailers.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel’s Wolverine - Loser</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently scheduled for a “late 2026” release window, one of Sony’s biggest hitters for next year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>, may want to get out before the end of October at the latest to avoid being impacted by GTA 6. In truth, any game looking to launch towards the end of next year is probably scrambling to put together a plan right now, and it will be no different between Insomniac and PlayStation as they work out the best course of action.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Black Friday 2026 Console Sellers - Winners</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 will now drop just before Black Friday 2026, so expect both PS5 and Xbox Series X/S bundles to be in more demand than ever across Capitalism’s favourite weekend of the year. Expect low stock as electronic stores around the world make all the money they can as people get their Grand Theft Auto machines into their homes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Us, The Players - Losers (and Winners)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Another six months of waiting may feel painful right now, but let’s try to look on the bright side. We get our summer back. Go outside. Enjoy an ice cream. Run around on the beach and get sand between your toes. Catch up with an old friend in a leafy beer garden. Watch every minute of the World Cup. November will be here before you know it. Those shorter winter days are much better suited to locking all the doors and playing games all day, anyway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.
