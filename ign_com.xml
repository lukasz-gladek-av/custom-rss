            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The alleged risk of using a well-known <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> exploit is causing widespread confusion among the game's community, fuelled by a dire warning from a senior player that supposedly originates from the app's own development team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said warning states that Pokémon Go's developers are aware of the exploit in question — which allows users to interact with in-game locations from further away than normally possible — and consider it "a violation of the Terms of Service of the game." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Continued use of the exploit is detectable by the developer's anti-cheat teams, the warning goes on to claim, and risks users' accounts being flagged for cheating — an offense that can eventually result in a permanent account ban. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The appearance of this message, and the claim it is being passed on from Pokémon Go's makers, has sparked a firestorm of debate, primarily over the rights and (mostly) wrongs of this exploit being viewed as cheating in the same vein as more nefarious tactics. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many players have said that this "trick" simply makes use of a unintended bug in how the game functions, and is not comparable to the tools some players use to actively break the game, such as by using third-party apps and hacks to spoof their location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a debate over the veracity of the message itself — both over its origins, which appear to be from a senior player marked as a Community Ambassador who has spoken to the game's developers, and over the likely intent behind what was said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To understand the nuances here, it's worth taking a look at the issue in more detail. At a base level, the exploit allows players to access a raid lobby slightly beyond their normal interaction radius via a Daily or Premium Raid Pass, rather than by using a more expensive Remote Raid Pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Performing the exploit — referred to locally among players as "flying," "floating," or "tricking" — is clearly not intended behavior, but can hardly be considered game-breaking. Accessing a raid lobby that's less than 100m away but slightly out of your normal range is considered by many players to simply be a convenience — and potentially an aid to taking part in more raids overall, even if this is done so without the top-tier Remote Raid Pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, a simple glance at the game's Terms of Service (TOS) shows that, according to the letter of the law, this could indeed fall under the game's description of cheating as it stands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN contacted the Pokémon Go development team to ask about the origins of the warning, whether the exploit was indeed considered cheating, and what actions players might expect if they continued to use it. In response, a spokesperson pointed us back to the game's <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/terms" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOS document</a>, and specifically its section on cheating, which we'll quote below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, it's entirely possible to see how this exploit <em>could </em>fall under the TOS' definition of using "techniques to alter or falsify a device's location" and therefore — again, according to the letter of the law — is something that <em>could </em>be considered cheating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But by pointing IGN back to its TOS, the Pokémon Go development team is also — deliberately or not — highlighting something potentially crucial around this issue's enforcement. And that's the fact that, once again, according to the letter of the law, playing with multiple accounts is <em>also </em>considered cheating — despite it being something that a percentage of the game's playerbase does, with absolutely zero infraction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this may all ultimately boil down to is someone purportedly asking the Pokémon Go development team for its view on an issue that the game's makers would obviously never sanction, but which seems unlikely to suddenly result in waves of players being banned. And yet, because of the murky origins of the warning, and because nuance can be difficult when messages get passed over the internet, players have now been left aggrieved and concerned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will the exploit stick around in the game forever? It seems unlikely. Will players suddenly find themselves banned for using it while it's still possible? This seems unlikely too. But, we should state, this is just one reading of the situation, in lieu of any formal statement being provided — something which, if formalised, would likely only prompt the need for actual enforecement, which the majority of players seem to be against.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is out today, and the game's credits have now confirmed Nintendo's main new voice actor behind Donkey Kong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unusually for a Nintendo game, Bananza's credits list out each of the game's voice actors with their specific roles — and right at the top is Kouji Takeda, credited as Donkey Kong in all of the game's various language options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Takeda, who voiced Donkey Kong in the Japanese dub of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie">Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, now appears to have taken over as the video game voice of Donkey Kong as well, unifying the ape's grunts across mediums. This was something that was previously speculated — though not confirmed — when his name popped up in the credits of Switch 2 launch title Mario Kart World, while DK's previous veteran voice actor did not.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagled-eyed Nintendo fans noted that Takashi Nagasako, who previously voiced Donkey Kong for 21 years, was no longer credited for the character as of Mario Kart World. At the time, this was discussed as likely yet another change by Nintendo of its long-term voice acting cast, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-and-toads-veteran-voice-actor-says-nintendo-told-her-shed-been-replaced-on-switch-2-launch-day-as-mario-kart-world-released-without-her-in-it">the replacement of Princess Peach and Toad actress Samantha Kelly</a> after 18 years and more than 70 games, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-charles-martinet-is-not-involved-in-super-mario-bros-wonder">retirement of Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi</a> after almost 30 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza's credits also reveal a new voice for Pauline, with actress and musician Jenny Kidd now voicing the character for its English dub. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Super Mario Odyssey, Pauline is voiced by Kate Higgins, who also sings the game's theme song Jump Up, Super Star! But perhaps this change is to be expected — after all, Bananza's Pauline is now a younger, 13-year-old incarnation.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have some interesting theories around this version of Pauline being a precursor to the character we see in Odyssey, something that would make Bananza a prequel — and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-wont-say-why-donkey-kong-bananzas-pauline-is-13-years-old-specifically-wants-players-to-puzzle-out-the-answer-themselves">we even asked the game's development team for their take</a>. But to say more, for now, would venture into spoiler territory — something that's best left avoided until you play the game for yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Intrigued? We dubbed the game as a "a brilliant successor to Super Mario Odyssey and a smashing return for a classic Nintendo character" in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>. "Every element comes together in complete harmony to create Nintendo’s first Switch 2 masterpiece."

He also suggested that there was a little confusion about whether Slitterhead was a horror or action game, which muddied the message, but was proud of the work Bokeh developers did to make Slitterhead such an unusual game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"As for how long we’ll be able to continue, it becomes a difficult topic, especially if we take my age into consideration," Toyama admitted, as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-creator-keiichiro-toyama-is-already-working-on-his-next-game-and-its-not-a-slitterhead-sequel/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>. "However, I believe that moving forward, I also have to pass the baton to the next generation. As a studio, we’re still midway to reaching our goal."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what his next game will be?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can’t reveal the exact details, but we have started working on our next title. In the beginning, we wanted this to be a studio where we could do many different things, like implementing the ideas of younger generations and even working on more light-hearted projects," he said, admitting that even though Bokeh's indie status allows it to try creative ideas, it's a long way from being able to do whatever it wants.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Once again, we have to pour in all our efforts as a studio and prove that we are up to the task. We are currently working towards that goal. However, we’re still in the beginning phase, so I believe we’ll be able to reveal more details [about the new game] somewhere in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Toyama did stress that he did not conclude Slitterhead with "a sequel in mind," suggesting his next game will not be Slitterhead 2, although it's possible we'll get one in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We thought Slitterhead was mediocre, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-review"><u>securing a 5 in IGN's review</u></a>: "Like a bloody blade worn down by a few too many battles, Slitterhead grows increasingly dull over time and ultimately just doesn’t cut it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Silent Hill franchise itself?
