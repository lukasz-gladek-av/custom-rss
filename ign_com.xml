It normally runs in the $30 range, but Amazon currently has it <a href="https://zdcs.link/QV73Mg?object_uuid=34e68c00-b671-4171-b832-c4c21420886d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on sale for $12.99</a>, which is less than half price. That's quite a deal on a game that's worth a look.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Maps of Misterra on Sale for $12.99</h2><div catalogid="8d6eada7-04f8-4e1d-8a7e-221edc573a17" id="216791"><div id="216791" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Maps of Misterra</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Maps of Misterra, players are cartographers, seeking to chart an unknown island. You’ll start with some end-game goals of what you think the island is supposed to look like, and initially you’ll place terrain tiles on a shared board trying to match that map. But exploration is a tricky business and you can be mistaken: other players can overwrite your placements with their own until someone takes an extra action to confirm that tile, fixing it in place. Terrain effects, such as being able to see further atop mountains, or travel further over steppe, lend extra weight to the strategy and flavor to the theme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result of this clever, two-step, discover and confirm mechanic is a fascinating dynamic and interactive puzzle where your goals push and pull against those of other players, and the island takes shape around them. This also provides a real sense of revelation, of venturing into the unknown as every version of the island is different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you enjoy getting into the theme of a game, you can also have a great time loudly proclaiming that your suggestions are the absolute truth against the nonsense other players are trying to foist on the map. It’s fun as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a>, too, against an automated opponent so you still get the sense of playing against an active player. The slightly messy interaction might put off some players, but at this price it’s worth a look for its sheer oddness.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See more cool board games</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance writer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

Dark Odyssey is the real headline here, as it includes a war chest of cosmetic treats for all God of War Ragnarök owners across PlayStation 5 and PC. It’ll arrive as a free update March 20.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything included in Dark Odyssey features a clean, black-and-gold look that will no doubt have Kratos and co looking better than ever as they tear their way through Norse mythology. Atreus and Freya both receive their own cosmetic sets as part of the patch, too, as do a variety of the player’s shields and weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The show-stealer, though, is a Dark Odyssey appearance and armor set for Kratos that hearkens back to a skin originally only rewarded to players who managed to beat God of War 2 on God Mode difficulty. Players can claim the content in any Lost Items chest in the base game or immediately in God of War Ragnarök’s roguelike Valhalla mode after the update drops. The patch will also finally introduce the option to customize the appearance of Kratos’ weapons without sacrificing each weapon’s respective ability.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">God of War Ragnarok Dark Odyssey Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dark Odyssey Armor &amp; Appearance for Kratos</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dark Odyssey Kratos Appearance</li><li>Dark Odyssey Armor Set for Kratos (Dark Odyssey Breastplate, Dark Odyssey Bracers, Dark Odyssey Belt) </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dark Odyssey Companion Armor  </strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dark Odyssey Vestment for Atreus</li><li>Dark Odyssey Witch Frock for Freya </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dark Odyssey Weapon Appearances &amp; Attachments</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dark Odyssey Leviathan Axe [Appearance] &amp; Dark Odyssey Knob [Attachment] </li><li>Dark Odyssey Blades of Chaos [Appearance] &amp; Dark Odyssey Handles [Attachment]  </li><li>Dark Odyssey Draupnir Spear [Appearance] &amp; Dark Odyssey Hind [Attachment]  </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dark Odyssey Shield Appearances &amp; Rönd</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dark Odyssey Guardian Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Dauntless Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Stone Wall Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Shatter Start Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Onslaught Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Spartan Aspis Shield [Appearance]</li><li>Dark Odyssey Rönd</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">God of War Ragnarök released in late 2022, so one simple update was never going to do the series’ 20-year history justice. Also included in Sony’s plans to celebrate God of War is a long list of other activities and offers for those who have stuck with Kratos’ story since the beginning. Highlights include a collection of some snazzy social media assets (that you can download <a href="https://sms.playstation.com/documents/70/God_of_War_-_20th_Anniversary_Fan_Kit.zip" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>here</u></a>), an art showcase coming as part of <a href="https://www.gallerynucleus.com/events/1072" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a collaboration with Los Angeles’ Gallery Nucleus</u></a>, new merch, sales, multiple vinyl releases covering the franchise’s history, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“On behalf of everyone at Santa Monica Studio, we are immeasurably grateful to have had the chance to build the legacy of this series with and for you, the fans of God of War,” the studio said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on how you can celebrate 20 years of God of War, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-the-concert-world-tour-coming-with-music-from-god-of-war-the-last-of-us-and-more"><u>an upcoming PlayStation symphony world tour that kicks off next month</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-are-looking-for-hidden-messages-amid-black-hole-disaster<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Easter eggs and secret messages are old hat for many ongoing games, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> is no stranger to them either. So it's little surprise that amid an ongoing, calamitous conflict with the Illuminate, players are poring over the messages for hidden details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not caught up with the running narrative in Helldivers 2, here's a quick catch-up: developer Arrowhead has the Illuminate back and pushing the lines of galactic warfare as the latest threat to Super Earth. The eerie foe is using a massive black hole to slowly consume entire planets, pushing it to <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1890025104643678643" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angel's Venture</a> and, now, <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1900413203336560904" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moradesh</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ironically, the black hole was initially created on Meridian <em>by </em>Super Earth, in an effort to wipe out a Terminid Super Colony. Arrowhead's got a particular penchant for "yes, and"-ing the outcomes of the galactic campaigns. The slow build to right now, with the Illuminate pretty much pushing a black hole slowly towards Super Earth, is the latest in a long line of dominoes.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING<br>EVACUATE PLANET<br>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING</p><p>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING<br>EVACUATE PLANET<br>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING</p><p>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING<br>EVACUATE PLANET<br>MORADESH EVACUATION WARNING <a href="https://t.co/G4vpaIgLpz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/G4vpaIgLpz</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1900413203336560904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So, now we're here: Moradesh is evacuating, and Helldivers are anticipating the next step of this cataclysmic campaign. Yet some are digging into the evacuation orders, trying to suss out a hidden meaning from the messages Arrowhead is broadcasting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit user Pinglyadya shared an image of what looks like an egg, hidden in the Moradesh videos. In the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jayjpb/comment/mhpnxc5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comments</a>, they go further, breaking down the potential morse code strings into dots and dashes, surmising that it all results in a few different codes: "045a5, 06efbc, e1b5f0 then 21232. We don't know what this is the code to but have fun."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The "06EFBC" code caught attention <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jawqur/comment/mhpoqeq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in another thread</a>, as it could correspond with the hex code for a shade of teal called Last Straw. Sounds ominous! Nothing concrete has surfaced beyond that, but at least a few fans are convinced there's something hidden in these messages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn't be the first time players have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-patch-01000202-addresses-general-game-stability-and-crashes-but-players-are-wondering-what-secrets-it-holds">gone diving for secrets in Arrowhead's updates</a>. With the Meridian Singularity slowly approaching Super Earth, though, I do wonder whether Helldivers have time to spare for this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead has, since the destruction of Moradesh, issued a new Major Order for players, tasking them with defending planets so Super Earth can construct a Penrose Energy Siphon and effect a "one-time reduction" in Dark Energy Accumulation.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">MAJOR ORDER: Following days of diligent resource collection and repurposing of enemy combatants, the Helldivers have enabled the construction of a partial blockade of the Meridian Singularity. The blockade is porous, but still moderately effective, and has slightly reduced the… <a href="https://t.co/ye33V6VKa6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ye33V6VKa6</a></p>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1900587754729140583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully, this can put a stop to the giant tear in space that's slowly encroaching on everything the Helldivers hold dear. And, possibly, put a few more secret messages out into the ether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all part of Helldivers 2's ongoing, community driven Galactic War, which has captured the attention of the game's community for over a year now. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024">The Illuminate invaded in December</a> with an initial alien force that added new enemies to fight against as well as brand new Super Earth colonies to fight on. These colonies introduced Helldivers 2’s first urban environments, with city streets packed with innocent civilians mind-controlled by the Illuminate. The Voteless, as they’re called by Super Earth, are little more than zombies who want nothing more than to team players limb from limb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
