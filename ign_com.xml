            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First light</a> is delayed two months for “further polish,” developer and publisher IO Interactive has announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The James Bond adventure video game was due out March 27, 2026, but will now release on May 27, 2026. In <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2003511022141817016" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement published online</a>, IOI said the delay would ensure it was able to deliver “the strongest possible version at launch.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that 007 First Light’s new release date is just a day after Grand Theft Auto 6 was due to be released before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">its latest delay</a> to November 19, 2026. Essentially, IOI has snapped up the release slot left vacant by Rockstar’s behemoth.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">007 First Light was thought to have benefited from the GTA 6 delay, coming out at the time just two months before GTA 6’s prior release date. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-io-interactive-interview-hakan-abrak-on-james-bond-dispatch-and-the-gta-6-delay" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesIndustry.biz</u></a> from last month, IOI CEO Hakan Abrak was asked about GTA 6 kindly getting out of 007’s way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It would be a lie not to say that obviously spring looks really good,” he replied. “I want to say in the same breath that GTA 6 is a welcome thing for the industry. I do believe a lot of gamers who maybe haven't played for a while will get into things again, and generally for the industry as a whole, I think that will be amazing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, GTA 6’s delay has given IOI even more room to breathe, and it’s snapped that extra time up to  give 007 First Light the best chance possible of having a strong launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, not all games can be great. In fact, many of them are not good, and some even fail to be simply okay. If you’re looking for all things good and great, then check out our list of the best-reviewed games of 2025. But this place, sadly, is not where they live. No, this is where I have the job of reminding you of all of the worst games we played this year. The ones that didn’t quite live up to expectations and received a score of five or below from IGN reviewers. Maybe you did enjoy some of these, and to that I say, all the power to you. Let us know in the comments which games featured on this list you did actually love playing. But before you scroll all the way down there, let’s talk about IGN’s worst-reviewed games of 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5 - Mediocre</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">What better way to kick this off than with a welcome tour? A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>, to be exact. A collection of minigames and digital museum displays designed to give you a better idea of the tech powering your new Nintendo console, this one just ended up committing a criminal cardinal sin by Nintendo standards — it just wasn’t fun. Our review described this “interactive brochure” as “a muddled collection of quaint tech demos and boring factoids”. Not exactly the best way to get everyone excited about a new generation of hardware, was it? And it didn’t even come packaged with the console. A standalone purchase isn’t exactly the best way to deliver your new spin on a digital manual. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At least the tech being shown off in Welcome Tour is very impressive, though, which sadly couldn’t be said for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kaiserpunk-review">Kaiserpunk<strong>. </strong></a>A city-builder that, unfortunately, suffered from significant performance issues at launch, ranging from “huge, save-killing bugs” to an interface that lacks “fairly basic functionality”, it provided unsolid foundations to build any metropolis on. If a fully-built sci-fi city is more your vibe, then maybe you could be tempted by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steel-seed-review">Steel Seed</a><strong>, </strong>an action-platform dripping in neon. But when we tell you that it’s actually a “stealth action game cursed by mediocrity”, then maybe you’ll be less interested. Hence, the five out of ten rating, which stands for “mediocre” here at IGN. Along those lines, if “30 mediocre hours of dodge rolling and sword swinging” sounds appealing, then maybe you want to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-limit-review">AI Limit</a>. A “soulslike without any soul”, this one just lacked the sort of creativity you’d hope for in what’s become a fairly played-out genre these days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of souls, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lost-soul-aside-review">Lost Soul Aside<strong> </strong></a>was a hotly anticipated PlayStation console exclusive this summer, which sadly didn’t quite live up to the hype. While it did come packed with some exciting combat, unfortunately, “repetitive story, derivative characters, and bland level design” couldn’t support it. Another game that fell foul of repetition was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/full-metal-schoolgirl-review">Full Metal Schoolgirl</a>, which you may not instantly see as a negative when considering it's an action roguelike — a genre grounded in attempting the same objectives over and over again — but when you hear that after “a couple runs, you've pretty much seen it all”, that isn’t ideal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Feeling like we’d pretty much seen it all before is exactly why we gave the<strong> </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-review">Battlefield 6 campaign</a><strong> </strong>a score of five, too. As our shockingly handsome reviewer said, the single-player offering is a “safe, dull reimagining of what Battlefield once was, rather than a bold reinvention of what it could be”, and I, for one, agree with him. It’s a short string of missions that doesn’t embrace the chaos naturally created in Battlefield 6’s multiplayer, instead feeling like a relic of a bygone age of FPSs. We also gave this year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 campaign</a> a less-than-shiny score, too, but it narrowly misses out on making this list due to us giving it a 6, because it at least tries to do something new, even if it isn’t very successful.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we head into the remaster, reboot, and reimagining section of proceedings. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yooka-replaylee-review">Yooka-Replayee<strong> </strong></a>aimed to bring the 2017 original into the modern day with some tweaks, but while improvements were made, we were of the opinion that “none of its changes do enough to bring it close to the 3D platforming standards of today”. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/double-dragon-revive-review">Double Dragon Revive</a><strong> </strong>attempted to breathe new life into the classic side-scrolling beat ‘em up, but ended up feeling “less a miraculous resurrection and more like exhuming a shambling corpse”. Similar things could be said for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/painkiller-2025-review">Painkiller</a><strong>, </strong>a reboot of People Can Fly’s 2004 cult-favourite, which again fell short, instead playing like a “mediocre resurrection of a classic trying to put a new cover on an old book and hoping it still has some relevance 21 years later”. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-labyrinth-review">Shadow Labyrinth<strong> </strong></a>did at least attempt to take something incredibly old and do something new with it. Unfortunately, this gritty, Metroidvania reinvention of Pac-Man was deemed to be “largely dull,” with crimes ranging from “annoying checkpointing to the one-note combat”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no shortage of checkpoints in racing games. Sorry, that’s the best segue I have for this one. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-motor-racing-review">Project Motor Racing<strong> </strong></a>is the most recent game we have on our list to score a five or below, as it failed to excite our reviewer, who said that “there are certainly glimpses of a competent racing sim here, but it is drastically unfinished”. On the other end of the racing spectrum was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wreckreation-review">Wreckreation</a>, not in terms of quality, as it also received a five, but in its very “arcadey” approach to action of four wheels. Disappointingly, it just didn’t reach the heights of the likes of its Burnout inspiration. Instead, “overflowing with ambition but ultimately plain and with no style to call its own, Wreckreation feels like a supermarket brand homage to a series of better arcade racers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s head into fantasy corner now and take a look at those sword-swinging games that just weren’t quite sharp enough this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yasha-legends-of-the-demon-blade-review">Yasha: Legends of the Demon Blade<strong> </strong></a>was yet another action roguelite to come out in 2025, but one that didn’t leave much of an impression, thanks to “repetitive levels and a flimsy story”. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blades-of-fire-review">Blades of Fire</a><strong> </strong>took an interesting approach to third-person action by placing an emphasis on creating your own bespoke swords through an involved blacksmithing process, which was admittedly quite good, but its “overly simplistic combat and a mediocre story mean it doesn’t forge a sharp enough edge to put its customizable weapons to good use”. And, finally, rounding out our list of games that received a review score of five from IGN this year, is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-review">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad</a>.<strong> </strong>A microtransaction-riddled interpretation of George R.R. Martin’s world, in which the recreation of HBO’s visual style is admittedly impressively done, it’s unfortunately hampered “by an overly grindy, pay-to-win live service model, and both its combat and homestead management are too tedious to keep things interesting on their own”.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4 - Bad</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Heading into the games that got a four, which represents “bad” on the IGN review scale, let’s stick with another beloved piece of fantasy literature that struggles to produce good video game adaptations. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-review">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game<strong> </strong></a>was an attempt to “cosify” Tolkien’s world and asked the age-old question, “What if Animal Crossing, but Hobbits?”. The answer, sadly, was a resounding “no”, as we described it as “a promising idea that turned out dreadfully boring and extremely buggy”.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Arguably, no other game arrived with as heavy a thud as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> did in 2025. The brainchild of former GTA dev, Leslie Benzies, this throwback third-person action-adventure was not only incredibly dull, but borderline broken. Sure, it looked like a blockbuster when viewed from a very specific, narrow angle, but on the whole, it failed to live up to any expectations that may have been held for it. “MindsEye’s flashy graphics and cinematics can’t hide its serious lack of substance and major performance problems”, says our review, and that tells you all you need to know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To round things off, we have a handful of early access games that we gave a score of four to this year. These include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-review-early-access">Hyper Light Breaker</a>, which we described as a “roguelite that currently feels hyper light on content and the wrong kind of broken”, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/la-quimera">La Quimera</a>,<strong> </strong>an “FPS version of a direct-to-video movie, with dialogue that is both poorly written and badly acted, middling combat, and an unfinished campaign”. Then there was EA’s reboot of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-early-access-review">Skate</a>,<strong> </strong>which we called<strong> </strong>a “faithful facsimile of the incredible feel of the old games, but its mobile game-style progression, dud dialogue, and cutesy art style make its early access debut drastically inferior to the originals in all other ways”. Unfortunately for Hyper Light Breaker, similar responses from both other critics and players eventually led to developer Heart Machine bringing development to a close. As for the other two, they remain developing projects, so let’s hope that these games fix their respective issues and have a better time in 2026 in the run-up to their full launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s it, all of the games that we at IGN scored a five or four out of ten this year. Believe it or not, nothing actually scored lower, so I’m glad to say there are no twos or threes to report this year. Did you actually love any of the games listed here? Let us know in the comments.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-dev-says-squadron-42-is-now-fully-playable-is-over-40-hours-in-length-and-is-still-on-track-for-2026-release-date</link>
            <guid>1391041</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> developer Cloud Imperium Games has told fans that the Mark Hamill-fronted single-player space adventure Squadron 42 is still on track for a 2026 release date — and not to expect “a long, drawn-out marketing campaign” beforehand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Founder and CEO Chris Roberts wrote in a <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/comm-link/transmission/20960-Letter-From-The-Chairman" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> that CIG is focusing on quality and polish as it moves toward an internal beta milestone and, eventually, a full release for Squadron 42 at some point next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re confident in the direction the game is headed and are fully focused on delivering,” Roberts said. “We know many of you are eager to play, and we’re looking forward to putting it in your hands. We don’t plan on a long, drawn-out marketing campaign as we’ve already done our share of trailers and gameplay previews. When it’s time, you (and the rest of the gaming world) will hear a lot more from us.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All chapters are said to be fully playable from beginning to end, and “we’ve been playing through the game ourselves regularly,” Roberts added. “Squadron 42 is a large game, over 40 hours in length, and it’s becoming increasingly clear how special it will be once the remaining polish, optimization, and bug fixing is complete.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “a big part of what makes this possible is the technology we’ve built at CIG over many years. The ability to move seamlessly from on foot, into a vehicle you can fly and move around inside, down to a planet or across star systems, all without loading screens, creates a level of immersion that’s very difficult to replicate. That combination of close-up interaction and galactic scale is at the core of what will make Squadron 42 so unique.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Equally important is the quality of the content itself. From writing and performance capture to characters, environments, ships, lighting, sound, cinematics, and design, the level of care across the entire game is something I’m incredibly proud of. Combined with deeply interactive systems, it creates an experience that pulls you into the world and keeps you there.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roberts, known for creating the Wing Commander series also starring Mark Hamill, showed off a Squadron 42 demo back in 2024. It was heavy on flashy cutscenes, with CGI representations of Hollywood stars such as Gillian Anderson, Henry Cavill, Gary Oldman, and Mark Strong mixed with on-rails turret action in a huge space battle. The demo ended with a first-person shooter segment as the alien enemy boarded the player’s ship.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Star Citizen itself, Roberts described 2025 as “the Year of Playability” for the space sim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was a year when more people played than ever before and spent more time in the ’verse than at any point in our history,” he said. “That momentum did not happen by chance. It came from a focused effort to improve quality of life, performance, and reliability, and to make the gameplay experience more engaging and rewarding to return to.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Citizen is reportedly set for a full release sometime in 2027 or 2028, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-raising-over-1-billion-from-players-star-citizen-dev-chris-roberts-hopes-squadron-42s-2026-launch-will-be-almost-as-big-an-event-as-gta-6">as Roberts has put it</a>, one or two years after the release of Squadron 42. No firm release window was offered in his latest blog post, but he did say next year will see the developer “continue improving stability and depth in Star Citizen while expanding and connecting core systems that shape how you play, from Engineering to Inventory, Crafting, Social Tools, and other foundational features, alongside expanding the playable universe itself.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Citizen is considered one of the most controversial projects in all video games. Over the 13 years since its crowdfunding drive began, Star Citizen has been called many things including a scam by those who wonder whether it will ever properly launch. Its virtual space ships, some of which cost hundreds of dollars, are often the focus of criticism. Roberts is said to have confirmed he's raised just over $1 billion for Star Citizen from players so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
