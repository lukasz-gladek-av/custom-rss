            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, it's true — Microsoft is bringing two of its hottest gaming franchises together for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series"><u>Fallout</u></a> Season 2 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</u></a> crossover event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're wondering how, exactly, that may work, the official Call of Duty X/Twitter account has shared a brief video teaser which shows silhouettes of Fallout TV series characters The Ghoul, Lucy, and Maximus in the smoke of war, with bullets whizzing by in the background.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Okie dokie — stay focused, stay alive," the text on the post reads. "[Fallout TV show] is coming to Call of Duty in Season 01 Reloaded."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Okie dokie - stay focused, stay alive ☢️<a href="https://twitter.com/falloutonprime?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@FalloutonPrime</a> is coming to Call of Duty in Season 01 Reloaded 💥 <a href="https://t.co/uyFl3mRDkG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/uyFl3mRDkG</a></p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/2001351763375325384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The implication here certainly seems to be that Call of Duty fans will see skins of those characters, which may or may not be tied to a premium event pass. Without further details — let alone a release date — it's hard to say for sure, though. We'll keep you posted, as always. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an opportune time to unite these two blockbuster games, of course. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-now-extremely-likely-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-as-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us"><u>Battlefield 6 now looks "extremely likely" to beat Black Ops 7</u></a> to be crowned 2025's best-selling game, with the latter seemingly not only struggling against Battlefield's sales, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shipping-a-major-franchise-like-clockwork-every-year-is-a-really-difficult-task-microsoft-responds-to-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-disappointing-launch"><u>also that of its predecessor, Black Ops 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout, however, has never been more popular, and its highly anticipated second season premiered on Amazon Prime yesterday (December 17). The new Fallout season picks up in the aftermath of Season 1’s finale and travels through the wasteland of the Mojave to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas. Fans of Obsidian's much-loved video game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-takes-the-fog-of-war-approach-to-avoid-making-any-new-vegas-ending-canon-creators-say"><u>will be interested to hear that Season 2 takes a "fog of war" approach </u></a>(which sure does match the video we see above) <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-takes-the-fog-of-war-approach-to-avoid-making-any-new-vegas-ending-canon-creators-say"><u>to how it juggles Fallout: New Vegas' various endings</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-1-review"><u>opening episode of Season 2 a Good 7/10</u></a> but if you've yet to watch the first season, don't forget that Bethesda and Xbox recently teamed up with Amazon and Samsung so fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/watch-prime-videos-fallout-season-1-for-free-from-today-on-samsung-tv-plus"><u>watching via Samsung TV Plus can stream Fallout Season 1 for free</u></a>. This means Season 1 is available subscription-free on Samsung TV Plus from now through to December 25. Samsung TV Plus is a free, ad-supported streaming service available on Samsung TV, Galaxy, Smart Monitor, and Family Hubs devices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind Amazon's hit show are gearing up to film Season 3 "next summer," with the hope that there <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-executive-producer-wants-hit-tv-show-back-on-the-air-as-soon-as-we-can-after-season-2-ends-with-season-3-set-to-film-next-summer"><u>won't be a huge gap between the end of Season 2 and what's next</u></a>.

Sony's argument outlined numerous similarities and compared various marketing screenshots from both games, as well as their descriptions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like Horizon, Light of Motiram takes place in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by giant robot dinosaurs who roam large, natural environments such as tropical forests, deserts, and snowy mountains. Both games even feature red-haired women protagonists that wear very similar outfits and styles, and devices similar to Aloy's "Focus" earpiece.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, Sony formally accused Tencent of developing a "knock-off game" and asked the court for a preliminary injunction against Light of Motiram to stop the Chinese megacorp from commencing pre-release promotion of its upcoming version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-is-suing-tencent-over-shameless-horizon-knock-off-game-light-of-motiram"><u>days after Sony filed its lawsuit</u></a>, Tencent quietly updated its Light of Motiram Steam page and swapped out a number of screenshots, including its cover image, before responding to Sony's lawsuit by claiming it was only making use of "well-trodden" tropes and suggesting the PlayStation maker's own game was too similar to Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. Indeed, Tencent hit back by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-copycat-drama-continues-as-tencent-claims-sony-was-already-concerned-its-game-too-closely-resembled-enslaved"><u>describing Sony's lawsuit as an overreach</u></a>, highlighting other game franchises with similar elements such as The Legend of Zelda and Far Cry. It was "startling," Tencent said, that Sony was now attempting to claim Horizon's concept was original, rather than an idea based on "ubiquitous genre ingredients."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bitter battle now seems to have come to an end, however. As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Verge</u></a>, new <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381827-sony-v-tencent-stipulation-for-dismissal-pursuant-to-rule-41a1aii/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>court papers</u></a> filed yesterday, December 17, show both parties have reached a "confidential settlement" that appears to have ended Sony's lawsuit, and Tencent's counter-suit, too. All parties are reportedly responsible for their own fees and costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without publicly sharing the terms of the deal, it's not possible to know how it all ended, although the disappearance of Light of Motiram is a fairly significant clue. The original URLs to both storefronts now redirect to each site's respective landing pages, and there's been no formal update from Tencent on the game's date. It seems unlikely we'll see it again, and almost certainly not in its present form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

It’s down to $121.55, a drop of 32%, which brings each deck down to around $30. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given World Shaper is currently selling for $43 on its own, while Counter Intelligence is $36 (and that’s on sale), you’re getting a great deal here, allowing you to open up the decks and play right out of the box with a friend - or sell two of them on to buy singles to upgrade with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s saying nothing of the Collector Sample Pack in each, which includes a pair of cards in rare treatments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, this is a great deal for anyone curious about Edge of Eternities. It's also still the last wave of Commander decks from 2025, given they weren't offered in Spider-Man or Avatar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.
