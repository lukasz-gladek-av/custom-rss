            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-pc-mod-support-launches-later-this-week-with-free-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Games and Avalanche Software have confirmed plans to launch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy"><u>Hogwarts Legacy</u></a> mod support for PC, opening the floodgates for players to add whatever their hearts desire to the Harry Potter video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team announced the addition with a special video presentation, below, revealing a release date of January 30, 2025 for a free update that includes the highly requested feature. It’ll only be for PC for now, with the team sharing no news about when or if players can expect to see modding come to consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve made it easy for everyone. It’s all simplified with official tools provided by us,” Avalanche community manager Chandler Wood said. “For mod creators, you’ll be able to get the official Hogwarts Legacy creator kit, free on the Epic Games Store. The creator kit provides powerful tools right at your fingertips, allowing you to flex your inner developer like the ones here at Avalanche and conjure the magic with custom mods that other players can enjoy, too.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hogwarts Legacy mods will almost certainly devolve into chaos immediately as players rush to add Shrek, Thomas the Tank Engine, and more nonsense to the open-world Harry Potter game. Thankfully, Avalanche is here to help fans get a head start. The studio said it’s been working with members of the community to make a few mods available on day one, including creative broom options like dragons and a vacuum cleaner as well as unique cosmetics, an endless dungeon experience to test your combat skills, and a magical creature fetch quest. More community-generated content will no doubt appear in the months ahead, giving players more than enough content to keep them busy as Avalanche looks ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hogwarts Legacy launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S in February 2023, with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions following in May and the Nintendo Switch version following in November. That means it’ll celebrate its two-year anniversary next month with full-on mod support, but the free update is far from the only post-launch support the project has received since it arrived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year alone saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-will-soon-give-all-players-access-to-playstation-exclusive-content"><u>previously PlayStation-exclusive content coming to other platforms</u></a> as part of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-update-adds-photo-mode-hogsmeade-quest-and-more-next-week"><u>summer update</u></a> that also added photo mode, new cosmetics, and more. Hogwarts Legacy has sold an incredible 30 million units as of November 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for mod support to drop, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-video-game-sequel-hogwarts-legacy-2-one-of-the-biggest-priorities-at-warner-bros"><u>why Avalanche says Hogwarts Legacy 2 is one of its “biggest priorities.”</u></a> You can also see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines"><u>how the sequel may share a few elements with the upcoming Harry Potter TV show</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-issues-warning-against-cheating-ahead-of-trading-feature-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> is warning players of the consequences for cheating, just ahead of the expected release of in-game trading later this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an announcement pushed to the app yesterday, players were warned about violations of the Terms of Service that specifically relate to cheating:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are aware that some players have engaged in data tampering, real money trading, and other behaviors that violate the Terms of Use," reads the in-game notice. "If we confirm that a player has engaged in behavior that violates the Terms of Use, we will warn them, suspend their account, or take other action."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">No further details were offered as to what behaviors, specifically, are being targeted. Players on r/PTCGP have been speculating that this warning is related to a few different behaviors. One of these, referred to as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ib23b8/wonder_pick_farming_is_definitely_part_of_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wonder Pick Farming</a>, is a practice where individuals mass-create new accounts to take advantage of the many free packs available for new players, and try to roll a "god pack," or a super rare pack of cards with five very rare cards. Then, they offer their friend code to others for money, so that buyers can add them as friends and then see the "god pack" in the game's Wonder Pick function and be guaranteed a very rare card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another behavior speculated to be the target of a crackdown is a practice where players will grind accounts to level 50 with plenty of banked currency by participating in PvP battles over and over, using the game's timeout function to stall games until the opponent concedes so they can win repeatedly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, it's possible that the warning was simply published because of the game's upcoming trading feature release, which could potentially kickstart a new wave of inappropriate behavior, especially where "real money trading" is concerned. The trading feature, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-trading-unveiled-but-is-so-poorly-received-the-developers-had-to-respond">which was panned by fans upon announcement</a>, allows players to trade cards of one star rarity and below with friends. Players have expressed frustration with both the rarity limit on trading, as well as the need to spend some sort of currency to make the trade happen in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The feature is planned to go live later this week on January 29, alongside the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pockets-next-set-is-a-diamond-and-pearl-themed-booster-called-space-time-smackdown">new expansion Space-Time Smackdown</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
