Previously £54.95, that's a massive £15 saving for a critically well-received RPG that will take you at least 40 to 60 hours just to complete the main story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've been distracted by all the other huge games that have come out in the last few months— like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>,<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii"> Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, just to name a few—this is the perfect chance to return to the Kingdom of Bohemia with a massive bargain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few other UK retailers who have followed suit, with <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4YjL?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Argos</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbxBkA?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Currys,</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGJ4q?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smyths</a> bringing the price down to £39.99. TGC is still the cheapest by 4p, but if stock runs out on PS5, we'd recommend going to Currys next since it does free next day delivery and is also the Day One Edition, containing the pre-order bonus quest— "The Lion's Crest". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Argos can do free shipping as well, but only if you collect from a store or place an online order over £100, otherwise costing you at least an extra £3.95 for home delivery. Plus, while Argos is selling the Day One Edition on Xbox Series X, it's only selling the standard version without the bonus quest on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Smyths is only selling the standard version on both platforms, neither without the pre-order bonus quest. That said, it still makes a better price than those currently at other retailers. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II on PS5 at <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7EmgV?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon UK</a>, for example, currently costs £57.77 at the lowest. <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YWB8?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ShopTo</a> has cut its prices on the game slightly, but not as much, only going as low as £47.85 for the game on Xbox Series X|S. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can get Kingdom Come: Deliverance II for as low as £38.49 on PC through sites like <a href="https://zdcs.link/aR3OP1?object_uuid=2a9c56b0-506c-4bd8-97a7-79f646361336&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CDKeys</a>, deals like The Games Collection's are the cheapest ways to play the game on console. KCD2 is still priced much higher on each system's digital platforms—£59.99 on both the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9n4w31hsmvvd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Games Store</a>. If you have either console with a disc drive, The Game Collection, Currys, or Smyths are your best options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.
