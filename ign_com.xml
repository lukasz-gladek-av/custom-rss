            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps5-pro-can-you-see-the-difference<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest selling points of the PS5 Pro is that it can boost the image quality of PS4 games, even though they have not technically been “enhanced” for the console by either Sony or developers. And while there are over 3,000 PlayStation 4 games to date, there’s one many of us hold dear to our hearts: Bloodborne. With a sequel now seeming little more than a pipedream, we’re left with only one option – to play through the original again on PS5 Pro to make the most of the console's Enhanced Image Quality feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But does the PS5 Pro actually make Bloodborne look any better? If you’ve pre-ordered a PS5 Pro then you can check it out for yourself, but if you’re still sitting on the fence then check out the video below and see if you can tell the difference.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve also compared some of the other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-enhanced-for-ps5-pro">50-plus games that are enhanced for PS5 Pro at launch</a>, starting with Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. We tested it in both Pro modes – Fidelity and Performance – and you can see the results for yourself in this 23-minute gameplay video.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hogwarts Legacy was one of the big showcase games from the console reveal. We've now had the chance to play it on PS5 Pro in Fidelity mode with ray tracing, which promises to improve lightning and shadows, as well as adding better reflections. Take a look at the game running on PS5 Pro.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally (ahem), we have 16 minutes of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth running in Versatility mode, which enhances the quality of the visuals and delivers better frame-rates.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Can you tell the difference? If so, is it enough to make you pay the extra money for a PS5 Pro? Let us know in the poll below. Meanwhile, make sure you check out IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-pro-review">full review of the PS5 Pro</a>, which tells you everything you need to know about PlayStation's latest console.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each week leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance. Walmart, for example, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-black-friday-2024-when-does-the-sale-start">announced its official sale</a> for November 11 this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

The casting call also dropped a hint about when filming will begin, saying the network would only "consider children who are aged 9-11 in April 2025" and listing the filming dates as 2025-2026 in the UK. That would track with Warner Bros. Discovery's previous announcement that the show would debut sometime in 2026. Daniel Radcliffe, who played Harry Potter, has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/daniel-radcliffe-doesnt-think-hell-cameo-in-upcoming-harry-potter-tv-show"><u>he likely won't appear in the show</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcoming Harry Potter TV series <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-tv-series-officially-announced-for-max"><u>was officially announced last April</u></a> and is said to be a "faithful adaptation" of the novels by J.K.
