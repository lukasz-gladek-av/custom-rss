Players will "ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythic continent."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some had wondered what was happening with Highguard given developer Wildlight Entertainment failed to follow up its The Game Awards reveal with any new trailers or even more detailed information about how it works. It’s fair to say that some felt Highguard did not warrant the coveted big finish slot at The Game Awards — the biggest video game reveal show in the world — and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/can-we-stop-dunking-on-highguard-before-its-even-out-please">it has suffered from a degree of negativity online since</a>. With the likes of Sony's disastrous live-service PvP shooter Concord still fresh in the memory, some have even declared Highguard "dead on arrival."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on the launch showcase:</p><blockquote>Tune in on Monday, January 26 at 10am PT for an in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio, featuring a full gameplay deep dive, year one plans, and much more.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It looks like Wildlight is trying to replicate the hugely successful launch of Apex Legends, which publisher EA released in 2019 with little pre-release marketing but heavy involvement from streamers on its actual release date. Highguard is set to launch across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
