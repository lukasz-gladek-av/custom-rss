There's something so satisfying about holding a guitar controller and feeling like I'm actually playing songs that I would never dream of playing on a real guitar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While my own Rock Band days ended a long time ago, the music goes on with the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review">Rock Band 4</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-festival-review">Fortnite Festival</a>. And if you want to keep playing those games or get back into them, PDP released a new wireless guitar controller just last year that can help you do that. It's pretty expensive, but Amazon has just dropped the price to a new low with a 20% discount.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller Sale</h2><div catalogid="1620c457-409e-42b8-91af-d7f30570614f" id="214952"><div id="214952" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When this controller first came out back in May 2024, it sold out very quickly. This is largely because there just aren't really any new guitar controller options available outside of this one. The compatibility with Rock Band 4 and Fortnite Festival allow new and old players to experience an upgrade that feels more in line with modern controllers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it is normally priced at $129.99, the discount Amazon is running right now drops that down to $104. This is the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CWS8WKS5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest-ever price we've seen on Amazon</a> for the PlayStation compatible version of this controller, and likely the lowest one we'll see until sales events later in the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is a fairly unique controller, it's the overall <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-controller">best PS5 controller</a> you can buy if you're looking to play Rock Band 4 or Fortnite Festival on your PS5 or PS4. If you're interested in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-accessories">more PS5 accessories</a>, however, we've gathered some below.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Feb 7, 2025 8:44 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
