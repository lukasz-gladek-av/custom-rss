            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s patent infringement lawsuit in Japan against Pocketpair’s open-world survival game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> is ongoing. In the latest development, Nintendo has reworded one of the patents in the case, but what led up to this bizarre move?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld is an open-world survival game that skyrocketed in popularity upon its Steam and Xbox early access launch back on January 19, 2024. It sold 8 million copies in just six days and racked up over 25 million players in one month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game world is inhabited by creatures called Pals, which you can capture and use (read: exploit) to carry out various tasks. The visual appearance of the Pals and the method of capturing them by throwing a ball (Pal Sphere), quickly drew comparisons to Pokémon, with the game even getting nicknamed “Pokémon with guns” for its darker, black humor-infused take on the creature collecting genre. With Palworld’s meteoric rise in popularity, it wasn’t long before Nintendo rival Sony got together with Pocketpair to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>form Palworld Entertainment</u></a> in June 2024, a new business venture aimed at expanding the IP.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company showed signs of keeping an eye on Palworld (for example, this <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/335.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official statement</u></a> from The Pokémon Company back in January 2024). But it wasn’t until September 2024 that they <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>officially announced</u></a> they were filing a lawsuit in Japan against Pocketpair for infringement of patent rights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three patents</u></a> granted by the Japan Patent Office (JPO): two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that these changes by Pocketpair are not an admission of guilt. Rather, as Japanese patent attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/a9dd2fc3c0dc4e4d1282d012649b665462137560" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pointed out</u></a> on Yahoo Japan news last month, Pocketpair is following the standard three-pronged defense against patent lawsuits, which is to “deny infringement, argue that the patents are invalid, and avoid infringement through design changes.” He also noted that Nintendo does not have the upper hand, as there seems to be a fierce back-and-forth with Nintendo pushing for patent infringement and Pocketpair pushing for patent invalidity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-7528390/15/ja" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ride mechanic patent</u></a> (which got a sudden rewrite recently) covers a system for mounting and maneuvering pre-selected “boardable characters” (<em>tōjō kyarakuta</em>). Commenting on X, Japanese lawyer Ryo Arashida <a href="https://x.com/IP_Arashida/status/1920369811932262824" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pointed out</u></a> that it could be argued that the way Palworld’s Glider Pals worked prior to the May update infringed part of the patent’s specifications, namely those about the player grabbing onto and hanging from the boardable character, and their subsequent control of that movement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to the May Palworld update, you could use an actual Glider Pal to glide (by grabbing onto its feet). However, post-update, players have to use a piece of equipment — a Glider — to glide, rather than actually using the Pals themselves. Instead, Pals now act as passive buffs on your gliding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ironically, as Arashida <a href="https://x.com/IP_Arashida/status/1920412095805571096" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>noted</u></a>, Nintendo’s major argument to get the patent granted in the first place was that a “boardable character” was specifically a character and not a tool, like a parachute. “For this reason, claiming in the lawsuit that a ‘Glider’ (which is a tool) is a ‘boardable character’ would create a contradiction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This month, Nintendo reworded the ride-switching mechanic patent. Rewording a patent mid-case is legal as long as it doesn’t introduce any new concepts or technical matter. However, as pointed out by IP consultant Florian Mueller at <a href="https://gamesfray.com/nintendo-resorts-to-weird-patent-claims-as-its-litigation-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair-is-struggling/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesFray</u></a>, this only tends to happen if the litigant (in this case, Nintendo) feels the patent is “at a fairly high risk of being deemed invalid in its original form.” Nintendo’s rewriting of the patent makes it more verbose. Mueller focused on the addition of “even when” <em>(-attemo</em> in Japanese) to the wording, noting that “even” is rarely used in patents because it's “too emphatic and subjective.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it's not clear exactly what Nintendo’s motivations are behind this sudden rewording, it’s possible that it is using this as a last-ditch tactic to make it harder for the patent claim to be dismissed as invalid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case continues. Meanwhile, Pocketpair continues to update Palworld with new features, such as the recently released Terraria crossover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

The game launches with 15 playable characters, which means four are still to be announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the voice cast, Matt Mercer from Critical Role is set to play Nova and Annihilus.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel Cosmic Invasion voice cast (so far):</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Brian Bloom (Captain America, Silver Surfer)</li><li>Steve Blum (Venom, Beta Ray Bill)</li><li>Trevor Devall (Rocket Raccoon)</li><li>Cal Dodd (Wolverine)</li><li>Josh Keaton (Spider-Man)</li><li>Matt Mercer (Nova, Annihilus)</li><li>Aileen Mythen (Phyla-Vell)</li><li>Elysia Rotaru (She-Hulk)</li><li>Alison Sealy-Smith (Storm)</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Cosmic Invasion is due out later this year on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5 and Xbox. Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>In Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the immortal Super Villain Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, threatening all life as we know it. Super Heroes both Earth-born and cosmic must now join forces in a star-spanning adventure against the deadly Annihilation Wave. Brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos in classically inspired side-scrolling combat.</blockquote><blockquote>Choose and control your own team of two characters while tagging between them mid-fight with the innovative Cosmic Swap system, capitalizing on distinct superpowers and special attacks to create unique team-ups and dish out devastating damage. Unlock stellar powerups and rewards while experimenting with different duos and bash through a fantastic collection of locales and nemeses from the Marvel universe. Marvel Cosmic Invasion’s action includes a range of accessibility features, empowering the whole family to be Super Heroes (or villains), and supports four-player drop-in/drop-out local and online co-op with crossplay.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

I'll just say that. That's a spoiler. I might get in trouble for that. I don't know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirkman continued: “The lineup is going to be absolutely insane. I'm so glad that we announced Battle Beast. You can't do an Invincible fighting game without having Battle Beast be one of the playable characters. There are other characters like that that will more than likely be in the game. So we'll see. We've got a lot of announcements to roll out.

Fans of the game had already taken the time to see everything the shockingly revealing outfit had to offer when it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvel-rivals/Season_1_Battle_Pass_and_New_Skins#Malice_Invisible_Woman_Skin">its debut with Season 1</a> in January.

This is my favorite bit of her as well,” she says of the video game version of her Fantastic Four character. “This is my favorite bit. Guys, watch out, like I said, for the sequel. You better watch it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fantastic Four: First Steps, of course, has yet to receive the green light for a proper MCU sequel, though we do know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-pedro-pascals-reed-richards-lead-the-avengers-the-fantastic-four-first-steps-director-clarifies-previous-comments-insists-its-for-the-russo-brothers-to-reveal"><u>at least some of its major characters</u></a> will make an appearance in the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday.
