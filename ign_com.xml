            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-adds-rares-game-boy-platformer-donkey-kong-land<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-land">Donkey Kong Land</a> is out now for Nintendo Switch Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rare’s 1995 Game Boy platformer is available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription for the Switch, and joins a growing list of classic Game Boy games available to download and play. Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/nintendo-switch-online">all the games available on Nintendo Switch Online here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Land offers a condensed version of the side-scrolling gameplay in Rare’s much loved 1994 SNES classic Donkey Kong Country, with different level design and boss fights. As you’d expect, it stars Donkey Kong and his nephew Diddy Kong, who team up to defeat King K. Rool and collect many, many bananas.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1859764097480355961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The game did well enough to get three sequels: Donkey Kong Land 2 (1996), based on Diddy's Kong Quest; Donkey Kong Land 3 (1997), based on Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!; and a Game Boy Color version of Donkey Kong Country (2000).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Cranky Kong doesn't think Donkey Kong has proven himself to be a hero yet. So, he decides to work out a deal with the closest villain that he knows. K. Rool and his baddies have hidden bananas in new places across Donkey Kong Island in another attempt to outwit the best-friend duo. And the only response is for Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong to go off on another adventure!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Boy launched in 1989 with the likes of Super Mario Land, Tetris, Baseball, and Alleyway, all of which are now on Nintendo Switch Online. Other Game Boy games on the service include Metroid 2 – Return of Samus, Kirby’s Dream Land, Super Mario Land 2 – 6 Golden Coins, The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening DX, and Wario in Wario Land 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Donkey Kong, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, a remake of the Nintendo Wii original that was also ported to Nintendo 3DS, launches on Switch in January. Last week's Super Nintendo World Direct offered fans their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-nintendo-world-direct-reveals-donkey-kong-country-opening-date-while-offering-a-teasing-glimpse-of-its-rollercoaster">long-awaited first look at the new Donkey Kong Country-themed expansion</a> while announcing it will officially open December 11, 2024 in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Even so, it’s such a quantum leap over the original PSVR in terms of ease of use, visual quality, and immersion that any PlayStation owner who loves VR should upgrade as soon as possible."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Its 4K HDR OLED screen and excellently tactile Sense controllers are the most obvious improvement, but plentiful quality-of-life changes and the raw horsepower of the PS5 set a new standard for how VR games should play and feel on console."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PS5 Black Friday Deals Are Now Live at Amazon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://sonyps.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l4as99" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation’s PS5 console deals</a> are also now live for Black Friday, featuring the Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle, and NBA 2K Bundle, at just <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB1XR8?object_uuid=9f3a3370-4438-4049-9564-f62d85e33539&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$374.99 for the Digital Edition</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdd2Bp?object_uuid=9f3a3370-4438-4049-9564-f62d85e33539&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$424.99 for the Disc Edition</a>.

If you’ve been holding out for a great price, now’s your chance. However, these deals could sell out or expire before Black Friday itself, so act quickly to secure yours and avoid disappointment. Let's take a look at what's on offer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What You Need to Use PSVR 2 on PC</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hardware-wise, you need the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-playstation-vr-2-pc-adapter">PC adapter </a>and a PSVR 2 headset – as well as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-pc">VR-capable gaming PC</a>, naturally. You’ll also need to download the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation VR2</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamVR</a> apps from Steam. You can find the minimum PC requirements and more details on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the convenience of using one headset to play all of your VR games, what really stands out about PSVR2 on PC is the OLED display. It makes everything look bright and clear and vivid. However, the drawback for using PSVR2 on PC is that PCs can’t take advantage of some of the unique features you can access when playing on PS5. That includes things like eye tracking, HDR, and adaptive trigger support.</p></div><div catalogid="40739933-4e75-453f-b51f-6875fcca6df9" id="206473"><div id="206473" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PlayStation VR2 PC Adapter</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of <strong>Black Friday in 2024 falls on November 29</strong> this year, but the deals have already kicked off.
