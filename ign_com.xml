            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet - Prismatic Evolutions represents the culmination of the slow build-up to Pokémania 2025. The wild popularity of the set sold preorders out fast, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-where-to-buy-in-stock">stock only now starting to return to shelves and online retailers</a>. But, despite these difficulties, it's quickly become the ultimate crown jewel of the Scarlet and Violet era, delivering fan-favorite Eevee and its evolutions in jaw-dropping Special Illustration Rares and ultra-rare Master Ball foils. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Packed with over 200 cards, including powerhouse Pokémon like Roaring Moon ex and Pikachu ex, this set blends stunning artwork with competitive playability, making it a must-have for trainers and collectors alike. Improved pull rates for Special Illustration Rares sweeten the deal, giving fans a better shot at pulling their dream cards, even as demand hits an all-time high.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/pokmon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-preorders-live-at-best-buy-2-1730736946734.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokemon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions - Elite Trainer Box - Credit: The Pokemon Company.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet, the new sets aren't just about beautiful cards—they're introducing exciting mechanics like Budew's game-changing free attack, and doubling down on rarity tiers to thrill pack-openers. Fancy hunting for the Eeveelution family or stacking your deck with tournament-ready hits? Prismatic Evolutions offers something for everyone. It's not just another expansion; it's the kind of release that defines a generation of Pokémon TCG fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, in my experience the pulls have been rough in Prismatic Evolutions so far. This won't be the same for everyone, of course. Moreover, on the one hand, it is a good thing; your SIRs and the rest have a much better chance of holding their value. On the other hand, 25 booster packs didn't bring the goods. Let's take a look at some of the exciting new cards that I did manage to bag, and then discuss some of the other exciting (and rare) new additions the expansion brings to see is Prismatic Evolutions is truly worth the hype.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Glaceon ex (Suprise Box Promo Stamp) 026/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-9-1737718353557.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Glaceon ex could end up being a sound playable card by building up enough damage on an opponent's bench to knock it out before it comes into play. The challenge with Tera ex-cards is using multiple energies. However, seeing a Glaceon Tera ex deck in action would be very entertaining.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Eevee Elite Trainer Box Promo 173</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-10-1737718374095.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to its stunning full artwork, this one will likely be in trainers' binders rather than their decks. It's still the standard Eevee card in this set, allowing trainers to evolve it as soon as it's played. It certainly makes playing an Eeveelution deck a lot easier.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mela Trainer SAR 140/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-11-1737718394762.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mela is a powerful trainer card that can be used at the right time. Trainers can grab a fire energy from their discard pile whilst topping up their hand with 6 cards, which would come in handy mid to late game. Again, this is one for a trainer binder, with the usual Mela trainer card being fairly easy to pull.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Pikachu ex 028/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-12-1737718521837.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Prismatic Evolutions also addresses Surging Sparks FOMO with Pikachu ex, although it's not a Tera ex. Thanks to Thunder, it's a relatively straightforward basic ex, with the possibility of one-hit knockouts in three turns. It's a high energy cost, but it's a lovely card to build up from the bench to switch in and out, thanks to its one energy retreat cost.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Max Rod Ace Spec 116/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-13-1737718545967.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This card can literally flip a battle on its head. Imagine having Tyranitar's ex knocked out alongside its four energy cards, then using this Max Rod to get it all back and start building it again from the bench. Probably one of the most useful Ace Specs cards we've seen.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Espeon ex 034/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-14-1737718572842.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Espeon ex decks are going to be very hard to combat thanks to their ability to both discard from an opponent's hand and de-evolve all opposing Pokémon, shuffling the evolution cards into their deck. This one card can drag a battle out and whittle down opponents, so imagine a deck built around four of them. Insane.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tyranitar ex 064/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-15-1737718597512.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, Grind makes Tyranitar ex very playable. But it's a different story when I consider it a second-stage evolution with a minimum of three energy cards attached to stretch its legs. I love Tyranitar, but this ex-card ain't it, chief. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">My Favorite Prismatic Evolution Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a given that we all want the Eeveelution SIR cards from Prismatic Evolutions. Still, some seriously cool overlooked artwork in this expansion might be worth snapping up if you see a bargain.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dragapult ex SAR 165/131</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-16-1737719041103.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragapult ex SAR 165/131 is one of my favorite artworks from this set, and I'm very tempted to build a deck around Phantom Dive. Two energy costscosts for a combined 260 damage, 60 of which can be spread on your opponent'sopponent's bench. It's an insane move; watch for this card creeping up in value just because trainers want it in their deck.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Roaring Moon ex SIR 162/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-17-1737719796337.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another heavy hitter with Roaring Moon ex-SIR with stunning artwork. A triple hit energy spend for its attacks is brutal, but this basic Pokémon card could be the final push in a tight battle. Loading a deck up with Stadium cards and building support around Roaring Moon ex sounds like a fun deck to build, that's for sure.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Umbreon ex SIR 161/131</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/pcmag-shopping-cards-18-1737720000986.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company International / Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, ​I doubt anyone will use an $1200+ Umbreon ex SIR in their decks, but if you take a look at that mental moveset, you'd surely be tempted. Like Roaring Moon ex, this card has the chance of flipping a Pokémon TCG battle on its head in the 11th hour with both of its moves. Yes, it needs three different energy types. Still, there's some fun to be had building out an Eeveelution deck around Umbreon ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, with all things considered, is Prismatic Evolutions worth the hype? In short yes. There are plenty of awesome cards to add to your binder and more playable cards. Still, you'll be waiting for stock to appear without brilliant timing. Eeveelution-based sets will always be cool, but the chances of pulling one of the elusive Eeveelution SIRs is 1 in 900 booster packs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the addition of God packs and Master Ball cards, which is very cool. Imagine pulling every SIR in one booster pack? The problem is it's very unlikely to happen, so strap in and get ripping packs and boxes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Pokémon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions in 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Stock has been hard to come by for Pokémon TCG: Prismatic Evolutions, and things are only now starting to even out a little. Pokémon is at the height of popularity again, between TCG Pocket, investors buying up stock, and general increased demand for sets such as Surging Sparks, it's a crazy time to get into the hobby. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-company-breaks-silence-on-prismatic-evolution-shortage">The Pokémon Company's efforts to restock shelves ASAP</a>, Prismatic Evolutions also represent a turning point of going online or in-store to buy stock instead of resorting to the questionable secondary market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Prismatic Evolutions collection offers a range of products for collectors and players, each celebrating the beloved Eeveelutions. At the top, the Elite Trainer Box provides nine booster packs, an exclusive full-art Eevee promo, and useful extras like sleeves, dice, and condition markers—ideal for anyone building their collection or deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a simpler option, the Surprise Box includes a few booster packs and a random Eeveelution ex promo with a Prismatic Evolutions stamp, offering an affordable way to dip into the set. Similarly, the Mini Tin is a compact choice with two booster packs, a collectible Eevee coin, and an art card, doubling as a neat storage solution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collectors will appreciate the Binder Collection, which pairs four booster packs with a sturdy Eevee-themed binder for organizing prized cards like Master Ball foils or Special Illustration Rares. The Tech Sticker Collection adds a playful touch with Eevee stickers and two booster packs, perfect for younger fans or casual fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, the Poster Collection combines display-worthy content with collectibility, featuring three booster packs, a fold-out Eevee poster, and exclusive holo promos of Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon. Each product highlights the magic of the Prismatic Evolutions set, offering something for every kind of Pokémon fan, whether you're chasing rare cards, organizing your collection, or simply enjoying the Eevee hype.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
