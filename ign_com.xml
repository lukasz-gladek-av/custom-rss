The "Concord situation" they refer to is Firewalk Studios' online hero shooter, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week"><u>which was infamously pulled from sale less than two weeks after launch</u></a> last year.

It debuted to a desperately low 697 peak concurrent players on Steam, a number that made the 12,786 players of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League — which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue"><u>was dubbed a disappointment by Warner Bros.

"Basically the same principal [sic] every artist has been inspired by some other artists and so on and so forth. Of course, it's not cool to blatantly just copy/paste someone's work, but then again, even the concept of completely original art is debatable.
