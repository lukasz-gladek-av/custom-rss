But modders are also on the case, adding what they can to expand and iterate on the base experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hosted on the <a href="https://www.civfanatics.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Civ Fanatics</a> site, mods are already starting to pop up for Civilization 7. Many build on the base game or put extra modifiers on world effects. <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/more-natural-wonders.31877/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>More Natural Wonders</u></a>, for example, does exactly what it says, doubling the amount of Natural Wonders that spawn on each map size. Or, for those who don't want to meet the requirements to unlock certain civilizations, the <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/unlock-all-civs.31856/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Unlock all Civs</u></a> mod undoes that particular constraint.

The mod lets Diplomacy be initiated through the city banner, adjusts Plot Yield icons to be smaller on unimproved or unworked tiles, and adjusts the tooltips as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The official Patch 1.01 for Civilization 7 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-patch-101-addresses-some-of-the-negative-feedback-from-advanced-access"><u>has already begun to address some of these issues</u></a>, taking aim at the user interface, AI, map variety, and other community complaints. It's the first in a "series of upcoming patches" from Firaxis, intent on addressing feedback from Civilization 7's advanced access period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet modders are still honing in on everything from <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/notques-artificially-intelligent.31881/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>AI</u></a> to <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/techtree-tooltip-fontsize-increase.31868/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>fonts</u></a> and <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/discovery-lens.31872/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lenses</u></a>, and even the <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/better-pause-menu.31873/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pause menu</u></a>.

It's still early days, but considering Civ's long history of eager mod support, it's likely we'll see more and more outside adjustments pop up alongside Firaxis' own efforts to fine-tune Civilization 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-legacy-civilization-audience-will-eventually-come-around-on-civilization-7-amid-mixed-steam-user-reviews"><u>recent interview with IGN</u></a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledged the negative reviews, but said the "legacy Civ audience" will come around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We think that as people play the game longer, the sentiment improves because with every launch of a new Civ, the team pushes the envelope a little bit and our legacy Civ audience is a little bit nervous about what they initially see and then they realize, wow, this is actually really incredible, and they dive in," Zelnick said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

This means you won't be able to play the network test throughout the entire four days, rather during five three-hour periods.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign network test session timings:</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>February 14: 3am-6am PT / 6am-9am ET</li><li>February 14: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li><li>February 15: 11am-2pm PT / 2pm-5pm ET</li><li>February 16: 3am-6am PT / 6am-9am ET</li><li>February 16: 7pm-10pm PT / 10pm-1am ET</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The network test is a “preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch,” Bandai Namco said. "This large-scale Network Stress Test is designed to evaluate various aspects of the online system's functionality and performance. We are looking forward to your cooperation to make Elden Ring Nightreign even better."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is FromSoftware’s standalone co-operative spin-off set in a world parallel to that of 2022’s Elden Ring. The network test will allow three players to team up and take their chosen Nightfarers to battle "against new terrors, and explore an ever-changing map to defeat increasingly challenging bosses and ultimately take on the Nightlord," Bandai Namco added, before confirming the network test features a three day-and-night cycle squads must try to outlast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb:</p><blockquote>The all-new adventure in Elden Ring Nightreign begins at the Roundtable Hold, set in a universe parallel to the events of Elden Ring. Players must choose from eight unique characters, each with their own abilities and powerful Ultimates. Their journeys take them to Limveld, an ever-changing environment, where they will have to make split-second decisions when it comes to combat and exploration in the face of a night cycle that shrinks the map with the coming Night’s Tide.</blockquote><blockquote>At the end of each night, players will face a powerful boss and, if victorious, awaken to bigger challenges. Each session will culminate in the third night when they must face off against the chosen Nightlord. Individuals can fight the night alone, but strength will come in numbers. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat. Unsuccessful runs will grant players relics to allow them to customize and upgrade their characters tailored to their personal play styles.</blockquote><blockquote>Elden Ring Nightreign is unlike any experience created before by FromSoftware, Inc. In this condensed action RPG, players will never experience the same journey twice as enemies, rewards, and Limveld itself are ever-shifting and evolving with each new session. Defeating greater enemies and venturing into the more dangerous parts of the map will uncover more powerful weapons and greater Rune rewards. Finding Sites of Grace gives each hero a chance to level up and gain crucial power. With each session-based adventure being akin to playing through an open-air dungeon, every journey provides an opportunity to grow lasting stat bonuses. Successful runs against the night bring players ever closer to defeating the Nightlord and unraveling the story behind each Nightfarer in this parallel world.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year IGN had the opportunity to visit FromSoftware and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-we-played-it"><u>go hands-on with an early build of Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a>. We came away impressed, stating that Elden Ring Nightreign “takes the cautious dungeon crawls of Elden Ring and turbocharges them into propulsive, slash ‘n’ dash speedruns.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service"><u>IGN's interview with game director Junya Ishizaki for even more on Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

EA saw all those first and passed on all of them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking to former Activision boss Bobby Kotick, Bing said: "This is why I have double-high respect for [Kotick] saying, 'no, no, this is going to be good to own.' And then you kept the people around. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm pretty sure that some of those companies, the creative leaders, would not have stuck around [for a company other than Activision], so you did some kind of miracle of keeping them productive for long periods of time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The merger between then Blizzard owner Vivendi Games and Activision in July 2008 created the Activision Blizzard we know today. At the time, World of Warcraft was already the world's biggest subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game. According to Gordon, EA was among the publishers approached to buy Blizzard ahead of the merger, but declined the offer.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Guitar Hero has fallen by the wayside, Call of Duty and World of Warcraft continue to make millions with each new game and expansion fueled by live service revenue, which flows up to parent company Microsoft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same interview, Kotick said EA tried to buy Activision and Blizzard several times. "They tried to buy us a bunch of times, we had merger conversations a bunch of times," Kotick revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gordon added: "While you were doing Blizzard, that EA passed on, and you were doing King, EA did PopCap — just stupid things."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same interview, Kotick declared <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bobby-kotick-declares-former-ea-boss-john-riccitiello-worst-ceo-in-video-games"><u>ex-EA CEO John Riccitiello "the worst CEO in video games."</u></a> Kotick also opened up about Universal's 2016 adaptation of Activision Blizzard's Warcraft, calling it "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-activision-blizzard-boss-bobby-kotick-slams-warcraft-film-calls-it-one-of-the-worst-movies-ive-ever-seen"><u>one of the worst movies I've ever seen</u></a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
