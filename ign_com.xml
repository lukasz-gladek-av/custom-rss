These had previously gone out of stock the last time I covered, but are now back at an even lower price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While stock lasts, at least, as this is such an excellent deal, and below market price, I fully expect these to fly off the digital shelves.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Best Phantasmal Flames Cards Chase Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">According to marketplaces like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-phantasmal-flames-most-expensive-cards"><u>TCGPlayer</u>, certain Phantasmal Flames cards</a> have already skyrocketed further in price, and, following up from our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-most-expensive-cards">Mega Evolution round-up</a>, we’ve ranked the ten most expensive cards so far just above. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From aggressive Mega attackers to powerful evolution support, Phantasmal Flames brings a fiery mix of competitive threats and high-demand pulls. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Valentine's Day is just a couple of weeks away, and if you're looking for a fun gift idea that you can experience with your favorite person, a co-op game is always a great pick. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> is one worth considering - we called it an "expertly crafted co-op adventure" in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">review</a>, after all - but what's even better is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPxjxV?object_uuid=2779ad6d-b5c8-45a4-8e14-74e5080a679e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/922y2l?object_uuid=2779ad6d-b5c8-45a4-8e14-74e5080a679e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a> versions are currently on sale for $37.49 at Walmart. This deal saves you just over $10 compared to their list price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save on Split Fiction (PS5 and Switch 2)</h2><div id="235109"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235109" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Split Fiction - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div></span></p></div><div id="235110"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235110" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Split Fiction for Nintendo Switch 2 (code-in-box)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm a big fan of Split Fiction, but I'm certainly not alone. To continue on from our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">review</a>, IGN's Luke Reilly said it's "a rollercoaster of gameplay ideas and styles that are usually discarded as quickly as they’re introduced. This keeps it fabulously fresh for its full, 14-hour duration." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued on to say that, "With no idea sticking around long enough to get stale before making way for the next, it’s a victory of imagination and restraint in equal measure. Hazelight may have been rewriting the co-op rule book for a decade now, but Split Fiction is a new chapter that you (and a partner) cannot miss."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of all that praise from the review, it also earned runner-up spots in our awards lists of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-action-adventure-game-of-2025">best action-adventure game of 2025</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-xbox-game-of-2025">best Xbox game of 2025</a>. It's even included in our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-switch-2-games">best Nintendo Switch 2 games</a>. As you can see, we're very big fans in general. So why not scoop it up now while it's enjoying this nice discount?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're curious what other co-op games are worth playing over Valentine's Day, check out our rundown of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-co-op-games">10 best co-op games</a> for even more ideas.
