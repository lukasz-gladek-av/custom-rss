Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and [graphics] sensibilities. Stay tuned."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is, of course, already a "third" game. As the last mainline Ecco instalment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ecco-the-dolphin-defender-of-the-future"><u>Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future</u></a> was released on Dreamcast 25 years ago in 2000. However, creator Annunziata wasn't involved. A further sequel, Ecco 2: Sentinels of the Universe, which had been written as a direct sequel to Defender of the Future, was cancelled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I just want to finally be able to enter my secret password from the end of Tides of Time. I still have it written in the codes section of the game manual," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1kfj391/comment/mqsd37c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one fan, while another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1kfj391/comment/mqshuvr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reminded</u></a> us: "I wonder how many people know how completely bonkers the plot of the games are."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">10 (Unintentionally) Terrifying Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Annunziata didn't provide any additional details as to when we'll get to be reunited with Ecco, but a countdown on the official <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ecco the Dolphin website</u></a> is set to expire in 8,508 hours' time — that's about a year from now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ecco the Dolphin originally launched in 1992 on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, and was followed by a sequel, Ecco: The Tides of Time, in 1994. Ecco Jr. and Ecco Jr. and the Great Ocean Treasure Hunt were released in 1995, although they were "edutainment" games and primarily developed as learning tools.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ecco the Dolphin sees you play as the titular dolphin, as your underwater world has been devastated by a swirling gust of air and water. You must help him navigate back through treacherous tropical reefs and freezing polar ice floes to reunite him with his dolphin pod. We thought the 2000 remake was okay, writing: "Ecco the Dolphin is a classic from SEGA. But sometimes classics should stay in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For those who have played Ecco before, there's really no reason to come back to it," we wrote of the 2007 remake in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/17/ecco-the-dolphin-review"><u>IGN's Ecco the Dolphin review</u></a>. "There are no extras offered and the Achievements are junk. If you've never played Ecco, then you may want to give it a go. It really is one of the more innovative titles of its time. But, again, that time has long passed, and Ecco's gameplay doesn't stand the test of time like Sonic's."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last Ecco the Dolphin game fared much better, getting a 7.6 score in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ecco-the-dolphin-defender-of-the-future"><u>IGN's Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future review</u></a>, saying: "If you thought Flipper had personality, wait until you get a load of Ecco the Dolphin. Experience amazing visuals and an engrossing story, and defend the ocean that is rightfully yours."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-already-the-3rd-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us-behind-only-monster-hunter-wilds-and-assassins-creed-shadows<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As if impressive Steam concurrent player numbers and Bethesda’s own announcement of 4 million players wasn’t enough to cement it as a hit, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> is now the third best-selling game of 2025 in the U.S. after just one week on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, which shadow-dropped on April 22, has a peak concurrent player count of 216,784 on Steam. While impressive, that figure doesn’t tell the whole story, given Oblivion Remastered also launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, as well as straight into Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we have a new milestone: after just one week on sale, Oblivion Remastered became the third best-selling game in the U.S. of 2025 so far by dollar sales. That’s according to Circana’s Mat Piscatella, who took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3logoljt5lk2d" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> to say Oblivion Remastered trails only Monster Hunter: Wilds and Assassin’s Creed: Shadows at the top of the 2025 sales chart.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that Circana’s sales charts do not include players via subscription services. So, we know that Oblivion Remastered is a sales hit despite also being available on Microsoft's Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this success, it seems inevitable that more remasters of Bethesda games will follow, with most suggesting either Fallout 3 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">it was leaked back in 2023</a>) or Fallout: New Vegas are next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If either game is indeed next, what should players expect? Bruce Nesmith, one of Fallout 3’s designers, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-success-ex-bethesda-dev-expects-a-fallout-3-remaster-would-significantly-improve-the-not-good-gun-combat">has pointed to Fallout 3’s “not good” gun combat</a>, which he expects Bethesda would improve significantly for a remaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-3-designer-expects-remaster-to-heavily-revise-gunplay/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VideoGamer</u></a>, Nesmith said Fallout 3 Remastered would have shooting more in-line with that of Fallout 4. “What did you see in Fallout 4? That will tell you what they felt was necessary to change from Fallout 3,” Nesmith said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know in Fallout 4 there was a lot of work done on the gun combat, because Fallout 3 is the first time they ever tried to do a shooter-style game. And, well, I think the work that was done was amazing.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>. Bethesda, however, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-comments-on-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-changes-we-never-wanted-to-remake-it"><u>has explained why it went down the remaster route</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nesmith said Fallout 3 Remastered would probably include improvements and changes along similar lines to Oblivion Remastered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“[Fallout 3 combat] didn’t hold up to shooters at the time,” he said. “Also, it’s an RPG shooter, it’s not a run-and-gun shooter. But a lot of work was done on that for Fallout 4. So I anticipate seeing a lot of that work go into it, assuming they’re doing the same thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oblivion wasn’t just brought up to the 2011 version of Skyrim,” he added. “It was brought up to something that, at least on the surface, looks like it exceeds the most recent graphics update in Skyrim.” Nesmith has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-designer-says-bethesdas-remaster-is-so-impressive-it-could-be-called-oblivion-20"><u>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is so impressive it could be called “Oblivion 2.0.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a busy time for Bethesda, which is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls VI</u></a> and, maybe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-logo-pops-up-on-work-in-progress-starfield-creation-sparking-ps5-release-speculation"><u>more Starfield</u></a>. Throw in remasters and ongoing work on Fallout 76 and the Fallout TV show, which is heading to New Vegas for Season 2, and fans are in for a treat in the coming years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-players-are-warning-newcomers-to-do-that-kvatch-quest-before-the-level-scaling-makes-it-an-absolute-nightmare">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered players are warning newcomers to do Kvatch before the level scaling makes it an absolute nightmare</a>.
