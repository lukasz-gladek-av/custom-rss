            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Relay the message.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The iconic voice behind Commander Shepard, Jennifer Hale, hasn’t been asked to return for Mass Effect 5, but “would be there before they finish the sentence” if asked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hale, the actress who gave life to “FemShep," the protagonist of the Mass Effect trilogy, spoke to IGN recently and expressed her desire to return to perhaps her most beloved character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, it turns out, it wouldn’t even need to be the temptation of reprising her role as Commander Shepard that would lure her back to the series, but just being able to step back into that world once again in any form.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/24/gettyimages-2240160516-1761306994447.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Jennifer Hale would love to play Commander Shepard once again in Mass Effect 5. Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for ReedPop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When we asked, “Would it have to be Shepard, or would you play anyone?" Hale replied: “Anyone. I love that universe. I’m ready. Anytime”. Krogan? Salarian? Turian? The possibilities are endless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned, developer BioWare has yet to pick up the phone and call on Hale to return for Mass Effect 5, but that doesn’t mean we should give up hope. Hale pleaded with fans to let BioWare know that you’d love to see Shepard return somehow — the developers could find a way to make the hundreds of years gap work, I’m sure. Or, perhaps more likely, pop Commander Shepard in the game as a holographic display in some future museum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Everyone out there, the more you tell them what you want, maybe the likelier it is that it'll happen,” Hale said. And who are we to disregard the orders of our Commander?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, all of this was said amid a turbulent time for both BioWare and its parent company, EA. Earlier this year, it was reported that the studio <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams"><u>had been entirely restructured, following the disappointment of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, to focus entirely on Mass Effect</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, EA was acquired and made private by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo"><u>an investor group composed of the Saudi Arabian PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in an eye-watering $55 billion deal.</u></a> It’s currently unclear how this change in ownership has affected projects in development, such as the new Mass Effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details may be very thin as to what we can expect next from BioWare’s landmark sci-fi RPG series, but fear not, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-wait-for-mass-effect-5-director-seemingly-confirms-returning-feature"><u>one returning feature has been confirmed by the game’s director</u></a>, Michael Gamble: excessive lens flare. And let's not forget <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-fallout-success-amazon-sets-mass-effect-series-filming-date-though-its-unclear-if-itll-be-a-canon-adaptation-of-the-trilogy">Amazon plans to film its Mass Effect TV series at the end of 2026</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">11 Mass Effect Characters and Moments the TV Show Needs to Be a Hit</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-teased-with-a-mysterious-piece-of-concept-art-on-n7-day">BioWare has issued repeated teasers</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-a-new-poster-teases-the-future-of-mass-effect">artwork stuffed full of Easter eggs and secrets hinting at Mass Effect 5's eventual story</a>. BioWare has suggested that the game will be set hundreds of years after the original Mass Effect trilogy, with a story that spans the events of both the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy featured in the series' fourth main game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Would you like to see Jennifer Hale and Commander Shepard return in the next chapter of Mass Effect alongside that lens flare?

Game-Key Cards have sparked a vociferous debate because they're essentially useless unless your console is connected to the internet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, a Ubisoft developer who worked on the Nintendo port of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws"><u>Star Wars Outlaws</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-developer-defends-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-says-cartridges-that-force-you-to-download-the-game-are-better-for-loading"><u>defended the use of Game-Key Cards</u></a>, saying the real reason why the Switch 2 version of Star Wars Outlaws uses a Game-Key Card was due to the console's data speeds, and how quickly the hardware can read information from its bespoke cartridges, versus games downloaded to the console's internal memory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in September, Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi implied that developers are choosing Game-Key Cards not necessarily from a cost perspective, but a performance one, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-director-would-like-nintendo-fans-to-come-to-accept-game-key-cards-as-part-of-the-culture-of-gaming-on-switch-2">as the format enables them to bring smoother-running games to the Switch 2</a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-survey-asks-your-openness-to-digital-games-and-offers-a-chance-to-give-feedback-on-switch-2-game-key-cards"><u>Nintendo recently launched a survey</u></a> designed to poll the Switch 2 userbase on its thoughts surrounding digital and physical games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Assassin's Creed Shadows, you choose between a Shinobi or Samurai and explore the open world of Feudal Japan, from spectacular castle towns and bustling ports to peaceful shrines and pastoral landscapes. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review"><u>Assassin's Creed Shadows review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: "By sharpening the edges of its existing systems, Assassin’s Creed Shadows creates one of the best versions of the open-world style it’s been honing for the last decade."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, IGN reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft"><u>Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Côté had departed Ubisoft</u></a> after a career spanning more than 20 years. Just a few days later, Côté made it clear that his shock exit from Ubisoft was not his decision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on LinkedIn, Côté said he bore "no resentment," but wanted to make clear to former colleagues and fans that he had not quit the Assassin's Creed franchise after 15 years of his own free will. The news came just two weeks after Assassin's Creed, Ubisoft's biggest brand, became operated by Vantage Studios, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embattled-ubisoft-forms-subsidiary-for-ips-like-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-with-the-help-of-116-billion-tencent-investment"><u>separate business entity formed by Ubisoft with a 25% stake from Chinese giant Tencent</u></a> that will also now oversee all future Far Cry and Rainbow Six games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
