            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-amazon-deal-yakuza-show-premiere<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Time to hit the karaoke bars.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">With the recent success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: Refantazio</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>, it’s safe to say Sega is having a pretty good year. While those may be the final big game releases from the publisher in 2024, Sega officially caps off its year of releases with a TV show based on the Yakuza game series. That’s a cause for celebration, and, more importantly, some discounts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the new TV show Like a Dragon: Yakuza <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-like-a-dragon-yakuza-show">premiering today on Prime Video</a>, Amazon has dropped prices on most of the Yakuza games. The critically acclaimed turn-based RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> is at its lowest price yet. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">$40 Off Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth on PS5 or Xbox Series X</h2><div catalogid="a0712628-1cdf-4bf2-ada6-3589574b52ab" id="209660"><div id="209660" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is the most recent addition to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-games-in-order">Yakuza timeline</a>, and $40 off brings the game down to its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CJHD3JZ8?" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest ever price</a>. In my experience, 60% off a same-year release of this quality is about as good as video game deals can get.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To clear up some confusion, the Yakuza series rebranded as "Like a Dragon" in English localizations back in 2022. If you’re an OG Yakuza fan, have no fear: The recent Like a Dragon games carry the spirit of the original PS2 series through and through. Here’s what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/tristan_ign_au">Tristan Ogilvie</a> had to say in his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">9/10 review of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>: </p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Yakuza Games on Sale</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a> (2020) and the spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-ishin">Like a Dragon: Ishin!</a> (2014) are also included in Amazon's deals. If you want to check out some of the OG Yakuza series, you're in luck. While not the same level of price slashing, the remastered collection of Yakuza 3, 4, and 5 is 25% off. The collection was released for the PS4 back in 2020, but because of the PS5's backward compatibility the games work on either console. Same goes for Yakuza Kiwami 2, a remake of the original Yakuza 2, which is also slightly discounted. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Preorders for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Are Still Full Price</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="73cb2eaf-df62-41ec-ac64-06de169b8249" id="207607"><div id="207607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The one Like a Dragon game that isn’t on sale is, as you could probably guess, the one that isn’t out yet.
