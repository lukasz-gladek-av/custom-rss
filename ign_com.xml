            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Quantic Dream, the developer of narrative-based single-player games such as Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls and Detroit: Become Human, has announced its first ever multiplayer project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spellcasters Chronicles will be a drastic departure for the studio, as a free-to-play competitive team-based 3v3 action strategy game set to launch in closed beta via Steam before the end of this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Quantic Dream boss David Cage confirmed the studio would still work on single-player projects, including its long-gestating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-eclipse">Star Wars Eclipse</a>. But the company will now operate as a multi-project studio, Cage said, with Spellcasters Chronicles its first attempt at a multiplayer title. An official reveal trailer lies just below:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Stepping into a new genre with a fresh artistic approach has been both a challenge and a source of growth, allowing us to evolve as a team," Cage explained in a statement today. "We now look forward to shaping the game further with players' feedback and to perfecting this journey together."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Spellcasters Chronicles might be unlike anything Quantic Dream has made before, Cage suggested the project actually reflected both the "creative spirit and technical ambitions guiding Quantic Dream for nearly three decades."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Describing the game as a blend of action and strategy genres depicted with an animated fantasy aesthetic, Cage said Spellcasters Chronicles would allow the famously story-led Quantic Dream a chance at "exploring community-driven narrative." A more in-depth look at gameplay follows:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spellcasters Chronicles matches will see two teams of three players compete in "fast paced 25-minutes" matches, the developer said, as "teams must capture altars to gain territory and destroy their opponents' Lifestones to claim their victory."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll play as Spellcasters, described as "archetype-driven mages with distinct identities" that fight with spells and summoned creatures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After years of development, we can't wait to finally share the world of Spellcasters Chronicles with players," said game director Gregorie Diaconu. "We are starting our closed beta phase with our core-loop focused on arena battles and will introduce community narrative and other elements of our macro-loop in the following months."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heavy-rain-and-detroit-become-human-developer-quantic-dream-insists-star-wars-eclipse-development-continues-despite-competitive-multiplayer-game-plans">Cage offered the briefest of updates on Quantic Dream's highly-anticipated Star Wars Eclipse</a>, confirming the game remained in development. "Of course, development of Star Wars Eclipse continues," Cage confirmed, "and we are eager to share more with you in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Tributes to the Dead or Alive creator have been pouring in from fans and fellow game developers alike, especially in his home country of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The following post was made in Japanese on Itagaki’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4120822378181849&amp;id=100007623816758&amp;mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;rdid=DODdRsfRJWqEWKWB#" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Facebook</u></a>.</p><blockquote>“My Last Words:</blockquote><blockquote>The flame of my life is finally about to be extinguished.</blockquote><blockquote>The fact that this message has been posted means that the time has finally come.

He also played a key role in reviving Ninja Gaiden, with 2004’s Xbox-exclusive Ninja Gaiden reboot and subsequent games. However, he made a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/06/03/itagaki-resigns"><u>dramatic exit from Tecmo in 2008</u></a>, suing the company for damages in Tokyo District Court, a matter that was eventually settled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He subsequently went on to found Valhalla Studios with former members of Team Ninja and directed Devil’s Third, which released in 2015. In 2021, he established Itagaki Games, with the aim of producing a new work, but unfortunately this never happened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tributes poured in from fellow game developers. On the Facebook post, Tekken series producer Katsuhiro Harada commented: “No way Itagaki-san- You said to me we’d go out for a drink next time” — which apparently was their last exchange. Harada followed this up with a <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1978773188034109651" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lengthy post</u></a> on Twitter / X in English, describing the full history of his sometimes rivalry-fuelled relationship with Itagaki. Despite working for different companies on competing fighting game franchises, Harada recounts that Itagaki referred to him as a “comrade-in-arms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken 8 director Kohei Ikeda <a href="https://x.com/nkt_dreamer/status/1978762395796279378" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lamented</u></a> Itagaki’s passing at only 58 years old: “Rest in peace Itagaki-san, the fighting game legend who shaped an era.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Ninja Studios also posted the following response on <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1978756897231798606" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X / Twitter</a> in both English and Japanese: “We are deeply saddened by the passing of Team Ninja's first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki. We will carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began and continue to create games that many gamers will enjoy.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Super Robot Wars series producer Takanobu Terada <a href="https://x.com/TakanobuTerada/status/1978763505768792410" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>recalled</u></a> that “although we had no professional connections, Itagaki reached out to me quite a while ago and said ‘let’s meet’ and we ended up having dinner together.” Terada also recounted that Itagaki encouraged him, saying: “please keep on enthusiastically creating things.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Likewise, former Dragon Quest producer Ryutaro Ichimura <a href="https://x.com/RyutaroIchimura/status/1978769650046693880" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reminisced</u></a> about fond memories of discussing the future of the game industry with Itagaki over food and drink. He recalled Itagaki’s warm words of encouragement, and remembered when Itagaki asked him for his autograph to give to a relative who was Ichimura’s fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I felt Itagaki’s kindness in that moment, which made me even more of a fan of his,” he said. Hearing of Itagaki’s passing, Ichimura noted that “it didn’t feel real at first but once the truth hit me, I couldn’t stop crying. Carrying Itagaki’s words with me, I want to keep pushing forward and continue to create new works without any regrets.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Kirby and Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai also took to <a href="https://x.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1978773161777766864" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> to comment, simply saying: "May his soul rest in peace."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
