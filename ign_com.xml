            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Exclusive news.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> has sold 3.3 million copies in its first month on sale, Sony has confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of its latest financial results, Sony said Sucker Punch’s PlayStation 5-exclusive action adventure sold 3.3 million units in the 32 days since going on sale on October 2 — so sales up to and including November 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony announced the figure without any commentary, so it’s hard to know whether the company is happy with the result. However, there is a great deal of context we can add that helps us paint a picture of Ghost of Yotei’s commercial success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first comparison we should make is to its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima. It sold 2.4 million copies in its first three days after going on sale exclusively on PlayStation 4 on July 17, 2020, then hit 5 million after 118 days (just shy of four months). It’s now up to 13 million copies sold, including sales of the PC and PS5 Director’s Cut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it’s worth remembering that while we don’t have a figure for a comparable period of sales, it looks like Ghost of Yotei is selling about as well as Ghost of Tsushima before it, a suggestion backed up by sales data <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yoteis-us-launch-was-perfectly-fine-not-amazing-not-bad-says-analyst-but-the-true-test-will-be-in-the-months-ahead">from the U.S.</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sales-of-ps5-exclusive-ghost-of-yotei-in-line-with-ghost-of-tsushima-in-europe-new-data-reveals">across Europe</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But is that good enough? We need to consider that Ghost of Tsushima came out on the PS4, which in the summer of 2020 had a much bigger install base than the PS5 does today, and amid the stay-at-home gaming boom fueled by lockdowns. Ghost of Yotei also sold for $70, which means its dollar sales are greater compared to the cheaper Ghost of Tsushima, whose standard edition launched at $60.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of each release differs also in that Ghost of Tsushima came out in the summer, and Ghost of Yotei came out in the fall. Yotei has the crucial holiday season coming soon, and it will surely be a popular pick for those buying a PS5 for the first time or upgrading to the PS5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out at some point in 2026, which will undoubtedly give Ghost of Yotei a shot in the arm next year. And we all know that Ghost of Yotei, like Ghost of Tsushima before it, will eventually launch on PC in Director’s Cut form. Perhaps there will even be a PS6 version, whenever that console rolls around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, Ghost of Yotei has some way to go before it matches the total sales figure of its predecessor, but is has plenty of opportunity to catch up. And, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3wthi4twc2u" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Circana’s Mat Piscatella said last month</a>, its launch sales were “perfectly fine... Not amazing, not bad.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what’s next from developer Sucker Punch, in an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>, co-founder and studio head, Brian Fleming, said the studio will decide its next project once Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out. But, he suggested, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/if-we-were-good-at-juggling-four-projects-yeah-wed-have-a-remaster-ghost-of-yotei-dev-sucker-punch-says-it-will-remain-a-single-project-studio"><u>don’t expect a flurry of games from the relatively lean developer — it’s one project at a time</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review"><u>Ghost of Yotei review</u></a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-au-retrospective-playstation-turns-30-in-australia</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ign-au-retrospective-playstation-turns-30-in-australia.1349521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Incredibly, almost <em>unfathomably</em>, the humble original PlayStation, our little grey slab of joy, is turning 30. It's got grey hairs, now old enough to have a couple of kids, a few different careers, a car in the garage. You could say it's accomplished all those things in different ways.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/special/playstation-30th-birthday-giveaway-au?">Aussies: Win a PlayStation®5 Pro Console – 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Bundle!</a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In the before-times, many previous and current IGN AU staff cut their teeth at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation:_The_Official_Magazine" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Official PlayStation 2 Magazine</a> (Narayan Pattison, Tristan Ogilvie, Luke Reilly, Patch Kolan, and Adam Mathew among them), so it's an understatement to say that the brand, hardware, games and experiences were formative for us and extremely close to our hearts.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Little Grey Box That Could</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When the original PlayStation launched in Australia, stock was extremely limited and the thing cost $AUD699 (or about $1300 in today's money) if you could manage to get your hands on it. If you did, you could play nearly a nearly perfect port of Namco's superb Ridge Racer, try some 3D fighting (a novelty!) in Battle Arena Toshinden, a bit of 3D platforming (woah!) in Jumping Flash!, and 2D sidescrolling platforming in Rayman. The games were perhaps a tad "safe" at the time, but it hinted at big things coming – and within a year, the PlayStation had cemented itself in the Australian gaming landscape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up my PS1 from a Cash Converters in 1999, then immediately bought <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/22/metal-gear-solid-6">Metal Gear Solid</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/09/04/final-fantasy-vii-review">Final Fantasy VII</a>. From there, I delived into a catalogue of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/21/xenogears">JRPGs</a>, racing simulators (yeah, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/23/gran-turismo-3">that series</a>), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/09/01/r-type-delta">scrolling shooters</a> and impenetrable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokimeki_Memorial_(video_game)" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dating games</a> as my N64 quietly looked on, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/06/03/superman-2">judging me</a> from the shelf. I'm fairly certain I did not see daylight for about two years – and I knew I wanted to do this stuff as a career. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By that point, it was also clear that Sony had a stranglehold over the entire industry – delivering a suite of the finest games month after month that neither Nintendo or SEGA could match for sheer volume. It brought gaming out of the niche basements of the stereotypical gamer and put it smack-bang on the covers of cool magazines. It changed everything.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/536276266-1321476293317591-6086579087571452701-n-1762817912289.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shots fired. Nintendo and Squaresoft had a, ah, <em>strained</em> dynamic back in the '90s. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">By 2000, the world was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/03/ps2-playstation-2-lands-with-a-splash">getting swept up into the hype machine</a> around the forthcoming PlayStation 2 – a monolithic black slab emblazoned with a twist of striking blue <em>P-S-2</em> lettering. It looked sleek. It looked powerful. In a Kubrickian way, it whispered, <em>"I am a mysterious and untouchable creation that will change the world"</em>. In a very real sense, it did. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The PlayStation 2 Arrives</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With launch games like Ridge Racer V and Tekken Tag Tournament, it brought the PlayStation brand out of infancy and into the big leagues. Sony's much-vaunted "Emotion Engine" promised state-of-the-art graphical fidelity, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/03/ps2-demos-to-die-for">showcased in real-time tech demos</a> that exceeded prerendered cutscenes on the PS1. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a breakthrough. Everyone wanted it – a DVD player! A gaming console! In one! And at the time, it was shockingly affordable for a device that could offer both. It propelled DVD sales, gave additional breathing room for developers moving towards larger games (and files). The controller even had analogue face buttons! Can you dig it, baby? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/04/ps2-launch-thousands-clamor-in-the-streets-for-playstation-2">The Japanese launch was an overwhelming success</a>, propelling international hype for the PS2 into the stratosphere.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/screenshot-2025-11-11-at-10-45-38-am-1762818359583.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Iconic and minimalist, the PlayStation 2's blue box proudly displayed on launch day in Akihabara.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN AU started up in 2006 – exactly 10 years after the debut of the PS1 (or PSX as everyone had taken to calling it). In those days, the PS3 had only just debuted in Japan to rapturouos response, thanks to the disruptive adoption of Blu-ray players (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/08/blu-ray-vs-hd-dvd">going head-to-head against HD DVD, then cutting off HD DVD's head to become the dominant format of the 2010s)</a> and increasing uptake of 1080p displays. People wanted content to showcase their cool tech. Sony delivered the PS3: an all-in-one Blu-ray player, harddrive-equipped media device and, at the time, beastly gaming device.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PS3: Running Up That Hill</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony, it must be said, made it a bit hard for itself around this time. The birth of the meme-era took on the PS3 press reveal, turning "Riiiiiiiidge Racer!", "Giant enemy crab" and "George Foreman grill" into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT920jOJUsY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet phenomenons</a>. That seemed to start a period of iffy consumer sentiment, in part aimed at the USD$499 and USD$599 launch pricing. The Australian launch was still off in the distance, over the horizon, but gamers were braced for a sting in the wallet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We got our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/15/au-ps3-first-impressions">first hands-on look at the PS3</a> as a fledgling Australian team of three fine folks: Bennett Ring, Cam Shea, and myself. Sony Australia rolled out a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/20/pause-australian-playstation-event">series of consumer and media events</a> in which to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/27/au-sony-experience-more-event-coverage">showcase its polished ovoid tower</a> and we walked away mostly impressed by the potential of the system. IGN's US team were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/12/22/ps3-2006-year-in-review">on hand to cover the year's launch titles</a> too. Resistance: Fall of Man was the media darling of the time and, to this day, remembered very fondly. However, it had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/09/world-war-iii-ign-aus-next-gen-console-showdown">some teething pains and needed to grow into itself</a>.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/11/screenshot-2025-11-11-at-4-40-52-pm-1762839656871.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ex-IGN Big Boss Bennett Ring swerves into the Motorstorm turns, while Cam stands there, looking tall.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a few years, and a few price cuts and redesigns, the PS3 finally found momentum and delivered on its ambitions. We have the PS3 to thank for Naughty Dog's Uncharted series – a game that, for many, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/13/uncharted-drakes-fortune-review">came out of the mists and made the console a must-buy</a>. By Uncharted 2, it was clear that Nathan Drake was a star for the ages, and Naughty Dog was just getting started.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without doubt, the system's<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/05/the-last-of-us-review"> pinnacle achievement was The Last of Us</a>. It was a technical showcase for the ageing hardware and a cinematic and gameplay line in the sand for developers. At risk of turning this into a love letter to Naughty Dog, Sony truly understood that this studio propelled its hardware forward – and gamers responded to it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around this time, Sony also went on a Wii-inspired foray into motion-based gaming with the PlayStation Move controller and camera. It was successful enough to spawn a whole series of Move-enabled titles. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">PlayStation <em>Phwoar</em>!</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A whopping 12 whole years ago, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/20/playstation-4-revealed">the PlayStation 4 was revealed in fine fashion</a>. Cam and Luke waxed lyrical about it in the video above. It seemed then, as it does now, a return to form for Sony's PlayStation brand. It came out of the gates strong and player focussed. The "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZkMdi3XBhw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For the Players</a>" campaign underscored a renewed focus on the core player experience. Wisely so, particularly with Nintendo's Switch just around the corner and an industry that was never bigger and more flush with great games and hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there were new experiences to be had – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/14/a-closer-look-at-the-playstation-4-controller-prototype">and a new controller design</a> (the first major rethink of the iconic PlayStation controller in the system's history) was coming. Naughty Dog released another breakthrough title, The Last of Us 2. The power of the PS4 also enabled Sony to experiment with another emerging field: VR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, the PSVR headset. For the time and not <em>un</em>substantial money, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review">PSVR offered impressive VR fidelity combined with great games</a> and IPs that other competing hardware could only look on enviously. When juiced up with the PS4 Pro (a new mid-generation hardware refresh), it improved performance even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While VR may have had its moment in the sun, and it now feels like the technology is mostly hibernating until the next big thing comes along, it pointed towards more TV-free gaming experiences that have become more and more normalised.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PS5 and Beyond</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-5/PlayStation_5_Release_Date,_Pricing,_and_Launch_Games">Enter: The PS5</a>. PlayStation 5 – the current generation of Sony consoles, in standard and Pro models. By 2020, digital marketplaces were standard and the TV screen was just one way of interacting with your PlayStation. The PS5 ushered in PSVR 2, a souped up version of the PSVR we know and love. Plus, it brought to the table a Switch-like (but not quite) handheld solution: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-review">The PlayStation Portal</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've noticed, we haven't discussed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-psp-games">Sony's PSP</a> (in gloriously piano black, a luxurious widescreen handheld in 2004) or the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/13/sony-playstation-vita-review">PS Vita</a> – pseudo PS3 in your pocket. But all of those handheld experiences seem to have been teasing where Sony (and Nintendo, for that matter) are heading. Already rumours are swirling about the <em>PlayStation 6</em> and oh boy do I feel old now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So here's to you, Sony PlayStation. You are 30 years young in Australia. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a very different world and games industry today than the one that I and many others remember from the turn of the millenium. However, the PlayStation has been an island of stability, joy, and adventure throughout. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will we all be playing our PS10s in 2055? Jacked straight into our neural cortex like a back alley goon from Neuromancer? Will TVs still exist? What about game stores? One thing is true: PlayStation fans will always adore this brand – so in a sense, the future is up to you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/special/playstation-30th-birthday-giveaway-au?">Aussies: Win a PlayStation®5 Pro Console – 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Bundle!</a></h3></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-au-retrospective-playstation-turns-30-in-australia]]></content:encoded>
