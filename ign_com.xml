            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/acquire-60th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">1964 was a busy year. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, The Beatles made their way to New York City, and the Olympics were held in Tokyo. But for our purposes, it also marked the wide release of the board game Acquire. Now, more than 60 years and multiple editions later, Renegade Games has the reins on this historic hotel-building powerhouse, releasing both a premium 60th Anniversary Edition in 2024 and its retail counterpart in 2023. While these new versions may have a fresh coat of paint, they still maintain the same wonderful gameplay that has kept it around for six decades and landed it on our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">best classic board games</a>.</p><div id="215711" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="578d7190-f9d3-4f11-9bcb-7e0a0d6f6c4e"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Acquire 60th Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="578d7190-f9d3-4f11-9bcb-7e0a0d6f6c4e" id="159919"><div id="159919" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Acquire</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Acquire plays with two to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-6-player-board-games">six players</a>, where everyone lays tiles, establishes hotel chains, and purchases shares of stock – all with the hopes of getting big returns on their investments. While the theme may not sound the most enthralling compared to other games on your local game store’s shelves, there’s a reason Acquire has been around for more than 60 years. It’s easy to teach and has a deceptive amount of strategy involved – so much so that it was even featured at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rdQlj9BVA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>World Series of Board Gaming</u></a> tournament last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On your turn, players will pull a tile – each with a grid coordinate printed on it – and place it on the board in its corresponding spot. When a tile is placed and creates a minimum of two adjacently connected ones, a hotel is formed, and its founder gets a share of its stock. The larger a hotel chain grows, the more expensive each share of stock becomes, but also, the greater the payout when that hotel gets acquired and absorbed into a bigger hotel. So, buying low and selling high is the name of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These latest versions from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/renegade">Renegade Games</a> offer a new variant rule known as Tycoon Mode, which makes it easier for players who aren’t in the lead to stage a comeback. In the traditional Classic Mode, only the first- and second-place owners of a hotel chain – the two who own the most stock – get the payout when it’s acquired. Tycoon Mode expands this benefit to the third player as well. While I prefer the classic option, I appreciate this variant’s inclusion to help ease new players into the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unique to the 60th Anniversary Edition are a set of special power cards that tweak the gameplay further. These cards provide powerful bonuses, such as playing four tiles at once or buying three stocks for free. While these cards dramatically change the game, I found them to be too powerful and game-altering for my tastes. After a single playthrough with them, I haven’t gone back and have no real desire to. However, like Tycoon Mode, they are optional, so they're worth trying out to see if they suit your style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding the differences between the main retail release and the 60th Anniversary Edition, the $50 price difference comes with enough tweaks and adjustments to make the premium edition worth considering. Gameplay and core components (tiles, board, and cards) remain the same – with the exception of the power cards – so the main differences lie in the components.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three main upgrades in the premium version that make the investment worthwhile: a drawstring bag for tile selection, a removable insert for organizing share cards and hotel miniatures, and replacing paper money with sturdy poker chips.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, these may not seem like major upgrades – or worth the additional cost – but the improved organizer and drawstring bag significantly enhance the experience. Storing and blindly grabbing tiles from a bag eliminates the need to manually flip over tiles during setup, making the game flow much smoother. If you opt for the base edition, I highly recommend finding a bag to use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another helpful addition exclusive to the Anniversary Edition is the redesigned plastic organizer, which stores share cards in their own separate container with a plastic lid. This allows the cards, which are held upright in grooves alongside their corresponding hotel miniatures, to be placed more conveniently. In contrast, the base edition’s organizer is the size of the entire game box, which, while functional, takes up more table space. Most players would likely prefer having the cards placed separately on the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last exclusive upgrade is purely cosmetic: replacing paper money with poker chips. Personally, I detest paper money in board games and believe it should have stayed in the 1960s. A significant portion of the Anniversary Edition’s increased price comes from this component upgrade, but what an upgrade it is. The chips have a nice weight to them, are neatly stored in their own container, and help keep the game organized. Plus, they’re simply more satisfying to handle than flimsy paper bills – there’s just something about that clinky sound.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Acquire: 60th Anniversary Edition (MSRP $99.99)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4Xqe?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D7MSX6PR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3ReLK?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Atomic Empire</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXYp4?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Standard Edition (MSRP $49.99)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/7XxGD?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKO4n8?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Atomic Empire</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/znXYgx?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">See More Strategy Board Games:</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Feb 24, 2025 7:25 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Acquire is one of those games I can always fall back on for game nights, knowing it will be a great time. We even have it on our list of the best classic board games. The Renegade releases were my first foray into the game, but it quickly became apparent why it has endured for so long. It’s easy to learn, quick to set up (especially with the Anniversary Edition), and offers a low barrier to entry while maintaining a high skill ceiling. This is especially true thanks to the new Tycoon Mode and power cards, which make it more accessible for younger and newer players.
Whether you get the base version or the more expensive Anniversary Edition, Acquire is an easy recommendation for any board game collection.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/jump-ship-preview-its-sea-of-thieves-meets-left-4-dead-and-its-even-more-polished-and-fun-than-last-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It was almost exactly one year ago that I walked into a meeting during the Game Developer’s Conference and first got introduced to Jump Ship, a four-player sci-fi PvE shooter that blends mechanics from Sea of Thieves, Left 4 Dead, and FTL into something I thought was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jump-ship-plays-like-a-mix-of-sea-of-thieves-left-4-dead-and-ftl">extremely special</a>. I recently had a chance to play the latest build with a few of the developers, and let’s just say that if any indie game can break out big in what’s already an absolutely stacked year of releases, I’d bet my money on Jump Ship. As it heads towards an Early Access launch this Summer, it’s more polished and more fun than ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you aren’t familiar with Jump Ship already, it’s a non-grindy space romp for up to four players — and I specifically didn’t say multiplayer because the team at Keepsake Games told me they’re responding to feedback and building on what they hope will be a clever way for solo players to enjoy Jump Ship. In short, if you want to treat it like a single-player game, there will be narratively constructed AI assistants to help you man the ship. You get a taste of this in the Prologue, which serves as one part tutorial — introducing you to gameplay mechanics like shooting, flying in your space suit, manning and piloting the ship, and ship combat — and one part lore-builder. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Jump Ship - Closed Beta Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Jump Ship now has a much-appreciated story behind its core PvE gameplay. A malicious virus has infected machines throughout the galaxy, and it’s up to you and your fellow Atirans to get to the root of it at the heart of the galaxy and stop it. You’ll run through procedurally generated chains of missions in each sector in order to get there. Some take 10 minutes, others might take an hour. You’ll know roughly what to expect going in, as each one of your branching choices on the Jump Map is color-coded to let you know how much danger you’re voluntarily wading into. But of course, the greater the danger, the greater the reward… </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Jump Ship now has a much-appreciated story behind its core PvE gameplay.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aiding you is a non-infected AI you discover in the Prologue called Iris, who acts as something of a narrator on your missions. It’s a welcome bit of structure around the solid foundation of gameplay Jump Ship brings to the table. As is the Hangar, which is the sort-of base of operations from which you can cash in your in-game currency to buy and customize your outfits, look at the greater Galaxy Map, and even engage in a bit of soccer in your downtime. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But back to that core four-player gameplay. Boy oh boy is it fun! As you embark on your mission, things naturally won’t always go according to plan. Your ship will get attacked en route to your destination, requiring one of you to pilot the ship and fire the meager pilot’s chair weapons, while another sits down at the ship’s proper weapon station to wield the 360-degree-pivoting cannon at any annoying targets. Meanwhile, the other two of you might be mag-booted to the ship’s hull outside, taking shots at passing ships. That is, until an enemy vessel damages your ship, requiring one or more of you to run inside, grab a fire extinguisher, crawl into a vent, and put out the flames. After all, you’ve gotta keep that pineapple pizza-maker in full working order!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you do get where you’re going, all four of you disembark and make your way on foot inside the structure that houses the loot you’re after. These evil, infected robots will keep coming and they won’t play nice, so teamwork is essential at each step of the mission. Your grappling hook helps zip you around areas both on the ground and in outer space much quicker, and once you’ve got the big loot, one of you has got to get it back aboard the ship while the others protect your defenseless, arms-full self.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Both my demo last year and my latest one just the other day were short. On the one hand, it proves that Jump Ship is a blast in short bursts, and thus you don’t have to quit your job in order to keep up with it. On the other hand, though, I haven’t seen enough of the larger mission structure and the procedurally generated variety to know if it will deliver on its endlessly replayable promise. But everything I’ve seen so far absolutely screams potential hit. Jump Ship has all the right ingredients to become something special, and I can’t wait to play a lot more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.
