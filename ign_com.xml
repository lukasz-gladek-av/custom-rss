Another user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1g7uo7s/if_you_want_a_say_in_what_you_opponent_plays/?chainedPosts=t3_1gkaiy0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bodeler</a>, pulled a Moltres ex, Rapidash, Charizard ex, Moltres ex, and Alakazam, again all in the incredibly rare alternate art forms. "I pooped," they said.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">God Packs definitely exist in Pokemon TCG Pocket! Check mine out! <a href="https://t.co/JH4l3OM9pa" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/JH4l3OM9pa</a></p>— Sauce McGavin (@SauceMcGavin) <a href="https://twitter.com/SauceMcGavin/status/1851756520402231670?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">These 60 alternate cards are the rarest pieces available in Pokémon TCG Pocket and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">add well over a year to the completion time of the first set</a>, Genetic Apex. Pulling five in one go will certainly speed this process along, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has led many to desperately attempt to figure out if there's a hidden mechanic that can trigger god packs, though beyond the almost definitely not legitimate conspiracy theory about crinkled corners, it comes down to pure luck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Creatures Inc. has shared the actual odds behind these packs, however, which are officially just called Rare Packs. Players have a 0.05% of opening one, Pokémon TCG Pocket tells players, meaning a one in 2,000 chance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some friendly fellow players and some who are, dare we say, jealous, are urging those who shared their god pack pulls to also share their friend codes. Pokémon TCG Pocket features something called Wonder Pick, which lets players dip into others' packs and pull one of those cards, and the list of available packs can be pulled from the friend list.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This means that, if someone is friends with a player who opens a god pack, that secondary player may also get a taste. While Wonder Picks are often reserved to middling packs, leaving plenty of common cards on the table for the random one in five chance, god packs obviously guarantee <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-has-a-secret-mew-card-thats-not-super-difficult-to-get">an incredibly rare card</a> even at their weakest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October as a streamlined, digital version of the beloved trading card game. It has players opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others;</a> a simple formula that's already proved popular given it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">$12 million in four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. is busy adding all sorts of events to the game, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-pvp-event-today">a player versus player battle event released today, November 7</a>. This isn't quite a full competitive mode for Pokémon TCG Pocket but is certainly a step in that direction, and will certainly be the first proper competitive test of which decks are best, with both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo ex and Charizard ex having dominated so far</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
