            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has asked a judge to grant the fired GTA 6 developers interim relief at a preliminary employment tribunal hearing held in the UK this week. Rockstar Games, which also attended the hearing, has issued a response to the claims, denying a number of points made by the union.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has insisted the employees it fired late last year were dismissed because they leaked game features for upcoming and unannounced titles in Discord, not because they were trying to unionize. 34 members of staff at Rockstar were dismissed, 31 in the UK and three in Canada, sparking protests outside the office of GTA 6 developer Rockstar North in Edinburgh, Scotland, and outside parent company Take-Two’s office in London.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rockstar North and Take-Two Office Protest Photos Nov 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The IWGB, which is representing the affected staff in the UK, has refuted Rockstar’s claim, saying that the workers "only communicated in private and legally-protected trade union channels."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Monday, January 5, a preliminary hearing at the Glasgow Tribunals Centre in Scotland saw the IWGB represent the fired Rockstar workers and make a case for why they should be granted interim relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interim relief is a legal mechanism that can provide workers with support while they wait for a full hearing. This week’s tribunal will decide whether or not the workers will receive the interim relief while awaiting a date for a full trial. If the interim relief is granted, the workers will be put back on Rockstar’s payroll and have their work visas reinstated where necessary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IWGB told IGN today that it is hopeful the judge will see it their way, but insisted that if the interim relief is not granted, that doesn’t mean Rockstar will not be found guilty of breaking the law if and when the case goes to trial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hope this week’s tribunal will grant urgently needed relief to the workers whose lives were turned upside down by Rockstar’s brutal union-busting, leaving them and their families without incomes, without secure futures, and in some cases without even the right to remain in the country they have made their home,” the IWGB said in a statement issued to IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“However, no matter the outcome of this interim hearing, we remain confident in the strength of  the case we have brought against Rockstar Games. We reiterate our firm belief that Rockstar broke the law when it summarily dismissed 31 of our members, and we look forward now to the day we face them in court for a full and substantive tribunal hearing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rockstar hoped to quickly and quietly wipe out a group of workers who were organising for better conditions. Instead, their dismissal of 31 union members captured the world’s attention and ignited an unprecedented uprising of global solidarity. This case is not just about the suffering of the 31 people who lost their livelihoods in the blink of an eye. This is about the arrogance of a company like Rockstar thinking that its size and profitability grant it an unlimited licence to abuse its workers, and to do so with impunity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Whether or not interim relief is granted this week, we will continue fighting in the courts and on the streets until we see justice, for the fired Rockstar workers and for workers everywhere fighting for a fairer future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Rockstar Games spokesperson issued IGN with the following statement on this week’s hearing. In it, the company addressed many of the union’s claims, and claimed the organization lacks any evidence to justify emergency interim relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rockstar categorically denies the claim being heard in today’s hearing,” the Rockstar spokesperson said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have consistently made clear that we took necessary action against a group of individuals across the UK and Canada who discussed highly confidential information, including relating to game features from upcoming and unannounced titles, in an insecure and public social channel. This was a breach of long-standing and well-understood confidentiality policies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This channel contained at least 25 non-Rockstar employees, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, as well as dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Meanwhile, employees who posted union-supportive messages, but who did not breach confidentiality policies, were not dismissed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We regret that these dismissals were necessary; however, confidentiality is fundamental to everything Rockstar Games does. Global interest in our games is unparalleled. Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage — as we have seen in the past — and damage the experience of our loyal players and dedicated team. This was never about union membership. We have always taken a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorized releases of information — and we always will.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has indicated to IGN that it believes the IWGB’s claim of “union-busting” is baseless, and that the union has no evidence to support its statements. Rockstar has also denied having a “blacklist” of union members, stressing that at the time of the dismissals, the company did not know whether the claimants were union members, so could not have targeted them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">as it has said before</a>, Rockstar employees themselves raised concerns to the company and granted representatives access to the “social” channel, not the Discord channel used for official union organizing. It maintains that this social Discord channel was not private or for employees only, and indeed contained hundreds of users, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, and dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members. As IGN has also reported, Rockstar has claimed that the union channel mods didn’t know who was in the channel, and that it posed a leak risk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What about this alleged leaked information? Rockstar believes it to be significant and related to game features around GTA 6. This includes specific game features, comments on the progress of GTA 6 development, and timelines to launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar believes that if the comments in question were leaked they would have been big gaming news and might even have affected Take-Two’s share price. When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">Rockstar officially announced that GTA 6 would be delayed by six months</a> to November 19, 2026, the market value of Take-Two plummeted $3.75 billion in a single day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And Rockstar has pointed to its well-established zero tolerance approach to leaks, highlighting that it dismissed a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK in April 2025, who it alleged disclosed confidential information about GTA 6 to a third party who published the information to social media, and dismissed an employee in the U.S. in November 2023 and another in India in November 2025 for two separate acts of information leaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hearing comes after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-prime-minister-sir-keir-starmer-says-rockstar-firing-31-gta-6-developers-over-alleged-union-busting-is-deeply-concerning-and-pledges-that-ministers-will-now-investigate"><u>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the case “deeply concerning,"</u></a> and pledged that ministers would investigate. The layoffs were raised by Rockstar North's local MP Chris Murray in the UK's Parliament during a session of Prime Minister's Questions that took place late last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The video games company Rockstar in my constituency last month fired 31 employees without providing evidence or union representation," Murray told the Prime Minister. "The [Independent Workers Union of Great Britain] IWGB alleges union busting. Having met Rockstar they failed to reassure me they are following employment law and I share concerns about union busting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Given this government is responsible for the biggest increase in workers rights in a generation," Murray continued, "does the Prime Minister agree all companies regardless of profit size must follow UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a deeply concerning case," Starmer replied. "Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Our ministers will look into the particular case that he [Murray] raises and will keep him updated."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Union busting has consequences! UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer says the government will look into <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RockstarGames</a>'s dismissal of 31 union members. <a href="https://t.co/4EEM9NvcR7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4EEM9NvcR7</a></p>— IWGB Game Workers (@IWGB_GW) <a href="https://twitter.com/IWGB_GW/status/1998758009200341375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement sent to IGN at the time, MP Chris Murray shared detail of his attempts to discuss the matter with Rockstar itself, including a joint meeting alongside fellow Edinburgh MPs Tracy Gilbert and Scott Arthur at Rockstar North's offices, which began with a standoff over the need to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The meeting began with us as MPs refused entry unless an NDA was signed, a request they eventually withdrew after being made clear this would not be signed," Murray said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: "The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members. I was not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently questioned Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick on the matter, who answered by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-our-culture-is-extraordinary-amid-accusations-of-union-busting-at-gta-6-dev-rockstar-games"><u>defending the company's culture</u></a> and saying that Take-Two was "incredibly proud of our labor relations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Lesley Martin/PA Images via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

And we're kicking off a month of very orky IGN First coverage with their opening cinematic (watch it above), setting the stage for a load of krumpin'. You gotta respect the boyz for knowing what they're about and living their truth, even if their truth is largely mayhem and murder. They never pretend to be anything they're not, you know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action starts with an Ork assault on one of the last battle barges of the Blood Ravens chapter of Space Marines. The long-time protagonists of the Dawn of War series, the red-clad Astartes are in a bad spot at this point in the 42nd Millennium, with the chapter barely clinging to life. And their return to Kronus hasn't gone unnoticed, with their perennial rival in the warboss Gorgutz meeting them head-on. It's the biggest and meanest we've ever seen him, trivially snapping a Primaris marine in half with his Mega Armor exoskeleton.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the surviving Blood Ravens try to escape their doomed ship – led by returning heroes Commander Cyrus and Chief Librarian Jonah Orion – Gorgutz orders his Ork Rok (basically just a big asteroid full of orks with rockets built in) to crash on the planet and pursue the beakies. But the Ork campaign won't just be about his story, as there's a native warboss on Kronus already who isn't eager to bend the knee to this Nob from the sky.You'll get to learn a lot more about him, and the Ork campaign and battle mechanics, all month long as part of IGN First. So keep an eye out for our interviews with the creative director for Dawn of War 4, a demonstration of the new synced melee animation system, and a hands-on preview of the first several campaign missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, don't miss our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4-first-impressions-from-a-series-veteran">first preview</a> of the upcoming RTS sequel, and stay tuned for our exclusive new coverage all January long!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has acknowledged leaving some completionist fans who wanted a "challenging" final boss fight "disappointed" at its difficulty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to Edge magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-underestimated-how-many-players-would-do-all-the-side-content-regrets-disappointing-people-that-wanted-a-challenging-end-boss/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>), Clair Obscur lead game designer Michel Nohra said he regretted not making it clearer that the game's final boss should be fought as soon as possible to experience the battle at its optimum level of challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nohra noted complaints from some completionist players who found themselves wanting more of tougher fight, having continued to level up by mopping up all the game's side content. But this was something Clair Obscur's team hadn't expected, Nohra explained, as they weren't sure if players would enjoy the game to the extent that they did.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now," Nohra said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content. And that's something I underestimated, which made people that wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed. I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By way of an explanation, lead programmer Tom Guillermin said it had been "a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon," having previously been unsure how long players would stick around in the game's world once the ability to go beat the final boss became available. "We're happy about that," Guillermin added, "but we didn't see it coming."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For players seeking even tougher challenges, the game's final DLC added a fresh area full of the hardest fights in the game — and players have been having fun with their own creative ways to make these even harder. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fan-wins-ridiculous-8-hour-boss-battle-with-10545-successful-parries-and-no-dodges">one intrepid expeditioner spent eight hours notching up 10,000 parries against one of the DLC's toughest new bosses</a> in frankly ridiculous conditions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's huge popularity and success, its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-storms-the-game-awards-2025-wins-coveted-game-of-the-year">recent sweep at The Game Awards 2025 speaks for itself</a>.
