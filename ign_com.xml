He knows, because he's cleared every boss in Nightreign already, by himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-director-interview-if-he-can-solo-every-boss-so-can-you/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNET</a> in a recent interview, Ishizaki was asked whether he has beaten every boss, including the final one, himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yes. I can hopefully give you reassurance to know that I have beaten all of the game's bosses," said Ishizaki. "I've seen everything it has to offer, both in multiplayer and as a solo player. So I want you and players to know that this is very possible, and I want you to have the confidence to give it a try yourself."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CNET followed to clarify that Ishizaki was saying he had soloed every boss in the game. "Yes," Ishizaki confirmed. "And without relics."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While that's a pretty dang impressive accomplishment in and of itself, I do like the notion that Ishizaki's clears are also meant to be encouraging for other players. If he can do it, essentially, then you might be able to as well. I don't know about the "without relics" part, though. You can give yourself a little bit of leeway on that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There have been other players who have been clearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBS751sS2Ao" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both individual bosses</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-elden-right-nightreign-player-got-their-solo-nightlord-clears-in-before-the-nerf-heres-how">the full roster of Nightlords</a> solo as well. Still, the solo experience of Nightreign has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review">been under scrutiny</a>, and not just for its difficulty, but also for how some mechanics (like revival) feel more oriented around teamplay than solo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's clear FromSoftware is both hearing and addressing those concerns, too. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-1011-nerfs-solo-mode-difficulty-fixes-bugs-and-makes-more-balance-changes">most recent patch, 1.01.1, arrived days after Elden Ring Nightreign's launch</a> and took aim directly at the solo mode, increasing the runes gained by lone players and adding one free automatic revival for night bosses.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if the difficulty is getting tuned down, though, Ishizaki's clears can still be inspiring for those struggling against the Nightlords in their own runs. When the rains pick up and the storm closes in, you can know someone else has already done it, and so can you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

He can serenade you, join and leave squads at will, respond intelligently to the player, issue impromptu dialogue, summarize gameplay events, and warn the player if something's about to go down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Darth Vader is voiced by the inimitable James Earl Jones, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-earl-jones-iconic-voice-of-darth-vader-and-mufasa-has-died"><u>who died in September 2024</u></a> at the age of 93.

Epic soon patched it out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">AI Darth Vader, it seems, was just the beginning. During State of Unreal 2025, Epic unveiled plans to release new tools for creators to build their own AI-powered NPCs in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). As demonstrated on-stage, creators will be able to use the new Persona Device to create characters with personalities that players can talk to. You can select the type of voice and delivery you want for your NPC, as well as their characteristics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re taking what we learned from Darth Vader and sharing the underlying technology with the creator community,” Epic said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, well-known IP is coming to UEFN, including Squid Game on June 27, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and official Star Wars features, templates, and assets.
