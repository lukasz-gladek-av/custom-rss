            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-and-limbo-are-currently-free-on-the-epic-games-store<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">One of the better offers in recent memory.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Epic Games Store is giving away a beloved indie title and the most recent Borderlands game as part of <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its weekly rollout of free PC games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an especially notable addition to Epic’s long-running free game promotion, which sees the company dropping a variety of titles for all Epic Games Store users at no additional cost every week. This week, PC users can add Playdead’s breakout video game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/limbo"><u>Limbo</u></a>, and Gearbox’s Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired Borderlands spinoff, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands"><u>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</u></a>, to their libraries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both titles are available to nab from now to next Thursday, June 5, at 8am PT / 11am ET, at which point they’ll no longer be free to own. Even if you don’t find yourself playing games on PC very often, you might as well sign into an Epic Games Store account and claim both games for the future just in case.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is a Borderlands side story that launched for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S in early 2022. While previous entries in the series see players team up to loot and shoot across twisted sci-fi settings, this spinoff drops fans into a fantasy setting with a few gameplay shakeups, such as new weapon types and fleshed-out character customization, to keep things interesting. Thanks in part to a surprisingly star-studded cast that includes Andy Samberg, Wanda Sykes, Will Arnett, and more, we felt Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands was a fitting addition to the Borderlands universe, giving it an 8/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review-pc-xbox-playstation"><u>our review</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Limbo, meanwhile, is a much more scaled-down adventure that sees players controlling a small child as they trudge through an unforgiving, colorless world. It’s a short story that <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/5304" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>HowLongToBeat</u></a> says takes just over three hours to complete, but it’s been more than enough to leave an impression on gamers for nearly 15 years. We gave it a 9/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/02/limbo-review-2"><u>our original review</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands and Limbo follow <a href="https://in.ign.com/sifu/231653/news/free-video-games-this-week-epic-games-is-offering-sifu-gigapocalypse-and-deliver-at-all-costs-amazon" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>last week’s free Epic Games Store titles</u></a>, which included Deliver At All Costs, Gigapocalypse, and Sifu. When this week’s titles are removed, another batch of free games will be announced.

The full Marvel vs. Capcom lineup includes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Wolverine vs. Silver Samurai</li><li>Psylocke vs. Thanos</li><li>Captain America vs. Venom</li><li>War Machine vs. Omega Red</li><li>Gargantos (formerly known as Shuma-Gorath)</li><li>Juggernaut</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">While Hasbro has released most of these characters in Marvel Legends form in the past (save for Gargantos), these figures are embellished to better capture the dynamic sprite designs from the classic games. For example, Wolverine has the exaggerated claws and mask, while Venom is decked out in his game-accurate blue color scheme. The Psylocke figure in particular showcases the extreme articulation possible with these new figures.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, not every character from the Marvel vs. Capcom games is represented here, but collectors can always look to past Marvel Legends releases to fill out their lineup. At this point, even relatively more obscure characters like Marrow and Blackheart have been featured in the Marvel Legends line. The bigger challenge is assembling the Capcom side of the roster. Might we recommend Jada Toys' Street Fighter line when it comes to Ryu, Chun-Li, and the rest of the Street Fighter gang?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro also showed off their line of The Fantastic Four: First Steps figures, which includes the titular foursome along with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fantastic-four-mcu-silver-surfer-shalla-bal-woman">Julia Garner's Silver Surfer</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-gets-review-bombed-again-this-time-over-its-big-battle-for-super-earth<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle for Super Earth is raging on in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, as players fight to hold back the invading Illuminate fleet. A new controversy surrounding the invasion, though, has led to some frustration and a fresh flood of negative reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To set the stage, the latest update for Helldivers 2 — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-finally-brings-the-illuminate-invasion-to-the-streets-of-super-earth">Heart of Democracy </a>— brought months and months of storyline building to fruition. The Meridian Singularity, a black hole formed during an operation against Terminids, had been flung towards Super Earth as the tip of the spear for an Illuminate invasion. The "Great Host" fleet flooded through the now-wormhole and onto Super Earth, turning the planet into a battlefield.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the days since the update went live, players have fought to hold the various Mega Cities of Super Earth, which correspond to major cities in real-life. York Supreme, for example, corresponds roughly to New York, and Remembrance to Buenos Aires. As the invasion has continued, more and more cities have fallen; as of this writing, only Equality-On-Sea (Shanghai) and Super Earth's capital, Prosperity City (Stockholm) remain standing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the invasion has approached what feels like endgame, a <em>lot </em>has happened. Helldivers players tend to "get into character" and play up the Major Orders, rallying behind different causes and calls to try and beat each new challenge that developer Arrowhead lobs at them. Some, for example, stopped playing matches on Super Earth to contribute to a new effort in another sector against the Automaton forces, which ultimately brought the DSS — a massive military orbital space station — <a href="https://x.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1927759821836538125" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back to Super Earth</a> to assist with the defensive efforts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Illuminate gaining ground and taking Mega Cities, efforts rallied behind Equality-On-Sea to make a last stand. Amid all this, there was a sense of comradery extended across nations; as more players dropped in to raise Equality-On-Sea's percentage and hold it against the Great Host, memes and support flooded in. Even as the Illuminate focused efforts on the city, players held out and kept diving.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's all been fairly heartwarming and exciting stuff, the sort of emergent story that Helldivers 2 is quite capable of forging in its greatest moments; where developer storylines, player investment, and community efforts result in some really brilliant moments of cooperative war theater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Equality-On-Sea never hit 100%. From here, the situation gets a little more complex, and a lot rougher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While players made a concerted effort to hold Equality-On-Sea against the continued onslaught, the current arc closed with the cities' percentage meter at 99.9783% (keep that number in mind). Most Major Orders and operations in Helldivers are about completion, a binary success-or-failure state. As some have pointed out, though, there might have been confusion about what the percentage meter meant in the defense of Super Earth. Rather than "liberating" a city and re-taking it, players are holding it. So it stands to reason that Helldivers might not be able to "100%" the defense, because the Illuminate are continuing to invade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, alongside theories that the war is narrowing down to an ultimate showdown in Super Earth's capital of Prosperity City, seems to be the main driver behind a new influx of negative reviews on Steam. As of this writing, roughly 2,312 negative reviews of Helldivers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have been submitted to Steam</a> in the last 24 hours compared to 324 positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the negative reviews are in Chinese, and while the machine translation doesn't seem accurate enough to quote, there are some recurring points one can easily glean: frustration over driving the narrative, the perception of a thumb on the scale from Arrowhead, and repeat mentions of "99.9783%."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Helldivers NOW (@Helldivers_NOW) <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1928075624414920862?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, it's important to keep this all in context. Yes, there is a fresh round of negative reviews on the game, and it's obviously a larger amount than the average trickle of reviews. It also still, at this moment, pales in comparison to the more-infamous review-bombing of Helldivers 2 from May 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-ceo-apologizes-amid-helldivers-2-review-bombing">where thousands upon thousands of negative reviews flooded in over PSN requirements</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are, broadly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ky6fp6/can_we_not_reviewbomb_the_game_because_were/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">understandably</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ky8p1o/we_cant_ever_have_anything_nice/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frustrated</a>. This should be a peak in Helldivers 2 history, as both the culmination of a long-running storyline and one of the cooler in-game moments Arrowhead has concocted. I've spent some time diving on Super Earth, and it's really an incredible feat. Arrowhead has nailed the feeling of holding out in these Mega Cities as massive, terrifying Illuminate forces rampage through, causing wanton destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And because so much of this is all tied into national identity, the previous sense of international comradery has been tainted a bit too. Even as players, mods, and fan accounts have <a href="https://x.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1928044854225031493" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">urged players</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ky7jdu/comment/muw298u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not get caught up</a> in the controversy, it has put a tinge of a bad taste on this otherwise incredible moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of this writing, Helldivers are still holding out across the Mega Cities of Equality-On-Sea and Prosperity City, with the former holding the higher percentage. It looks like the battle for Super Earth is entering its final phase, and the current order is simple: Hold Super Earth. Hopefully players can still hold out, seize victory, and celebrate the good in all this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
