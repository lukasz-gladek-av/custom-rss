I've listened to it several times this morning and can report that, annoyingly, they've made it even more catchy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-blows-past-700-million-at-the-box-office-in-its-quest-to-be-the-highest-grossing-video-game-film-ever">breakout box office run in theaters</a> that saw A Minecraft Movie notch up (no pun intended) $955 million, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-block-party-edition-to-double-down-on-memes-with-sing-along-theatrical-release-in-may">launch of a special singalong version of the film</a>, Steve's Lava Chicken found its own fame by becoming the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jack-blacks-steves-lava-chicken-song-from-a-minecraft-movie-officially-hits-the-billboard-100-charts-the-shortest-ever">shortest-ever track to make the coveted US Billboard Hot 100 Chart</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Minecraft has released a remixed version of the viral Lava Chicken song from the movie <a href="https://t.co/gQER36wTTF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gQER36wTTF</a></p>— barry scott (@barryscott33338) <a href="https://twitter.com/barryscott33338/status/1945093537701220662?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">At just 34 seconds, the song — which boasts deep lyrics like "la-la-la-lava ch-ch-ch-chicken" — was written by Black and the film’s director Jared Hess, and marks the second video game movie appearance by Black to feature a breakout song, after his turn belting out "Peaches" as Bowser in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie">Super Mario Bros.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A surprise continuation for the Rebel Moon universe is here.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zack-snyders-rebel-moon-is-apparently-getting-a-ridiculous-scale-video-game-adaptation">Blood Line</a>, a video game spinoff for Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon, finally launched today as the Netflix movie series it’s based on remains with an uncertain future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Subscribers may have been surprised to see Blood Line: A Rebel Moon Game show up as a playable game on their mobile devices today. Developed by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate studio Super Evil Mega Corp, this spinoff of the sci-fi universe that Snyder kicked off in 2023 allows players to drop into the Rebel Moon universe with isometric, twin-stick shooter gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Take on intense combat missions in this multiplayer action game,” an official description for Blood Line says. “Build a rebellion against the Motherworld and fight for your planet’s freedom.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With friends or alone, Blood Line tells a standalone story completely separate from the tale spun in Rebel Moon parts 1 and 2. What’s more is that Netflix Games and Super Evil Mega Corp <a href="https://www.rebelmoongame.com/features/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>promise</u></a> their video game spinoff will “expand and evolve across regular post-launch updates.” With more challenges and rewards yet to be revealed, Blood Line’s future seems much more secure than the film series it originates from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rebel Moon: Part 1 – A Child of Fire set the stage for a new world from Snyder when it premiered in late 2023. After propping it up as a big-budget sci-fi epic with lots of moving parts, Rebel Moon Part 1 failed to impress, scoring a 22% from critics and 56% from fans on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rebel_moon_part_1_a_child_of_fire" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rotten Tomatoes</u></a> (we gave it a 4/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-part-one-review-netflix-zack-snyder"><u>our review</u></a>). Rebel Moon: Part 2 – The Scargiver attempted to get the new universe back on track upon its release in April 2024 but faced a similar landing with a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rebel_moon_part_two_the_scargiver" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>16% from critics and 47% from fans</u></a> (we also gave it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-part-two-the-scargiver-review-netflix-zack-snyder"><u>a 4/10</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snyder Cut versions of both Rebel Moon films eventually made their way to Netflix in August 2024 and received <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rebel_moon_part_one_directors_cut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>more positive reviews from audiences</u></a>, but Netflix has been quiet about how the story may continue. Snyder spoke about his work with Netflix during a recent interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/rebel-moon-video-game-zack-snyder-film-franchise-superman-1236453663/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a>. While Rebel Moon and its characters remain on the Man of Steel director’s mind, it sounds like he’s got other projects he’ll be tackling first.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I got sidetracked into this — not sidetracked, it’s all uptown problems, as they say — for Netflix, I’m working on an LAPD SWAT movie,” Snyder said. “So I was like, OK, well, I’m gonna just sort of let that Rebel Moon world boil for a minute, and I’m gonna go do this. And frankly, it was a very exhausting, long process doing the two movies together. So it was nice to have a bit of a break from it. I love it like crazy, but it’s nice to have a bit of a break. So yeah, we’ll see after I finish this, when I come back, where we are with everything.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snyder adds that there are “tons of stories” to tell from the Rebel Moon, but he still needs to determine how the universe could expand, “if at all.” While we wait to see how Blood Line might continue to build on Snyder's world, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-star-says-negative-reviews-zack-snyder-movie-really-affected-her">how the negative reviews affected Rebel Moon star Sofia Boutella</a>.
