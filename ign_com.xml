            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprise! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> is cutting the prices of its store cosmetics, and will refund anyone who snapped them up before the new price goes into effect tomorrow, November 13. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an update on the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Arc Raiders website</u></a>, developer Embark Studios said it has "heard [player] feedback," writing: "We’ve reviewed our prices and made adjustments to lower prices where applicable." Revised prices go live tomorrow, November 13, at 1.30am PT / 4.30am ET / 9.30am GMT).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For any Raider who has already made a purchase on the old pricing, we’ll compensate you for the difference. These Raider Tokens will be refunded back into your account automatically in the coming week."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The team stopped short of revealing the new prices, or how big the discounts will be. Nonetheless, it should be good news for players, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwmpz/im_new_here_but_kinda_disgruntled_at_the_cosmetic/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>some of whom have been unhappy at the costs</u></a>, complaining that the premium skins cost "half [the] price of the game" itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not the only big news we've had today, either. Embark also confirmed it has been "silently testing" duo matchmaking and has indeed enabled it earlier this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have silently tested and enabled duo prioritized matchmaking, beginning earlier this week," the team explained. "Duo matchmaking will work like this: first, we prioritize Solos and Squads to play separately. After that, we prioritize Duos to play with other Duos, and for Trios to play with Trios. Please note that this is not a 100% guaranteed system, so you may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, while there's currently one free Raider Deck available for all, in the future players will see both free and premium decks. As the team explained, gameplay Items are only in free Raider Decks, but to "help you along the way as a new Raider, we have included some gameplay Items in the free Raider Deck, which can be unlocked via progression."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also "no pay-to-win items in the premium Raider Decks," Embark insisted, saying the "focus" for premium Decks is based on "cosmetics and convenience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-first-major-update-north-line-goes-live-tomorrow-heres-what-to-expect">Don't forget that Arc Raiders' first major update, North Line, launches tomorrow</a>, November 13. The new update introduces a whole new region north of the Rust Belt called Stella Montis, described as "cold, pristine, and filled with the remnants of humanity's lost ambitions."  It'll introduce a whole new region, new community unlock event, two new ARCs — Matriarch and Shredder – as well as new weapons, playstyles, and quests. The next update, Cold Snap, arrives this December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Arc Raiders raises the bar for extraction shooters pretty much across the board, with an incredibly gripping progression grind, tense fights against NPCs and other players that make for memorable matches, and loot that feels completely worth all the work and stress it takes to obtain it," we wrote in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review"><u>IGN's Arc Raiders review</u></a>, which returned an 'Amazing' 9/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're not the only ones who are having a good time with it, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-publisher-defends-generative-ai-use-insists-every-game-company-is-now-using-it"><u>despite the controversy around its use of AI</u></a>.

Ouch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Raiders who complete its challenges will recover rare resources, new gameplay items, and potential weapon blueprints hidden in the ruins, revealing the next step in the struggle to reclaim the surface," developer Embark Studios teased. "Access to Stella Montis must first be earned — the tunnels leading to the new region will only open once the global community completes Breaking New Ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of which, Breaking New Ground is a new community unlock event where players must work together to restore the tunnels to Stella Montis, earning new event currency, Merits, as they go.

Don't hang around, though — this new track will only be available until December. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all, either. Embark has confirmed we'll also get to meet two new enemies, "each bringing distinct challenges to the surface." The Matriarch<em> </em>— described as a "hulking ARC that makes the Queen look friendly by comparison"— will appear under specific map conditions and will be available from the start of Breaking New Ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Shredder, however, will be exclusive to Stella Montis and will only emerge once the new region opens, "forcing Raiders to stay sharp in close-quarters encounters." To take them on, players can make use of the new Energy Burst Battle Rifle, a set of new Mines — Impulse, Timed, and Gas Jump — as well as fresh Playstyles Lone Wolf and Trailblazer, and all-new Questlines themed around Stella Montis.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Arc Raiders North Line Content Overview:</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Map: <strong>Stella Montis</strong></li><li>Community Unlock Event: <ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Breaking New Ground</strong></li><li><strong>Starts Nov. 13 at 10:30 a.m. CET</strong></li><li><strong>Multi-phase community event leading to Stella Montis unlock</strong></li></ul></li><li>New ARC: <ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Matriarch </strong></li><li><strong>Shredder</strong></li></ul></li><li>New Weapon and Gameplay Items:<ul data-cy="list"><li>Energy Burst Battle Rifle</li><li>Impulse Mine, Timed Mine, Gas Jump Mine</li></ul></li><li>New Play Styles: <strong>Lone Wolf and Trailblazer</strong></li><li>New Stella Montis Quests</li></ul><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/arc-raiders-stella-montis-1762958619093.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Arc Raiders North Line update.
