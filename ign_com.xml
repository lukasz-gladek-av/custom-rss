            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Absolutely no horsing around.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese developer Cygames <a href="https://umamusume.jp/visitingstables_guidelines/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>published a list of rules</u></a> for fans wanting to visit the real-life horses behind the characters in its anime racehorse-girl management game Umamusume: Pretty Derby, which got a <a href="https://umamusume.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>long-awaited global release</u></a> this June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, anime racehorse-girl management game, you heard that right. In the world of Umamusume: Pretty Derby, racehorses are reborn as cute anime girls, complete with equine ears and tails. The franchise started off in 2018 as an anime, followed by a Japan-only release of the mobile game in 2021. In the game, players can talk to, train and manage horse-girls like Special Week and Mejiro McQueen, sharing in their triumphs and losses. As a result, the Umamusume franchise has inspired a cult following, and apparently many fans have become interested in the real-life Japanese racehorses behind their favorite characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, in their enthusiasm, it seems that some fans may have caused distress to their favorites and their owners in real life. As previously reported by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/umamusume-pretty-derby-devs-urge-fans-to-not-pester-real-life-racehorses-3224393/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dexerto</u></a>, Cygames shared guidelines for those who want to visit real-life racehorses in Japan, reminding people that you can’t just rock up to a ranch and that horses are easily startled by loud noises and camera flashes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 9-point guideline was created by the <a href="https://uma-furusato.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Racehorse's Hometown Information Center</u></a>. The first two points urge would-be visitors to check with the center for tour availability and to confirm tour times before visiting. The rules also remind visitors to follow the instructions of ranch staff at all times, to refrain from smoking on-site, and not to enter stables or pastures without permission. The rest of the rules are centered on the horses’ wellbeing — don’t make loud noises and refrain from touching, feeding or taking flash photography of the horses.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/image005-1752142593002.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Umamusume: Pretty Derby's English language launch has exploded.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Cygames has been fostering strong connections to the Japanese horse racing world — it often shows up alongside and provides support for racehorse-related exhibits at events in Japan, and has donated to the Retired Racehorse Association of Japan (source: <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20240304-27999/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> is officially delayed to 2026, publisher Krafton has confirmed to IGN. The news follows a report that claimed the delay may cost the development team a $250 million bonus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krafton, the Korean company behind smash hit battle royale PUBG, acquired the $500 million-valued Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds in October 2021. At the time, Krafton insisted Unknown Worlds would continue to operate as an independent outfit. Following its announcement, the hotly anticipated Subnautica 2 was set for an early access release later in 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, last week, Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, and CEO Ted Gill, were replaced by former Striking Distance CEO, Steve Papoutsis, in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum">a shakeup that shocked the Subnautica community and sparked concern over the sequel’s future</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cleveland subsequently revealed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit</u></a> that while he and his colleagues believed Subnautica 2 was "ready for early release... that decision is in Krafton's hands." Krafton issued a community update of its own, suggesting a delay was incoming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, earlier this week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> reported that Subnautica 2 was delayed to 2026 — just months before it was due to pay a $250 million bonus to the development team. Bloomberg added that the delay was “against the wishes of the studio’s former leadership,” and that the $250 million bonus would have kicked in if Unknown Worlds hit certain revenue targets by the end of 2025. Without Subnautica 2 coming out this year, hitting those revenue targets is unlikely, and the bonus won’t be paid out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per Bloomberg:</p><blockquote>Unknown Worlds’ leadership planned to share the additional money with all of the studio’s employees, which number around 100. Staff who were at the company at the time of the acquisition were told they were eligible for bonuses ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to seven figures, the people said.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Krafton has made Subnautica 2’s delay to 2026 official, but in a statement to IGN, it insisted the decision had nothing to do with “any contractual or financial considerations.” Instead, Krafton claimed, the delay was about responding to feedback from playtests, and delay talks were already under discussion before Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill were outed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Krafton’s statement in full:</p><blockquote>During playtests for Subnautica 2, we received valuable feedback from our community that reinforced our confidence in the game's direction. At the same time, the feedback highlighted a few areas that could benefit from further refinement before release.</blockquote><blockquote>As community voices play a central role in how we shape our games, we’ve made the decision to give the development team more time to implement that feedback and deliver a more complete experience. As a result, Subnautica 2’s Early Access launch has been rescheduled for 2026.</blockquote><blockquote>This decision was based solely on our commitment to quality and to delivering the best possible experience for players. It was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations. Additionally, the decision had already been under discussion prior to recent leadership changes at the studio.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">For fans, the wait for Subnautica 2 goes on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

In it, each player has to work together to rebuild the titular Monkey Palace using LEGO bricks. You'll earn Banana Points by placing certain bricks of a specific color onto other color-distinguished spaces, which will then determine the amount of Banana Points you receive. Once all of the bricks are used and the Monkey Palace is complete, the game is over. Then, players add up their Banana Points, and the player with the most wins the game. It's pretty straightforward, but its simplicity makes it a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">good option for family game night</a> or for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">kids new to board games</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The way the game is designed, no two sessions will have the same Palace build outcome, so there's plenty of replayability potential and avenues to find new strategies. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Prime Day Board Game Deals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The board game selection for Prime Day isn't bad.
