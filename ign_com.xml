            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gaming-peripherals-maker-corsair-clarifies-gta-6-pc-early-2026-release-date-comment<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Corsair has clarified recent comments from one of its executives who claimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> would release on PC early 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During a financial call, Corsair Gaming’s VP of finance, Ronald van Veen, said: “Yeah, GTA 6 is probably the one everyone is talking about. And we’ll get a glimpse of that, I think, later on in the year for console. My understanding now it’s going to come out in the fall for console, and then early 2026 for PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was enough to spark a number of headlines about Corsair’s apparent insider information on GTA 6’s release window, but a representative of the company told IGN that Ronald van Veen’s comments were speculation, and confirmed Corsair does not have release dates supplied from Rockstar or Take-Two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">Take-Two recently committed to launching GTA 6 fall 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only</a>, despite concern around a potential delay. But what does this mean for the PC version, which remains unannounced?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an omission in keeping with developer Rockstar’s playbook for its previous games, but in 2025 feels outdated. And, given the increasing importance of the PC for a multiplatform game’s success, is GTA 6’s no-show on PC a missed opportunity or even a mistake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put that question to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick ahead of the company’s recent financial results, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">in his response he teased GTA 6’s <em>eventual</em> release on PC</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away,” Zelnick said of Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. “With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar fans have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question of how long PC gamers will have to wait for what could end up being one of the biggest games ever remains. Given GTA 6’s fall 2025 release window, it seems likely PC players won’t get to play the game until 2026 at the earliest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December 2023, a former developer at Rockstar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-rockstar-dev-tries-to-explain-why-gta-6-is-coming-to-pc-after-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s"><u>attempted to explain why GTA 6 is coming to PC after it hits PS5 and Xbox Series X and S</u></a>, and called on PC gamers to give the studio the “benefit of the doubt” over its controversial launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6">Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
