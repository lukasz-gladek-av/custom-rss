            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a new version of Resident Evil 2 made specifically for arcades, and an early version of it is already playable at Namco Funscape in the UK. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 2: Dead Shot, as this on-rails lightgun iteration is known, is the product of a collaboration between Bandai Namco and Capcom to create a fresh arcade iteration of the latter's survival horror classic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has visited Namco Funscape in Romford, north-east London, and gone hands-on with Resident Evil 2: Dead Shot ourselves — as you can see in our first footage above. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In it, we can see that Dead Shot has split Resident Evil 2's narrative into five episodes, with the first two already unlocked. It's believed that this arcade cabinet has been installed within Namco Funscape for testing, with early bugs ironed out after public play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead Shot's first episode is its prologue, with a second episode titled "Hunted". Loading up the prologue, the game then introduces Resident Evil 2's setting to players: "Leon and Claire find one another on the streets of Raccoon City. Chased by zombies, they evacuate to the police department only to discover further horrors within."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you select your episode, a zombified hand shatters through the screen, pulling you (and your co-op partner) in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The opening section sees Leon and Claire fighting their way into the Raccoon City Police Department, past zombie cops and zombie dogs. The game's visuals appear to be based on Capcom's 2019 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2 Remake</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Resident Evil Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once inside the building, the pair introduce themselves to each other before more zombie cops interrupt the party. Still, there's time for a little bit of exposition from just-about-still-alive cop Marvin Branagh, before the action continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with other arcade lightgun games, you'll need to point the gun away from the screen and pull the trigger to reload. You'll automatically reload when you run out of bullets, but manual reloading is faster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear how long Resident Evil 2: Dead Shot will remain playable at Namco Funscape, but if you're headed down in the near future look out for the neon red-lit cabinet with images of Leon, Claire and Ada Wong. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's intriguing to see the Resident Evil series featuring Raccoon City here once again, ahead of the franchise's 30th anniversary next year, and the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has teased that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">Requiem will see a return to the "overarching narrative" of Resident Evil begun 30 years ago</a>, and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/brief-look-at-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-reveals-first-person-footage">early trailer has already featured the reappearance of the RCPD</a> — albeit after its later destruction in Resident Evil 3.

The first is that the Brainrot Evolution code was input incorrectly. Check the spelling and that the case is correct, then redeem again. You can even copy and paste the codes directly from this article over to Roblox if you want to make sure you’re inputting them correctly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other possibility is that the code has expired or you’ve already used it. In this scenario, you should see an error message pop up below the code bar informing you that the code has already been redeemed or is invalid.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Get More Brainrot Evolution Codes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're on the hunt for more Brainrot Evolution codes, you'll want to search several spots. The most common place to find new codes is the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/eYeaS2R2JR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>. The team posts new codes alongside every update, and you'll be able to find them in the <strong>announcements channel</strong>. Unique codes also crop up on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@i2Perfect/videos" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">i2Perfect YouTube channel</a> and <a href="https://x.com/xFrozenStudios" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xFrozen Studios' X account</a>, so it's always worth checking both social media pages in case new codes have dropped there.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Brainrot Evolution in Roblox?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Brainrot Evolution is incredibly similar to xFrozen Studios' other popular Roblox evolution sim, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capybara-evolution-codes">Cabybara Evolution</a>. You start out as a lowly Brainrot minion and must fight your way to evolve, growing to inhabit more powerful forms, including Bombardiro Crocodilo, Tralalero Tralala, and Chimpanzini Bananini. All the while, you'll be able to buff your character with purchasable pets, unlock gear with loot chests and take on towering bosses to cement yourself as the ultimate life form at the top of the Brainrot hierarchy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides. When he's away from his desk, you can usually find him obsessing over the lore of the latest obscure indie horror game or bashing his head against a boss in the newest soulslike.
