As <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/most-expensive-magic-cards" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wargamer explains</u></a>, one of these Euroakus cards was sold for $25,200 in 2022, but the name was blurred out.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">8 - Phoenix Heart</h3></div><div catalogid="334d5d5d-79f3-4d77-a6ba-f374d07985a7" id="225819"><div id="225819" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Phoenix Heart</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8eLo?object_uuid=99b72451-82d2-4003-ac01-8f0633b6f648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Phoenix Heart</u></a> might not be legal (it doesn’t actually have an effect), but it’s very sweet. Richard Garfield, creator of Magic: The Gathering, has the card printed to celebrate his wedding to Koni Kim and send it out among the wedding invites.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s previously sold for $27,500, which is even better than an open bar at a wedding if you ask us.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">7 - Splendid Genesis</h3></div><div catalogid="334d5d5d-79f3-4d77-a6ba-f374d07985a7" id="225820"><div id="225820" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Splendid Genesis</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Richard Garfield commemorated the birth of his first child with this neat card. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qbb5jj?object_uuid=99b72451-82d2-4003-ac01-8f0633b6f648&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Splendid Genesis</u></a> reads, “Shuffle all cards in the game together and deal them into three decks. The game continues with a new player.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, it serves no gameplay purpose, but it’s a wholesome card that still fetched around $72,000 at auction in 2022. Only 110 were printed.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">6 - Timetwister</h3></div><div catalogid="334d5d5d-79f3-4d77-a6ba-f374d07985a7" id="225821"><div id="225821" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Timetwister</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember when we mentioned the ‘Power 9’ earlier?

Many of the cards on this list haven't been printed for years, and while there are still valuable cards to find in packs (we've got a rundown of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-most-expensive-cards">most valuable ones in Edge of Eternities</a>), you'd have to find a super dusty old pack to get some of the cards on this page.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That makes the secondary market the only option for collectors.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering's Power 9 Explained</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve referred to the ‘Power 9’ in this list a few times, so here’s every entry, and their effects.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Black Lotus</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Adds 3 mana of any single color of your choice to your mana pool, then is discarded. Tapping this artifact can be played as an interrupt.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Mox: Emerald, Jet, Pearl, Ruby, Sapphire</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Add 1 [color] mana to your mana pool. Tapping this artifact can be played as an interrupt.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Ancestral Recall</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Draw 3 cards or force opponent to draw 3 cards.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Timetwister</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Set Timetwister aside in a new graveyard pile. Shuffle your hand, library, and graveyard together into a new library and draw a new hand of seven cards, leaving all cards in play where they are; opponent must do the same.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Time Walk</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Take an extra turn after this one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Power 9 were found in the Alpha, Beta, and Unlimited sets of Magic: The Gathering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 16, 2025 12:00 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-most-expensive-and-rarest-magic-the-gathering-cards-of-all-time]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The Radeon RX 9070 XT graphics card scored a 10/10 in our review.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to upgrade your gaming PC and want to keep your budget to under $1,500, then one deal stands out above all the rest. Walmart is offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqw1wD?object_uuid=2fdebc24-4973-4a58-9bb6-d71f73326a58&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iBuypower Element Pro gaming PC</a> equipped with an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU for just $1499 with free delivery. This was the best "high-end" gaming PC deal during Prime Day - better than anything I found on Amazon - and it's still the best deal I've seen so far at this price point. The Radeon RX 9070 XT is an outstanding graphics card that can run the latest games (like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer">Battlefield 6</a>) in 4K.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">iBuypower Element Pro Radeon RX 9070 XT Gaming PC $1499</h2><div catalogid="bfc43746-9b7c-42f7-b829-b608cfd87865" id="224881"><div id="224881" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>iBuypower Element Pro AMD Ryzen 9 7900X Radeon RX 9070 XT Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The iBuypower gaming PC is generously equipped across the board. It features an AMD Ryzen 9 7900X CPU, Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and 2TB M.2 SSD. The Ryzen 9 7900X processor has a max boost clock of 5.6GHz with 12 cores and 24 threads. This is an excellent CPU for both gaming and multi-tasking and you won't need to upgrade from it for a long time. It's cooled by a very robust 360mm all-in-one liquid cooling system and run off an 850W power supply.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Radeon RX 9070 XT Received a 10/10 at IGN</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We rated the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT a "perfect" 10/10. Even though it costs $150 less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the 9070 XT beats it out in several of the games we tested. In a few benchmarks, the results aren't even close. The 9070 XT is also comparable in performance to the older $1,000 RX 7900 XTX but with better ray tracing and upscaling performance than its predecessor. It does lose out on VRAM (16GB vs 24GB), but that isn't really an issue for gaming. By "4K ready" I mean that this gaming PC can run pretty much any game at 4K resolution and at framerates of 60fps or higher. Any video card that's weaker and you'll have to compromise in order to get playable framerates. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Battlefield 6 Beta Runs This Weekend</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is out in October and there's one final open beta that runs August 14-17. It's shaping up to be a solid game that goes back to its true roots . Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-preview">initial impressions of the beta</a> and go ahead and <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-open-beta" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try the game</a>. Battlefield 6 has <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/system-requirements" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fairly lax requirements</a> for a new release title; EA recommends at last a GeForce RTX 3060 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT GPU to achieve 30fps at 1080p, although an RTX 4080 or more powerful GPU is recommended for gaming in 4K.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Check out more Alienware Back to School deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
