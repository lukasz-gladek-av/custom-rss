From the trailer, we've seen it will definitely include both Mega Evolution and Terastalization, and the reveal suggested it will canvas all different types and eras of Pok√©mon battles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Pok√©mon Champions will connect with Pok√©mon Home, allowing players to transfer Pok√©mon from all other games to battle in it and finally giving fans something to do with the hundreds of Pok√©mon just sitting in their boxes from past generations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pok√©mon Champions is "now in development" for both Nintendo Switch and mobile, but did not get a release date. It will be playable in Latin American Spanish at launch in addition to other languages previously available in Pok√©mon games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/27/pokmon-presents-2-27-2025-4-1740667969476.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Key art for Pokemon Champions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pok√©mon Champions appears to be the same as Pok√©mon Synapse, a game that first leaked last year as part of the larger "Freak Leak" that saw tons of internal Game Freak info drop online, including unreleased games, meeting notes, Pok√©mon designs, and more. At the time, the most firm details we had were that it was being co-developed by Game Freak and ILCA, while everything else seemed to be a work-in-progress and a bit speculative. Those who looked into the leak suggested it was a multiplayer game of some kind and some compared it to Splatoon, but that comparison seems to have been slightly off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything else we saw at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced">today's Pok√©mon Presents right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Luimiose City is undergoing a "high-tech urban redevelopment plan" that aims to turn the city into a place people and Pokemon can share together. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Pokemon Legends: Arceus, players will run around big open spaces and encounter Pokemon they can run into and try to catch or battle to weaken. However, battles will be a bit more advanced this time around. Moves now have shorter and longer reach and an area of effect, meaning position is very important. Mega Evolution will also be part of this game and can change the tide of battle at any time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There also seems to be a lot of verticality in Pokemon Legends: Z-A, as the player is seen zooming up to the top of a building, exploring rooftops, and even jumping from building to building.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon live in places called Wild Zones, which appear to be gated by level or something similar, and this is where the majority of your encounters seem to take place. There will also be a ton of new characters to meet and so much more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Multiplayer, Battle-Focused Pokemon Champions Revealed for Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-champions-game-freaks-leaked-multiplayer-game-officially-revealed">Pokemon Champions is a new multiplayer game being developed for Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android</a> that is focused on Pokemon battles with others around the world.

Whether you‚Äôre raiding, grinding XP, or hoarding Incense like a dragon hoards gold, you‚Äôre going to need a steady supply of these things. And while you could buy them directly through the game, that would be a rookie mistake because<a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5JrX?object_uuid=c90e0943-ece0-4605-8563-462c6fac2a9d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Best Buy has a way better deal</a> right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pok√©mon Go $50 Gift Card (7,000 Pok√©Coins)</h2><div catalogid="90f29803-f317-419b-a185-92ea2d66bf8e" id="215886"><div id="215886" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pok√©mon GO $50 Gift Card (7,000 Pok√©Coins)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For $42.50, you can get a $50 Pok√©mon Go gift card, which gives you 7,000 Pok√©Coins instead of the usual 6,700 $50 would get you in-app. That‚Äôs an extra 300 coins for free, and you‚Äôre saving $7.50 on top of that. More Pok√©Coins, less money spent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, if you‚Äôre sitting on 7,000 Pok√©Coins, you might be wondering what to spend them on. Should you hoard them for future boxes? Blow them all on Remote Raid Passes? Maybe finally invest in that Pok√©mon Storage upgrade so you don‚Äôt have to suffer through constant ‚ÄúYour Pok√©mon Box is full‚Äù notifications? Decisions, decisions.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What can you buy with 7,000 Pok√©Coins?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">To make things easy, here‚Äôs a breakdown of what 7,000 Pok√©Coins can get you in Pok√©mon GO right now:</p><p><strong>Pok√©mon Go Shop Boxes</strong>Box NamePrice (Pok√©Coins)What‚Äôs InsideSpecial Offer?</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Explorer Box</strong></td><td>5,250</td><td>20x Super Incubator, 30x Egg Incubator</td><td>39% off</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Voyager Box</strong></td><td>6,500</td><td>100x Lucky Eggs, 50x Star Pieces</td><td>50% off</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Starter Box</strong></td><td>100</td><td>10x Pinap Berry, 1x Lucky Egg, 30x Pok√© Ball</td><td>‚Äì</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Beginner Box</strong></td><td>150</td><td>15x Pok√© Ball, 5x Great Ball, 1x Lucky Egg, 1x Super Incubator</td><td>One-time only</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Pok√©mon GO Individual Items</strong>ItemPrice (Pok√©Coins)What It Does</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Remote Raid Pass (x3)</strong></td><td>525</td><td>Join Raid Battles remotely</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Premium Battle Pass (x3)</strong></td><td>250</td><td>Raid or get premium Go Battle League rewards</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Super Incubator</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Hatches eggs 33% faster</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Egg Incubator</strong></td><td>150</td><td>Hatches eggs (3 uses)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lure Module (x8)</strong></td><td>680</td><td>Attracts more Pok√©mon to a Pok√©Stop</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Incense (x8)</strong></td><td>250</td><td>Lures wild Pok√©mon to your location</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Item Bag Upgrade</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Increases storage by 50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pok√©mon Storage Upgrade</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Increases max Pok√©mon capacity by 50</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Pok√©mon GO Upgrades</strong>UpgradePrice (Pok√©Coins)What It Does</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Item Bag</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Increases max item storage by 50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pok√©mon Storage</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Increases max Pok√©mon capacity by 50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Postcard Pages</strong></td><td>100</td><td>Increases max saved Postcards by 50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Team Medallion</strong></td><td>1,000</td><td>Lets you change teams (once per year)</td></tr></tbody></table><p data-cy="paragraph">If I had 7,000 Pok√©Coins burning a hole in my trainer bag, I‚Äôd probably go straight for the Voyager Box at 6,500 coins. It‚Äôs a ridiculous deal with 100 Lucky Eggs and 50 Star Pieces at 50% off, meaning I‚Äôd be set on XP boosts and Stardust bonuses for months. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If raiding is more your thing, stacking up on Remote Raid Passes (525 coins for three) is a solid move if you want to farm Legendaries without leaving your couch. And for anyone who‚Äôs perpetually running out of space (guilty), throwing a couple of Pok√©mon Storage and Item Bag upgrades into the mix would make life way easier.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Claim three free Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Go</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you‚Äôre grabbing this Pok√©Coin deal, you might as well snag some free Pok√©mon while you‚Äôre at it.
