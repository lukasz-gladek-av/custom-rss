Games is restructuring its interactive entertainment endeavors to focus on four key franchises: Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, and Game of Thrones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details on the company-wide overhaul come from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a>, which says the changes involve a leadership shake-up but will not result in any layoffs or the exit of any executives. Instead, three key Warner Bros. Games names have been promoted as the gaming branch shifts its focus to its more reliable brands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Games Montreal studio head Yves Lachance now serves as senior vice president, development and will watch over games based on the Harry Potter and Game of Thrones franchises. Meanwhile, NetherRealm Studios’ Shaun Himmerick is taking on the senior vice president, development role to maintain the company’s Mortal Kombat and DC Universe efforts. Finally, Warner Bros. Games New York’s Steven Flenory has been promoted to senior vice president, central tech &amp; services and will manage game and publishing technology, customer service, quality assurance, and user research.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Our company is home to some of the biggest franchises in the world, and we are optimizing our team structure to develop long-term franchise roadmaps to delight players and fans of Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat and DC games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our company is home to some of the biggest franchises in the world, and we are optimizing our team structure to develop long-term franchise roadmaps to delight players and fans of Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat and DC games,” Global Streaming &amp; Games CEO J.B. Perrette said in a statement. “We are very fortunate to have a strong stable of development and technology talent, and Yves, Shaun and Steven are respected leaders with excellent track records in their areas of expertise. I’m looking forward to working closely with them and the team as we work to make the best games possible for our key franchises.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Time will tell how the Warner Bros. Games restructuring will affect the company after its worrying start to 2025. It began January 23 when it was revealed that boss David Haddad would be leaving the company following noteworthy failures that include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>the troubled launches of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business"><u>MultiVersus</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shutdown <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-to-shut-down-when-season-5-concludes-in-may"><u>plans for the latter followed</u></a> only one week later, with an even more substantial blow arriving in February as Warner Bros. Games announced plans to shutter Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. San Diego alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-cancels-wonder-woman-game-closes-three-studios"><u>the cancelation of its Wonder Woman game</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s restructuring does line up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>a strategy Warner Bros. outlined late last year</u></a>. At the time, it admitted its games business “is substantially underperforming its potential right now,” and would soon shift to lean on titles like Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, and Game of Thrones. DC was included in its refreshed plans as well, with Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav specifically mentioning Batman of particular importance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Changes at Warner Bros. Games fall in line with other smaller and larger shake-ups at the company. Just weeks ago, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it would <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>soon split into two media companies</u></a>: Global Networks and Streaming &amp; Studios.

It’s a message that comes with the promise that an update, as well as a new release date, will be delivered this fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear,” Bungie said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion. After much discussion within our Dev team, we’ve made the decision to delay the September 23 release.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Marathon delay follows criticism revolving around a Marathon alpha test held in April. The conversation around Bungie’s new take on the live-service, extraction shooter formula has been heated to say the least, so a delay isn’t too shocking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling — survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s genre-defining FPS combat,” Bungie’s message adds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like Marathon is built around. This means deepening the relationship between the developers and the game’s most important voices: our players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hermen Hulst went as far as to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026">address feedback</a> just last week, calling the response from fans “varied.” His comments also included the promise that the Marathon reboot would get a release date set by March 31, 2026, while assuring naysayers that the company had no intention of repeating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-wave-goodbye-to-playstation-flop-concord-as-it-goes-dark-maybe-forever"><u>the mistakes</u></a> seen with last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Concord</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While no new Marathon release date has been revealed, it appears as though players can at least expect to get their hands on Bungie’s latest by March 2026. In the meantime, the studio has laid out three major points of feedback it plans to address that should leave a better taste in players’ mouths. These include “upping the survival game,” which means more challenging and engaging AI encounters, more tense and strategic combat, and a more rewarding experience overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie adds that players can expect increased visual fidelity across the Marathon experience along with more story to uncover and a darker tone that falls more in-line with the original Marathon universe. The delay also grants the studio the opportunity to add “more social experiences,” including improvements for solo and duo runs as well as proximity chat.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’ll hear from us again later this Fall when we can share the progress we’ve made, alongside the game’s new release date,” Bungie concluded. “Thank you again for your patience and — much more importantly — your passion. Your continued feedback will help us make Marathon the incredible gaming experience we all know it can be.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-reveals-new-marathon-game-at-playstation-showcase"><u>announced its Marathon reboot in May 2023</u></a> and remained quiet as its development progressed throughout 2024. Trouble arose with the launch of its alpha test along with controversy centered on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-developer-bungie-launches-thorough-review-after-once-again-being-found-to-have-used-work-from-an-uncredited-artist"><u>plagiarized work that had been discovered in Marathon itself</u></a>. As uncertainty has taken over the conversation, many have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-discuss-marathon-developer-bungies-future-after-yet-another-plagiarism-row-rocks-studio-make-no-mistake-this-is-an-existential-struggle-for-bungie-at-this-point"><u>begun to discuss how the impending game launch could impact the future of the studio forever</u></a>.
