And now, 10 days from its 1.0 release, the developer has revealed preorder and beta rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Escape from Tarkov is a hardcore MMO mixture of first-person shooter / third-person shooter and role-playing gameplay. Players need to find a way out of the isolated Russian city of Tarkov, survive deadly hazards, and unearth the mysteries of the city. It's been playable in early access form since making its debut in 2016, and it's finally coming to Steam as part of the 1.0 launch on November 15. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For anyone thinking of preordering the shooter ahead of its November 15 release — or those who've already preordered it — players can get following awards:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Clothing set: USEC Legionnaire Olive </li><li>Clothing set: Bear Sumrak Reverse</li><li>PMC Dogtag: Immortal</li><li>Prayer Armband: Head, Eyes</li><li>Hideout Style: Echo of Battle</li><li>Shooting Target: Hatchling</li><li>Mannequin: poses</li></ul><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/screenshot-2025-11-05-at-12-26-20-1762345917038.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Escape from Tarkov preorder and beta rewards.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian has said it’s well aware that whenever it announces a new game, people ask where Fallout: New Vegas 2 is, but it loves how it’s been able to create new IP and even release sequels to them — and its owner Microsoft sounds like it supports that approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Season 2 is set to hit Prime Video this December, and while Bethesda has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle-announced-on-fallout-day-here-are-the-contents">a new Fallout: New Vegas bundle</a> up its sleeve, there’s no word yet on a Fallout remaster or a Fallout: New Vegas 2 to capitalize on the surge of interest in the franchise. Obsidian is of course the developer of the much-loved 2010 RPG Fallout: New Vegas, so fans often wonder whether it will return to the setting for a sequel, especially given it’s owned by Bethesda parent company Microsoft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian, though, has focused on making brand new games, and it is prolific in doing so. It’s released Grounded (Grounded 2 came out this year), fantasy RPG Avowed (which came out this year), and sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds (The Outer Worlds 2 came out this year). Pentiment, which came out last year, was another brand new game, although I wouldn’t expect a sequel to that any time soon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/of-course-working-at-obsidian-is" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a>, Obsidian’s VP of operations Marcus Morgan and VP of production Justin Britch touched on the fan calls for a New Vegas follow-up, but pointed to its work establishing new franchises as a “joy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know everyone on the internet, on every game we ever announce, will constantly reference back to, ‘When’s the next New Vegas? Or when’s the next whatever?” Morgan said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But this year, in addition to it being a celebration of shipping three games, all three of those games are IP that we’ve created, that are Obsidian IP. Our history, prior to the Microsoft acquisition, really was surrounding around working on others’ IP. And this is the joy that we get of… how do we start to define our own and how do we build our own IP? And we’ve got to the part where we have sequels to all of them. All of them are sequels to the IP we created.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it sounds like Microsoft has supported Obsidian’s desire to do just that, even though you’d think the mega corp might have gone hard on Fallout, especially with the hugely popular Fallout TV show breaking through into the mainstream.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Xbox has been pretty supportive of the stuff we want to do,” Britch insisted. “It’s been great.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no mention made during the recent Fallout Day broadcast of a Fallout: New Vegas remaster, which some (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remaster-new-vegas-boss-danny-trejo-calls-on-bethesda-to-give-fallout-fans-what-they-really-want"><u>including Danny Trejo!</u></a>) have called on Bethesda to develop. Indeed, there were no new Fallout games announced at all. Find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-day-2025-everything-announced-live"><u>everything announced during the Fallout Day broadcast here</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda wants to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>Bethesda Softworks head Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</u></a>. Howard opened up about the future of the hit post-apocalyptic RPG series during <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?si=Ua6SywsuPtdIr0yv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with YouTube content creator MrMattyPlays</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76… we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Happy Bday Fallout: New Vegas</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG over time (and after a rocky launch), it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Howard wouldn't budge when it came to desires for a substantial video game release. For him, it comes down to wanting to treat Bethesda's franchises with care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game," he said. "And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, The Outer Worlds 2 has strong New Vegas vibes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/valor-mortis">Valor Mortis</a>, the first-person soulslike action game set in an alt-history Napoleonic era, is out next year. And with developer One More Level especially pushing the “Soulslike”-ness of the whole thing, it seems only natural that at some point before or after launch there’s going to be a discussion about the game’s difficulty - is it too hard? Is it hard enough? Should it have an easy mode, or something else?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The difficulty discussion, of course, is one that crops up every time a new Souls game is released. What makes difficulty fun, and what makes it obnoxious? Should games have easy modes? What sorts of accessibility features are helpful to ensure everyone can play the game and experience its design friction as intended, without experiencing other, undesirable friction due to controls or other functions?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I played Valor Mortis at the Game Industry Conference in Poznań, Wielkopolska, and while I’m only of middling Soulslike skills, I can confirm it’s pretty tough! I also spoke with game director Radosław Ratusznik, who says that the team is still in discussions as to how they will approach all this. For now, he says, Valor Mortis just has one difficulty setting. But that may change in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If we decide at one point to change it, I think we will change it for easy mode and normal mode, just two of them. Because I think that players should have similar experiences when they're playing these kinds of games. So personally, I'm fine with the easy mode, if someone wants to just experience the story, learn a little bit about how the game works. But if we have a lot of options, like there are like tens of difficulty options, then each person can play a totally different game. I think what connects Soulslike players is that they are all struggling in these games. If they manage to succeed in this game, they can share this experience with other players. And this is something that has a huge value I think for them, for this community.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s nuance here, because while Ratusznik may be against having ten difficulty options ranging from Story Mode to Ultra Hard Giga Death Difficulty, he agrees that discussions around difficulty often don’t take into account the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/05/sekiro-accessibility-in-games-is-about-far-more-than-difficulty"><u>nuance of accessibility</u></a>. He’s not a fan, for instance, of games that let you turn on and off certain mechanics (such as parries), because he thinks that players “lose something from this experience.” But he also adds that, as far as accessibility goes, “we can have a lot of things that can assist you without lowering the difficulty of the game.” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-difficulty-accessibility-easy-mode-debate"><u>Accessibility isn’t solved with an easy mode</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Soulslikes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ratusznik isn’t alone in this belief. FromSoftware’s Hidetaka Miyazaki has <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/hidetaka-miyazaki-sees-death-as-a-feature-not-a-bug" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said similar of Elden Ring</u></a>, “We are always looking to improve, but, in our games specifically, hardship is what gives meaning to the experience. So it’s not something we’re willing to abandon at the moment. It’s our identity.” But also notably, Elden Ring was far more flexible than FromSoftware’s past games in the ways in which it allowed players to eventually conquer challenges. You could outlevel bosses to make them trivially easy if you wandered off and defeated enough weaker enemies, there are some builds that turn certain bosses into jokes, and there’s so much to do in the game and so many paths to victory that if you’re struggling with something, Elden Ring encourages you to leave and do something else. Another recent Soulslike, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is similar in this structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How Valor Mortis will ultimately handle its difficulty remains to be seen, as Ratusznik himself says that the team is still working out what they want to do. We won’t know til next year when the game launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also spoke to Ratusznik at GIC about Valor Mortis’ soulslike credentials, and why it’s challenging to make a game in that tradition in the first-person. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valor-mortis-dev-dares-fans-to-question-the-games-soulslike-credentials-if-you-are-not-sure-about-it-challenge-us">You can read our conversation right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Fan response to the new season and its highly-detailed map has been positive, and Epic Games seems pleased with player numbers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In 48 hours, we welcomed the biggest number of new and returning <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> players since last holiday season," the developer wrote in a social media <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1985776844571107624" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. "The first Fortnite | The Simpsons short popped to #1 on Disney+ today in the US. Move over Shelbyville..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite's player numbers have dipped somewhat this year, amid tough competition from Roblox and a string of battle royale seasons that feel like they haven't landed with fans quite as expected. In September, during the game's alien bug season, the game's average daily numbers briefly sagged to around half a million players, though player counts then rallied as Fortnite began its annual Halloween celebrations.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">We Build the LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While 2.6 million players this past weekend is impressive, Fortnite has recorded several higher player spikes this year for other events. A peak of 5.7 million players logged in on June 7 for Death Star Sabotage, the game's live event that served as the finale of its Star Wars mini-season. Fortnite also saw a spike to 3.9 million players on August 2 for its superhero season finale, and 3.3 million players for the launch of its Daft Punk Experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What remains to be seen is how many of those new and returning players stick around over the rest of this month, as Fortnite's The Simpsons season culminates in a big live event on November 29. This is expected to usher in the game's next big era — Chapter Seven — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-seven-teases-kill-bill-crossover-points-to-usa-setting">that looks set to feature a crossover with Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill and, potentially, the return of Fortnite's heroic Seven faction</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
