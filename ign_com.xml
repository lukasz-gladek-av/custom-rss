            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But it's still the best-selling game in the U.S. year-to-date.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds got off to an incredible sales start when it launched in February. Unfortunately, it seems as though its success has fallen off one heck of a cliff since then - and Capcom appears to be trying to amend that by releasing an endgame content expansion much sooner than expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sales data comes from Capcom's quarterly earnings report, which includes <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/1st/explanation_2025_1st_01.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a slide presentation showing sales data</a> for the company's top ten best-selling games from April 1 to June 30. The presentation shows that Monster Hunter Wilds sold 477k copies during that period, only just above the 389k copies sold of four-year-old game Monster Hunter Rise. Wilds was the 9th best-selling game of the quarter for Capcom, while Rise was the 10th.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, even though Rise is four years old, those aren't exactly gangbusters sales figures either. In Capcom's consolidated financial results, the company says, "Regarding catalog titles, although sales were soft for Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest title in the series released in February this year, Monster Hunter Rise, a previous title in the same series, continued to see sales growth." This is technically true, in that Rise continues to sell copies, but calling it "growth" is a bit strong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last quarter, Monster Hunter Rise only sold 384k copies. In fact, sales of the game slowed down significantly throughout last year after the game sold 725k in Q1, 640k in Q2, and 691k in Q3. That's not really shocking, especially once Wilds was announced - people were bound to hold off on buying Rise if there was a brand new game just around the corner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's more interesting here is how much better Rise was selling throughout most of last year, several years after its release, than Wilds is selling now. Just a few months out from its launch, Wilds saw a steep, steep sales dropoff. After releasing during the first quarter to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-breezes-past-10-million-sold-capcom-explains-why-its-done-so-incredibly-well">Capcom record-setting 10.108 million copies sold</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-surpasses-8-million-units-sold-in-3-days-and-is-the-fastest-capcom-game-to-do-so">8 million of which were in just three days</a>, Wilds shot up to become the best-selling game in the U.S. year-to-date according to Circana. And while it's still No.1 as of July 5 due to that initial spike, for the month of June, it didn't even crack the top 20 best-selling games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why is Wilds having such a bad time of things? Well, despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review">reviewing well initially</a>, its endgame content is sorely lacking compared to past games, so the many fans who play Monster Hunter over time, with friends, are struggling. It's also suffering from severe performance issues on PC specifically that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-takes-aim-at-performance-woes-but-opinions-vary-on-whether-it-worked">have yet to be fully resolved</a>. Despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-is-heating-up-for-summer-with-its-next-season-event-heres-whats-new">new content and seasons</a>, fans remain unsatisfied with the state of the game, to the point where some players are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-backlash-highlights-how-death-threats-against-devs-are-becoming-a-major-issue-in-japan">taking things too far</a> and apparently harassing and threatening individual Capcom team members over it.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>An update on release date and content of update Ver.1.021</p><p>The expansion of endgame content which was originally planned as part of Title Update 3 in late September will now be released ahead of schedule as part of the Ver.1.021 update. To accommodate this change, this update… <a href="https://t.co/aQF1oFMCFR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aQF1oFMCFR</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Which all perhaps explains why Capcom has <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bumped up a planned expansion of endgame content</a> from the end of September to August 13. The planned expansion will include a new level of quest difficulty, a new rewards system, weapon balance adjustments, and other improvements. It's unclear as of yet if this will solve the performance issues, but perhaps it will sate those frustrated at Wilds' weaker endgame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll have to wait for more details to see if this is the start of a turnaround or if Wilds will go down as one of the more disappointing Monster Hunter titles long-term. In the meantime, perhaps a Rise Renaissance is on the horizon if fans gravitate back to older games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Prices for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Scarlet and Violet 151 Pokémon cards</a> have been moving fast this month. As more booster boxes get opened and singles flood the market, some of the set’s Illustration Rares have started to dip in value, especially the middle evolutions of the starter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon</a>. On the flip side, big Special Illustration Rares of fan favourite Kanto starter final evolutions are seeing steady climbs as collectors chase the best‑looking cards from the set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex, Blastoise ex and Venusaur ex are the top of the climbers hill this week with noticeable price jumps, while Zapdos ex and Alakazam ex are also gaining traction with collectors and competitive players. All five of these cards have strong artwork, great playability, or both, which is helping push prices higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same can’t be said for some of the Illustration Rares of Charmander, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and their evolutions. These cards spiked when the set first dropped, but with more supply on the market, prices have started to settle. They’re still popular pulls, just not commanding the same premium they did in June.</p><p id="crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers">Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/29/pixel-9-94-1753801366630.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Kanto starters’ final evolutions are climbing, their earlier forms have started to dip in value as more Scarlet &amp; Violet 151 product hits the market. Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur were among the hottest Illustration Rares when the set launched, but prices are cooling as supply catches up with demand. Charmander is down 14% to $44.44, Squirtle has dropped 7% to $43.80, and Bulbasaur has fallen 18% to $32.20. These cards are still popular with collectors who want to complete the evolutionary lines, but they no longer command the inflated early prices from the set’s release month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The middle evolutions are following the same trend. Charmeleon has dropped 14% to $30.54, while Wartortle is down 15% to $27.36. Both Illustration Rares have fantastic artwork and remain fun pulls, but they simply don’t hold the same appeal as the Special Illustration Rare ex cards of their final evolutions. As Scarlet &amp; Violet 151 booster boxes continue to be opened, the market has become saturated with these mid‑tier rares, bringing prices back down to more reasonable levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with these price drops, the Illustration Rares of the Kanto starters and their evolutions are still great pickups for collectors who want the full line. Prices are likely to stabilise at these lower points, making now a good time to grab them if you missed out early. The final evolutions will continue to be the big-ticket items, but these cards remain iconic pieces of the set for anyone who grew up with the original Pokémon games.</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/29/pixel-9-93-1753801271476.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex has risen to $210.00, up 14% from early July. It remains one of the most in-demand cards in the set thanks to its powerful Explosive Vortex attack, which hits for 330 damage, and the fantastic Special Illustration Rare artwork that collectors continue to chase. Blastoise ex has seen an even sharper jump, climbing 28% to $84.99, driven by both its intimidating art and competitive appeal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solid Shell makes Blastoise surprisingly tanky, and Twin Cannons can unload massive damage by discarding Water Energy from your hand.Venusaur ex is seeing a similar surge, up 27% to $69.99. While Charizard usually grabs the spotlight, Venusaur’s Illustration Rare version has become a favourite for collectors who love its vibrant, personality-filled design. Its ability Tranquil Flower lets you heal 60 damage every turn while in the Active Spot, and Dangerous Toxwhip spreads status conditions alongside 150 damage, making it a tricky card to deal with in grindy matchups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Legendary Pokémon aren’t being left out either. Zapdos ex has climbed 23% to $61.99, buoyed by a dynamic Illustration Rare that shows the Legendary Bird mid-strike. It isn’t just binder candy, though. Voltaic Float removes its retreat cost when it has Lightning Energy attached, and Multishot Lightning can deal big damage to both the Active and a damaged Benched Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the climbers is Alakazam ex, which has risen the fastest of the bunch, up 35% to $44.98. The surreal, psychedelic artwork on its Special Illustration Rare has kept collector interest high, but it’s also a flexible attacker. Mind Jack punishes opponents with full benches, while Dimensional Hand can be used even if Alakazam stays on the Bench, giving it options that most other attackers don’t have.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10 Most Expensive Cards In Black Bolt and White Flare</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-most-popular-cards">Black Bolt</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-white-flare-10-most-popular-cards">White Flare</a> are the final Scarlet and Violet expansions, released together earlier this month. Each half of the set has its own focus, with Black Bolt featuring Pokémon like Zekrom, Kyurem, and Genesect, while White Flare highlights Reshiram, Keldeo, and Hydreigon. What makes these sets unique is the new Black White Rares and the fact that every single Pokémon has at least one Illustration Rare or Special Illustration Rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/most-expensive-black-bolt-white-flare-pokemon-cards-right-now">most expensive cards</a> are the Black White Rare versions of Zekrom ex, Reshiram ex, and Victini, all highly desirable for both their powerful attacks and prestige foil treatments. Special Illustration Rares like Hydreigon ex, Keldeo ex, Genesect ex, and Kyurem ex are my favorites, plus they're cheaper than their Black White Rare versions.</p><p id="latest-stock-updates"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Latest Stock Updates">Pokémon TCG Price Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't believe I was singing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-july-22">Amazon's praises last week</a> for some <em>near </em>MSRP deals on sealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Pokémon TCG</a> product, as this week they're back up to ridiculous pricing. You should stay away until they lower their prices and stick to TCGPlayer and eBay right now, which in some cases are a clean $15 below Amazon's current pricing. The benefit of buying from TCGPlayer is the vetted sellers and full transparancy on market values, but if you can save even more on eBay then go for it. All links are above to make your life easier.</p><p id="last-weeks-update"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Last Week's Update">Last Week's Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet base set prices have been volatile lately, with Illustration Rares seeing steady gains while some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-july-14">Special Illustration Rares have cooled off</a>. The Ralts evolutionary line has been one of the biggest surprises this month, with Ralts and Kirlia both climbing around 28% in value. Their popularity seems to be driven more by collectors chasing the full evolution line rather than playability alone. Gardevoir ex has also risen significantly, up to $54.99, thanks to its strong Psychic Embrace ability and frequent appearances in competitive decklists. Miraidon ex and Koraidon ex have seen smaller but consistent gains, reflecting their continued use in Lightning and Fighting decks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, several Illustration Rares have dropped sharply. Dondozo and Starly saw the biggest falls, down 30% and 37% respectively, likely due to their limited competitive relevance. Fidough, Armarouge, and Pachirisu also dipped, correcting from their initial launch hype. Overall, Scarlet and Violet’s market is shifting as collectors focus on full evolution lines and competitively viable cards, while once‑popular lower‑tier Illustration Rares settle into lower price ranges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
