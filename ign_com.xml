Don't worry, though, as Solos, Squads, and Zero Build will be available at launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The loot pool will include much of what was found at the beginning of Fortnite, including Assault Rifle, Burst Assault Rifle, Scoped Assault Rifle, Pump Shotgun, Tactical Shotgun, Pistol, Revolver, Submachine Gun, Tactical Machine Gun, Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle, Semi-Auto Sniper Rifle, Grenade Launcher, Rocket Launcher, Damage Trap, Ceiling Zapper, Wall Dynamo</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Fortnite OG is taking players back in time, there will be some Quality of Life changes put in place to make for a better overall experience, and you can check them all out below from The Fortnite Team;</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Building mechanics will be uniform with Battle Royale as it is today.</li><li>As far as traversal goes, players will be able to sprint, slide, mantle, door bash, and move while healing. </li><li>Some of the rough edges from that era have been preserved, while others have been polished. For example, players will find Reboot Vans and be able to see the glare from a sniper scope, but Max building resources are set to 999 and Double Pump is enabled for Shotguns (for now). </li><li>Of course, the original map that Fortnite Battle Royale launched with in 2017 is back! Great care has been taken to ensure that every tree, Chest, car, and object is right where players remember it. In Zero Build, there will be Ziplines and Ascenders to help players get to hard-to-reach locations.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Players will also be able to purchase the Fortnite OG Pass and work their way to earning 45 tiers of "retro rewards with a modern twist on classic items and Outfits." Speaking of Outfits, Renegade Rebel, Aerial Assault Bomber, and Skull Commander are the ones players will work towards in Season 1, and each will have an unlockable alt style as well. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fortnite OG Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's important to note that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-just-raised-its-battle-pass-price-for-the-first-time-ever">Epic Games did just raise its Battle Pass price for the first time ever</a> ahead of Fortnite OG, so we wanted to make sure everyone was aware of that ahead of this upcoming launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite OG first launched back in November 2023 and the reception was overwhelmingly positive.

This time it's Remnant II, as the Fae goddess Nimue takes center stage in the form of a gorgeous new sculpted bust. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head down to the slideshow gallery below for an exclusive first look at the Remnant II: Nimue Bust:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Remnant II: Nimue Bust Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Remnant II: Nimue Bust measures 9 inches tall, with a base diameter of 4.5 inches. The bust features a light-up LED heart and base, along with glow-in-the-dark paint, all of which are designed to reflect Nimue's connection to the Dreamer and the energy at the heart of the multiverse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bust was crafted Bigshot Toyworks, with prototyping and paint by J.W.

In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remnant-2-review">IGN's Remnant II review</a>, Travis Northup wrote, "It’s astounding to think that if I were to create a list of my favorite soulslikes, my favorite looter shooters, and my favorite procedurally generated games, Remnant 2 would appear on all of those lists. This is a triumphant sequel that doesn’t just reimagine the soulslike genre as a co-op looter-shooter, but absolutely nails that concept in nearly every way – including many that the original did not. With completely engrossing combat, challenging and memorable boss fights, ultra-dense buildcrafting options, incredibly cool procedurally generated levels, and a clever multiversal concept that allows for a ton of different adventures in one package, it’s very likely going to become one of my most-played games this year. No matter which part of the multiverse you find yourself in, you should do yourself a favor and play this gem."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.
