            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-fury-series-returns-with-first-new-entry-in-26-years<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Terry Bogard and crew are back in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fatal Fury series from SNK began back in 1991 as part of the fighting game boom that dominated arcades across the world, and its popularity led to the series releasing several games throughout the ’90s. In the years since, those classic games have been ported to consoles, but there hasn’t been a new entry in the series since 1999.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until now, that is. The series is returning with Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves in 2025, ending a drought of 26 years without a new title. It will feature the return of characters from past games, most notably series star Terry Bogard and his protege Rock Howard. Other fan favorites, like Mai Shiranui and Billy Kane, will also be included and get updated designs.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/mai-shiranui-1734114693442.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">City of the Wolves will act as a continuation of the previous game in the series, Garou: Mark of the Wolves. The T.O.P. system, now called the S.P.G. system, makes a return. It allows you to pick a section of your health bar (either the start, middle, or end), and when your health is in that range, your S.P.G. will activate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When your S.P.G. is active, you’ll regenerate health, have boosted attack power, your power gauge will fill faster, your REV Meter will fill slower, and you can perform REV Blows. Those last two points are part of an important new mechanic in City of the Wolves called the REV System. REV Blows blend together offense and defense, allowing you to strike hard while also shrugging off enemy attacks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can combo into these after REV Arts, which can be used after a special move to perform a stronger version of said move. And REV Guard is a unique type of block that creates more space between you and your opponent than a regular block and also eliminates chip damage from special attacks.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/rev-arts-1734115338277.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these actions build up the REV Meter in the bottom left corner of the screen, and once the meter is full, you’ll become overheated. While in this state, you won’t be able to use REV actions anymore and your guard gauge will decrease whenever you block attacks. If the gauge runs out, your guard will be crushed and you’ll take longer to recover from being hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your REV Meter slowly reduces as time passes, as well as when you walk or dash toward your enemy, land an attack, or successfully use Just Defense or Hyper Defense. The former happens when you block an attack at exactly the right moment, while the latter happens when you do a forward input at exactly the right moment of a multi-hit attack.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/just-defense-1734114814867.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This REV System adds a strategic layer to each fight, since you can’t simply use powerful REV actions over and over. You need to keep an eye on your REV Meter and balance aggressive offense with well-timed defense to avoid overheating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first time in the series, you’ll also be able to choose between two different control schemes that will determine the button inputs needed to execute each of these moves. Known as Arcade Style and Smart Style, they’re designed to provide options for players experienced with the series as well as newcomers diving in for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re excited to dive into Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, it’s available to pre-order and wishlist now ahead of its release date of April 24, 2025 on PC, PS4/5, and Xbox Series X/S. Pre-order bonuses include Terry’s classic costume from Fatal Fury 2 and early access to the game on April 21, three days before release.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/rev-meter-1734115446297.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The base price of $59.99 also includes Season Pass 1 and five DLC characters. We already know who two of those characters will be: Ken and Chun-Li from Street Fighter, the first non-SNK collab characters ever featured in a Fatal Fury game. This marks the continuation of a collaboration between the two franchises after Terry and Mai were featured in Street Fighter 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d like to pre-order, you can visit <a href="https://www.snk-corp.co.jp/us/games/fatalfury-cotw/index.html#product_unchor" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official website</a> to pick the platform you’d like to play on.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-is-leading-mufasa-the-lion-king-in-the-box-office-race-after-one-lap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3">Sonic The Hedgehog 3</a> is off to a fast start at the domestic box office, pulling in $62 million during its opening weekend. That’s significantly more than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/mufasa-the-lion-king">Mufasa: The Lion King</a> managed — Disney’s live action prologue made $35 million during the same time period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an early victory for Sonic, then, but there's a slightly different story globally. Mufasa: The Lion King opened to $87.2 million internationally, which, combined with its domestic haul, is enough to make it the number one global release of the weekend with $122.2 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Sonic The Hedgehog 3 is yet to launch in all international markets, so a proper global comparison won’t be possible until next weekend’s numbers are in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Paramount be pleased with Sonic 3's performance so far? Sonic the Hedgehog 3 opened above the original 2020 Sonic the Hedgehog’s $58 million and just below 2022’s Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ($72 million). Both films will hope for stickiness over the holiday period and into the New Year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like a positive picture for Sonic, but a disappointing one for Mufasa. <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/box-office-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-starts-strong-mufasa-lion-king-misfires-opening-weekend-1236257432/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> called it a “terrible” start domestically, given Mufasa cost more than $200 million to produce and roughly $100 million to promote. Sonic the Hedgehog 3, on the other hand, cost $122 million and still has its international release to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s no surprise, then, that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-is-officially-in-the-works-at-paramount-for-spring-2027-release">Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is already confirmed</a>. For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-post-credits-scene-ending-explained">Sonic 3 Ending Explained</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-film-writers-reveal-the-big-the-cat-cameo-that-almost-was">Big the Cat Cameo That Almost Was</a>, and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-review-jim-carrey-ben-schwartz-james-marsden-idris-elba">Sonic The Hedgehog 3 review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Mufasa: The Lion King, Disney will be hoping positive word of mouth helps it rebound over the holidays. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mufasa-the-lion-king-review-beyonce-donald-glover-barry-jenkins">Mufasa: The Lion King review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Barry Jenkins’ Mufasa is a strong, uncomplicated effort that should charm kids. The Moonlight director's involvement in a CGI-heavy Disney prequel caused serious film lovers to wring their hands, but the results speak for themselves: This is simply a lovely movie.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Amid the delight of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-is-officially-in-the-works-at-paramount-for-spring-2027-release">learning there would be a fourth Sonic the Hedgehog film</a> and finding out that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-will-tease-another-new-character-to-set-up-potential-fourth-film">film's ending teases yet another new Sonic character for that film</a>, there's still one major question on everyone's minds: where is Big the Cat?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, sure, it's maybe not the most pressing question ever, but we did have a chance to sit down with Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy writers Pat Casey and Josh Miller to ask where everyone's favorite fisherman kitty has been all this time. And it turns out, they actually did write a cameo for Big the Cat into the second Sonic the Hedgehog film... only for it to be a bit too grim to make it to the final cut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In one draft of Sonic 2, we actually, when they're going through the snowy mountains to the cave, we had a bit, because Sonic 2 was sort of an Indiana Jones," Casey told us. "Indiana Jones, it's a trope that at some point a skeleton pops out at you and scares you. So we were going to do that, but with a skeleton of a, I would say,<em> a</em> Big the Cat, not necessarily-"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miller cuts in here, "Not necessarily <em>the</em> Big the Cat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>"</strong>But we ended up cutting it," Casey concludes. "It didn't make any sense."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, we almost had a... dead Big the Cat in Sonic 2. The two writers said that "Big the Cat" is usually their joke answer when fans ask them who they want to add to the films, though they also informed me they've been unsuccessfully trying to get Rouge the Bat in as well for three fims straight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep your eyes here at IGN for our full interview with Casey and Miller coming later this week, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/sonic-the-hedgehog-3">all the latest on the Sonic the Hedgehog movies</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

But while Titus appears in the animation as he looks in Space Marine 2, the episode also features a weapon players have yet to see in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds innocuous, but the action scene in which this mystery Power Axe is used steals the show. We see it wielded with brutal efficiency to tear apart cultists and Tzaangors. There’s even a super cool moment in which a Space Marine bashes the helm of the axe in order to shift it into the upright position in his glove.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>THIS is why I’m a fan of Warhammer 40k!

Space Marine 2 has a thriving modding scene that makes a significant number of improvements and changes to the record-breaking third-person melee / shooter hybrid. IGN has reported on Space Marine 2’s modding scene a number of times, shining a light on everything from more in-depth customization to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-mod-solves-one-of-the-games-biggest-problems"><u>a fix for one of the game’s biggest problems</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-5-makes-big-balance-changes-completely-reworks-blocking-weapons">Space Marine 2 is now up to Patch 5</a>, although Focus has already talked about what to expect from Patch 6 and 7, both due out in 2025. The Year 1 roadmap for Space Marine 2 includes new content up to Season 4, which is set to kick off at some point in 2025 (we're currently in Season 2).
