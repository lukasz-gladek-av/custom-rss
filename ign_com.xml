            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-has-a-mostly-negative-steam-user-review-rating-with-players-labeling-it-a-shameless-blatant-cash-grab<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 video games have been on a great run lately, with the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> leading the charge of well-received, successful titles. The recently released Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition, however, may be Warhammer 40,000’s first video game misstep in some time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition is a re-release of Relic Entertainment’s 2011 action game, Space Marine. Both Games Workshop and publisher Sega are not calling this a remaster. Instead they point to quality-of-life and graphical improvements "that take the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine experience to the next level."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These include higher fidelity and improved textures, 4k resolution, "improved" character models, a modernized control scheme and interface overhaul, and remastered audio.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition launched on June 10 across Xbox Series X and S and PC, and straight into Game Pass (there’s no word on a PS5 version). It’s going down better on Game Pass, where gaming is often more disposable and subscribers are free to try games out and discard them on a whim if they don’t like what they see. On Steam, however, where Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition costs $39.99 / £34.99, it’s getting destroyed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition currently has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Valve’s platform. Complaints revolve around the high price of the game relative to the changes it makes over the Anniversary Edition, and, on those changes, bemusement in response to what many believe is worse usability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, coupled with struggles to find others to play with online, has caused some to call Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition a "cash grab."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was very excited for the idea of this being updated but honestly? I prefer the older version,” reads one negative Steam user review. “It feels better and looks better. Why couldn't this just be an update or something? And for the price tag it just feels very meh. And this is one of my all time favourite games too. Just gonna install the older version and play through that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Too bad, I really wanted to play this game,” reads another. “No players in PvP multiplayer. No players in co-op Exterminatus horde mode. FOV problem, aiming down sight makes 1000000x zoom. No option to change FOV. Maybe get it on sale after upgrades and updates and working enabled crossplay matchmaking. Refunded, sadly.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I bought and get refund” said one disgruntled customer. “Buy the Anniversary Edition, it's almost the same but it isn't a cash grab (around 7€ for a key).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Look how they massacred my boy,” declared another.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar sentiment across social media, Discords, and subreddits. “Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition is a mess,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1laagiu/warhammer_40000_space_marine_master_crafted/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor KitsuneLynx</a>, highlighting problems even on Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This game came out a few days ago and has shown itself to be an absolute mess and disappointment. When I heard this remake was coming out, I was so hyped, I was curious what they'd do and was excited to play it on Xbox after having played it on PC a while back. I was disappointed to say the least.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This game is a buggy, janky mess that didn't bother to fix anything and instead made a worse UI, odd visual changes, etc. Why make the Orks all Goffs now? The colors helped recognize each unit, now they all blend together to the point it's hard to decipher which is which. WHERE ARE THE DEDICATED SERVERS? Not to mention the NEW jank and bugs that came with this release that weren't present in the previous remaster. It didn't bother to fix the jank or make the game feel revitalized, this IS the definition of a lazy cash grab. Charging this game for 40+ USD is criminal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Crossplay is off by default which just leads to the game shooting itself in the foot when it comes to vacant servers. My wife also just experienced a bug which is more common than it should be where when you boot up the game, there is a chance for your save file to corrupt and reset ALL OF YOUR PROGRESS. Why hasn't this game received a patch yet? I can't imagine all the other bugs I haven't seen yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you're planning on playing this game, either get it on Game Pass or wait for a sale and mega patch, otherwise stay on Space Marine 2 or play the remaster on PC.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that there <em>are </em>players who are having a reasonable time with the game, although anecdotally most of them appear to be on Game Pass. Similarly, those who have never played Space Marine before seem to be enjoying experiencing the events that lead into last year’s blockbuster hit, Space Marine 2. Steam, then, appears to be the focal point of the backlash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hope is that Sega will announce incoming improvements sooner rather than later, as Space Marine is generally remembered fondly by those who played it back in the day. In 2025, with Warhammer 40,000 at the peak of its popularity and with a flood of newcomers sparked by the success of Space Marine 2, it’s important Space Marine gets it right. The Inquisition, after all, is always watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/directive-8020-might-give-the-dark-pictures-saga-a-massive-upgrade<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We played an early portion of the upcoming horror adventure game and had to reckon with some tough choices.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Supermassive Games really made their mark on the horror game landscape with 2015's Until Dawn, but the Dark Pictures Anthology really brought the heat by offering gaming's closest analog to Netflix's Black Mirror series. With the latest installment on the way, the developers have plans for an ambitious return that finally ventures into sci-fi horror while also putting players in more direct control of the tense encounters that await the characters in this dark story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At Summer Game Fest 2025, we got to play a particularly fateful encounter from the upcoming Directive 8020, which continues the Dark Pictures saga. We also saw just how the sci-fi horror adventure game mixes things up with more real-time gameplay encounters that bring the series and its strong narrative hooks closer to a true survival horror experience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking place in the far future, where Earth is on the verge of collapse, a crew of scientists and space colonists travel to a distant planet poised to become humanity's next home. But as you'd guess for a horror game, the planet is home to another malevolent entity, and the crew is forced to survive against a mysterious alien presence that can mutate and take the form of any living person on board their ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Actress Lashana Lynch – seen in The Day of the Jackal and Captain Marvel – leads the cast of characters as the pilot of the ship, and her early scenes in Directive 8020 make her such a compelling lead in this bleak story. The game leans into similar themes of paranoia, isolation, and fear of the unknown – which makes for an excellent setup for a Dark Pictures game. The developers were particularly inspired by sci-fi films like Event Horizon, Alien, and John Carpenter's The Thing, which helped establish the style of horror and sense of dread that Directive 8020 goes for.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to game director Will Doyle, who guided me through the SGF demo, Directive 8020 will still feature many of the hallmarks of a Dark Pictures experience. Still, it will also mark the start of more active gameplay sequences and choices that aim to increase the fear factor within this extended episode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've had this idea for more real-time threats in my mind for a long time and throughout season one of the Dark Pictures, and the main reason we wanted to do it was to increase the fear factor for the games," said the game director. "There's nothing more scary than when you're in direct control and the creatures are trying to hunt you down and kill you. That gets your heart pumping, and that was a significant part of our motivation. We also wanted to expand our audience with more engaging gameplay. It's still a cinematic, story-driven game, but it does have moments where you are making those decisions and actions with more direct control."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I got to see this real-time action sequence during a story segment where the Captain and another crew member were confronted by their alien impostors. Playing as the second crew member, the imposter mutates into a grotesque monster, and I have to evade it from within the maintenance area of the ship. This played out in a tense and unnerving stealth sequence that felt similar to Dead Space or Resident Evil, which lends Directive 8020 a classic survival horror-like feel. As this is a Dark Pictures game, permanent death is a thing, and if I hadn't gotten this character out away from his imposter, the main story would have evolved differently.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Permanent death is a thing, and if I hadn't gotten this character out away from his imposter, the main story would have evolved differently.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Directive 8020 heightens the sense of paranoia and tension when making fateful survival choices. Given that Supermassive Games' pedigree of horror adventure games is about making decisions to keep a group of survivors and friends alive to the end of the story – the added twist in Directive 8020's story with your crew being replaced by alien imposters presents an unsettling wrinkle.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A fateful moment occurred when the Captain returned to the crew and had to decide where to shoot a crew member who had seemingly come in contact with the alien entity. Much like the games from the developers, these flashpoint moments are among the most consequential points in the story. Without giving away spoilers, I made a decision that I would come to regret. Still, according to the game director, these moments can also be rolled back using the turning point system – which acts as an optional story tracker and rewind system, allowing players to view different moments and choose a different path if they wish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Directive 8020 is set to be a welcome return to the Dark Pictures series. And with the focus on giving players more direct control of the action while also heightening the sense of distrust in your dwindling party of survivors, the next game looks to offer one of the more unique and game-changing episodes the series has seen yet.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It also reduces the difficulty for the CPR mini-game, adds a new setting to disable or modify Depth of Field, and fixes missing controls in the MineHunter and Run Dungeon mini-games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On PC, there are new pop-up warnings for PCs that have Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling disabled, and PCs with CPUs that have potential crash issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy said this patch also fixes the memory leak issue that had been causing most crashes reported by players. “Performance optimisation is our number one focus and an ongoing commitment that will take further time,” it added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates. Our team is committed to do everything possible to urgently action your feedback,” Build A Rocket Boy said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy has said that by the end of June, players can expect ongoing performance and stability improvements, a rebalanced ‘hard’ difficulty setting, animation fixes, and AI improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is whether the developer, which was founded by former Rockstar North chief Leslie Benzies, can turn MindsEye around. On Steam, which does not paint the whole picture of MindsEye’s current popularity, the game hit a peak concurrent player count of 3,302 on launch, but had a 24-hour peak of just 786 players. At the time of this article’s publication, 435 people were playing on Steam, with a 'mixed' user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/06/devil-may-cry-5-review">Devil May Cry 5 review</a> returned a 9.5. We said: "Devil May Cry 5's trio of outstanding combat styles set a new high bar for the series, and its mysterious story keeps things interesting along the way."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Six years later, Devil May Cry 5 must go down as a blockbuster success for Capcom. “The title has garnered strong support from users due to its exceptional gameplay experience, leading to expanded sales as a catalog title since its release,” the company said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Capcom provided an even more advanced story and action elements in the game with the addition of a new playable character, and more recently, on April 3, 2025, the company released the new Devil May Cry animated series on Netflix, in line with the company’s Single Content Multiple Usage strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The animated series has garnered critical acclaim from around the world, and with more than 5.3 million views it ranked fourth during its first week globally in the "Shows | English" category, while also ranking in the top 10 for seven consecutive days in Japan.
