It accuses PlayerAuctions of operating "with full knowledge that its sellers are engaged in rampant infringement and other unauthorized conduct," while it "reaps millions in revenue by taking a cut of every transaction on its marketplace."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA 5 and GTA Online</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Take-Two alleges that PlayerAuctions hosts listings of modded accounts that have been manipulated to give high game levels and in-game currency, or to unlock content normally unlocked through playing or purchases. Take-Two also claims PlayerAuctions sells money drop services that work using hacking software to give purchasing players large amounts of in-game money, and account boosting services where sellers use hacking software or glitches to inflate a purchasing player's in-game level or currency total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two further argues that PlayerAuctions goes out of its way to "lull its users into buying illegitimate GTA V content from its sellers" by offering refunds if the hacked accounts purchased are caught and banned post-purchase. According to the complaint, Take-Two has "repeatedly confronted PlayerAuctions with evidence of infringement" and has issued a cease and desist, but PlayerAuction has refused to shut down these listings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GTA publisher is claiming relief for multiple different types and levels of copyright infringement, as well as intentional interference with contract. Take-Two is seeking a permanent enjoinment on PlayerAuctions from continuing to directly or indirectly sell accounts, currency, or items in any Take-Two game, or participating in or assisting hacking efforts, or infringing the GTA trademarks. It's also seeing damages for trademark infringement, costs and attorney fees, damages, and restitution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two isn't the only company going after PlayerAuctions. Early last month, Roblox filed a similar suit in the Northern District of California Court covering roughly the same accusations, attempts at a cease and desist, claims, and prayer for relief. Notably, PlayerAuctions offers similar sales and services across many other games, including World of Warcraft, Genshin Impact, Valorant, Path of Exile, Final Fantasy 14, Call of Duty, and Fortnite. In total, PlayerAuctions claims to sell various boosts, items, and benefits for over 200 games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Take-Two suit is still early in the process, the Roblox case has its first hearing set for March 20 in Oakland, California, where Roblox is seeking a preliminary injunction to stop PlayerAuctions from selling Roblox-related products and services while the case proceeds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lawsuit comes ahead of the fall 2025 launch of GTA 6, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">which Take-Two recently reaffirmed</a>. The hope is of course that any new version of GTA Online that launches alongside GTA 6 will be as free from cheaters as is possible, and the lawsuit may go some way to helping.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including Take-Two boss Strauss <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6"><u>Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

However, it won't be happening until 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a press release today, Blizzard revealed the next in-person BlizzCon dates: September 12 and 13, 2026. It also promised to bring back favorite convention elements such as the opening ceremony, panels, the Darkmoon Faire, competitions, and hands-on gameplay. Additionally, Blizzard says it will "aim to meaningfully elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience for all who take part in it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard did not provide an explanation for why it was skipping 2025, or if it has plans for any sort of online celebration this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BlizzCon's status has been rocky the last few years. Formerly an annual event, it was, like many other similar events, canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It returned in 2021 as a digital show in 2021, then went on hiatus again in 2022. In 2023, BlizzCon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzcon-2023-to-be-held-in-person-for-the-first-time-in-four-years">was held once again in person</a> with plans to follow it up in 2024, but the event was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-cancels-blizzcon-2024-promises-return-in-future-years">then canceled for that year as well</a>. While no reason was given at the time, the 2024 cancellation followed its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-just-bought-activision-blizzard-for-69-billion-so-whats-next"> acquisition by Microsoft</a>, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">rash of mass layoffs company-wide</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question of what BlizzCon will look like under Microsoft's oversight remains, and we won't find out the answer until at least next year. At least we have loads of time to plan our cosplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.
