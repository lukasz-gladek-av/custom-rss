It’s worth keeping an eye on these dips, since Amazon tends to fluctuate prices more often than dedicated TCG retailers.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon TCG Below Market Value</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While TCGPlayer is often the go-to marketplace for low Pokémon TCG prices, a handful of sealed products are currently cheaper on Amazon, making them below market value and worth grabbing. Right now, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPVYkD?object_uuid=ce4def12-633f-4e9f-ac1c-3a2ea40d1059&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Black Bolt Booster Bundle is available for $50.01 on Amazon</a>, while the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKMY5?object_uuid=ce4def12-633f-4e9f-ac1c-3a2ea40d1059&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">White Flare Booster Bundle has dipped under $46</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collectors looking for nostalgic sets can also snag the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbMmOe?object_uuid=ce4def12-633f-4e9f-ac1c-3a2ea40d1059&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket Tin at $41.24,</a> or the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxqjY?object_uuid=ce4def12-633f-4e9f-ac1c-3a2ea40d1059&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Paradox Pokémon Stacking Tin at $26.32</a>.

The clear winner is Lugia V (Alternate Full Art) 186/195, which has surged 68% since July to $427, cementing itself as the set’s chase card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trainer Gallery standouts like Rayquaza VMAX TG20/TG30 and Blaziken VMAX TG15/TG30 have also doubled or tripled in value thanks to strong artwork and nostalgia, while even Lugia VSTAR continues climbing on competitive strength. At the same time, cards like Regidrago V (Alternate Art) and Alolan Vulpix VSTAR have cooled as the meta shifted away from them, with values slipping back toward the $12–$14 range. </p><p id="snag-classic-mega-evolution-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Snag Classic Mega Evolution Cards">Snag Classic Mega Evolution Cards Before Market Rise</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The market for XY-era Mega Evolution Pokémon cards is heating up fast ahead of Pokémon Legends: Z-A and the upcoming Mega Evolution TCG set. Collectors aren’t waiting for modern reprints, they’re chasing the originals, and prices are showing it. Some cards have exploded in value, while others have steadied after sharp climbs, creating both momentum plays and entry points for buyers. Leading the surge is M Rayquaza EX (Shiny Full Art - Ancient Origins), which has skyrocketed over 426% this year, from $275 in January to $1,450 today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">M Gengar EX (Secret Rare - Phantom Forces) isn’t far behind, up nearly fivefold to $415, cementing its place as one of the most sought-after Megas. Other heavy-hitters include M Rayquaza EX (Full Art - Roaring Skies), now at $656, M Charizard EX (X - Flashfire) climbing past $349, and Primal Groudon EX (Shiny Full Art), which has more than doubled to $349. These climbers show how nostalgia, unique mechanics, and iconic artwork are driving a collector frenzy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But not every Mega Evolution is running away in price. Some cards have plateaued after strong early-year gains, leaving a rare buying window before the next spike. M Mewtwo EX (Full Art - BREAKthrough) climbed from $37 to $145 but has leveled off in recent weeks, while M Alakazam EX (Full Art - Fates Collide) sits steady just under $100 after jumping from $28 earlier this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Charizard is showing signs of cooling, M Charizard EX (Generations) and M Charizard EX (Full Art - Evolutions) have tripled since January but are holding in the $190-$200 range for now. These pauses don’t signal weakness; rather, they reflect consolidation before the broader Mega Evolution wave hits with new set releases. For collectors and investors, the message is clear: the grails are climbing fast, but the plateaued cards may be the smarter pickups before Mega hype takes over the market again.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Crown Zenith Prices Are Rising</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crown Zenith market has been showing two very different stories this month. On one hand, several Galarian Gallery Ultra Rares are slipping as hype fades, with fan-favorites like Leafeon VSTAR and Suicune V dropping more than 20% from their peaks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, the gold Secret Rares are climbing steadily, led by Giratina VSTAR and Arceus VSTAR, as collectors chase the scarce, high-end pieces of the set. This split reflects a maturing market: casual collectors are less interested in mid-tier Eeveelutions and V cards, while serious players and investors are doubling down on the big four golds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the crashers, Leafeon VSTAR has fallen from nearly $50 to the $43 range, and Glaceon VSTAR is down 26% since February, hovering in the mid-$30s. Deoxys VMAX has slipped under $37, while Suicune V and Raikou V both lost more than a quarter of their value since spring. These are still striking artworks, but set fatigue and limited competitive relevance are pushing prices down. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the climbers are commanding all the attention. Giratina VSTAR (Secret) has surged nearly 20% since July to $180, making it the definitive chase of Crown Zenith. Mewtwo VSTAR is also up more than 30% this summer, with its Charizard battle artwork driving collector demand. Rounding out the gains, Arceus VSTAR, Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR, and Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR are all trending higher as well, thanks to their powerful abilities and limited supply. Taken together, the set still holds broad collector appeal, but it’s clear the market is consolidating around the golden Secret Rares as the safest long-term holds.</p><p id="first-party-switch-2-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="First Party Switch 2 Preorders">First Party Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s 2025 first-party lineup is shaping up to be one of its strongest in years. Pokémon Legends: Z-A is set to arrive in October, followed closely by Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 bundled together for Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then in December, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond lands with its own set of new amiibo figures, alongside Kirby’s big return in Kirby Air Riders. Between new entries in cornerstone franchises and fresh collectible amiibo launches, fans will have plenty to keep their Switch 2 libraries stocked through the holidays.</p><p id="third-party-switch-2-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Third Party Switch 2 Preorders">Third Party Switch 2 Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The third-party slate for Switch 2 is just as impressive, with several big franchises making the jump to the new hardware. Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection launches in December with a full set of classic fighters, while Borderlands 4 and Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake hit this fall. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, titles like Hades II, Octopath Traveler 0, and Cronos round out the lineup for RPG fans. Whether you’re into fighters, shooters, or sprawling JRPGs, the Switch 2’s preorder catalog already feels packed, and today’s deals cover every one of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Days of Our Lives' current 61st season has included a shoutout for one of Nintendo's lesser-known franchises, much to the surprise of fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A recent episode of the long-running soap saw Salem University student Aaron flirting with classmate Arianna outside his dorm room. Looking for an excuse to invite her in, Aaron boldly suggests Arianna might like to wait inside, in order to "play Xenoblade on my Switch." I'd have gone for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, personally, but there we go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To the surprise of Aaron — and, let's be honest, everyone at home watching — his offer is taken up by Arianna, who awkwardly laughs and steps inside, looking like she really did not have anything else better to do. Aaron, bless him, looks genuinely surprised his suggestion worked — as well he should.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">In this scene from the long-running American soap opera Days of Our Lives (s61e008), Aaron uses playing Xenoblade as an excuse to invite Arianna into his dorm room. <a href="https://t.co/LQ9kCVmuyC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LQ9kCVmuyC</a></p>— Nintendeal (@Nintendeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendeal/status/1967660763499405407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The moment has since been turned into a clip and uploaded by <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1967660763499405407" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendeal</a> to social media, where many Nintendo fans are celebrating someone remembering that Xenoblade exists. (To those who were hoping for a new game announcement in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">last week's Nintendo Direct</a>, I hope you're doing okay.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Monolith Soft, the Xenoblade Chronicles series began back in 2010 on Wii, with subsequent years featuring half a dozen sequels and re-releases. The most recent of those, a new version of Wii U side-story Xenoblade Chronicles X, launched for Switch back in March, at a time when most Nintendo fans were just waiting for Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This show has 61 seasons and I've never seen any bit of it until Xenoblade was mentioned," wrote Zhenghua Yang, founder of To the Moon developer Serenity Forge, after watching the clip. "Top tier marketing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know nothing about this show but Aaron is already my favorite character and there is no question about it," wrote another fan, AmiibroN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally launched in 1965, Days of Our Lives is (still) running — now on streaming service Peacock. For anyone who has watched the full episode, do let us know what happened next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: NBC/Peacock.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Flying the Early Access nest</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for a new survival game to obsess over, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lost-skies">Lost Skies</a> officially goes from Early Access to full release on September 17. As the name suggests, you're doing a lot of grappling and gliding in the game, exploring floating islands to unlock technology and collect raw materials, but the core of the game is its detailed, physics-based ship-building system. There's co-op for 1-6 players too, so you don't have to fly alone. If you haven't checked it out yet now is the perfect time, and here are a few details to tempt you to take off. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">PSA for sufferers of airsickness </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Lost Skies is all about exploring ruins and biomes, collecting resources to craft and refine a skyship, so you're spending all your time at high altitude. You'll start out with a grappling hook for shorter distances, then craft a makeshift glider, and by combining the two you can chain movement that will let you get to the harder to reach areas. Once you have enough materials to start crafting your skyship it will become a home base and a weapon war.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>You are not alone</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The various regions of the Lost Skies world are home to strange creatures, like the Blue Manta that travels through the skies, but will attack if provoked, or the burrowing Spitter Motus Beetle that rudely shoots balls of acid at you. Those are the least of your worries though - there are also the Seraph, strange mechanical looking enemies that are powerful and use nano-technology to devastating effect. They're are not to be trifled with. You do have someone on your side though, an AI companion called ASA that can help explain the strange lands you find yourself in, and stop you turning into a weird sky loner. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Something really bad happened</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like most survival games, there's a terrible event that has left you trying to craft your own underpants or going toe to toe with an enraged boar. In Lost Skies it's not the old zombies or aliens stuff, but something called the Cataclysm. AI companion ASA helps you decode the clues you find scattered around ruins, and figure out how the monstrous mechanical Seraph are involved.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Lost Skies Regions, Bosses, and Wildlife Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">You can create your own Lost Skies islands</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're the sort of person who doesn't just want to live in a world, but to shape and control it too, maybe check in with a therapist and then try the Lost Skies Island Creator. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102670/Lost_Skies_Island_Creator/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This free tool</a> allows players to sculpt and populate an island, and use assets from the game to refine and populate it. There are already hundreds of player made islands.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">It's made by the Surgeon Simulator folks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It might look whimsical, but Lost Skies is made by the studio that brought you cult hits like Surgeon Simulator. That was the cult where you had to perform complex medical procedures with tricky physics-based controls. Many virtual patients died, but hilariously. They also created the self-explanatory I Am Bread and I Am Fish. Lost Skies is definitely a vibe shift, but one that takes the bare bones physics-engine skills of Bossa and makes it real pretty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Disclaimer: IGN Entertainment and publishing label Humble Games operate under separate divisions of the same parent company, Ziff Davis.
