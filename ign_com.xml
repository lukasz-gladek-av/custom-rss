Helldivers 2 has the phrase "it's about freedom," for example. FInal Fantasy 7 has the phrase "it's about fantasy." And Bloodborne, as mentioned, has the phrase "it's about persistence."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gothic horror role-playing game also ends the special, two minute long trailer, which some fans think adds further weight to the significance of its involvement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be a simple reference to Bloodborne being a challenging game which requires persistence to conquer, of course, but as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-announces-maintenance-scheduled-for-playstations-30th-anniversary-and-as-youd-expect-fans-are-struggling-to-cope">a bizarrely timed maintenance period is also scheduled for the exact 30th anniversary date</a> of December 3, fans are crossing their fingers and donning their leather hats in anticipation of a long-awaited remaster or sequel announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ending this video on Bloodborne truly is something," said @mathijnd on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkmonzpHVRg&amp;ab_channel=PlayStation" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>. "It's about persistence," said @davgil47. "That Bloodborne clip has a double meaning. They know we've been asking."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A screenshot of the Bloodborne clip is also at the top of the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/1h4x6cn/playstation_30th_anniversary_video_ended_with/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> page, and has more than 3,000 upvotes despite the trailer being just two hours old. "I know we’re joking," EdGeater said. "But this is actually the first time in my memory that Sony put Bloodborne in a sizzle reel."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They're doing this on purpose now," said another user. "It's a sign! The key to Bloodborne 2 is persistence," said someone else. "Saying 'it’s about persistence' on the Bloodborne part feels like a targeted attack on the community," another comment reads. "The light doesn't match the original game fight," pointed out someone else. "I'm wondering if this means something."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar sentiments can be seen all over social media, but fans will just have to wait until tomorrow, December 3, to see whether an announcement comes. Bloodborne launched on March 24, 2015 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">is easily one of the most beloved PlayStation 4 games</a>, but developer FromSoftware has moved on to the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review">Dark Souls 3</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/21/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review">Elden Ring</a> in the years since, while leaving the Sony-published Bloodborne behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have persisted in asking for a sequel or remaster or remake, however, so will be keeping an eye out tomorrow for any hints at a potential return to Yharnam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is definitely celebrating the anniversary of PlayStation in other ways, at least, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-psone-style-playstation-5-and-ps5-pro-as-part-of-30th-anniversary-collection">a range of PSOne themed hardware has also been released</a>. All PS5 users can also enjoy some nostalgic themes, as for a limited time <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-gets-psone-ps2-ps4-and-ps4-menu-themes-to-celebrate-30th-anniversary-of-playstation">menus can be transformed into those reminscent of the previous four generations</a> of PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
