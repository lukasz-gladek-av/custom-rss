            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-game-closures-and-a-declining-audience-call-of-duty-is-in-a-rough-spot-so-whats-next<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty fans are still digesting the news that Activision is walking away from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile">Warzone Mobile</a>, the game that was meant to lead the battle royale into a new era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the weekend, Activision pulled Warzone Mobile from iOS and Android app stores, with the scope of the game being ‚Äústreamlined" and an admission it had not met expectations. While servers will remain online for now, no new content or updates will be issued to the game, and players can no longer spend real money in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, [but] it unfortunately has not met our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences,‚Äù Activision said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs a brutal end for a game that clearly struggled right out of the gate. Warzone Mobile launched in March 2024 on iOS and Android as a Warzone-specific Call of Duty mobile experience that offered battle royale for up to 120 players, as well as cross-progression with the PC and console Warzone, Modern Warfare 2 and 3, and, later in the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-review"><u>Call of Duty Warzone Mobile review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile includes all the best elements of Warzone, while speeding up and streamlining matches and using cross-progression to make this a meaningful extension of the traditional experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision‚Äôs hope was that Warzone Mobile would make a splash in the competitive mobile shooter market, where the hugely successful Call of Duty Mobile, developed by Tencent-owned TiMi Studio Group, is already established. With Call of Duty Mobile, which has seen 1 billion downloads since launch, revenue is shared between Activision and Tencent. Warzone Mobile, on the other hand, was developed entirely in-house at Activision, and so the company received a bigger slice of the money pie every time a player dropped cash on a battle pass or a cosmetic.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Call of Duty Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Warzone Mobile, which requires more powerful mobile phones than Call of Duty Mobile to work well, failed to meet Activision‚Äôs expectations, and its development team was scaled down when, in September last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-layoffs-hit-call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-which-didnt-hit-as-big-as-hoped">Microsoft-wide layoffs hit across the games business</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Call of Duty fans, especially those who <em>did</em> play Warzone Mobile, have lamented the state of the game and indeed the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúThis game simply came out too early and wanted to be too greedy,‚Äù <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WarzoneMobile/comments/1kqdosx/what_a_huge_waste_i_feel_sorry_for_those_who/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Maddafragg</a>. ‚ÄúIt could be seen on the Reddit videos, a lot of gameplay was not fluid with weird graphics, it could be seen that even if the game is playable, the device struggles to run it. The world of mobile gaming is cursed, it's not just Warzone that's dying. Dead by Daylight mobile and Star Wars hunter will also close the doors.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúTurns out mobile games need to be optimized on most devices to be successful, you can't just cater to high end devices and hope your game succeed ‚Äî it won't,‚Äù <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WarzoneMobile/comments/1kocpnv/warzone_mobile_is_officially_dead_now_what/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added piegeamorue</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúGreed is a dangerous thing. Activision was too greedy and when it leaked that they planned on killing CODM in favor of WZM they essentially turned tens of millions of people against the game. It became ‚Äòus vs them‚Äô and CODM is vastly more accessible than WZM ‚Äî the loss was guaranteed.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's next for Call of Duty, which appears to be in a tricky spot right now? Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/has-xboxs-call-of-duty-game-pass" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a> reported that while Black Ops 6 launched big late last year, the Call of Duty franchise saw its users decline afterwards, and ‚Äúmore sharply‚Äù than in recent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here‚Äôs the relevant blurb:</p><blockquote>... the reality is that despite a strong start, Call of Duty has struggled to engage players to the degree it has in the past. According to Ampere, in March 2025, Call of Duty had 20.6 million players. That is still a huge number, but it‚Äôs slightly less than March 2024, which had 20.8 million players, and well down on March 2023, which saw 22.4 million players.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere">The return of the much-loved Verdansk to Warzone did give the battle royale a much-needed shot in the arm</a>, but with the honeymoon period over and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-warzone-cheating-complaints-ramp-up-following-the-return-of-verdansk-activision-insists-its-caused-chaos-in-the-cheat-marketplace-by-disrupting-over-150-cheat-resellers">accusations of rampant cheating once again dominating the narrative</a>, all eyes are on Activision and this year‚Äôs Call of Duty game to see if the still-huge first-person shooter franchise can reinvent itself once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Related, there are a number of apparent datamined gameplay videos doing the rounds that show wall-running and even jet packs working in Black Ops 6. This, some believe, indicates this year's Black Ops 7 will ditch Activision‚Äôs ‚Äòboots on the ground‚Äô mantra for gameplay reminiscent of Black Ops 3.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">They also added jetpacks lol <a href="https://t.co/ZrFxLVfQkj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ZrFxLVfQkj</a></p>‚Äî Bikou (@Kivikou) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kivikou/status/1924643962159030591?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">üö®‚ÄºÔ∏èWALL RUNNING CONFIRMED FOR BO7‚ÄºÔ∏èüö®<br>There is wall running in BO6 currently It is unclear if it's leftover from BO3 that managed to make it's way into a glitch through BO6 or if it's from BO7 and is left in the BO6 files. <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@charlieINTEL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ModernWarzone</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Dexerto?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Dexerto</a> <a href="https://t.co/0FJ0guUIEH" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/0FJ0guUIEH</a></p>‚Äî peter (@viipeter_) <a href="https://twitter.com/viipeter_/status/1924313756395360577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Activision told IGN its teams are busy and moving forward on a variety of work, so hopefully we‚Äôll see the fruits of that soon. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-xbox-games-showcase-2025-for-june-plus-the-outer-worlds-2-direct">Microsoft‚Äôs annual June Xbox showcase is around the corner</a>. Perhaps Call of Duty will turn up there. And, meanwhile, Call of Duty: Mobile is going strong, but, as we‚Äôve pointed out, it‚Äôs not as lucrative a business for Activision, despite being bigger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision Blizzard‚Äôs recent mobile struggles also call into question Microsoft‚Äôs $69 billion acquisition of the company itself, given Xbox boss Phil Spencer has made no secret that the decision was in part motivated by Xbox‚Äôs lofty mobile ambitions (Activision Blizzard owns King, the maker of phenomenally popular mobile game Candy Crush). Indeed, Microsoft plans to launch an app store of its own, taking on Apple and Google in the lucrative mobile game space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

You can now select missions on our home planet in Mega Cities and fight back alongside SEAF soldiers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The city biomes include operations that work towards liberating the cities, which, developer Arrowhead said, have ‚Äúa significant impact on planetary campaigns.‚Äù This is a part of Helldivers 2‚Äôs ongoing Galactic War, a community-driven meta narrative that Arrowhead orchestrates behind the scenes.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The Illuminate have reached the Heart of Democracy. </p><p>Our Mega Cities are under siege.

It won‚Äôt be a walk in the park, divers. Like a game of intergalactic tug-of-war, you will struggle against the incoming forces, gaining and losing control quickly.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">You can activate Planetary Defense Cannons and take down the Illuminate fleet, as shown in the trailer. And, as mentioned, SEAF troops will help join the fight to defend the cities. These small squads will fight enemies on their own, or they can be ordered to follow Helldivers and provide temporary backup as you navigate toward objectives. You do, however, need to be mindful of civilians who are still roaming the streets; Helldivers 2 is as much about friendly fire management as it is blowing aliens up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Heart of Democracy update is part of Arrowhead's long-term committment to keeping Helldivers 2 going for years to come following its record-breaking launch last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-our-main-focus-and-will-be-for-a-loooong-time-arrowhead-boss-insists-as-long-as-you-keep-playing-and-buying-super-credits-we-can-keep-it-going">Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani addressed player concern that the studio might leave the game behind to focus on its next project</a>, dubbed "Game 6."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nah. It's ALL Helldivers 2 for now," he insisted. "A very, very small team will spin up something later this year and go at it sloowly. Helldivers is our main focus and will be for a loooong time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, how long does Jorjani expect content updates for Helldivers 2 to last?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As long as you folks keep playing and buying Super Credits we can keep it going," Jorjani said, pointing to Helldivers 2's virtual currency that's used to buy Premium Warbonds. "Last summer we were kinda screwing the pooch so it looked like we wouldn't be able to keep the train going for a long time - but we turned the ship around, you support us a lot so it's looking bright."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Accompanying the release of Heart of Democracy is update 01.003.002.
