I’ve been watching prices across Amazon and the secondary market as usual, and it’s not even close. The latest Pokémon products like <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObZOj?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">White Flare Binder box</a>, while older set products like <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l30GE?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Destined Rivals Tripple Blister is $8 cheaper</a>, especially the <a href="https://zdcs.link/91jddk?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elite Trainer Box running about $3 cheaper</a> than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-august-1-2025?_cache=pass">Amazon’s lowest price last week. </a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-august-1-2025">Scarlet and Violet 151 is still shifting fast</a> too. Charizard ex, Blastoise ex, and Venusaur ex are climbing, but the Illustration Rares of Charmander, Bulbasaur, and Squirtle have dipped, which makes this a solid time to grab those before prices settle again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over in Magic, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJmnY?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fallout Commander Deck bundle is cheaper at TCGplayer</a> by around $4, with the other commander decks saving around $10 per deck, which really adds up if you’re <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8NZy?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">grabbing the full set</a>.</p><p id="best-deals-for-today"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Best Deals For Today">TL;DR: My Best Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of trading cards, there’s some fun stuff dropping today. I’ve already preordered the Vault Boy Fallout Pop Vinyl, but I’m tempted to pick up the rest of the lineup now that they’re all available for $14.99. If you’re into mini PCs, there are a couple of solid builds going for under $175. They’re perfect for work-from-home setups, light gaming, or just keeping your desk tidy.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-price-check"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG Price Check">Pokémon TCG Price Check</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst there's a couple of savings on Amazon today, TCGplayer is knocking big box retailers out of the water. The White Flare binder box is a couple of dollars cheaper on Amazon, but looking at older sets like Destined Rivals show a clear gap in market value and the notorious Amazon mark ups of 2025. Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box is currently sat at <a href="https://zdcs.link/91jddk?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$85 on TCGplayer</a>, for example, which is cheaper than the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-august-1-2025?_cache=pass">Amazon sale price last week of £88</a>.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-crashers-and-climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG Crashers and Climbers">Pokémon TCG Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet 151 card prices continue to shift, with <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAgkqp?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard ex</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a036gm?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blastoise ex</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWYW1n?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Venusaur ex SIRs</a> climbing steadily thanks to standout artwork, competitive playability, and high collector demand. Charizard has jumped to $210, Blastoise is up 28% to $84.99, and Venusaur is up 27% to $69.99. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3GPE?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zapdos ex</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QdbVn2?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alakazam ex</a> are also on the rise, with Alakazam seeing the biggest gain of 35% to $44.98. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, prices for Kanto starter Illustration Rares like <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbpMy?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charmander</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWmNj?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/av40e2?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Squirtle</a> have dipped as more product floods the market. Charmander is down 14% to $44.44, Bulbasaur is down 18% to $32.20, and middle evolutions like <a href="https://zdcs.link/985m2w?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charmeleon</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP85YO?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wartortle</a> are following the same trend. While the final evolutions remain the most sought-after, now is a good time to pick up the earlier stages at a more reasonable price.</p><p id="magic-the-gathering-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Magic: The Gathering Deals">Magic: The Gathering Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again it's TCGplayer and the secondary market values saving MTG players and collectors a small fortune over Amazon. Even sale pricing of the<a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJmnY?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Fallout Commander Deck - Science! is $4 cheaper</a>, with my favorite deal in this lineup being for the four pack bundle of Fallout Commander Decks. Amazon works out at $47.07 per deck, with <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8NZy?object_uuid=2b716754-e160-45db-8a8f-491877303a3d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGplayer massively undercutting here at $41.56.</a> That's well over $10 saving per deck, with even more savings compared to Amazons single pricing overall.</p><p id="fallout-funko-pop-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fallout Funko Pop Preorders">Fallout Funko Pop Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dropping throughout December 2025, these Fallout Pop Vinyls focused on the Fallout TV series should drop around the same time as Season Two. There's also chances to get a random rare variant, which is about as much Funko hype as I can handle. I've preordered Vault Boy already, but I might get the whole lineup before preorders run dry.</p><p id="mini-pc-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mini PC Deals">Mini PC Deals</h2></p><div><div id="226348" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Intel Twin Lake N150(Turbo 3.6GHz), 16GB RAM, 1TB M.2 SSD</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ACEMAGIC Vista Mini V1 Mini PC</h3></p></div><div id="226349" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Intel Twin Lake N150 (4 Cores, up to 3.6GHz), 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB M.2 SSD</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>KAMRUI Mini PC</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mini PCs are great for a work from home setup, a bit of light gaming or just saving some space. Both of these models have decent specs whilst being good enough to run Minecraft and your day-to-day productivity apps. Plus they're dirt cheap, so there's nothing to loose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
