The offer comes as retailers gear up for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday sales season</a>, providing an opportunity for digital gamers to prepare for upcoming deals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The promotion includes significant savings, such as <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjGqEe?object_uuid=77df69be-79ed-4d43-9678-fc8a21595768&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$25 off a $250 PlayStation gift card</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QODJWD?object_uuid=77df69be-79ed-4d43-9678-fc8a21595768&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$10 off a $100 card</a>. These discounts are particularly valuable for those planning to purchase digital games, downloadable content, or subscriptions during the holiday sales period.</p><div id="210705" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="3432ae1d-309c-45dd-8db4-0708c5b8eb3a"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PlayStation $100 Gift Card</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>10% off deal is available on from $250 to $10 gift cards.</p></div></div><div catalogid="3432ae1d-309c-45dd-8db4-0708c5b8eb3a" id="210706"><div id="210706" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xbox $100 Gift Card</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>10% off deal is available on from $100 to $10 gift cards.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Think about it this way: There's a 100% certainty of digital games sales over the Black Friday period, and these gift card discounts mean you can save even more. Or you could actually <em>gift </em>them, if you want? There are also discounts on <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPbkej?object_uuid=77df69be-79ed-4d43-9678-fc8a21595768&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fortnite V-Bucks</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/91b0Dq?object_uuid=77df69be-79ed-4d43-9678-fc8a21595768&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Game Pass Core</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QLnkeb?object_uuid=77df69be-79ed-4d43-9678-fc8a21595768&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Roblox Digital Gift Cards</a> if you're so inclined. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-black-friday-sale-2024">Nintendo already revealing its Black Friday plans</a>, similar announcements from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-slim-console-black-friday-2024">PlayStation</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-deals-black-friday-what-to-expect-2024">Xbox</a> are expected in the coming days. For now, these gift card offers provide a timely chance to save ahead of the main sales event. Not a Prime member?

Additionally, these digital gift cards can be used to purchase subscriptions, making them a handy option if digital deals on memberships are announced soon. Otherwise, there's a pretty great deal on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals">Xbox Game Pass UItimate at Woot</a> right now if you're keen to grab a deal today.</p></div><div catalogid="d0a019c2-b31e-4e7b-afdb-2a73c34152bd" id="148732"><div id="148732" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3 Months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Membership</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Multiple digital codes can be stacked</p></div></div><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024"><strong>Black Friday</strong></a><strong> in 2024 falls on November 29</strong> this year, but the deals have already kicked off. Leading up to the big event, retailers have begun to open deals online. Each day leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to massive discounts on Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance, such as this excellent discount on gift cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

Today's strike takes place at four ZeniMax locations across Maryland and Texas, with workers set to return to their desks tomorrow, November 14. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment from IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ZeniMax is the umbrella organization that includes The Elder Scrolls and Fallout maker Bethesda and Doom developer id Software, among other studios. It also owns <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> developer MachineGames and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blade-arkane">Marvel's Blade</a> developer Arkane Lyon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Communications Workers of America Union (CWA) filed an unfair labor practice charge against ZeniMax for contracting out work without notification. ZeniMax Workers United-CWA members have raised concerns that ZeniMax’s recent unilateral decision to outsource quality assurance work threatens job security amid record layoffs across the video game industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The strike comes hot on the heels of Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer's insistence that “the Xbox business has never been more healthy.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After splashing out $69 billion on Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">Microsoft has cut more than 2,500 jobs from its gaming business</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">closed three ZeniMax studios</a>.

We’re not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer is of course under pressure to deliver following the Activision Blizzard acquisition, and is in the middle of a big multiplatform push <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-gaming-boss-phil-spencer-wont-rule-out-any-xbox-exclusive-making-the-jump-to-playstation-including-halo">that may end up seeing Halo launch on PlayStation</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We run a business,” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">Spencer said in August</a>. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Deals that add “geographic diversity,” including in Asia, might be worthwhile, Spencer said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apparently Microsoft’s eyeing up buying another mobile company (Microsoft picked up Candy Crush maker King as part of the Activision Blizzard acquisition).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We definitely want to be in the market, and when we can find teams and technology and capability that add to what we’re trying to do in gaming at Microsoft, absolutely we will keep our heads up,” Spencer said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft is still busy absorbing Activision Blizzard employees, Spencer added, which is why very large deals are probably impossible right now. But that leaves the door open for major acquisitions in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer and co. will probably find future acquisitions easier to get over the line after Donald Trump becomes U.S. president in January. Microsoft faced a tough battle with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over the Activision Blizzard deal — a battle it ultimately won. <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/11/07/donald-trump-ma-mergers-acquisition-doj-ftc-lina-khan/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street is said to be foaming at the mouth</a> with all the possible mergers and acquisitions that may now go through with Trump as president.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The focus, it seems, is fleshing out its mobile offering ahead of launching an app store of its own. But Microsoft's App Store and Google Play rival has suffered a number of delays, with staff still trying to figure out a plan. According to Bloomberg, Microsoft still doesn’t have an effective way to get its own store on mobile phones, delaying the launch further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft's gaming aquisition ambitions continue despite cutting an eye-watering 2,550 staff just this year alone, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-layoffs-hit-call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-which-didnt-hit-as-big-as-hoped">Xbox mobile game development teams recently hit hard</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
