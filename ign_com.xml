Singapore's rating board has rated "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4" for a 2025 release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rumored remake, consisting of the next two mainline games in the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series, would be heading to a hefty lineup of platforms. The ratings board lists Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S as platforms for the THPS collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No official confirmation has arrived just yet for this collection, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-announcement-teased-as-fans-spot-easter-egg-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">though a countdown timer spotted in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is teasing some Tony Hawk's Pro Skater news is coming</a>. The countdown is ticking down to March 4, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-teases-pro-skater-anniversary-plans-it-will-be-something-the-fans-will-truly-appreciate">Tony Hawk told Mythical Kitchen that he's been talking to Activsion again</a>, and that they are working on something. "It will be something the fans will truly appreciate," Hawk said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-remake-review">by-all-accounts stellar remake of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</a> from 2020, a remake of the next two games seemed like a no-brainer. Though 3 and 4 felt like an almost surefire bet to happen next, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-merges-blizzard-and-vicarious-visions">Activision folded the THPS remake developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard in 2021</a> and dedicated the team to "Blizzard games and initiatives."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-plans-for-pro-skater-3-4-remake-were-abandoned-after-blizzard-merger">According to Tony Hawk</a>, the original plan "even up util the release day" of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 remake was to tackle 3+4 next. But when Vicarious Visions got absorbed, the publisher sought other developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The truth of it is that [Activision] were trying to find somebody to do 3 + 4 but they just didn’t really trust anyone the way they did Vicarious, so they took other pitches from other studios,” Tony Hawk said in a Twitch livestream in 2022. “Like, ‘What would you do with the THPS title?’ And they didn’t like anything they heard, and then that was it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question remains, then: if a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 remake is happening, and it sure looks like it is, who's making it? The Singaporean ratings board only lists Activision as the publisher and developer. March 4, next week, seems like the day we'll learn some more answers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
