Much like other initially PS5 console-exclusive games, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake</u></a>, Phantom Blade Zero won't be available on "other consoles until at least 12 months after release date." This means Xbox Series X and S or Nintendo Switch 2 versions will have to wait until at least September 2027, if they are in indeed in S-GAME Studio's plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 console exclusivity comes from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q89X4nOzxGw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teaser video</u></a> added to the official PlayStation YouTube channel, which has a familiar blue notice at the end (thanks, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/phantom-blade-zero-console-exclusive-ps5-12-months" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MP1st</a>).</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/15/screenshot-2025-12-15-at-10-23-22-1765794856738.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Phantom Blade Zero won't appear on non-PS5 consoles until 12 months after launch.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Phantom Blade Zero follows Soul, an assassin framed for a murder trying to uncover the truth of what happened. Its release date was announced at The Game Awards alongside the launch of a new trailer, below, which has generated a great deal of excitement.

In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phantom-blade-zero-is-a-delightfully-punishing-action-rpg">most recent look at Phantom Blade Zero this past October</a>, we found the game to be delightfully difficult, with our previewer saying: "It never felt cheap; it just demanded more from me. In just over an hour of play, I was easily ten times the player I was when I started. It’s a feeling of achievement that is reserved for the very best action games on the planet. If the rest is anything like what I played at TGS, I feel like there’s a real chance that Phantom Blade 0 might be one of those games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
