            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">While attending Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show in Bangkok this week, IGN was given the opportunity to sit down with Rainbow Six Siege X’s creative director Alexander Karpazis to talk about how much the tactical live-service shooter has evolved in the ten years since its launch in 2015, where it might go next, the possibility of a campaign mode and Switch 2 port, the use of generative AI in development, and more. Read on for our full chat below! </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/18/s-8626233-0-1-1760775678782.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Alexander Karpazis, Creative Director of Rainbow Six Siege X.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: 10 years is a great achievement for a live service game, particularly since we’ve seen so many others come and go in that time. What do you put the longevity of Siege down to?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alexander Karpazis [AK]: I think one of the big points is just the sheer depth of the game. Like even within 10 years, I don't think you'll be able to master a game like Siege and as a gamer that's incredibly rewarding. It means that you're on a journey to learn, master and discover new things with a game that's always changing. And I think because of that, it's just grown and resonates with so many people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Has Siege evolved in ways that you could have never predicted at launch?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: Yeah, absolutely. I mean if you look at 2015 when the game first launched, the Bomb game mode wasn't the number one game mode. It was split between Hostage and Secure Area and Bomb. Back then eSports was something that was very grassroots and new, and now it's become this entire ecosystem where people make their livelihoods off of it, and that's something we could have never anticipated when it first launched. And so in these interesting ways it's built up to be something that is really significant and humbling to be a part of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You’ve previously said that Siege X is setting the table for the next 10 years. Do you take it one year at a time? How much of a road map is there for the future? Are there 10 more years worth of ideas in the bank? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: When it comes to ideas, we actually sat down and we interviewed the entire team about their ideas for the game, and came up with over 40 pages of concepts that the team still wants to push for. So there is no end in sight when it comes to what we want to do with the game, and it's a balance of short term and long term. We're looking at the seasons ahead of us but also because of Siege X, we're looking at anticipating new technology, new platforms, stuff that's going to come out and it's going to affect the game. And so how can we anticipate that too over a longer stretch of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Hitting a 10-year milestone, does that increase the pressure on your team for the future, or do you feel like you’ve mastered it now and you know what you’re doing?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: We're always learning and we'll never stop learning. There's so much that goes into building a game like this, and it really comes down to listening to the community. They'll always be vocal in what they want to see and how things change and so yeah, it's not a matter of mastering where we are right now. It's being comfortable and knowing that we still have to listen to our community, we still have to adapt, and we still have to innovate as well. Maybe we're getting a little bit more comfortable in being uncomfortable, and that's how we keep on rolling the next 10 years. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: On the topic of listening to the community, how much of a challenge is it to balance your team’s vision for Siege X with the wants, needs, and complaints of the players?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: It is a challenge, and it isn't. Firstly, because this game's been around for so long I think the DNA is very well understood by players, new and old actually. They know it's a tactical game that has a lot of unique elements like destruction, like asymmetric attacker-defender characteristics. But it does mean that players do want to see change, and more of it more often, and that's where we have to anticipate better, adapt even faster. And in a way, that's sustainable, right? We are humans at the end of the day, the dev team is very human as well, and we want to encourage something that can last another 10 years and not only focus on the short term.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We want to encourage something that can last another 10 years.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What impact will Ubisoft’s creation of the Vantage Studios subsidiary have on you guys? How do you feel about it, and will it have any noticeable impact on the players? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: So when it comes to the player perspective, Vantage Studios is not player-facing so it won't be anything that's noticeable for players in the day-to-day or even long term. And even on the project we're not seeing any major changes, the focus is still on making sure that Siege grows, that it's invested in, and so that's something that we can confirm today. And it means that again, we're still very excited about the future. So it doesn't actually change anything for us right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: When Siege X launched in June, it surged on Steam to around 150,000 concurrent players. Now it appears to be hovering around 40,000. Is that sort of drop-off a concern?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: Firstly, the players coming to the game, especially like a record number of new players checking out Siege X? It’s always awesome and it’s exactly what we had hoped for. And then yeah, there's always a bit of a tail afterwards, especially as the team was also kind of recovering from launching something as massive as Siege X. There are ebbs and flows, and a lot of it's expected. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for us, we're really happy with the game. We're happy with where it's going. We have the Munich Majors in November where we'll be sharing even more about where it's going next. And again, excited to see players continue to join Siege and grow from there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is it a similar trend on consoles?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: Yeah, it is. PC and consoles share the same player habits that we see all the time. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: At this stage, do you feel like switching to free-to-play was the right thing to do, or is it too soon to tell?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: For us, we're seeing the benefits already. We have more new players joining the game than ever before since launch, and that's exactly what we’d hoped for. We're seeing a new generation of Siege players as well, which again is really great even as we try to balance the needs of new players and also veteran players. It is hitting the mark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You’ve got so many characters and 10 years’ worth of lore built into the game now. Have you at least entertained the idea of a campaign mode? Rainbow Six Vegas had such an awesome co-op campaign.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: It’s absolutely part of the heritage and yes, it is something that our players ask about. All I can say right now is we're still really focused on the PvP aspect. We have been playing around with storytelling within PvP, and we had an event called Assault on Hereford that players really loved, that did build on what our characters are doing, the tone of the game, and we will continue to explore that realm. But yeah, we have nothing to announce right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What’s your stance on the use of generative AI in games development, do you have plans to use it for Siege?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: If we just talk about AI at its core, it's something we've always been using, like machine-learning, developing new tools not only for anti-cheat but for things like our AI bots, where they're actually trained on our real player data. So these are all incredible tools that make us faster and more efficient. And so it's not a new concept. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, when it comes to generative AI, this is stuff that's still really new and so we haven't incorporated it into our pipeline of Siege. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When it comes to generative AI, this is stuff that's still really new and so we haven't incorporated it into our pipeline of Siege.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What's the fan response been like to the Dual Front mode? I know a lot of players were of the opinion that the District map was a bit too big at launch, are you reevaluating that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: Yeah, there was a lot of feedback on the new mode especially when you're comparing it to veterans and new players. We see new players really jumping in more often than veterans, which is great. It's something that we hoped for. But there are still ways to improve it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we will be taking some time to make some bigger changes to the game mode that we’ll be really excited to share for Year 11 - Season One. So at the start of next year. We'll keep on shaking things up and seeing if we can get more good feedback on it too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's definitely something that we want to stand apart from core Siege. Core Siege is very much competitive. The main draw is Ranked where it has this kind of competitive progression. Dual Front is still the place where we want to give all of the sandbox ingredients that you have in Siege in a more free form so you can play around with all of it, mixing attackers and defenders, mixing different kinds of strategies to attack and defend too. That's where it really shines. So making sure Dual Front is answering a clearly different need than Core is something that we're focused on.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rainbow Six Siege X: Dual Front Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: We’ve seen Star Wars Outlaws come to Nintendo Switch 2, and Assassin’s Creed Shadows is rumoured to be on its way too. Is Rainbow Six Siege 2 likely to be next? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: For us the focus will always be on the platforms we’re on right now, making sure that it's the best experience and when we do new gameplay [that] it makes use of the platforms that we're on. So right now, any new platform isn't necessarily a focus for us. But again, we're a live game, it's 10 years. I learnt a long time ago to never say never, so we'll see as platforms grow and new opportunities come up too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Finally, do you have anything special planned for the 10-year anniversary?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: We’ve spoken a little bit about it and we'll share even more at the Munich Majors, but our plan is absolutely to celebrate this major milestone with our players. We have a big event planned for in-game. We have rewards that we have planned for our players as well. So yeah, we'll absolutely be taking advantage of this big moment and celebrating it with everyone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Looking forward to seeing what you have in store. Thanks for your time.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">AK: Thank you so much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a senior video editor at IGN's Sydney office.

What I didn't expect was to see so many Trainer Gallery cards drop in value, but I think this is more of a market correction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was only at the beginning of the year that Gengar and Pikachu were in the pocket money binder at your local TCG and collectables stores, but those days are still a distant memory. </p><p id="crashers-and-climbers-lost-origin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers and Climbers: Lost Origin">Crashers and Climbers: Lost Origin</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Pokémon Mania 2025 still going crazy, everyone is trying to grab new release sealed product at retail, which means it's a great time to snag some overlooked cards from older sets before they climb up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, I got most of the cards in today's crasher section for around $5 each 12 months ago, so although they're currently lowering in price, they're still a great buy. Let's get straight into it.</p><p id="pokmon-card-crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Card Crashers">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/feature-image-42-1760714767311.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5XwrY?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gengar TG06/TG30</a> is a bit of a risk to play in-game, Netherworld Gate can bring it back from the dead without the need to evolve it, but you also get three damage counters. Screaming Circle can work out well then opponents have a full bench for one Psychic energy, but it's still a risk that might not be worth taking. The artwork itself is fantastic, and it's one of my favorite Gengar cards just for the bold colour and Gengar being fascinated by a washing line. This card has had a brutal crash from $56 to $38, but I see this as more of a correction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjR8K?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pikachu TG05/TG30</a> has the exact same charm, seeing it having a nap with the female trainer from Legends: Arceus. It's such a sweet image and can see why this card is worth over $26. It's come down from over $30, but I'm sure this will grow far past this point in the next 12 months. It's really not worth including in your deck, but it's a cracking pick for a trainers binder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gold and black cards never really did much for me personally, so I can see why the value of <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp47J4?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mew VMAX TG30/TG30</a> has dipped from $26.04 to $21.42. But that's besides the point, it's still Mew and there's plenty of people who need every Mew they can find in their collection, so this still isn't bad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7pNv?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard TG03/TG30</a> is another card im suprised to be calling a crasher this week. It's Charizard cuddling up with Champion Leon, which is a recipe for a banger card. We're seeing a lot of Trainer Gallery cards go through a bit of a correction right now, but a 25% drop from $23.95 to $17.98 is a bit rough. I'd reccomend picking one up before it ticks back up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/921x05?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pikachu VMAX TG29/TG30</a> is matching that Mew energy. I pulled this from a booster earlier this year, and it's a bit of an underwhelming card despite the rarity. It's not dropped by much, only 9%, and it will probably climb in the next year or two, but black gold cards could have been so much cooler.</p><p id="pokmon-card-climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Card Climbers">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/feature-image-43-1760714810779.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6D2mZ?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giratina V 186/196</a> has gone through the roof and into the stratosphere over the last month. In September these we're going for $570, but it's now over $720, and I'm here for it. I'm yet to get my hands on one, but what an incredible work of art this card is. It illustrates the Distortion world perfectly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's nice to see Aerodactyl card climbing up in value, especially it's <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8Jyk?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">V Alt Art (180/196)</a>. It's a gorgeous scene of it slying over a tropical area, with a shedload of detail and some lovely use of color. It's easy to see why this card has been bumped from $129 to just over $180 in the space of a month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red and Pikachu, this is peak Pokémon generation one nostalgia at its finest. Showcasing Red checking out a map and Pikachu looking ready for a new adventure, there's no reality where <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YMWGl?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pikachu V TG16/TG30</a> twouldn't double in value in a month. At $99.07 right now, trainers would be wise to add this to their collection sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/911jeq?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pikachu VMAX TG17/TG30</a> takes this nosgalia and kicks it up a gear into the Sword and Shield era of Pokémon with Pikachu Gigantamax form. The posture of Red ready for another challenge with chonky Pikachu just happy to be standing upright is a cracking scene. This card used to be $10-20 higher than Pikachu V, but is settling in the same ballpark at $96.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rotom is a cool Pokémon and no one will tell me any different. I'd have one in my phone making it fly around every day of the week, and i'd love to have <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4714?object_uuid=11f82099-c865-4491-866c-04f736247772&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rotom V 177/196</a> in my collection one day. It's cheap and cheerful at $26, but it's climbed up from $22 in a month, so I'd call that a low risk investment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

But what happens when you can’t get your hard-earned Legendary drop because it got trapped out of bounds or behind an invisible wall? Desperate Borderlands 4 players are running into that exact problem and are now pleading with developer Gearbox for a fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played Borderlands 4 you’ll probably know the feeling. It’s the europhoria that comes from a Legendary drop among the confetti-like explosion of loot that erupts from a downed boss. This is something the Borderlands series has always done well, perhaps better, even, than any other looter shooter. When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-chief-randy-pitchford-says-if-more-developers-better-understood-why-gamers-love-making-decisions-about-loot-wed-have-good-competitors">Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford recently said if more developers better understood why gamers love loot, then Borderlands would have “good competitors,”</a> most agreed with him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if that Legendary flies off and lands out of bounds, the frustration is just as intense as the euphoria that proceeded it. Double the intensity if the Legendary spirals away after a particularly difficult boss fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This has been a problem with Borderlands 4 since launch, but it was exacerbated this week with the weekly endgame content reset, which rotated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/The_Oppressor_-_Legendary_Drops_and_Boss_Guide">The Oppressor</a> into this week’s Big Encore boss fight. The problem here is The Oppressor is a flying enemy (flying enemies in shooters are almost always more annoying to fight than any other), which means it darts about the sky, sometimes over areas the player can’t reach. And what happens when you land the killing shot as it’s in the air? The loot flies sometimes lands on a roof, behind an invisible wall just out of reach, or off the map entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are, understandably, infuriated. “Do not waste your Eridium on this week's Big Encore Boss Opressor unless you want to lose loot,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1o96xcp/do_not_waste_your_eridium_on_this_weeks_big/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declared redditor PuzzleheadedDust8094</a>. “If you value your Eridium and dislike getting screwed out of your items because Gearbox can't seem to prevent your loot from flying outside of the arena or through walls, you absolutely should avoid fighting this boss UNTIL THEY FIX THIS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have lost so much loot to bosses dropping stuff in places you can't get to because it's a giant death pit or because of bogus invisible walls. This week’s Big Encore boss might just be the biggest offender yet. I've lost (and I wish I was joking) 7 OUT OF 10 Big Encores worth of loot. That's 700 hard earned Eridium down the drain.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/a-lot-to-process-opressor-1760734763948.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Oppressor is one of the most frustrating boss fights in Borderlands 4.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I swear to god if they don't fix The Oppressor loot issues (out of bounds or spread around the entire arena rather than where the boss is) and flying around for a full f***ing minute before you can even hit him, I may lose a bit of faith,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1o95l0m/ive_called_bl4_a_1010_from_day_1_but/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said StretchDizzy7792</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Please QC your Big Encore picks. Two weeks in a row of bosses with issues (loot under floor on last weeks).

I've only seen one purple and one blue item in it. The rest has always been white and green.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's supposed to replace gear with higher quality loot once full but it's definitely not doing that,” said another. “I constantly leave behind blue gear and that thing should be littered with blues, but nope.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/GearboxOfficial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@GearboxOfficial</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Borderlands</a> <br>Flies around sporadically with no inertia looking awful, gets stuck on map geometry, upon dying flies out of arena to drop all loot in inaccessible places.

Some suggest saving and quitting as soon as the Legendary goes out of bounds, and then, upon loading back in, heading straight to the Lost Loot Machine. Maybe you’ll be lucky. Maybe not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week’s hotly anticipated patch — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-borderlands-4-players-brace-themselves-for-the-end-of-the-op-crit-knife-gearbox-developers-explain-why-nerfs-are-needed-even-in-mostly-single-player-games">the one set to nerf “unintended interactions” such as the crit knife</a>, was delayed to early next week. Some are hoping this ‘Day 30 Update’ will also sort out Borderlands 4’s lost Legendaries problem. In the meantime, there’s a new mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/173" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the Borderlands 4 NexusMods page</a>, that some players are finding success with (this is only if you’re playing on PC, of course).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Who's your starter Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Z-A? Wait, wait, let me guess: is it Totodile?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Odds are, I was correct, at least based on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx65Ppq4EA6KKNkicT8VFQJctnWwdt0UUn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poll we've conducted surrounding the launch of Z-A yesterday</a>. Our poll's been up for 22 hours and has over 11,000 votes from IGN readers, and it reveals that of the three Z-A starter Pokémon, over half of IGN's audience is picking Totodile over Tepig or Chikorita. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time this piece was written, water-type Totodile had 56% of the vote, with 24% choosing grass-type Chikorita, and only 20%, one-fifth of our readers, picking fire-type Tepig -- and we agree with the winner: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-legends-z-a/Starter_Pokemon_Guide:_The_Best_Starter_to_Pick">Totodile is the best pick, stats-wise, with some caveats we go over in our Pokemon Legends: Z-A Best Starter Guide.</a> <em>Update: At 32K votes, Totodile remains locked at 56%, Chikorita at 25.3%, and Tepig at a tepid 18.7%).</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This might not be a shock to anyone, though, as Totodile has long been a fan-favorite. Just look at the bitey boy! Chikorita and Tepig have historically gone less-loved, and Tepig in particular is an outlier in this trio as both Totodile and Chikorita hail from Johto, while Tepig was a starter in Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, while I personally went with Chikorita (having picked Totodile in Generation 2 every single time and wanting a change-up), I gotta say, Tepig by far has the best final Mega Evolution of the three. All members of this trio get new Mega Evolutions in Z-A, and while I won't spoil them here, Meganium's was rather disappointing and Feraligatr's just looks weird. Emboar though? Looking awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't overthink it though. All three starters are perfectly viable for the entirety of Z-A's campaign, and it's very easy to catch all three Pokémon for your PokeDex once you hit the endgame, so you won't be missing out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can learn more about the starter Pokémon and their evolutions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=backstage_event&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqblZWNkRVX2ZuaVNfeU5BTnFIOE15Q1NaVzNDZ3xBQ3Jtc0tuSjVhT1R4N3Bmbk81UXVYSWd5eElNcGJYd1c2R01KczNzeTlsUlU2c3pGYURvSU5xWWR3QlFadlMwNi1tbWV4aVJKOG1udG9HSkF6LVpuN3ViM3hzU2paQTByVTNyeXZxWFFJOGRnVGsxMGJaZGRxYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Fwikis%2Fpokemon-legends-z-a%2FStarter_Pokemon_Guide%3A_The_Best_Starter_to_Pick" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in our Wiki guide</a> if you're still on the fence.

As gamers new and old now drop into what has become one of the most popular Battlefield games ever, everyone's talking about what kind of player Battlefield 6 should cater to.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Apparently I'm a "Battledad" now cuz I enjoy playing games slower and don't want to always be zooming around.</p><p>It's ok young one, it'll hit you too one day.

So, when the August Battlefield 6 beta revealed mechanics that leaned more into movement shooter territory than the series had ever experienced before, longtime fans – often not-so-lovingly referred to as "battledads" – were quick to ask for changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and BF Studios obliged, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcing</a> that Battlefield 6 movement had been tweaked to “create a more balanced and traditional Battlefield experience,” later that same month. Changes included reduced horizontal speed and a hit to jump momentum that many had used to dance around others. Shooting while jumping or sliding was also nerfed, thus causing a stir amongst newer fans — often called zoomers — who typically favored movement shooters, such as Call of Duty. You can probably see where this is going.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Battlefield 6 developers have removed building momentum and bunny hopping, and yeeting yourself 10-30 feet off ledges and cover.</p><p>DICE has introduced aim penalties when sliding and shooting, jumping and shooting and trying to spam movement.</p><p>Movement community is in shambles. <a href="https://t.co/FDiALnPDxU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/FDiALnPDxU</a> <a href="https://t.co/3szUfUcFzT" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3szUfUcFzT</a></p></div>— Xfactor Gaming - Battlefield 6 (@rivaLxfactor) <a href="https://twitter.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1968726309481128037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Another AAA studio gutting movement to cater to people that play games one hour a week that will never run into people utilizing movement tech anyway,” content creator and X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/Reave/status/1958548537064497348" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>@Reave said at the time</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oh go fly a kite, bro,” content creator and X user <a href="https://x.com/TeioStreams/status/1958699009121689917" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TeioStreams <u>replied</u></a>. “If you want movement in your shooter go play COD.

Battledads aren’t quite as enthusiastic, with some sharing fears of “overcorrection.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Go back to your CoD slop if you think the movement now is worse than in the beta.
