It's the largest all-cash sponsor take-private investment in history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Under the terms of the agreement, the group will acquire 100% of EA, with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company. EA stockholders will receive $210 per share in cash. The per share purchase price represents a 25% premium to EA’s unaffected share price of $168.32 at market close on September 25, 2025, and a premium to EA’s unaffected all-time high of $179.01 at market close on August 14, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the close of the transaction, EA’s common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/29/gettyimages-970613584-1759148343537.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">EA boss Andrew Wilson will remain in charge of the company.

This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA will continue to be led by Wilson and will remain headquartered in Redwood City, California. The transaction is expected to close in Q1 FY27, subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The transaction will be funded by a combination of cash from each of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners, the latter of which is an American investment firm based in Miami, Florida, and formed in 2021 by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combined, the deal is for an equity investment of approximately $36 billion, and $20 billion of debt financing fully and solely committed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., $18 billion of which is expected to be funded at close. Each of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners plan to fund the equity component of the financing entirely from capital under their respective control, the companies said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The enormous sale comes just days before EA releases Battlefield 6, a crucial launch for the company, and hot on the heels of FC 26 and Skate. EA games in development include Mass Effect at BioWare, Star Wars Jedi 3 at Respawn, and Iron Man at Motive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Patrick T.
