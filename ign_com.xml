            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a decade of storytelling, Square Enix has decided to wrap up the story of Max Caulfield and Chloe Price in the newly-revealed Life is Strange: Reunion, which is set for launch on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on March 26, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A direct sequel to 2024's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, featuring many of the same secondary characters, Reunion will also finally answer fan wishes by bringing back both beloved faces from the franchise's original 2015 game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Max, who returned as the protagonist of Double Exposure, will reunite with her former lover/best friend Chloe for one final adventure — and for the first time in the same game, both characters will be playable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, there's a sci-fi mystery to solve and limited time to do so — this time, Max's Caledon University must be saved from a deadly fire — and once again, Max can rewind time to remake decisions, while Chloe can use her risk/reward "Backtalk" ability from 2017's Life is Strange: Before the Storm to provoke further responses from others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How is Chloe back, if players previously saw her demise? The story here seems to be that Chloe is now alive regardless after Max merged a pair of disparate timelines in Double Exposure's finale. Returned to life with memories of a past she never lived, Chloe is prompted to seek out Max for answers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game builds on all the character-led, grounded storytelling for which the Life is Strange series is known, with meaningful choices that affect the outcome of a dramatic and surprising narrative – all culminating in an epic climax that serves as a finale to the Max and Chloe saga," Square Enix wrote today. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Life is Strange: Reunion Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans may be surprised to learn that Max and Chloe's stories will end here, but after a lengthy and often bumpy development road for the franchise, now perhaps feels a good point to ensure their tale gets a definitive ending, with both characters together one final time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember that Don't Nod, the series' original developer, never planned for the characters' stories to continue beyond its initial hit game. Remember also that both Don't Nod and current maker Deck Nine have experienced mixed fortunes with the series since, with the original game's emotional climax still considered by many fans to be the franchise's high point. Finally, there are likely narrative advantages to letting players decide on a final outcome for the pair — something that doesn't need to be unpicked or worked around in any continuation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Life is Strange continue without Max and Chloe? Square Enix doesn't go as far as stating that Reunion is the last Life is Strange game <em>ever </em>— though this feels an ending, for now. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/20/g-ibdyox0aeuhtr-1768932660114.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Farewell, Max and Chloe.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We couldn’t dismiss the tragedy at the heart of Max and Chloe," Life is Strange senior brand manager Andrew James said in an Xbox Wire blog post today. "Their reunion could be no quick fix. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Max and Chloe’s relationship is at the core of the story," James continued, "a relationship that YOU will choose how to develop over the course of the game. Whether Chloe lived or died in Arcadia Bay, and whether she and Max were friends or lovers — these choices are key not just to the <em>past</em> you’ll confirm as you play, but to the <em>future </em>you’ll fight for the chance to build."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon launch, Life is Strange: Reunion will be available for $40. There's also a $50 Deluxe edition featuring a digital soundtrack, art book and comic, and access to a behind-the-scenes documentary with returning Max Caulfield actress Hannah Telle, and Rhianna DeVries, Deck Nine's actress for Chloe Price. (Yes, thankfully there's no cat content sold separately this time around.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're yet to play Double Exposure, a double pack of both games will be available for $60. (It's a solid entry in the series that sets up a new cast of characters we'll see more of in Reunion — and one which Chloe fans may now enjoy more in retrospect.) Finally, a $100 Collector's Edition of Reunion will be available for die-hard fans, featuring a range of physical goods such as a 12" vinyl soundtrack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

I've pulled three normal 'Zard ex's so far, so no need to worry about deck building with Phantasmal Flames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They also had the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwZV5?object_uuid=a4e67122-6c4e-4044-aa3f-fa1b60d0cb2d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box live</a>, which is actually available for $74.99 right now, though it's been going in and out of stock as the months have gone by. With that, I'd suggest keeping an eye on that too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What made this set even more exciting is its size, with about 90 cards before secret rares, which makes it the smallest English set in nearly a decade. For collectors like me, that usually means a much more manageable chase, while still packing in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokemon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-august-28">plenty of heavy hitters</a> for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The product lineup altogether for Phantasmal Flames was pretty stacked, too. We got the usual booster packs and booster box (36 packs), a 9-pack Elite Trainer Box featuring a shiny new Charcadet promo, and an Ultra-Premium Collection built around Mega Charizard X ex.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, two theme decks for Mega Gengar ex and Mega Diancie ex arrived a few weeks early on October 24, which was a fun way to get a taste of the set before launch. If you’re like me and love cracking packs, the booster box was the way to go, but the UPC already looked like the big collector piece this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What tied it all together was the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6bvY?object_uuid=a4e67122-6c4e-4044-aa3f-fa1b60d0cb2d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Japanese set Inferno X</a>, which hit shelves there in late September. That set had only 80 cards, and once you added in the Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie decks, you basically got the full Phantasmal Flames lineup. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'd already seen some killer reveals, including the Mega Charizard X ex secret rare previewed at Worlds, so I fully expected that to be the chase card when this launches. Between the smaller set size, Charizard hype, and some solid gameplay cards, I'm not surprised this one flew off the shelves and I’m definitely glad I locked in my preorder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mega Evolution - Released Sept. 26, 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/14/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-preorders-up-today-1752498558521.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mega Evolution - Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just when you thought the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop"><u>Pokémon TCG</u></a> had enough going on with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-destined-rivals-cards"><u>Destined Rivals</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed"><u>Black Bolt and White Flare</u></a>, in came a brand new series altogether with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025">Mega Evolution sets</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced at Japan's Championship tournament, the two new sets featuring Mega Lucario ex and Mega Gardevoir ex marked the popular trading card game stepping away from its Scarlet and Violet era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Evolution released on August 1, 2025, in Japan, and September 26 in English markets (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-where-to-buy">with more preorders also supposedly taking place on September 13</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finding sealed products like these at a fair price became a challenge very quickly.

I think it's great and possibly the best opportunity to pull Illustration Rares in the Scarlet and Violet era, it's ending on a high note. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally I'm not a fan of stuffing the set with Pokéball and Masterball rares, but in terms of quality and presentation, they look cool.

This set brought back Trainer’s Pokémon, reintroduces Team Rocket for another round of villainous fun, and includes some of the best card art we’ve seen in ages. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-preview">Destined Rivals</a> top chase card prices are also finally stabilizing, making it a great time to snap some up. Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex SIR has been going for anything over $450 since release, but is starting to settle on a more respectable $310. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A while back, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-best-singles-to-chase-and-buy">Destined Rivals singles market</a> was bouncing all over the place. Some cards were doubling in price overnight and it was tough to tell what was hype and what would hold. Now, prices feel a lot more stable by comparison. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some have dipped. Some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-best-singles-to-chase-and-buy">Destined Rivals</a> bangers are just cruising right at market. It feels like we’re finally seeing what these cards are actually worth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Above are the ten of the most expensive cards you can find in the set right now. A couple of them are legit strong in decks. A few are pure collector bait. Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex was the hottest card in the set for a while and it’s still holding close to market. The artwork is what does it for me, personally. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GRqK?object_uuid=a4e67122-6c4e-4044-aa3f-fa1b60d0cb2d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mewtwo</a> looks like it's about to explode, floating in this dim lab setting with everything glowing around it. The ability makes it tough to use unless you’re running a full Rocket build, but once it's active, Erasure Ball gives you some serious power. Definitely still a top-tier pull even with the market calming down.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Journey Together - Released Mar. 28 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s about time we got a set like this. Bringing back nostalgic Trainer’s Pokémon cards from the Gym Heroes era. N’s Zoroark ex and Lillie’s Clefairy ex end the chaos of endless secret arts for a more curated, collectible experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With just 16 Pokémon ex, 11 illustration rares, and three hyper rare gold cards, it’s been easier to track what’s worth pulling without feeling like you need a PhD in pack odds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fancy snagging the Enhanced Booster Display Box with its bonus N’s Reshiram illustration rare or pull Iono’s Bellibolt ex? This set screams nostalgia with a new coat of paint.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rare Cards and Collector’s Highlights</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re into collecting, this set hits the sweet spot. It’s got 16 Pokémon ex, six unique illustrations rares, and just three hyper rare gold cards, which means you won’t have to mortgage your house chasing every rarity. As for the artwork. illustrating rares like N’s Zoroark ex will look incredible in your binder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Center’s Enhanced Booster Display Box is the one to grab for preorder exclusives. It comes with a bonus N’s Reshiram illustration rare card — a little extra flex for your collection.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prismatic Evolutions - Released Jan. 17 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Prismatic Evolutions, kicked off 2025, and it’s all about Eevee and its many evolutions. This set is doing things differently, which is probably why stock sells out as soon as it comes in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is another 151 situation, but there were plenty of stock refeshes coming throughout 2025, with hopefully more coming eventually in 2026. You won’t find these cards in the usual booster packs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, they’ve be released in boxed sets throughout last year, each packed full of exclusive cards celebrating Eevee and friends. With over 175 cards, including unique designs and new game mechanics, Prismatic Evolutions is shaping to be a hit with collectors and competitive players alike.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rare Cards and Collector’s Highlights</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">For collectors, Prismatic Evolutions isn’t short on treasures. Each Eevee evolution has its special illustration and hyper-rare gold Pokémon ex card, making them must-haves for anyone building a showcase-worthy collection. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The set includes 32 illustration rares featuring detailed artwork for Pokémon ex and Supporter cards, so plenty of eye candy is here. With so many unique finishes and designs, it’s bound to make a few waves among fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the fresh artwork, inventive mechanics, and the undeniable charm of Eevee and friends, Prismatic Evolutions is set to be one of 2025's standout sets. Collectors and players alike will still find something to love here, from stunning illustration rares to powerful new game cards that can make a real difference in play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

In the years since, IO's assassination masterpiece has since also launched for Switch 2, iPhone, iPad and Mac. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next month, on February 3, a fresh update will unlock <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> cross-progression across mobile, consoles and PC — though the ability to carry over progress from Hitman 2 will cease as a result. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cross-Progression will allow you to assign a specific platform as your Primary Account, with your progress there saved to IO Interactive's servers and accessed wherever you log in with your IOI Account.

So, just because you might own the game on PC, don't expect to suddenly be able to fire it on PlayStation. The same goes for its DLC packs, which similarly must be bought for any platform you wish to play their content on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Older saves not tied to your Primary Account won't be deleted, though you will need to toggle off Cross-Progression to regain access to them.

The ability to do this will end on February 3, alongside the addition of Cross-Progression. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This guarantees data integrity and prevents conflicts between legacy progression systems and the new unified WOA progression," IO Interactive wrote in a <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> on the changes. "Past February 3rd 9:00 UTC players won’t be able to proceed to the Hitman 2 to Hitman 3 carryover, giving you two weeks to proceed to the carryover if you are yet to do so."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive has three main productions right now: ongoing work on Hitman: World of Assassination, including work on a co-op mode, James Bond blockbuster 007 First Light, and a new fantasy IP appropriately codenamed Project Fantasy.

He said saving the game and releasing it had been “the most challenging but rewarding experience of my life.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale has endured a tumultuous development. It was announced in December 2018 with a trailer that so far has an incredible 62 million views on <a href="https://youtu.be/o77MzDQT1cg?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a>. The idea was to expand on the likes of Minecraft by combining the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game, all set in a procedurally generated world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Excitement around Hytale was fueled by the experience of the developers themselves, who co-founded Hypixel, one of the most influential Minecraft servers in the world. League of Legends developer Riot Games invested in the project and, in 2020, bought the studio outright.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in June last year development on Hytale stopped and Hypixel Studios began winding down operations. It was thought Hytale was canceled, destined never to release. But in November, Riot confirmed it had sold the rights to Hytale back to Collins-Laflamme as this "gives players the best chance to one day experience a revised version of the game they've been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006090043665088900" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>statement</u></a> published at the end of 2025, Collins-Laflamme expressed his "anger" at what had happened to Hytale over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game has insane potential, but four years of engineering went into rebuilding the engine rather than gameplay features," he said. "That leaves us with a four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do, and that rebuilt engine is never gonna be used.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you don’t invest in gameplay, you don’t just lose time. You lose momentum, iteration, and player feedback. Now the focus has to be on gameplay first and rebuilding trust by actually shipping things at a rapid pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s a damn miracle we were able to salvage Hytale. It was barely playable. All basics were broken. Camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, gameloop, sounds, rendering. Everything, everything was wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It should have taken years to fix, but within weeks, we got the game into a playable, fun state. And now, instead of slowing down or celebrating a release, we have to keep pushing for years to make up for the time that was lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So yes, I feel anger. And I’m turning that into focus and execution. I’m committing more money, more time, and personal sacrifice to deliver the game this vision deserves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to the early access launch, and it sounds like all the heartache was worth it. Even before the early access launch, Collins-Laflamme said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-isnt-even-out-yet-and-its-already-made-enough-money-to-cover-the-next-2-years-of-development-costs">Hytale had already made enough money to cover the next two years of development</a>. And now, he’s told fans he can call the launch a success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s now been seven days since early access launch and I can confidently say that I have no regrets saving Hytale, it’s been the most challenging but rewarding experience of my life,” Collins-Laflamme said in <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2013636980626595976" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X / Twitter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you everyone for the amazing support, and a big thank you for the rebuilt Hytale team for trusting me to get this to the finish line in just a few months. I haven’t been involved with Hytale development for many years and coming back was a big unknown and risk for me, and my family. I fully trusted the people and it just worked. Amazing team, every single one made a big difference.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Work on updating Hytale continues, with Update 2 coming this week.
