Ultimate, Super Mario Odyssey, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, it's been reported. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/confirmed-switchs-virtual-boy-headset-can-play-vr-supported-switch-games-including-breath-of-the-wild-and-mario-odyssey/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a> has tested the new Virtual Boy headset (and its cheaper cardboard alternative) with the four games, which previously received VR modes to become compatible with Nintendo Labo VR following its launch back in 2019.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As VGC reports, the new Virtual Boy accessory works in an identical manner to Nintendo Labo VR, essentially acting as a shell with a pair of lenses for your Switch screen. (And yes, you can remove those red Virtual Boy lenses.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Viewing the four classic Switch games in their VR modes, players are treated to a VR effect, and can look around naturally by moving their head — which is tracked by the console's motion sensors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does Nintendo intend for you to use your new Virtual Boy accessory this way? It's debatable. On the one hand, using the actual Virtual Boy accessory for this is a little difficult, since it is designed to sit on a flat surface, removing your ability to look around easily. On the other, VGC notes that Breath of the Wild's Switch 2 upgrade retains its VR mode option, so perhaps this was the plan all along. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo will officially launch its Virtual Boy Nintendo Classics collection next week on February 17, which you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription on either Switch or Switch 2 to access. You'll also need a Virtual Boy ($99.99) or cardboard Virtual Boy ($24.99) accessory, sold via the My Nintendo Store. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Virtual Boy for Nintendo Switch</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As of next week, the Virtual Boy library will arrive with the following games:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Galactic Pinball</li><li>Teleroboxer</li><li>RED ALARM</li><li>Virtual Boy Wario Land</li><li>3-D Tetris</li><li>Golf</li><li>The Mansion of Innsmouth
</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Over time, Nintendo will then slowly launch more, including two games that previously never saw the light of day. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mario Clash</li><li>Mario's Tennis</li><li>Jack Bros.</li><li>Space Invaders Virtual Collection</li><li>Virtual Bowling</li><li>Vertical Force</li><li>V-Tetris</li><li>Zero Racers (previously unreleased)</li><li>D-Hopper (previously unreleased)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">"Would I recommend the average Nintendo fan drops $100 or even $25 to play these games? No, probably not," IGN wrote after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-on-switch-2-discovering-nintendos-greatest-failure">going face-on with the Virtual Boy accessories recently</a>. "There are only seven of them to play at launch, and they are more enjoyable from a historical perspective than an entertainment one. You could buy seven superior indie games for 100 bucks that come in more than just one color. But if you love exploring wacky bygones from past eras and want a really cool accessory to display in your game room, you’ll probably really like the new Virtual Boy like I did."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
