            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">New content, low price.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages"><u>Doom: The Dark Ages</u></a> remains one of the best shooters of 2025 so far, and it seems it’s only getting better with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/doom-the-dark-ages-official-update-2-launch-trailer">Update 2 dropping this week</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only does the update add new skins and bug fixes, but a new Ripatorium adds an infinite arena for, well, ripping through foes ad nauseum. Better yet, you can get this new and improved version of the Doom Slayer for under $45.</p><div catalogid="f10ff7c9-fbb2-44cb-aedd-75d98685c12a" id="226634"><div id="226634" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DOOM: The Dark Ages</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Best Buy is now offering a <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXMwL?object_uuid=3134d6ea-479e-4977-9db9-59158cd6bba7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$25 discount on Doom: The Dark Ages for PS5</a>, bringing the price down to just $44.99 from $69.99, and it’s a great time to jump in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the best price for a physical copy of the game from major online retailers right now, with Amazon OOS, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObmoj?object_uuid=3134d6ea-479e-4977-9db9-59158cd6bba7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart listing for $49</a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xME1?object_uuid=3134d6ea-479e-4977-9db9-59158cd6bba7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target down to $55.99 today</a> as well. For those looking to buy digitally, Dark Ages is also down to <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5wvlj?object_uuid=3134d6ea-479e-4977-9db9-59158cd6bba7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$52.99 for PS5</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what about that new update? Combat is always at the heart of DOOM, and the new Ripatorium in Update 2 lets you pick your opponents, the quantity of them, a time limit if you want to challenge yourself, and tweak respawn settings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or, just throw everything on and work to stay alive as long as you can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect from a game where the soundtrack is so core to the experience, you can choose the music for your showdowns, too, as well as your arena, with three to choose from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review"><u>In his review for IGN</u></a>, Mitchell Saltzman awarded The Dark Ages a 9 out of 10 score, and said “Doom: The Dark Ages may strip away the mobility focus of Doom Eternal, but replaces it with a very weighty and powerful style of play that is different from anything the series has done before, and still immensely satisfying in its own way.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should I Buy Now or Wait for Black Friday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It really depends on your preferences. In my opinion, Doom: The Dark Ages will likely be even cheaper by the time <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> rolls around. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At $45, it's still a significant saving with $25 off the MSRP. But, Black Friday could potentially hold even better discounts, if you can wait another three months to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My best guess is it will drop to $30-40 during the Black Friday sales that tend to kick off around the beginning of November. If you can hold out, you could find yourself with a better deal. There's also other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-sales-events">2025 sale events</a> like Prime Day in October, or any post Gamescom sales to consider as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, some folk are old enough to know you can pay yourself with time as well, so if you want to play Doom: The Dark Ages now, without having to pay the eye watering $70 price tag, there's nothing wrong with dropping $45 on a Game of the Year contender today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 8, 2025 11:42 am</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-ps5-discount-deal-new-official-update-2-patch]]></content:encoded>
