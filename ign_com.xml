If you’ve been looking to add to your setup, though, two new characters have been remade in plastic.</p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47oeL?object_uuid=902d9df5-351d-4491-b7a3-25f0fa877d96&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yawgmoth Funko Pop<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$14.99</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnOXy?object_uuid=902d9df5-351d-4491-b7a3-25f0fa877d96&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Urza Funko Pop<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$14.99</span></li></ul></div><h2 data-cy="title2">New Magic: The Gathering Funko Pops Hit Shelves Soon</h2><div catalogid="b225afdc-0be3-404f-b6f5-3d76915ebec0" id="226740"><div id="226740" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Yawgmoth Funko Pop</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Over at Amazon, two new listings have been added for <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnOXy?object_uuid=902d9df5-351d-4491-b7a3-25f0fa877d96&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Urza</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47oeL?object_uuid=902d9df5-351d-4491-b7a3-25f0fa877d96&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Yawgmoth</u></a>. Both are available to preorder for $14.99, with release planned for November 9.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two have fought a long war between the former’s plane of Dominaria and the latter’s Phyrexian plane, but curiously, Mishra (Urza’s brother) is nowhere to be seen this time around.</p></div><div catalogid="b225afdc-0be3-404f-b6f5-3d76915ebec0" id="226741"><div id="226741" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Urza Funko Pop</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone sat next to a few of the older Funkos from the Magic set, I must say I am somewhat tempted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Away from Funkos, it’s been a busy year for Magic: The Gathering.

So, if Funko Pops aren’t your thing, they could be worth a look instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 11, 2025 5:00 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/more-magic-the-gathering-funko-pops-are-on-their-way-and-amazon-preorders-are-open]]></content:encoded>
