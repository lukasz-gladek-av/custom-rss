            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Thieves keen to steal Pokémon cards have struck again in Southern California, turning over a Burbank store and taking more than $100,000 of stock.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The robbery is just the latest in a string of similar incidents across the region, <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/burglars-ransack-burbank-card-shop-steal-100000-worth-of-rare-trading-cards/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KTLA5</a> reports, where three masked figures were seen raiding card shops and escaping within minutes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">LA Sports Cards' Burbank shop was hit last week, on December 2, in a high-speed theft that was over in just three minutes. During that time, the thieves crowbarred open the outlet's door and made multiple trips to a waiting vehicle, all while carrying armfuls of Pokémon merchandise.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>NEW: Burglars ransack card shop and steal $100,000 worth of rare Pokémon and sports cards</p><p>The owner believes the thieves knew exactly where the merchandise was and planned the job ahead of time</p><p>They got away with about $100,000 in merchandise</p><p>Police believe the same crew may… <a href="https://t.co/zMIurJ86U9" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zMIurJ86U9</a></p></div>— Unlimited L's (@unlimited_ls) <a href="https://twitter.com/unlimited_ls/status/1997451668946895184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"[For the] vast majority, they were targeting Pokémon cards," store owner Kiet Nguyen said. "They did take some locked boxes from the back that had sports cards... They were targeting liquid assets, Pokémon is so easy to sell these days that sealed product, everyone has it. So it wouldn't raise any suspicion if someone was to sell it, it's available everywhere."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside new Pokémon decks and collectible sets, the thieves also got away with a handful of rare sports items including a signed Ronaldo card. But it's clear that Pokémon cards were the key draw — with suggestion that this gang has struck several times before.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It seemed like they had it down pat," Nguyen continued. "They knew what they were doing... We thought this was a very safe, secure, very busy street. We had preventive measures in place, we thought the deterrance was good enough."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">KTLA5 stated that the group were now suspected to be behind "half a dozen" similar store raids within Southern California in recent weeks — during which, one of the trio had his face partially caught on CCTV. Police have appealed for anyone with further information to contact the Burbank Police Department on 818-238-3000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This recent spate of thefts is just the latest example of how Pokémon cards are now considered high-value goods by thieves. In December 2024, it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/japanese-crime-syndicates-reportedly-launder-money-using-pokmon-cards">reported that Japanese crime syndicates were now using Pokémon cards to launder money</a>. And in the US, this is just the latest incident <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-caught-on-camera-stealing-35000-pokmon-cards-get-mocked-by-store-staff">similar</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-allegedly-steal-315000-worth-of-pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-in-targeted-attack">many</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-allegedly-steal-70000-worth-of-pokmon-cards-after-asking-store-staff-which-were-valuable">others</a> over the past 12 months. Until Pokémon's popularity fades — and there's no sign it'll do that anytime soon, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-teraleak-reveals-unannounced-games-seemingly-laying-out-franchises-major-releases-through-2030">with a big new wave of games expected next year</a> — it seems likely this will continue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I think it was the right call."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy's Cloud has one of the most recognizable weapons in gaming history, but the Final Fantasy 7 Remake team actually considered resizing his iconic Buster Sword to make it more realistic before deciding to stick with the original design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKxyZ5DsgSs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>interview</u></a> alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><u>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</u></a> director Guillaume Broche, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a> director Naoki Hamaguchi opened up about the decision, admitting that while rescaling Cloud's sword did come up, "it was just too iconic" to change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While making Remake, there was this aspect of the weight and how Cloud swings it around with one hand that sort of felt like it would weaken the sense of realism, you know?" Hamaguchi said, according to a translation by a Final Fantasy fan account on <a href="https://x.com/ShinraArch/status/1997787393253118017/photo/1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter</u></a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/square-enix-director-naoki-hamaguchi-considered-giving-cloud-strife-a-more-realistic-sword-for-final-fantasy-7-remake-but-decided-jrpg-fans-wouldnt-accept-it-we-stayed-faithful-to-the-og/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GR+</u></a>).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So at the time, when we were making Remake, there was some discussion about whether we should give Cloud a more realistic version of the Buster Sword," Hamaguchi added. "But it was just too iconic, and if we'd made it just a regular old sword, players wouldn't accept it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He closed, stressing: "In the end we stayed faithful to the OG. A whole new generation of people fell in love with it, so I think it was the right call."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the latest on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3"><u>Final Fantasy Remake Part 3</u></a>? Well, in the same interview, Hamaguchi teased that the "core game experience is almost complete," and while he "really want[s] everyone to play it as soon as possible," the team has now moved on to "refining and polishing."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Weirdest Things That Happened in the Original Final Fantasy 7</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, he also warned the team "never intended to make all three parts feel like the same game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As the director, I feel a very strong sense of the game’s final form," the director said. "Honestly, I really want everyone to play it as soon as possible, but of course, since it’s a game, it needs to be carefully crafted before it can be delivered to players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Once we go through this phase properly, we’ll be able to present it in a form we’re satisfied with. So I ask everyone to wait just a little longer, and we’ll be able to share more information soon."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, he also teased that "Highwind" will be an important keyword for the third instalment. "As for the third part, introducing new gameplay experiences and a new scale is key to successfully delivering the project to players. 'Highwind' is certainly an important keyword here, there's no doubt about that," he teased. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Briana White, the actress who portrays Aerith in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake"><u>Final Fantasy 7</u></a>, has called on fans to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7s-aerith-has-had-enough-of-creeps-tagging-voice-actors-with-smut-featuring-their-characters"><u>stop tagging voice artists in spicy material featuring their characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <title><![CDATA[After Almost a Decade, Pokémon Go Delights Fans by Finally Adding Remote Trading — and for Now, There Are No Strings Attached]]></title>

            <guid>1376941</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> now finally lets players trade creatures from afar — a feature that fans have wanted for almost a decade. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Pokémon Go launched in 2016, the game has been hesitant to allow gameplay that does not encourage players to meet up in person. Remote raiding was only added to the game during the era of Covid lockdowns, and trading has remained locked within a small location radius — until now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remote trading will still require some work to unlock, with the feature available when in-game friends hit a fresh, fifth interaction tier — Forever Friends — that will require a couple of months more levelling beyond Best Friends (though this can be heavily reduced by completing Weekly Challenges).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once Forever Friends, you'll get to make a Remote Trade — and there's a clever system for selecting three creatures you'd be happy to swap, while picking one from your friends' selection. Only when both parties are happy with the matchup will the trade take place. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Subsequent Remote Trades will then require a similar wait to unlock again, but this length of time is not terrible — it will give more of a chance to roll the Lucky Friends status, and for many, Remote Trading will be most useful for existing Lucky Friends in other countries who have been sat with that status in place for years. Another positive change includes a major increase in friend list size, from 450 to 650. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hot damn!" wrote Plus-Pomegranate8045 on Pokémon Go reddit TheSilphRoad. "Huge shout out to whoever it was at Niantic/Scopely that got this pushed through." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Finally, I can trade with the guy ive been lucky friends with for 4 years," added another fan, Abject-Sector-2167. "He lives on the other side of the globe."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, not everyone is happy. "Welp, that's just ruined the point of regionals," wrote HappyTimeHollis. "This sucks."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon Go Safari Zone in Yokosuka, Japan</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Months of datamines have suggested that Remote Trading has been in the works for some time, and initially fans had expected more of a system that required payment via in-game currency to use the feature. Its arrival now, as simply another part of free gameplay, has been greeted warmly. Though, of course, there remains the possibility that some new mechanic might be introduced in future to speed the process up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, though, the announcement of Remote Trading is being received positively. Levelling up to Forever Friends is now live for the game's loyal audience in New Zealand, where new features are regularly tested first, before it is rolled out more widely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
