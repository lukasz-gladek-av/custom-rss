Neither Nintendo nor The Pokémon Company have responded to IGN's request for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Funnily enough they took the bait," CentroLeaks posted this morning, stating that The Pokémon Company was behind the removal of numerous images that appeared to detail upcoming projects, including next year's unannounced but highly-anticipated "Gen 10" Switch 2 games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Mr. Takato Utsunomiya, the Chief Operating Officer of The Pokémon Company, has personally sent an email to Centro Leaks / X to take down the Pokémon leak images," another <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978956584966381833" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> by the account stated, later <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978966734452248960" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing</a> what appeared to be a formal demand for a long list of posts to be removed as they contained "copyrighted works (illustrations) of the characters from the Pokémon video game series... reproduced and distributed to the public without our permission."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details of a further set of Mega Pokémon coming in Legends Z-A's $20 DLC are among the images that have been removed, the account noted. "I guess Game Freak also confirmed the returning Pokémon list in the Legends: Z-A DLC is real," CentroLeaks <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978974832873156877" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">New Mega Pokemon in Legends: Z-A</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other removed images included concept art and early screenshots purported to show various upcoming Pokémon projects, including the Gen 10 games, a third Pokémon Legends title, and an ambitious sounding concept for a Pokémon game spanning multiple regions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Attention to CentroLeaks' account has been so widespread that fan art has already started to spring up of Pokémon species shown in the leaked art, likely years before any official reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, as IGN has stated previously, it is worth treating all of the details leaked online this week with a measure of caution, amid claims that some logos were in fact fan-made, and a general acknowledgement that all of the information is now a year out of date at the very least. Game Freak's servers were breached in August 2024, and The Pokémon Company's plans may have since changed, with specific concepts or indeed entire projects potentially scrapped altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have previously <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-requests-subpoena-of-discord-to-track-down-user-behind-last-years-pokemon-teraleak">attempted to track down the culprit behind the original Teraleak</a>, though seemingly have not had much success, judging by the huge spread of further details online this week. As for CentroLeaks, the account's owner does not seem particularly concerned by either company, despite their infamously litgious nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of writing, the most recent update on the CentroLeaks account is a retweet of a previous <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1846952727269798029" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> from 2024, which simply states: "if only he knew that laws don't exist in Peru."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">review-in-progress of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is now live, if you want to check out our impressions of the first 24 hours, with a full review coming next week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We hope to not have that kind of thing happen."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The fear that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a> might tank its reputation with a dodgy finale was a concern for the show's cast, star Finn Wolfhard has admitted, after seeing Game of Thrones' final season brutally "torn to shreds."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://time.com/7324811/stranger-things-season-5/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time</a>, Wolfhard mentioned the widespread reaction to Game of Thrones' final episodes as an example of how a long-running big-budget TV series can build up enormous expectations for its hotly anticipated climax — then spark enormous backlash after failing to deliver.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Negative reaction to Game of Thrones' final season still dominates discussion around the show, following widespread criticism of its plot, pacing and sudden character developments. Many fans blamed the uneven final season on the series' creators running out of book material to adapt, while others have suggested the series simply tried to do too much in too few episodes. Regardless, it has become a model that other series, clearly, do not want to follow.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think everyone was pretty worried, honestly," Wolfhard said.  "The way that Game of Thrones got torn to shreds in that final season, we're all walking into this going, 'We hope to not have that kind of thing happen.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not that Wolfhard is suggesting Stranger Things will wrap up its own run with a similarly polarizing finale — far from it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Then we read the scripts," Wolfhard continued, saying that the show's cast now felt reassured. "We knew that it was something special."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Stranger Things: Everything We Know About the Upside Down</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Stranger Things' fifth and final season will launch on Netflix with four episodes on November 26, before a further three episodes arrive on Christmas Day, December 25. The series' feature-length finale will then release on New Year's Eve, December 31, wrapping up the show's supernatural saga after almost a decade. No pressure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After all that, will this really be the end of Stranger Things? Of course not. Netflix already has plans for animated series and at least one spinoff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, fans learned that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-we-have-to-now-stranger-things-season-5-will-finally-explain-the-series-biggest-mystery-showrunners-confirm">Stranger Things' final episodes will wrap up one long-standing mystery</a> around the series — what the Upside Down actually <em>is</em>. So that's something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Rich Polk/Variety via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
