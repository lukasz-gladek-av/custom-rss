            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> community has asked for bigger Conquest maps for months, so someone made their own – and they're actually pretty popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have spent the time since launch asking EA and Battlefield Studios for everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-to-revert-aim-assist-settings-as-pc-players-edit-files-to-turn-off-crossplay">aim assist tweaks</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-won-battlefield-6-fans-rejoice-as-ea-tones-down-bright-colors-on-monster-energy-skin">realistic skins</a>, but few conversations have stolen the spotlight quite like the discussion around map sizes. While some players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more">went to great lengths to determine if Battlefield 6 maps are as small as they look</a> and others <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-steam-reviews-as-battlefield-6-players-push-for-battle-pass-changes-and-bigger-maps">took to review-bombing</a>, the more creative individuals are using Battlefield Portal and REDSEC to make larger maps of their own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to work from Reddit users kurtinthegrind and andy_6170 (a.k.a. ViperAndyStudios), the Battlefield 6 community now has Club House, a large-scale Conquest play area that pulls elements from REDSEC’s Southern California-set Fort Lyndon map for an (unofficial) version of the kind of wide-open spaces they’ve been asking for. There are also Tech Center and Operation Tech Center map options, with the former set up as a large-scale, infantry-focused Conquest map, while the latter offers linear gameplay centered around one main building.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The credit to the original version of Tech Center and the Conquest Script belongs to Andy,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1on9ras/two_new_br_maps_with_three_conquest_gamemodes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kurtinthegrind says</a>, “though I've made a few modifications to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Club House and the smaller version of Tech Center are my creations, and honestly, I'm not too proud of them. But until Ripple Effect/Battlefield Studios provides improved Portal support and releases ALL parts of Battle Royale map, these will have to suffice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both bot and bot-less versions of the Club House and Tech Center maps are currently available for players to create servers, but it’s Club House that’s attracting the most attention online. In the middle of a Wednesday, the map, also known as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oovku6/golf_course_is_the_best_bf6_map/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golf Course</a>, boasts a few hundred active players across different server browsers in Battlefield 6, with some 64-player servers populated almost entirely with real people.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/img-4639-1762378638374.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 Portal Club House Conquest Map Page. Image captured in-game by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We played a few matches on Club House and noticed that, even with around 30 players on each team, combat encounters feel spread out, with infantry required to sprint long distances to reach each Conquest objective without redeploying. Everything from small vehicles like golf carts to attack helicopters and tanks can help with travel, too, with above-average ticket sizes and a relatively large play area resulting in more room for vehicle warfare and lengthy matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is brilliant," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1on9ras/comment/nmv6sa1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popular comment</a> says. "Fingers crossed they actually put these on the official map rotation. For now, I’ll just mess around with my squad."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s certainly a change of pace when compared to other, standard Conquest maps, and it’s an experience those playing on Club House seem to enjoy. Our short time with real-world players saw the in-game chat filled with comments praising the map for its long, clear sightlines and vehicular combat potential.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fingers crossed they actually put these on the official map rotation. For now, I’ll just mess around with my squad.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Portal game modes – Club House Conquest included – have dedicated fans, even if a modified XP rate means significantly slower progression for all. One Battlefield 6 player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ooadm9/for_the_first_time_i_felt_like_i_could_breathe_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to Reddit</u></a> after trying the mode for themselves, saying, “for the first time, I felt like I could breathe in this game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are too many small, cramped, and poorly designed maps in this game, and I never had much opportunity to play normally without constantly confronting opponents in narrow alleys or buildings,” the popular post says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think there should be maps like in BF3/4, small, medium, but also large - I know I haven't discovered anything new, everyone has been saying this since the game's release, but we need to keep talking about it until we finally get some comment on the matter.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some have already begun calling for these fan-made maps to join official Battlefield 6 playlists, others argue the emergeance of Club House and other similarly large Conquest maps only serve as proof that Portal is working just as the developers intended. For now, it's unclear if Portal experiences like this could get a bigger spotlight from BF Studios.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although BF Studios has yet to confirm just how big future Battlefield 6 maps will be, we do know that much, much more is on the way. The first post-launch map, Blackwell Fields, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-map-blackwell-fields-in-the-firing-line-as-players-report-being-killed-from-as-far-away-as-enemy-hq-spawn-points">met with criticism from fans</a>, but another new map called Eastwood is just weeks away. Both locations are included as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-trailer-highlights-blackwell-fields-and-eastwood-maps-ahead-of-next-weeks-launch">Season 1</a>, with more content set to follow in the months ahead as future seasons roll out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Battlefield 6 and REDSEC, you can read IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-review">REDSEC review in progress</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has discussed last year's intense backlash to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and said the unexpected conversation shift "from gameplay to ideology" led directly to its high-profile delay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking during a recent event at Paris Games Week, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameFile</a>, Guillemot screened a short internal video Ubisoft had created to narrate its response to the backlash surrounding Shadows' Black samurai co-protagonist Yasuke — <a href="https://in.ign.com/assassins-creed-shadows/208502/news/assassins-creed-shadows-dev-addresses-musks-tweet-on-yasuke" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which even saw Tesla and X boss Elon Musk getting involved</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Guillemot has now stated that the level of vitriol required Ubisoft to rethink its plans for Shadows — back then, set for launch in November 2024. Ultimately, the company elected to delay the game until March 2025, a decision explained last year as necessary to "polish" the game further. But, behind the scenes, Guillemot says the firm understood it needed to bolster fan sentiment to ensure the game launched to a more positive response.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With more time to improve the game, Ubisoft gave itself the opportunity to share more with fans pre-launch, Guillemot said, something the company hoped would both impress long-term Assassin's Creed aficionados, and move the conversation around Shadows on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we saw is that, by allowing our fans to see in the game — everything they were going to be able to rediscover — of what they love about Assassin's Creed, [that] ultimately helped to combat this aggression, which is linked to the fact that video games have a very strong impact on the people who play them," Guillemot said. "They’re kind of caught between 'I want to play, and what interests me is self-expression within a game' and 'there is a cultural message that comes with the video game.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So our goal is really to be able to ensure that our fans discover and defend what they expect from our games," Guillemot continued. "It very quickly eliminated the fights, which were just fake fights."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an internal video, also shown last week, Ubisoft described its response as a successful turnaround of public opinion on a game featuring a pre-launch crisis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What happens when a legendary franchise reveals one of its most anticipated experiences," the video begins, "only to become the game everyone loves to hate? When conversation shifts from gameplay to ideology? When everything you say only adds fuel to the fire?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In September 2024, we had our backs against the wall, and that's when it clicked," the video continues. "To get out of the corner, we had to stop focusing on those who hated us. We had to start firing up our allies. So we stopped trying to win the argument, and leaned on what had carried us for 18 years: The Assassin's Creed brand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We started by doing the last thing anyone would have advised. We delayed the game. The extra time allowed the devs to polish, optimize, and reach the high standards fans expect from an Assassin's Creed game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It also gave us time to rebuild the Assassin’s Creed brand pact, putting the markers of the franchise back at the center. More hood, more stealth, more leap of faith, more lore. So we could show that the spirit of Assassin’s Creed lives on in Shadows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Instead of fearing leaks, we showed the game," Ubisoft concluded. "Fans came back, conversations started shifting, and everyone who built, played, and loved this game could be proud again."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The framing of the delay as a positive response to the game's backlash is an interesting one, though one which feels limited considering what we already know from other reports detailing events at the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a> reported that the game's delay had been widely expected within the company "and desperately needed" to address feedback from playtests and mock reviews (a standard industry practice where external consultants size-up projects before copies are given to press).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking in December last year</a>, former Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté suggested similar, saying that the game's delay was necessary to change the "narrative" of Ubisoft's "inconsistency in quality" (just months after the company's fellow blockbuster Star Wars Outlaws underperformed).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, perhaps most notably, there's no mention here by Guillemot of the fact that Ubisoft's plans to delay Shadows came alongside a decision to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-set-during-post-civil-war-period-canceled-last-year-due-to-increasing-concerns-over-us-political-climate-report">reportedly cancel a separate Assassin's Creed game set in post-Civil War America</a> — a project that would have featured a former slave as its main character. While still in pre-production, the game's fate was apparently sealed after Ubisoft judged the idea too risky to continue amid the current U.S. political landscape — and, to a lesser extent, after having seen the Yasuke backlash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed Shadows has gone on to sell "in line with expectations," Ubisoft said in July, with 5 million copies sold so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Shroud has called on his fans to vote for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> as Game of the Year 2025 over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, calling multiplayer gamers “the minority.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Canadian Michael ‘Shroud’ Grzesiek, who specializes in competitive multiplayer first-person shooters, is a former professional Counter-Strike player who has built an enormous online audience. With 6.8 million subscribers on YouTube and 11.3 million followers on Twitch, his call to action has significant weight behind it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shroud has thrown himself into Embark Studios’ Arc Raiders ever since its explosive launch, and in a recent <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2610645158" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch stream</a> mobilized his community to vote for the game when it comes to The Game Awards 2025.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/gettyimages-1054359868-1762430155403.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Shroud wants Arc Raiders to win Game of the Year 2025. Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We gotta make sure that this game wins game of the year, by the way,” he said. “Do not let that Expedition game win game of the year. Do not let it. Absolutely do not. We all have to band together to make this game win. Us multiplayer gamers are the minority, okay. We are the minority being multiplayer gamers, but I believe we can win. I believe. You just need to tell everybody. I’ve never voted for anything ever, but I think I’m going to vote this year for this game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the end of 2025 in sight, Sandfall's single-player role-playing game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has emerged as a frontrunner for Game of the Year, but Arc Raiders is being touted by some as a strong contender. Other candidates include Hades 2, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Blue Prince, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, among others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does Shroud’s comment about multiplayer gamers being in the “minority” ring true? Research from last year indicated that most gamers prefer single-player games, but there's a significant difference in preference depending on the age bracket. <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/most-gamers-prefer-single-player-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midia Research</a> found that under 25s preferred multiplayer to single-player, with younger generations emphasising social play. But as you get older and it becomes harder to arrange time to play with friends, this preference shifts towards single-player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Younger players prefer PVP, which captures a large swathe of consumer attention and engagement and is enjoyed by all generations,” Midia Research’s Rhys Elliott said in the report. “Convincing players — and their friends — to leave for new titles is a huge barrier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Live-service games are the homes of many highly engaged players. Getting them (and their friends) to relocate permanently to another live-service game is a big ask.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When people talk about the most popular video games in the world, multiplayer games tend to dominate. Roblox games that blow up, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/grow-a-garden">Grow a Garden</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/steal-a-brainrot">Steal a Brainrot</a>, typically have a strong community element to them despite not being traditional competitive multiplayer. Fortnite is a multiplayer game through and through. Minecraft can be played either way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The dominant games on Steam, meanwhile, are competitive multiplayer: Counter-Strike, Dota 2, PUBG, Battlefield 6, and Apex Legends are, at the time of this article's publication, the top five most-played games on Valve's platform. And let’s not forget the likes of World of Warcraft and League of Legends, both of which are multiplayer games. There are huge single-player games, of course, but when it comes to sheer popularity, or monthly active users, free-to-play multiplayer games dominate the industry.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In any case, Shroud went on to claim that voting in The Game Awards doesn’t matter. “All the f***ing awards are rigged anyway, who cares?” he said in the same stream. “When have you ever seen an award that’s actually legit?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Geoff Keighley’s The Game Awards uses a combination of votes from the games media and influencers and public fan voting. The voting jury has in the past had more of an influence on the outcome. Keighley has said he’s considered going all in on public voting for The Game Awards, but expressed concerns about “social engineering.” It’s worth noting that The Game Awards has a purely fan-voted category called Players’ Voice. The Game Awards 2025 nominees are expected mid-November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Houser was lead writer on it, as he was for almost all Rockstar’s games. But <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-co-founder-leaves-company-dan-houser-red-dead-redemption-gta">having left the company over five years ago</a>, Houser recently confirmed to IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dan-houser-says-gta-6-will-be-great-but-thinks-the-world-probably-had-enough-gta-from-me-in-first-comments-since-leaving-rockstar">GTA 6 won’t have a story or a character set he developed</a>, but expects the game to be great nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=kMAZuzpS5Xxkb3mm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with the Lex Fridman podcast</a>, Houser has indicated that he’d have stronger feelings when Rockstar inevitably returns to Red Dead Redemption with a follow-up.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Of course, letting go of something I worked on in one way or another for like 20 odd years, and wrote on them for the last 10 or 11 that came out, wrote all of them, or you know, lead writer on all of them, whatever it was… letting go of that is a big change. And sad in a way,” Houser said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because each of the [Grand Theft Auto] games was a kind of standalone story it’s not quite the same as… I think probably it would be in some ways sadder if someone continued on Red Dead, because it was a cohesive two-game arc. That might be more sad to hear someone working on that. But again, that will probably happen too. I don't own the IP. That was part of the deal. It's a privilege to work on stuff, but you don't necessarily own it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is Red Dead Redemption 3 an inevitability? Houser seems to think the Red Dead Redemption series will continue, but it’s worth noting that the series began with Red Dead Revolver in 2004, so perhaps Rockstar will create a new sub-series if and when it decides the time is right for more Red Dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, in 2023, Roger Clark, who played Arthur Morgan, the main playable protagonist of Red Dead Redemption 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arthur-morgan-actor-certain-rockstar-will-make-red-dead-redemption-3-eventually">said he was “certain” fans will see Red Dead Redemption 3 “one day,”</a> but qualified that statement by saying he had no idea when that would be. Clark also ruled out the return of Arthur Morgan in the game, should it come to be. If you’ve played Red Dead Redemption 2, this might seem like stating the obvious, but there’s always the chance Rockstar may consider another prequel of some kind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m certain we will see Red Redemption 3 one day,” Clark said. “When that will be — I have absolutely no idea. Don’t count on Arthur’s involvement either. His story has been told, I feel.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/before-rockstar-i-was-just-a-jobbing-actor-off-broadway-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-on-the-red-dead-redemption-2-effect">a subsequent interview with IGN</a>, Clark expanded on his thoughts: “Yeah, that got really picked up! I would have thought that was obvious though. Wouldn’t you? And it’s not like I have any insider information whatsoever, but of course there’s going to be another Red Dead. It sold over 60 million copies!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two said it himself. He said GTA and Red Dead are prominent franchises for Rockstar Games and that they will be returning to them in the future. So there’s no doubt there will be another Red Dead. But if Arthur Morgan will be involved? I highly doubt it, to be honest. And I think it’s going to be quite some time before we even see a snifter of anything new Red Dead related. I have no idea how it would pan out, but I wouldn’t bet on Arthur being a part of it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, the focus very much is on GTA 6, due out May 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The boss of the Kingdom Come: Deliverance games has reviewed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and in doing so has issued a number of stinging criticisms of Obsidian’s sci-fi RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Daniel Vavra, co-founder of Warhorse Studios and lead writer of the much-loved RPGs Kingdom Come: Deliverance and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1985848222707765440" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to say he’d finished The Outer Worlds 2 and settled on a 7/10 review score (check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-review">The Outer Worlds 2 review</a> to find out what we thought).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a decent score for any video game, but expanding his thoughts, Vavra criticized The Outer Worlds 2 and Microsoft-owned developer, Obsidian Entertainment, for fasiling to innovate in the RPG space.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the review in full:</p><blockquote>Finished. 7/10. But what I find sad is that the company and the people who gave us one of my favorite games ever (Fallout &amp; New Vegas) have been unable, even after 15 years and with all of Microsoft's money and latest technological advances, to come up with a single new game mechanic that could take this proven but ancient formula somewhere new.  Can any of you think of a single new game mechanic in The Outer Worlds that wasn't already in Deus Ex or the original Fallout games more than 25 years ago? Unfortunately, I can't. Give me a living, simulated world! True non-linearity! Give me something more than loot boxes, maintenance shafts, loading screens and level grinding in a static scripted world.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth unpacking Vavra’s comment. His first point is an accusation that Obsidian, creator of the beloved Fallout: New Vegas, has failed to significantly evolve its "ancient formula," despite the backing of moneybags Microsoft. He claims The Outer Worlds (I assume he means The Outer Worlds 2 here) doesn’t have a single new game mechanic that wasn’t already in Deus Ex or the original Fallout games more than 25 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is that true? Some people are pointing to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-outer-worlds-2/All_Flaws">The Outer Worlds 2’s Flaw system</a>, which sees the game dish out game-changing perks that can benefit your character but always hinder them in some way, as an eye-catching new feature for this type of RPG. In a later social media post, Vavra said Fallout had Traits with negative aspects, calling this Flaw system “nothing new.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But is that fair? The Outer Worlds 2’s Flaw system is getting a lot of love from players not just for their impact on playstyle, but the way they’re unlocked. As you play the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-outer-worlds-2/Best_Flaws_to_Pick_and_Reject">you’ll occasionally trigger a Flaw opportunity</a>, with the game itself reacting to the way you’re playing by delivering some really fun perks that are a delight to encounter. For example, if you crouch walk a lot you’ll be offered the Bad Knees Flaw, which makes you crouch walk faster but every time you stand up your knees crack, making a noise guards might hear. I won’t spoil all the Flaws here because part of the fun is in their discovery, but I will say it feels like there is a DM behind the scenes, observing your playstyle and occasionally dipping into the action to add some spice to your experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are pointing to the way Obsidian lets players unlock unique dialogue options not just by having a high speech skill, but by seeking out information which can then be brought into conversations to gain an advantage. Your character will remember "discovered info” you’ve found from, say, terminals or chats with other NPCs or examining things, and you’ll get the chance to use it in conversation when it counts. It’s a cool system that adds depth to the standard, straight-forward speech-driven dialogue experience you see in a lot of RPGs, and it makes you want to go out into the world and learn more before having the big quest convos, like the space detective I like role-playing as.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vavra continues: “Give me a living, simulated world! True non-linearity! Give me something more than loot boxes, maintenance shafts, loading screens and level grinding in a static scripted world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, Vavra’s assessment of The Outer Worlds 2 perhaps rings true. The game’s mini-open worlds can feel static and scripted in the sense that they do not revolve around a simulation. The Outer Worlds 2 is not a game similar in scope or style to one of Bethesda’s big RPGs. It is not Fallout: New Vegas, even, more a game that rekindles memories of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And scope is something Obsidian openly talks about. It is one of the most prolific studios Microsoft has, having released three new games this year alone: Avowed, Grounded 2, and The Outer Worlds 2. It is a developer that has learnt to focus when it comes to scope, to drill down, and to ship games that are manageable to play and, I suspect, manageable to develop. Obsidian isn’t doing a The Elder Scrolls 6 here. It’s carved out a style all its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So The Outer Worlds 2 was never going to be a game with a living, simulated world. Whether that disappoints you or not probably comes down to your expectations for modern Obsidian games. But I’d say it was pretty obvious what The Outer Worlds 2 was going to be, not just based on previews, but on the studio’s previous games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what about Vavra’s “all of Microsoft’s money” comment? Sure, Microsoft has significant resources, but the business reality is — reportedly — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-has-reportedly-pushed-xbox-studios-to-deliver-a-30-profit-margin-allegedly-leading-to-all-those-layoffs-canceled-projects-price-rises-and-the-end-of-exclusives">that Xbox studios are under more pressure to deliver profits</a>. Part of doing that will be bringing more money in while keeping development as low as possible. It does not feel like Xbox studios have a magic money tap to make their dream games come true.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vavra’s comments have certainly hit a nerve online, and have sparked a debate about what Obsidian is trying to do when it comes to video game development. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-knows-whenever-it-announces-a-new-game-everyone-asks-about-fallout-new-vegas-2-but-it-loves-making-original-ip-and-sequels-to-them">It recently acknowledged that fans desperately want it to make Fallout: New Vegas 2</a>, a game that would probably come with the kind of expectations Vavra has for the studio, but it’s enjoying creating new IP and building those franchises out with sequels, which is what The Outer Worlds 2 is all about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It should be clear by now that Obsidian’s focus is on actually releasing games that are consistently good and don’t necessarily need to be huge hits to be successful. In the current climate, perhaps that’s an approach that makes a lot of sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
