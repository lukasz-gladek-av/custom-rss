In a statement on Discord, user nkjellman said "Due to the unexpected attention that our project received and after speaking with Rockstar Games, we  have decided to take down the Liberty City Preservation Project."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>There's a new mod on the block for GTAV "Liberty City Preservation Project", I tried out the mod. It's AMAZING, it has a working subway network, the police and ambient traffic are faithful and it's so polished. </p><p>Amazing work to the team of devs who worked on this! <a href="https://t.co/aLLtOMvwsc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aLLtOMvwsc</a></p></div>— Ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/1873944250431529122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 31, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar is well-known for asking modders to take down various mods like this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-ai-powered-gta-5-story-mode-mod-unlikely-to-fight-back-against-take-two-after-shutdown">AI-powered GTA 5 story mode mod</a>, or a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-5-red-dead-redemption-2-vr-mod-takedown-notice">VR mod for Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. The Liberty City Preservation Project take down is also not without direct precedent as Rockstar issued a take-down for a mod that tried to recreate <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/vice-city-remastered-mod-in-gta-5-ign-plays">Grand Theft Auto Vice City within GTA 5</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One interesting development is that while Rockstar is judicious when it comes to taking down mods, they also sometimes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-hires-a-team-of-modders-it-had-previously-banned-from-playing-gta-5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hire those very modders</a> to work at Rockstar Games. And some mods, like the Vice City mod, were taken down only for Rockstar themselves to announce remasters of those very games. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't to say Rockstar is working on a GTA 4 remaster, by any means, but there's certainly precedent. Still it may be years away before we get an answer as we know Rockstar is currently hard at work trying to ready the highly-anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 for a 2025 launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And returning from previous installments is Axis Invasion mode, which lets you invade another player’s campaign as an enemy to take them down.
