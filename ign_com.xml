I like the weird, eye-catching Garden Walk set myself.</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aepYVW?object_uuid=e7995b0a-bb02-40fb-a3bb-1ca158c6f008&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><strong>Thunder of Dragons Metal Dice Set</strong></u></a> - As beautiful as they are impractical, this dragon-smothered, hollow set of dice look awesome and reviews say they perplexingly roll well to boot.

If you’re like me, you won’t be able to understand the descriptions, but the photos say it all.</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6qOZ?object_uuid=e7995b0a-bb02-40fb-a3bb-1ca158c6f008&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><strong>Olive Green Stripe Wood Dice Set</strong></u></a> - I like these dice for elves, druids, and other woodland-friendly PCs who want a wooden, green-dyed set of dice to really showcase their love of nature.

Beadle &amp; Grimm’s Platinum Edition Box Sets</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking up one of these premium campaign sets is a delightfully self-serving option to give to your DM. These are packed with premium maps, miniatures, handouts, and props that support specific campaigns. That includes recent additions like <em>Adventures in the Multiverse</em> and <em>Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk</em>. Each set costs hundreds of dollars, but hey, you can always ask your fellow PCs to chip in.</p><div catalogid="76e35bff-0297-4ea0-a9bf-d09ec78827fe" id="210752"><div id="210752" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Beadle &amp; Grimm’s Platinum Edition Box Sets</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">2. Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Red Dragon’s Tale LEGO Set</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This 2,000+ piece LEGO set commemorates D&amp;D’s 50th anniversary (and so could very easily go on that list as well), but at more than $350, it certainly sits squarely in the high-end space. This set includes some really neat stuff, like a dragon, owlbear, beholder, and gelatinous cube, as well as some preset PCs for you to control. LEGO can be a bit pricey, but this set is still cheaper than most battlemats and painted miniatures!

Damascus Steel True Metal Dice</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This incredibly beautiful, absurdly luxury set of dice is forged from the same steel alloy found in the weapons of soldiers in a bygone age. The impressive swirl patterns and attention to detail are sure to zhuzh up any table – as they well should at a $460 asking price.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 30, 2024 2:11 am</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Maybe even catching fish in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fisch-roblox">Fisch</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whichever “Roblox experience” has you or someone you know hooked, I’m sure it has microtransactions (things to spend real money on) in one form or another. Roblox gift cards can be converted into the Robux needed to make those purchases, and those gift cards happen to be included in Amazon's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Black Friday sales</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are slight discounts on digital gift cards, the best savings you can possibly get is by going physical: Right now, you can get <a href="https://zdcs.link/92bnVY?object_uuid=629e0141-5dfd-4b1f-a775-c8b0f7bf2b13&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a full $10 off $50 Roblox gift cards</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Roblox Black Friday Deal: $50 Gift Card for $40</h2><div catalogid="b9d778fc-984a-4acf-ab01-0de3d67a709b" id="212474"><div id="212474" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Roblox Physical Gift Card [Includes Free Virtual Item]</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Equivalent to 4500 Robux, redeemable worldwide</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re doing some holiday shopping over Black Friday, a physical Roblox gift card is an unbeatable stocking stuffer. Though, I have to admit, getting $50 worth of Robux at a $10 discount is something you could even gift to yourself. A $50 gift card is equivalent to about 4,500 Robux. By saving $10, you're basically getting 900 Robux for free. Act fast, however, because I'm sure this Lightning Deal will sell out quick. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on what month you redeem your Roblox gift card, you’ll also get a different free virtual item. In November, that gift is the Midnight Crimson Sombrero, but if you wait until December, you’ll get the Festive Deadpan Alpaca Head.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Does Roblox Have Its Own Black Friday Sale? </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox as a platform doesn’t have an "official" Black Friday sale, but you might find deals, discounts, and special events within specific experiences.

Glad to have been wrong on this one.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Garry's Mod (@gmodofficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/gmodofficial/status/1862466757589418048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Garry’s Mod was named the best-selling PC exclusive of all-time by the Guinness Book of Records, beating out the likes of World of Warcraft and its expansions. At the time, <a href="https://x.com/gmodofficial/status/1834185126206488932" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newman joked</a> that he'd “never imagined becoming a world record holder and not be prawn cocktail crisps related.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Garry's Mod lets you play with models from Valve games developed on the Source engine, and its enduring popularity has seen it remain in Steam’s top 100 most-played games list for years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, Newman said the “Skibidi Toilet guys” had hit him with a DMCA in a wild bit of litigious irony. But soon after, an account purporting to be Skibidi Toilet creator Alexey Gerasimov (DaFuq!?Boom) insisted he wasn’t behind the claim, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-modskibidi-toilet-dmca-claim-has-been-resolved-creator-garry-newman-says">Newman then told IGN that the matter had been “resolved.”</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The copyright holder the DMCA letter was attributed to was <a href="https://inviz.tv/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Invisible Narratives</u></a>, the film and TV production studio that’s partnering with Michael Bay <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skibidi-toilet-film-reportedly-in-the-works-from-michael-bay"><u>on a Skibidi Toilet film</u></a>. The letter cited Skibidi Toilet characters Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, and Titan TV Man, saying they were "all registered copyrights that are unique and representative of our brand." Sure enough, <a href="https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&amp;ti=1,1&amp;Search%5FArg=Titan%20Cameraman&amp;Search%5FCode=TALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=Gr6jPAL716R1MnV450HxzbpYaFF0b&amp;SEQ=20240730153403&amp;SID=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a public catalog search reveals</u></a> that Invisible Narratives had indeed claimed a copyright for Titan Cameraman and three other unpublished works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The letter added that “significant revenue is being generated by unauthorized Skibidi Toilet Garry's Mod games that are being advertised everywhere." The irony was not lost on Newman, who declared: “can you believe the cheek?” Skidibi Toilet, of course, is largely made with assets from Half-Life 2, and was originally created in Garry’s Mod.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garrys-mod-removing-all-nintendo-content-from-steam-workshop-after-takedown-request">Facepunch removed all Nintendo-related content on Garry's Mod</a> - what amounted to 20 years of uploads - from Steam Workshop after receiving a takedown request from Nintendo. Newman is currently working on a successor to Garry's Mod called S&amp;box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
