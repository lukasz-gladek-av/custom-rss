There are plenty of rumors going around regarding what will be shown during the February 4, 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET show, as players look forward to seeing what comes after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2"><u>Overwatch 2</u></a> Season 20: Vendetta.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/03/overwatch-talon-1-1770145039517.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/03/overwatch-talon-2-1770145042777.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Overwatch Taken Over by Talon. Image captured in-game by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As of last week, however, there is one big question on everyone’s mind: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1qp1ex6/yall_got_this_email_too/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Why did Talon take control of Overwatch</u></a>? Blizzard issued a hostile takeover hotfix last week, changing all iconography from the familiar Overwatch logo to that of the in-universe antagonist faction, Talon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been an unexpected, unexplained villain arc that’s continued through to today, with even official social media accounts affected by the changes. With confusion in the air, it would be strange if Blizzard <em>didn’t </em>talk about Talon during tomorrow’s showcase, so we’re hoping to find out what role it might play in Season 21.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Overwatch Spotlight is a shared moment with our community, for our community,” a recent <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24250387/step-into-the-spotlight/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a> from the Overwatch team says. “A chance to see where the game is headed, hear directly from the team, and step into the next chapter side by side.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, several clues have the community expecting a more fundamental change for Overwatch 2. Specifically, fans across the internet believe this so-called “next chapter” will see the number 2 dropped from the Overwatch title altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speculation began when Blizzard announced the event last week, as audiences noticed the Overwatch logo featured on official artwork was missing its 2. It’s led many to assume the first-person live-service game could either soon drop the number, or that tomorrow’s showcase should cover information outside of Overwatch 2 itself. Theories for the former started to hold more weight when players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1qro4n1/overwatch_2_invasion_bundle_renamed_to_overwatch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>seemed to find evidence</u></a> suggesting its story-centered Invasion Bundle had dropped the two from its name, as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hero shooter, which first launched in 2016 and will celebrate its 10-year anniversary this year, went through a major revamp in October 2022 that saw it transformed into Overwatch 2. It gained three new heroes – Sojourn, Kiriko, and Junker Queen – a visual overhaul, gameplay changes across its dozens of heroes, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-becomes-worst-user-reviewed-game-on-steam-ever-even-as-tens-of-thousands-turn-up-to-play"><u>a lot of hate</u></a>, as players criticized <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-offering-double-xp-and-free-skin-as-apology-for-rough-launch"><u>its unstable launch</u></a> and the controversial adjustments to its monetization strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the more problematic changes have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode"><u>reverted or altered</u></a> in the years since launch, with 6v6 queue options, additional heroes, map adjustments, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-overwatch-fans-are-thrilled-loot-boxes-are-coming-back-some-not-so-much"><u>even loot boxes</u></a> all added within the past year alone. It’s resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-becoming-the-worst-user-reviewed-game-ever-on-steam-overwatch-2s-recent-reviews-jump-to-mixed"><u>a small resurgence</u></a> for the game, as players turn up as Blizzard attempts to steer toward a brighter tomorrow.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another talking point players are hoping to see brought up includes what could be in store for next Season, such as potentially new maps, another collaboration or crossover, Perk reworks, and a theme. Fans are also hoping to see what its next hero may look like after Vendetta was added in Season 20, though the Overwatch team typically launches just one hero every other season, so we may have a slightly longer wait in that regard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last time the studio put hype like this behind a showcase was last year’s February event, suggesting that whatever the developers have planned for tomorrow will likely be huge. Like the 2025 Spotlight, Blizzard has parternered with a<a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/2018469470692360432?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> long list of some of the biggest streamers</a> for this year's show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can see how the inclusion of the latest major mode addition, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-keeps-its-fans-in-the-loop-with-overwatch-2-stadium-summer-roadmap"><u>Stadium</u></a>, had Overwatch players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-years-of-struggle-blizzard-has-found-itself-in-uncharted-territory-overwatch-players-are-having-fun-again"><u>having fun for the first time in a long time</u></a>. You can also see what game director Aaron Keller had to say about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-director-says-blizzard-wants-to-get-back-to-story-content-after-fans-feel-it-dropped-the-ball-with-pve"><u>the team’s desire to return to story and PvE content last July</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

This year, by the time Marvel launches in June, we’ll have a dozen to choose from. While we don’t know if The Hobbit, Reality Fracture, or Star Trek will have precons, it could be an even bigger year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-precon-decks-in-stock-best-price-preview"><u>Lorwyn Eclipsed</u></a> has two decks, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has one that stars all five Turtles, and Marvel is bringing four. Will they all be of a reasonable quality, though, or should we expect diminishing returns on the gameplay and financial side of things? That remains to be seen, but those of us who enjoy the format will find at least one deck to gravitate towards, and those of us that have a tendency to collect a few at a time will be well satiated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also means that it’s likely to be easier than ever to get into the format - ideal for anyone with friends looking for an on-ramp to Commander, or Magic in general.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on the game’s current set, Lorwyn Eclipsed, be sure to check out<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-most-expensive-cards"> <u>our list of the best chase cards</u></a> in the set right now, and<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-precon-decks-in-stock-best-price-preview"> <u>our rundown of its Commander offerings</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a> — the superhero game that's censored on Nintendo Switch — has said it is "legally unable" to explain why it can't launch an unedited version of its game in specific regions — as CD Projekt Red did with Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dispatch maker <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/people-have-a-right-to-be-pissed-dispatch-developer-apologizes-to-fans-over-nintendo-switch-censorship-says-disclaimer-wasnt-visible-enough">AdHoc Studio previously referenced Cyberpunk 2077 by name when discussing the development of Dispatch's Switch edition</a>, and said it had "initially assumed" its game would also be able to feature similarly "uncensored mature content." Instead, AdHoc continued, "during the porting process it became clear that was not the case."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is the key point," AdHoc added. "Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn't meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform. That's what happened here. Honestly we thought this would be obvious since we're the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While AdHoc has stated that this explanation was obvious, it has not been able to explain why Cyberpunk 2077 released unedited in most countries around the world, while Dispatch did not. Indeed, many fans have called for Dispatch to get the same treatment, with a censored version released in Japan, where the country's strict rating board has been blamed for not allowing the game to launch unedited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, AdHoc has responded on this point too — if only to say it is prohibited from explaining the situation in more detail. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"AdHoc is legally unable to provide further comment on why separate SKUs were not possible for different regions," the company said in a statement to <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/57271-dispatch-devs-say-uncensored-physical-switch-release-not-possible-can-t-comment-on" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoNintendo</a>, adding that there was "no possibility" for an uncensored physical edition either, and that it had no physical edition plans to announce.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-is-censored-on-nintendo-switch-due-to-platform-content-criteria-developer-says">fans were shocked to discover that hit superhero game Dispatch had been censored on Nintendo Switch</a> — where enormous black boxes cover nudity and even a character raising their middle finger. While an option to hide these already existed on other platforms, on Switch it is enforced by default, and cannot be toggled off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/people-have-a-right-to-be-pissed-dispatch-developer-apologizes-to-fans-over-nintendo-switch-censorship-says-disclaimer-wasnt-visible-enough">AdHoc apologized to fans and said it that its own disclaimer on the changes should have been more visible</a>, and said fans had a right to be "pissed."
