            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A post on the official Japanese Twitter / X account for the upcoming game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy">Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy</a> received a reply from none other than veteran developer Akitoshi Kawazu, who surprised users by revealing new information about the inspiration behind a Final Fantasy II character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy is Square Enix’s upcoming free-to-play mobile game, slated for a 2026 release. Featuring cel-shaded graphics, Dissidia Duellum takes beloved Final Fantasy characters from throughout the RPG series’ history and transports them to modern Tokyo, where they take on monsters in 3vs3 battles. Two teams of Final Fantasy characters will race to fight their way through roaming monsters to beat the boss faster than the opposing team. The game will also feature voiced story segments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dissidia Duellum will not only let you put protagonists like Cloud, Squall, and Lightning in your party, but a whole host of other characters are also making a return, some in the form of special abilities. The official X account recently revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/final-fantasy-ii/Minwu">Minwu</a>, a character from 1988’s Final Fantasy II, will be lending power to your party with his teleport ability.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ミン=ウは漢字で表記すると、呉明、となります。モデルは戦国時代の呉起。孫呉の兵法という形で孫氏と並び立つ兵法家という評価です。</p>— 河津秋敏 (@SaGa30kawazu) <a href="https://twitter.com/SaGa30kawazu/status/1979894991829999619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Veteran dev Akitoshi Kawazu, battle designer for Final Fantasy I and II as well as the key creator of the SaGa series, responded to this post with some insight into Minwu’s original inspiration. In his post, Kawazu revealed that Minwu was modelled on Wu Qi, a real life military general and philosopher from China's Warring States period. He explained that when Minwu’s name is written in kanji characters, it contains the same character for Wu as Wu Qi (rendered as 呉 in Japanese, and 吳 in traditional Chinese). For the Japanese release of Final Fantasy II, Minwu’s name was written phonetically in katakana (a script used for foreign loan words) just like the rest of the game’s cast of characters, so the reference to Wu Qi was not apparent to players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Final Fantasy II, Minwu is a white wizard from Mysidia who temporarily joins your party. He serves the Flynn royal family in exile as an advisor when the Palemecian Empire’s attack forces them to flee. He plays a key role in organizing rebel forces and the quest for the Ultima Tome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another reason Minwu’s inspiration is not readily apparent is his physical appearance. With his turban and dark skin, he does not visually resemble Wu Qi. However, his strategic role as an advisor plus his loyalty to the Flynn royal family and Princess Hilda does bear some resemblance to Wu Qi’s appointment as the head of Chu State and his fealty to King Dao. Sadly, both meet tragic ends.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Final Fantasy Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kawazu’s comment attracted many appreciative responses from other users. “It makes me extremely happy to receive new information about FFII in this day and age. Thank you,” said one<a href="https://x.com/kandata_dq10/status/1979940177658384569" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> commenter</u></a>. <a href="https://x.com/ZERU_KOBA/status/1980287303567512044" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Others</u></a> were eager for more insight into the 37-year-old game: “I wonder if there are any behind-the-scenes revelations or inspirations for other Final Fantasy II characters?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dissidia Duellum is scheduled to launch on iOS and Android in 2026.
