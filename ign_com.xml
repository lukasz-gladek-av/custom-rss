            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has updated the main GTA 6 website to reflect the game’s most recent delay, and it’s sticking with its console-only launch for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 was delayed from May to November 2026, with Rockstar saying the extra half year “will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some had wondered if this latest delay — its second since it was officially revealed in December 2023 — would cause Rockstar Games to revise its launch plans, which so far include PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S only. But, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1986784619530801294" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@videotechuk_</a>, now Rockstar has updated the official GTA 6 website to mention the November 19 release date, it lists the consoles as the only launch platforms.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/07/screenshot-2025-11-07-131810-1762522553789.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 6 is still set for console only at launch. Image credit: <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">Rockstar Games website</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this mean for PC gamers? They already faced the prospect of having to wait longer for GTA 6 — back when GTA 6 was planned for release in the fall of this year, some thought the game would come out on PC in 2026. That now looks impossible, and some PC gamers are worried they won’t get to play the game until 2028. Late 2027 feels like a safe bet, but this is Rockstar. It’s hard to predict what the company will do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN last night, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-is-highly-confident-on-new-gta-6-release-date-but-says-when-games-are-released-too-early-bad-things-happen">Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he was "highly confident" that this is the last time GTA 6 will be delayed</a>. “We wanted to give Rockstar the appropriate amount of time to polish the title and make sure it can be the very best it can be," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Previously, GTA 6 was announced for a fall 2025 release, which Zelnick was confident in at the time. The game was later delayed to May of 2026, with Take-Two and Rockstar similarly citing a need for polish. Zelnick sounded confident then, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for launch platforms, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response">last year Zelnick was asked if the lack of a PC version of GTA 6 was set in stone</a>. Here’s Zelnick’s response in full:</p><blockquote>Well, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement, I guess that could happen too. It doesn’t seem to me that either would be set in stone.</blockquote><blockquote>But Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we’ve seen before, and they will make more announcements in due time. I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That was Zelnick dancing around the inevitable PC version of GTA 6, but he did point to Rockstar’s release strategy for its previous games. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/place-your-bets-will-gta-6-release-on-pc-on-the-same-day-it-does-on-consoles/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fans of Rockstar games</u></a> have noted the studio's historical reluctance to release other past games on PC day-and-date with console, as well as its fraught relationship with the modding community over the years. Still, some had hoped that a game as big as GTA 6 could be a turning point for the studio's PC gaming attitude, only to have those hopes dashed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Big Rockstar titles tend to get to PC eventually, but the question is how long PC gamers will have to wait for the biggest entertainment launch of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6 in the meantime, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/publisher-jokes-concern-and-a-lot-of-memes-the-internet-reacts-to-the-gta-6-delay">how the internet reacted to the GTA 6 delay</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history">why it’s no surprise it was delayed in the first place</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rockstar Games website</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">GTA 6 is delayed again</a>, this time from May to November 2026. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history">Perhaps we should have seen it coming</a>. After all, aren’t all Rockstar games delayed multiple times before they eventually come out and break sales records?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of coverage on the delay already, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-is-highly-confident-on-new-gta-6-release-date-but-says-when-games-are-released-too-early-bad-things-happen">comments from Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick</a>, who told IGN in an interview he was “highly confident” in the new release date (I’m sure he’s said that before?). And, if you need a reminder, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2">a whopping 89 details from GTA 6 Trailer 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how has the internet reacted to the GTA 6 delay? Fans are, as you’d expect, in tatters. And spare a thought for PC gamers, who now face the prospect of having to wait to play GTA 6 in 2027 at the earliest. But video game publishers — some, publicly at least — are having fun with it, while some are expressing concern for any game that might have earmarked a fall 2026 release window. And then there are the memes. Lots of memes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt, which took the opportunity to remind everyone that it once promised no more delays to Cyberpunk 2077, and look how that turned out when its sci-fi action RPG came out in December 2020. What CDPR is saying here is trust in Rockstar to deliver — it’s better to delay the game and ensure it’s great than launch it when it isn’t ready.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/SqC2ZYRK6s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/SqC2ZYRK6s</a> <a href="https://t.co/l5o58PULml" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/l5o58PULml</a></p>— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1986547061886427406?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Hotline Miami and Cult of the Lamb publisher Devolver Digital, meanwhile, continued the bit by continuing to promise (threat?) to release a game on the same day GTA 6 comes out. Now it’s moved whatever game it had in mind to GTA 6’s new release date: November 19, 2026. Devolver won’t — can’t at this point — stop. It even cheekily asked Rockstar if it needed help getting GTA 6 out the door, tweeting: "DO YOU NEED A PUBLISHER TO GET THIS THING BACK ON TRACK? DMs are open. Our work on @BALLxPIT speaks for itself." Those scamps!</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Devolver Digital (@devolverdigital) <a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1986545399910289732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking more seriously, Christofer Sundberg, founder of Liquid Swords and former boss of Just Cause developer Avalanche, <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1986705793048031697" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called the delay</a> “a gravitational shift.” He continued: “When giants move, the ground shakes. That’s not competition. That’s opportunity.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a comment about how publishers will be left scrambling to adjust their own release dates in the wake of GTA 6 moving from May to November. Some may be able to hit May or thereabouts now GTA 6 has moved out of that window. Others already locked into fall 2026 may now be set for crisis talks. Will next year’s Call of Duty be okay, for example? COD usually launches in November, so we're potentially set for a GTA 6 vs Call of Duty showdown in 2026. I know what my money's on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the delay may even impact games set to launch in 2027. John “Bucky” Buckley, Communications Director and Publishing Manager at Palworld developer Pocketpair, <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1986583034326622227" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X / Twitter</a> to say "expect to see many games (especially AAA ones) swerve to avoid the 2027 awards season," now GTA 6 is set for a November 19 launch, which puts Rockstar's game outside the nominaton window for most game awards in 2026. "Intentional or…?🤔" Bucky wondered.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Microsoft might be the publisher most heavily impacted by this GTA 6 delay.</p><p>Halo Remake, Gears E-Day, Fable, AND Call of Duty 2026 are all almost certainly scheduled for next Fall.
