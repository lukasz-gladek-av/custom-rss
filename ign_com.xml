            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> appears to have suffered yet another leak, this time relating to its battle royale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981741907387523203" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ModernWarzone</a>, which has a track record of accurate reporting around unannounced video game information, particularly in relation to Call of Duty, the Battlefield 6 battle royale is called Battlefield: RedSec.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ModernWarzone also reported that it’s free-to-play and is due out on October 28, the same day Battlefield 6 Season 1 is set to launch. Given EA and Battlefield Studios are yet to make any announcements about this so close to that date, a shadowdrop is expected.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While EA is yet to comment on this particular leak, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-highlights-multiplayer-combat-in-latest-bf-labs-leak">it’s seen various gameplay clips emerge from playtests of the battle royale</a>. And today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-community-update-reveals-long-list-of-gameplay-changes-ahead-of-season-1-and-battle-royale-launch">it outlined gameplay changes coming to battle royale ahead of its release</a>, based on feedback to those playtests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s what BF Studios said today:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a quick look at what changes you may notice the next time you play:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Close-range TTK</strong>: We’ve adjusted time-to-kill at close range for all weapons to reward clean positioning and tracking while giving players more time to counter attacks. We’ll keep monitoring this once it’s live.</li><li><strong>Armor Changes</strong>: Everyone will now have the capacity for 2 armor plates at the start of the game. All players will spawn with 1 plate, so you will have the chance to upgrade as soon as you start looting, giving everyone an equal chance at upgrading their armor fully.</li><li><strong>World Improvements</strong>: We’ve been fixing pesky world bugs and optimizing areas to improve the environment. With these improvements, we made adjustments to the lighting as well as enhancing the visibility across the map.</li><li><strong>Vehicle Balance</strong>: We’ve adjusted the balance for helicopters and combat vehicles to keep them as powerful tools showing off Battlefield’s core DNA, without making them necessary to survive or win the late game. This includes significant adjustments to the heli countermeasures and ammo economy.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">We have also been working on providing smoother performance overall. We have identified and addressed a range of issues that affected performance that we simply couldn’t have done without our players’ involvement in the tests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait, it’s worth checking out the Battlefield 6 update 1.1.1.0 patch notes, below, which go into detail on the changes coming to the game with Season 1. Finally, be sure to check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/All_Multiplayer_Maps"><u>full list of all currently available Battlefield 6 multiplayer maps</u></a>.
