Instead of trying to cram the massive video game’s story into a box, Gangs of Night City instead puts you in control of one of the universe’s various gangs (each gang having unique asymmetric abilities), and you wage war as you and the other players try to carve out more territory. </p><p id="cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City ">Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City The Board Game</h2></p><div catalogid="b1abd622-deb3-40e8-8b58-fb95dd597f8d" id="224519"><div id="224519" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City The Board Game</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>1 to 4 players take on the roles of rival gangs struggling to expand their territory in the universe of Cyberpunk 2077 with Cyberpunk 2077: Ganges of Night City The Board Game </p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This game isn’t just a bloodbath, and while you can expect some good ol’ shootouts, Gangs of Night City will reward strategic planning more. For those of you who may be hoping for some story, this does manage to inject some narrative elements into the mix, thanks to the scenarios you play with. These will mix things up for you and your fellow players with some new rules or mechanics, or even some alternative victory conditions. That said, this game is about seeing who is best at dishing out the most pain, and it just feels fun to cause some chaos with some friends over some drinks during a game night.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">Board game adaptations of popular video games</a> have become pretty commonplace these days, and we have covered a bunch, including Gangs of Night City!

This step is part of our ongoing, targeted restructuring and global cost-saving efforts, and reflects the needs on the studio’s projects. While this was not an easy decision, it was a necessary one given our operational priorities. We remain committed to supporting those affected with comprehensive severance packages, extended health-care benefits, and career transition assistance. We deeply appreciate their hard work and the impact they’ve had on Ubisoft.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft PR also confirmed that no other Ubisoft locations were impacted by today's layoffs. However, the company did not respond to IGN's request for information on how many employees remain at Red Storm or the status of the company's current projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft Red Storm was originally Red Storm Entertainment, founded by author Tom Clancy specifically to make games based on his novels, including Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six. The studio was acquired by Ubisoft in 2000, going on to create hits such as the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon series and assisting on other popular Tom Clancy games such as The Division. In more recent years, it has taken a backseat role as more of a VR and support studio beginning with Werewolves Within in 2016. and continuing more recently with Star Trek: Bridge Crew and Assassin's Creed Nexus VR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Storm also worked on a canceled Splinter Cell VR game, and the also-canceled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">The Division Heartland</a>. Most recently, Red Storm assisted on XDefiant, which just shut down completely last month after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">an announcement last year</a>. At the time, Ubisoft shut down the San Francisco and Osaka studios behind the game, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-16/ubisoft-entertainment-cuts-45-people-from-its-us-staff?embedded-checkout=true" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some layoffs occuring at Red Storm as well</a>.

Even if you are only familiar with Kojima from his newer games, for this sale price, even if you are only slightly interested or intrigued, you can’t go wrong trying this series out. If you are a longtime fan, you already know how good these games are. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just ask yourself, is having these games with you on the go worth the price of less than it costs to go see a movie and get some popcorn? Heck, even if you already own it on another platform, for 16 bucks, why not get another copy?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a note only Metal Gear (MSX), Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Metal Gear (NES), and Snake’s Revenge are on the cartridge, with the other games requiring a download. </p></div><p id="more-prime-day-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More Prime Day deals">More Prime Day Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Day is one of the best times to buy pretty much anything.
