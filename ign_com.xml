            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-players-can-win-1-million-in-this-2025s-the-hunt-mega-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of things most people would be willing to do for $1 million, and now they can add taking part in Roblox's The Hunt: Mega Edition when the event starts on March 13. Cash hungry hopefuls will need to play their way through more than 24 different Roblox games to compete against other players to prove their skills. If they make it into the top ten competitors, they'll be invited to Roblox HQ in California and take part in a live-streamed final, where one will take home $1 million dollars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are smaller prizes like "ultra-rare digital items" up for grabs and the event is open to anyone, but you have to be over 13 to be eligible for the big cash jackpot. The event is set to run until March 24 to find its top ten players, with the live-streamed final planned for some time in April. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've yet to dip your toe in the vast Roblox ocean of games and experiences, there's still time to start and get some practice in before The Hunt: Mega Edition goes live. We don't know every title that will be part of the contest yet, but the following are confirmed. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Rivals - Nosiny Games</li><li>SpongeBob Tower Defense - Wonder Works Studio</li><li>Basketball Legends - InfinitySports</li><li>IT GIRL - IT GIRL Magazine</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hunt: First Edition launched last year and according to Roblox, saw 34 million users spend 128 million hours completing 212 million quests, and that event didn't even come with "buy your own yacht" kind of money. The event involved every part of the Roblox community with 100 creator teams crafting quests specifically for The Hunt, and Roblox influencers putting together special live streams for competitors and spectators.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

As you might have guessed from the name, Marvel Rivals’ Clone Rumble mode removes hero limits by asking each team to choose a single hero to play as. That means the dream to see a 6v6 match between a full lobby of Mister Fantastics will be fully realized come launch on March 7, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Clone Rumble’s debut trailer teases how players can experiment with new strategies. We know 12 Reed Richards will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-are-stretching-mister-fantastics-meme-potential-to-its-limit">open the door for some hilarious clips</a>, but the mode will also allow players to turn maps into a greenhouse with a team of Groots. You’ll also be able to make Marvel Rivals look more like Call of Duty if your teams pick Punisher as their chosen clone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have taken to social media to discuss the other possibilities, too, including what it might look like to use Doctor Strange in the mode. Although Marvel Rivals’ Sorcerer Supreme likely won’t be able to completely pollute arenas with portals, there’s no telling how Loki, Captain America, and Peni Parker matches will play out.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>“We still have time to capture the point, there is over a minute left on the clock.”</p><p>“I AM READY TO PUT ON A SHOW!”</p><p>“I AM READY TO PUT ON A SHOW!”</p><p>“I AM READY TO PUT ON A SHOW!”</p><p>“I AM READY TO PUT ON A SHOW!”</p><p>“I AM READY TO PUT ON A SHOW!”“</p><p>“I AM READY TO PUT ON A SHOW!” <a href="https://t.co/ZB1UDDzsfG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/ZB1UDDzsfG</a> <a href="https://t.co/Lh36Xd94ha" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Lh36Xd94ha</a></p></div>— Ultima (@UltimaShadowX) <a href="https://twitter.com/UltimaShadowX/status/1896956534871167255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">PC players when all 12 Doctor Strange’s open a portal <a href="https://t.co/2Nh8uWovI1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/2Nh8uWovI1</a> <a href="https://t.co/NimPjFf5hC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NimPjFf5hC</a></p>— PridefulSin🫧 (@ReignOfPride) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReignOfPride/status/1896967030861078530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in today’s Clone Rumble trailer is the reveal of a new Western costume for Black Widow, which may also come with what appears to be a cowboy-inspired MVP animation. Players will be able to earn the outfit for free as part of a board game event, Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure. The activity will see Marvel Rivals players rolling dice to move a game piece across a board to collect more in-game rewards, including Units and other customization options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear how long Clone Rumble and Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure will be available to players after they launch this week.
