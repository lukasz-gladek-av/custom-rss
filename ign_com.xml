            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-state-of-play-reportedly-set-for-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's a Marathon, not a sprint.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is reportedly set to deliver its now-standard February PlayStation State of Play broadcast next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaker NateTheHate, who accurately revealed the date of Nintendo’s Switch 2 reveal ahead of time, took to social media to <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1885748440132456877" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tease</a> a State of Play for Valentine’s Day week (February 10 to 14).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s speculation time! What could Sony have up its sleeve for this year’s State of Play? It’s worth going through the first-party games it has announced and coming out in 2025. Sucker Punch’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> currently has a 2025 release window. Perhaps we’ll get a fresh look at gameplay and a release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Bungie’s PvP extraction shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> may be set for a showing if it still plans to open playtesting up this year. There’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgames</a>, the debut game from Haven Studios. Naughty Dog recently announced its brand new IP, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet"><u>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</u></a>, and Insomniac is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>. More likely, perhaps, is a fresh trailer for Hideo Kojima’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, which is set for a 2025 release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we won’t see are the various live service games Sony recently canned. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony canceled two unannounced live-service games that were in development at Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games</u></a>. The Bluepoint game was reportedly a live-service God of War game. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bend-studio-dev-says-we-still-plan-on-creating-cool-st-after-sony-live-service-cancelation">Bend Studio’s live-service game remains unknown</a>. Guerrilla Games' live service Horizon game reportedly survived the cull. Is it finally time for a reveal?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to potential third-party announcements, Kojima has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project"><u>Physint</u></a>, the upcoming stealth-action PlayStation exclusive in the works, but it feels a little early for that. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero"><u>Phantom Blade Zero</u></a>, the flashy hack-and-slash action RPG from Chinese studio S-Game, is a safer bet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s not forget Microsoft, now a significant publisher of games on PlayStation. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is set to launch on PS5 soon, so maybe we will see a release date announced. And could Microsoft use State of Play to finally announce <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-finally-looks-set-to-make-the-jump-to-playstation-this-year">the arrival of Halo on PlayStation</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In predicting the future, it’s helpful to look to the past. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-january-2024-everything-announced">Last year’s equivalent State of Play</a> showcased the likes of Death Stranding 2, Physint, Rise of the Ronin, the Until Dawn remaster, Stellar Blade, Dragon's Dogma 2, Sonic x Shadow Generations, various Silent Hill projects, Ken Levine’s Judas, Foamstars, and Helldivers 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-devs-looking-to-improve-trading-following-major-player-backlash<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> developer Creatures Inc. is "actively investigating ways to improve" the trading feature which launched last week to major backlash from players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. released a statement on <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1885447974094070090/photo/1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> that thanked players for their feedback and said they planned the controversial trading feature with the intention of stopping players from abusing it, but "some of the restrictions put in place are preventing players from being able to casually enjoy" it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also promised to alleviate complaints by introducing required items as rewards in upcoming events, but has already failed to do so as the Cresselia ex Drop Event released today, February 3, includes none.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the standard Pokémon TCG Pocket mechanic that restricts players from opening packs or Wonder Picking or, now, trading too much without spending real world money, the feature was also introduced with an extra restriction called Trade Tokens. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-trading-today-and-players-absolutely-hate-it">Players criticized the high cost of obtaining these</a>, as they essentially had to delete from their collections five cards before trading one of the same rarity.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Space Time Smackdown</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The item requirements and restrictions implemented for the trading feature were designed to prevent abuse from bots and other prohibited actions using multiple accounts," Creatures Inc. said. "Our goal was to balance the game while maintaining a fair environment for all players and preserving the fun of collecting cards that is core to the Pokémon TCG Pocket experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"However, thanks to your feedback, we understand that some of the restrictions put in place are preventing players from being able to casually enjoy the feature as intended. We are actively investigating ways to improve the feature to address these concerns. Going forward, we also plan to offer multiple ways to obtain Trade Tokens including through event distributions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement is essentially as vague as it gets, with Creatures Inc. offering neither specifics into what changes will be made or when they will arrive, but it at least confirms that community concerns are heard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players of Pokémon TCG Pocket are also left in the dark as to if their current trades will be refunded or compensated in any way, as if the Trade Token cost changes, those taking advantage of the feature in its opening days may lose much more than if they waited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. doesn't seem particularly determined to include Trade Tokens in events either, as it only made a total of 200 available as premium rewards to those who pay $9.99 a month for the Battle Pass when the refresh arrived on February 1. This is enough to trade a single 3 Diamond card, the lowest rarity that requires Trade Tokens to trade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also failed to include any as rewards in the aforementioned Cresselia ex Drop Event which arrived today. Players can pick up new promo cards, Pack Hourglasses, Shinedust, shop tickets, and experience from completing the events, but Creatures Inc. doesn't offer a single Trade Token despite its vow to do so just yesterday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans complained trading is fairly clearly being implemented as a means of increasing revenue for Pokémon TCG Pocket, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">is estimated to have made $200 million in its first month</a>, before trading was possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also evidenced by the inability to trade cards of 2 Star rarity or higher, as if players could immediately trade for their missing cards, they wouldn't need to spend $10 or $100 or more for a random chance of getting them. It cost one player around $1,500 just to complete the first set, for example, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-space-time-smackdown-expansion-today-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">the third in three months arrived just a few days ago</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players called the mechanic "predatory and downright greedy," "hilariously toxic," and a "monumental failure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

It means so much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is the 3D remake of the first game in the Wizardry series. 1981’s medieval fantasy Wizardy is considered the first party-based video game RPG ever released, and is credited as inspiring the likes of Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is built directly on top of the original game's code. You can even view the original Apple 2 interface as you play.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/03/gettyimages-2196802600-1738578849127.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Winifred Phillips at the 67th Grammy Awards.

"The category was populated with so much brilliance this year, and I have so much deep respect for the other nominees in this category. So to have been recognized is just a highlight of my career. It truly is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We do a very unique thing," Phillips continued. "We’re creating music that needs to accompany people who are having an experience and who are making choices, and having adventures and living a grand story, and we’re creating the music for that story. It’s such a wonderful privilege because you feel like you’re collaborating with the players. Like you know them and they know you. It’s really very special.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Previous winners of the coveted award include Stephanie Economou for Ubisoft’s Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab for Respawn’s Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. The first piece of music from a video game ever to be nominated for and win a Grammy in any category was Baba Yetu, a song arranged by Christopher Tin for Firaxis’ Civilization 4, which won Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2011.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-dev-calls-out-threats-to-harm-following-shutdown-announcement-i-am-in-deep-mourning-for-the-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The game director of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> has called out “threats to harm” developers on the game have received following the announcement of its impending shutdown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-to-shut-down-when-season-5-concludes-in-may">Player First Games announced that Season 5 of the Warner Bros. brawler would be its last</a>, with the MultiVersus servers going dark this May, just one year after it relaunched. Players will still be able to access all earned and purchased content while offline via the local gameplay mode and training mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While real-money transactions for MultiVersus are no longer available, fans can still use Gleamium and character tokens to access in-game content until support ends on May 30. MultiVersus will also be delisted from the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, Steam, and Epic Games Store at this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the announcement, and without word of a refund policy, MultiVersus players who bought the $100 premium Founder's Pack hit out at Warner Bros. and Player First Games, with some saying they felt “scammed.” Based on online reports, there are a number of disgruntled customers who have character tokens that are now rendered useless, given they had already unlocked all playable characters in the game. Predictably, MultiVersus is also getting review-bombed on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tony Huynh, co-founder of Player First Games and game director of MultiVersus, <a href="https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1886119648480915954" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to address player concerns and call out threats of violence directed at the team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Huynh’s statement in full:</p><blockquote>Hey all, I wanted to say a few words as I reflect on the recently announced news about MultiVersus. While I'm sad about the outcome, I will forever be grateful for the opportunity given to us by Warner  Bros. Games and to each and every developer on the Player First Games and WB Games teams. Also to every IP holder thank you for entrusting us with your babies, we hope we made the characters true to themselves and felt authentic to your fans. I couldn’t be prouder of the work the PFG team did. Their endless creativity and passion never ceased to inspire and amaze me. And of course I wanted to thank every player who has ever played or supported MultiVersus. Delighting and serving players is Player First Games objective.</blockquote><blockquote>I apologize for not addressing things sooner, there’s been a lot going on and I’ve been focused on the game and the team, but now more-so the team.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for sending us all the great fan art, character ideas, and personal stories. They were the highlight of every day and always excited the team.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m sorry if we couldn’t get to your favorite character. I do think Aquaman and Lola are really cool and I hope you all check them out. Character selection comes down to bunch of things including development time, listening to what the community wants, working with IP holders and approvals, if there is a cross-marketing opportunity available to support, and of course if the team is inspired to make the character. So a lot goes into to it.</blockquote><blockquote>For instance BananaGuard came about because the team was enthusiastic about making it and on their own produced it over the weekend as a fun, quick-to-make character. When inspiration and enthusiasm spark we want to reward that and we got BananaGuard because of that. It wasn’t at the expense of another character. It was because the team was excited about making the character.</blockquote><blockquote>I don’t have the power some you think I do. PFG is a highly collaborative team and ideas are encouraged and can come from anyone and we promote delivering value to players</blockquote><blockquote>I also hope that the community notices that we try to listen and act. Like any developer we’re limited by time and resources.</blockquote><blockquote>I know that this is painful for everyone, and I know every member of PFG feels it too, but I have to call this out, you’re entitled to what you say and think, but when there are threats to harm it’s crossing the line. I hope that you can take a step back and realize that this is an extremely sad time for the team. I am in deep mourning for the game. Nobody wanted this outcome and it wasn’t from lack of caring or effort.</blockquote><blockquote>I sincerely hope that Season 5 is enjoyed with the time we have left and that you will all continue supporting other platform fighter and fighting games as these games have impacted me in many positive ways. I’ve made so many friends and created so many great memories because of these games, and a big reason why we worked so hard at PFG was to share that with you. I hope that we played a small part and that you can look back on MVS and find some joy in the friends you made and the memories you shared.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for allowing this dream to become a reality even if for a briefer time than we would have wanted. I don’t know what the future holds for any of all of us, but I just wanted to say thank you. It has been an honor to work alongside the team at PFG to serve our community and players.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Player First Games community manager and game developer Angelo Rodriguez Jr. took to <a href="https://x.com/AJAX_HQ/status/1886134953546838238" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> to defend Huynh, stressing: “Receiving threats of physical harm against him is not and will never be the way.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've legitimately been losing sleep over the past few days watching as all of these has been happening to Tony,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The man who would stay up past midnight with us watching streams and listened for fun ideas from the players. The man who took the time to read so many messages and respond to so many people when he didn't have to. The man who spent countless hours working with every department to try and improve things we could in the weeks we had to do it. The man who went out of his way to hire so many of us from the community and gave us a shot at being involved in something so special. Tony is not who he is being painted out to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know things aren't the best right now and everyone is looking for answers. Receiving threats of physical harm against him is not and will never be the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“PFG poured their heart into this game and we still hope everyone enjoys season 5. We never stopped pushing for improvements and again you will see 50 pages worth of them this season. I hope everyone can take the time to read through what Tony has to say, and I hope you will all think things through.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MultiVersus’ demise is the latest high-profile failure for Warner Bros. Games, following Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s disastrous launch last year. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-is-leaving-the-company-a-year-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disastrous-launch">the departure of Warner Bros. Games boss David Haddad was revealed</a> after what had been a troubling 12 months for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure contributed to a $200 million hit to its business</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business"><u>MultiVersus added another $100 million on top</u></a>. Warner Bros. Games' only new game release during the third quarter of 2024 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions"><u>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</u></a>, which failed to make an impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav said: "We recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League post-launch content has come to an end with the delivery of its year one roadmap. Warner Bros. has yet to announce Rocksteady’s next game, but it is reportedly helping out on a director’s cut of Hogwarts Legacy. The legendary British studio has suffered a number of layoffs in recent months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also question marks over Mortal Kombat 1’s financial performance, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-chief-ed-boon-teases-t-1000-fatality-and-future-dlc"><u>NetherRealm chief Ed Boon recently announced over five million sales and teased future DLC following the release of the T-1000 Terminator guest character</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Zaslav said Warner Bros. was doubling down on four games: Hogwarts Legacy (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines"><u>a sequel is already in the works</u></a>), Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, "in particular Batman." Warner Bros. recently published the VR game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-shadow"><u>Batman: Arkham Shadow</u></a> exclusively on the Meta Quest 3, and has a Wonder Woman game in the works at Monolith Productions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio," Zaslav added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
