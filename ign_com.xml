            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase Games has finally pulled back the curtain on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals"><u>Marvel Rivals</u></a> Season 3: The Abyss Awakens with a trailer, below, that features major comic book characters like the symbiote king, Knull, as well as Blade and Jean Grey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The minute-and-a-half-long cinematic trailer was published today, revealing a first look at the upcoming season‚Äôs theme, its new playable characters, and even a few symbiote-themed skins. The Season 3 release date is set for July 11, though it remains unclear how some of the content shown in today‚Äôs video will roll out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-2-ushers-in-the-age-of-ultron-with-hellfire-gala-theme-and-emma-frost"><u>Season 2: Hellfire Gala introduced</u></a> new Heroes, Ultron and Emma Frost, Season 3: The Abyss Awakens looks like it will finally allow players to control Blade and Jean Grey/The Phoenix. The former is an especially important addition, as Marvel Rivals fans have speculated about when the Daywalker would be added to the roster since teases began during the vampire-themed Season 1. Jean Grey‚Äôs inclusion, meanwhile, comes with the surprise that she‚Äôll be able to harness the power of The Phoenix for her telekinetic abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Knull will serve as the big bad this time around, with the Marvel Rivals Season 2 trailer teasing that he‚Äôll be teaming up with Hela to take power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúIn the wake of the Timestream Entanglement, Knull stirs deep within Klyntar‚Äôs core, stretching his shadowed hands across the cosmos," an official description for Marvel Rivals Season 3 says. "Power promised by the dark symbiote god beckons the awakening of a new queen. The Phoenix arrives from across the stars to erase Klyntar before the darkness can rise again! However, she'll require unlikely aid from a warrior of two worlds who lives to fight against the tide of night. As the god of the symbiotes and the Phoenix Force collide, will you burn with the light of creation or embrace the darkness?‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eyed Marvel Rivals players will also notice what is most likely a collection of new skins set to arrive at some point during Season 3. There is, of course, Hela‚Äôs symbiote skin, which Knull gives her early on in the footage, but it‚Äôs toward the end that we get a closer look at a few more. Wolverine can be seen sporting a Phoenix Force skin of his own, with Blade and Magik both sporting fiery outfits as well. It‚Äôs Jeff the Landshark symbiote skin that has most fans really freaking out, though.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="no" dir="ltr">SYMBIOTE JEFF SKIN???? <a href="https://t.co/SMmm41rUYF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/SMmm41rUYF</a></p>‚Äî Lightoss üí™üåü (@lightossan) <a href="https://twitter.com/lightossan/status/1940062111255712134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals Season 3: The Abyss Awakens will introduce at least two new playable Heroes, but it also marks the beginning of a new chapter for the popular Marvel hero shooter experience. Starting July 11, NetEase will begin <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-says-its-feeling-social-media-pressure-to-keep-the-game-as-exciting-as-it-has-been-since-december-announced-big-season-3-shake-up"><u>rolling out new content at a much quicker pace following pressure it received on social media</u></a>. While past seasons have been approximately three months long, Season 3 will see that schedule change to two-month-long seasons. That means major updates will drop much faster than before without sacrificing any content, as NetEase hopes to keep fans engaged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio has done its best to address fan feedback since launching late last year. Some examples include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-marvel-rivals-support-players-went-on-strike-dev-lays-out-plans-to-buff-strategist-experience"><u>a major rework for Strategists that followed after Support players went on strike</u></a>.

He‚Äôs working on an anthology of these unexplained and weird phenomena and he needs your help investigating the wildest claims that cross his desk.</blockquote><blockquote>Strange Tales of the West will require steely resolve and courage in the face of the odd, twisted, and downright supernatural. Embark upon these four new Telegram Missions by picking up Mr. Levin‚Äôs letter at any Post Office or from your Camp‚Äôs Lockbox, then opening it via your Satchel or launching Telegram Missions from your Player Menu.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The four new missions are Strange Tales of The Plague, Strange Tales of Modern Science, Strange Tales of The Bayou, and Strange Tales of The Wilderness. As reported by @videotechuk_ on X / Twitter, the update adds a new zombie infected mode, the first mission of which takes place in Armadillo.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Rockstar has launched a new zombie "infected" mode in Red Dead Online as part of the new Strange Tales of The West telegram missions </p><p>The first mission takes place in Armadillo and the main objective to kill infected and bring them to a wagon as a team.</p><p>Infected carry knives. <a href="https://t.co/TC9uOuIDEI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TC9uOuIDEI</a></p></div>‚Äî ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/1940025158225264674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 1, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are still digesting the news, with posts across social media and subreddits showing the level of excitement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what does this mean for Red Dead Online and parent game Red Dead Redemption 2? Given the zombie nature of the update, some are wondering if Rockstar has prepared an Undead Nightmare-style expansion for Red Dead Redemption 2. That would come as a huge shock given the studio‚Äôs all-hands-on-deck focus on next year‚Äôs Grand Theft Auto VI, but perhaps more likely is a next-gen port.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In May, <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-red-dead-redemption-2-for-nintendo-switch-2-may-arrive-this-year-1544753/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GameReactor</u></a> reported that a Nintendo Switch 2 version of Rockstar's Wild West romp was on the way, along with a "next-gen upgrade patch" that would improve the game for current-gen systems (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S). Both could be released later in 2025, according to the site.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have long called for an updated version of Red Dead Redemption 2, which is considered a masterpiece. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review"><u>IGN's Red Dead Redemption 2 review</u></a> returned a 10/10. We said: "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open-world ode to the outlaw era."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Red Dead Online fans are enjoying digging into Strange Tales of the West, which is officially described as Vol.1. This suggests another content drop is coming. Whatever the future holds, it seems Red Dead Online is back from the dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
