We cannot let them turn this defensive tool of peace into a destructive weapon of war," developer Arrowhead teased. "It's now up to you, our most elite and powerful force, to bring them to justice on their own turf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have approved the deployment of new equipment for squads to aid in the swift elimination of the Automaton threat. Push toward Cyberstan and end this insult to Managed Democracy. Helldivers, let this be the last time the Automatons steal from Super Earth."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Highlights of the patch include the Bastion Tank, a new tank vehicle that is "ready to roll over entrenched enemies,"  and "offering unrivaled firepower and defense on the battlefield." Be warned, though — "it will require your team to work together to hunt down the enemy!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll also see a 50% increase to base melee attack, changes to enemy behavior, and a trickier challenge in the game's hardest difficulties, with Arrowhead explaining that the "biggest change should be noticed on the Automaton front while Terminids and the Illuminate are less affected."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for those aftermentioned Automatons? There's nothing specific about them in the patch notes beyond a cursory note that it's now confirmed that it was the Automatons that stole the Star of Peace schematics, but a fan-run Twitter/X account dedicated to Helldivers found this to share with us:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="sv" dir="ltr">Cyborgs 💀 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Helldivers2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Helldivers2</a> <a href="https://t.co/SBVhHYDm7W" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/SBVhHYDm7W</a></p>— Helldivers Alerts (@HelldiversAlert) <a href="https://twitter.com/HelldiversAlert/status/2018646087112995039?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 3, 2026</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2">Helldivers 2 update 6.0.1 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">*** INCOMING MESSAGE FROM HIGH COMMAND ***</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have confirmed, with concrete proof and beyond any doubt, that the Automaton Collective stole our schematics for the Star of Peace. We cannot let them turn this defensive tool of peace into a destructive weapon of war. It's now up to you, our most elite and powerful force, to bring them to justice on their own turf.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have approved the deployment of new equipment for squads to aid in the swift elimination of the Automaton threat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Push toward Cyberstan and end this insult to Managed Democracy. Helldivers, let this be the last time the Automatons steal from Super Earth.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">📍 <strong>Patch Highlights</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Bastion Tank: A new tank vehicle is ready to roll over entrenched enemies! The Bastion Tank offers unrivaled firepower and defense on the battlefield. It will require your team to work together to hunt down the enemy! (2pm CET)</li><li>Chinese VO has been added to Helldivers 2!</li><li>Arm yourself with the latest premium Warbond Siegebreakers, loaded with a devastating hammer built for close-range persuasion and an upgrade to a <em>Helldivers </em>favorite, the LAS-16 Trident!</li><li>March into battle in style with the new War Horse set, available in the Superstore on February 10!</li><li>With a few exceptions, all victory poses and emotes are now interchangeable!</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">⚖️ <strong>Balancing</strong></h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>General changes overview</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Melee weapons and Armor passive with increased melee damage re-balance</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Intent is to make the Armor passive that increases melee damage less mandatory but still be useful to make melee weapons more effective.</li><li>We increased all the melee weapons damage and decreased the modifiers on the armor passives that increase melee damage.</li><li>Total damage with the melee armor passive will be higher or the same as before.</li><li>Base melee attack also got a 50% damage increase.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">SMG and Pistol rounds less Sway</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The intent is that the increased drag of SMG and Pistol which make it a close combat weapon and less effective at range is the main characteristic of these weapons.</li><li>We decreased the Sway modifier to be the same as most other weapons</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Unify Weapon function directions inputs</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The intent is to make the "weapon function modes" that are similar to be on the same "weapon function direction input".</li><li>This is to make it easier to remember which direction similar types of weapon functions are and also make it so you need to use less "quick weapon functions" inputs.</li><li>Weapon function modes that affect Programmable ammo, Ammo types, Volley modes, Safe modes, Guided modes will now be in the left direction. </li><li>We have not moved the underbarrel weapon switching option to the left yet, but we are looking into moving it to the left direction so all ammo altering switching is in the left direction even if it is an underbarrel selection that usually is in the down direction.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Difficulty on difficulty 9+</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Made changes across all factions to increase the intensity on high difficulties, the biggest change should be noticed on the Automaton front while Terminids and the Illuminate are less affected.</p><h3

Other adjustments also affect the FRV and Exosuits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enemies Aim calculations were not always updated when there were many enemies trying to aim, making Automatons on higher difficulties a bit bad at aiming. They should now attempt to update the aim better considering the data they have before they get another proper aim update.

This generates a file called a “crash dump” which contains important debugging information for our programmers to diagnose and fix the root cause of the hang. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you experience a hang, please wait at least 40 seconds before restarting your PC to allow the hang detector to do its job. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you experience a 20+ second hang followed by a crash:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>If the crash reporting window shows up then please submit the report as usual. </li><li>If the crash reporting window doesn’t show up (it can fail), we humbly request that you share the crash dump file with our player support team (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Farrowhead.zendesk.com%2F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://arrowhead.zendesk.com/</a>).
