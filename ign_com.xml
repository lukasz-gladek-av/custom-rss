            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"This is the absolute worst generation."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being revealed at last year's The Game Awards, Naughty Dog's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> is reportedly still years away from launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the Uncharted and The Last of Us studio should also not expect another glimpse of the project at next month's annual video games award ceremony, it was claimed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussion around when to expect Intergalactic was recently sparked by journalist Colin Moriarty, who suggested he thought it possible the game would launch in 2026. (After various sites picked up the comment as confirmation, Moriarty then <a href="https://x.com/longislandviper/status/1992340284026331442" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued</a> a clarification to say he'd just been "speculating," though by then, the topic had snowballed.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In March this year, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conversation</a> with 28 Years Later director Alex Garland, Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann said the developer still had "a ways to go" on the project. During the same month, Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier stated that the game would not launch in 2026 (and neither would The Witcher 4, either). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This month, Schreier has now <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-on-intergalactic-can-assure-you-that-intergalactic-is-not-coming-out-in-2026.1361842/post-148016161" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repeated</a> this statement — once again placing Intergalactic's arrival as 2027 at the earliest, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-tech-wizard-mark-cerny-teases-new-graphics-features-hes-excited-to-bring-to-a-future-console-in-a-few-years-time-sparks-wave-of-ps6-release-date-speculation-in-the-process">potentially skipping the PS5 generation altogether</a>. Meanwhile, Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3m6ajw5exkk2p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> that the game won't be making a second appearance in trailer form at The Game Awards this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this a surprise? Not really. PlayStation (and Nintendo, and Xbox) have a habit of teasing blockbuster titles a long time before they're ready for most people to play them. And in an interview in May, Druckmann confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-developer-naughty-dog-working-on-a-second-unannounced-game-other-than-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-neil-druckmann-confirms">Naughty Dog was also working on a second game</a> which he said he was acting as "more of a producer" and "mentor" on. Perhaps this game will be announced and launched first?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the reminder that Naughty Dog's big new IP is still years away has come as a disappointment to some. Should Intergalactic launch in 2027, it will have been seven years since the launch of The Last of Us Part 2. During the PlayStation 3 and 4 era, Naughty Dog launched a trilogy of Uncharted games and the first The Last of Us within the same timeframe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Naughty Dog has still launched new products over the past few years, including the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, The Last of Us Part 1 and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered — but these have been re-releases and remasters. At the same time, it has also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward">abandoned its long-awaited multiplayer The Last of Us spin-off</a>, which will now no longer see the light of day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I am all for letting devs cook but this is the absolute worst generation for Naughty Dog," one fan <a href="https://x.com/NeoGameSpark/status/1992617103627804904" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on social media. "TLOU P2 dropped in 2020 and all we've gotten are barebones remasters, an unnecessary remake, cancelled multiplayer and waiting almost a decade for a new game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Druckmann has spoken confidently that Intergalactic will be worth the wait. Featuring a dark sci-fi story centered around the topics of faith and religion, the project will be led by a star-studded cast that includes Tati Gabrielle from the Uncharted movie as protagonist Jordan A. Mun, and Kumail Nanjiani of Marvel's Eternals as a man called Colin Graves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September this year, in an interview in which Druckmann described development as "firing on all cyclinders," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-most-expansive-and-maybe-the-most-expensive-game-the-studio-has-ever-made">the director branded his next project as "the most ambitious game we’ve ever made."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's the most expansive game we've ever made," he then teased, "[and] maybe the most expensive, by the time we finish it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Photographer Michael Childers took to social media to say Kier died in hospital in Palm Springs, California. A cause of death has not yet been revealed.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/24/gettyimages-2192353105-1763977501837.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Udo Kier at the Palm Springs International Film Festival Film Awards 2025 on January 3, 2025.

His first American role came in 1991 film My Own Private Idaho, which starred River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves. Madonna, a fan of Kier's work, cast him in her music videos for Erotica and Deeper and Deeper. Later notable roles came in the likes of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Johnny Mnemonic, Armageddon, End of Days, and Blade. Kier’s final film was the political thriller The Secret Agent, in which he played a Jewish Holocaust survivor caught in the final years of the Brazilian military dictatorship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as starring in hundreds of films, Kier was no stranger to the world of video games. He famously played Yuri in the live-action cutscenes that formed a part of Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2’s story, and reprised the role in 2001’s Command &amp; Conquer: Yuri's Revenge.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>RIP Udo Kier, who passed away today at the age of 81.</p><p>His performance as Yuri in Red Alert 2 has always stuck with me, and it’s one I constantly reference. I’m sad we won’t get to see you in Kojima’s OD but thank you for the great memories. <a href="https://t.co/d8Y2ZBmV5r" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/d8Y2ZBmV5r</a></p></div>— Bucky | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1992787137469776151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Later, he had voice roles in 2017’s Call of Duty: WWII, and 2022’s Martha is Dead. He was set to appear in OD, the upcoming horror video game by Hideo Kojima and producer Jordan Peele, and indeed was a part of its teaser trailer, below, showing initial face scan work. It is unclear whether Kier will now be recast in the upcoming Microsoft game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima took to <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1992785286712209409" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> to pay tribute to Kier, expressing his shock at the news.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m at a loss for words,” Kojima said. “It all happened far too suddenly. Because of the strike, we weren’t able to shoot OD for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year. Even during that time, Udo and I exchanged emails frequently. We stayed in close contact. When we met in Milan at the end of September, he told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year. He was full of energy then too, making me laugh with his usual ‘Udo-isms.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I still can’t believe this. Udo wasn’t just an actor. He was truly an ‘icon’ of his time. We’ve lost a great ‘icon.’ There will never be another like him. Udo, rest in peace. I will never forget you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tweet video below, shows Kojima and Kier together in Milan in September.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="pl" dir="ltr">With Udo Kier. <a href="https://t.co/6tdXYLY8aW" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6tdXYLY8aW</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1971510978283225320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
