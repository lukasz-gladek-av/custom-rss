            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/crimson-desert-golden-star-boss-battle-banner-1760099376651.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Bosses are woven into the fabric of Crimson Desert’s world. Judging by the many, many different ones we’ve now seen across multiple hands-on demos and videos, it appears that they’re frequently a showstopping spectacle that puts all of your abilities to the test. One such headline attraction is Golden Star, a monstrous mechanical dragon that we fought at the Seoul offices of developer Pearl Abyss in preparation for this month’s IGN First. If you watched our last gameplay video, you’ll have already seen this mighty boss in action, but here we’re going to take you behind the scenes to show you how it was designed, all the way from the sound of its beating wings to the method of its downfall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s safe to say that Crimson Desert’s continent of Pywel offers classic fantasy with a twist, often blending unexpected elements into the mix, including (but not limited to) rideable dinosaurs and supercharged mechs. The Golden Star, with its combination of classic fantasy beast and sci-fi metallic sheen, is this philosophy personified. Members of the Pearl Abyss design team explained that they’d put a lot of focus into trying to blend the organic and the mechanical together, but as part of that, perhaps surprisingly, they also wanted there to be a level of believability. The art team noted that, even though Golden Star looks like a sci-fi dragon, a lot of the materials used in its character model were inspired by everyday materials that could be found not just in modern times, but even back in the more fantasy-adjacent Middle Ages. It’s an approach Pearl Abyss applied not only to the Golden Star, but also to all the robots, industrial buildings, and steam trains that you can find in the game. While these elements lean closer towards science fiction, the design team was insistent on maintaining a sense of believability. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this helps us buy into the idea that this is a beast that could have genuinely been constructed by Marni, the inventor who sends you out on a quest to battle Golden Star. Exploring Marni’s office in the run-up to this encounter further educates us on the dragon’s origin, as the room is littered with paperwork concerning its construction, as well as industrial machinery that foreshadows the beast’s mechanical nature. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you finally meet Golden Star, whose claws crumble age-old masonry with ease, you can clearly see how the machine mimics the organic. The Crimson Desert design team made sure that the gears and chains beneath its armoured shell “realistically” operate in unison. Together, these components take the shape of something you’ve never quite seen before, but simultaneously it also feels familiar — the beast’s swooping golden wings and earth-shaking roar can’t help but conjure up memories of Bioshock Infinite’s Songbird, an equally impressive mechanical invention that’s also a man-made creation engineered from a fantasy framework. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sounds generated by Golden Star presented the team with a very specific challenge: having to combine the organic motions of a winged beast with the mechanical clanks and whirrs of something man-made in nature. On our visit to Pearl Abyss’ South Korean headquarters, we were shown around its purpose-built Foley recording studio and given a walkthrough of all of these different elements, and an insight into the enjoyably explorative process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">First on the agenda was the flapping of its wings, which also became the basis for all other dragons in the game. While Golden Star is mechanical, you’ll notice that its wings are giant sheets of fabric, and so their sound is also created by moving fabric: the waving of a leather jacket. The weathered rustling of the material evokes the sound of a wing’s membrane cutting through the air and provided a solid starting point for how to add aural layers to this creature, with the ultimate goal of creating something previously unheard. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pearl Abyss wanted to make you feel overwhelmed by the overall size and force of Golden Star.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up was to give it metallic heft, hence the closing of a creaky, clanking cabinet door being introduced to the mix. It’s followed by a ribbed, plastic hose — the kind you’d normally expect to see at the end of a vacuum cleaner — being pulled along the corner of that cabinet to further add texture to the dragon’s many moving parts. A smaller plastic pipe is then pulled and pushed like an accordion, as this friction,  surprisingly, adds an almost cyber-like tone to the beast. It’s this experimentation and commitment to using everyday objects in unexpected ways that make this process look very fun. On top of that, a large fork was dragged along a metal chain while the fingers of an armoured gauntlet were fiddled with at the joints to punctuate the sound of the wings' smooth motion, providing the effect with a mechanical edge. It all blends into a symphony of noises that creates a soundscape as engineered as the in-game dragon itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Foley studio is just one impressive aspect of the cutting-edge facilities found at Pearl Abyss' mammoth office building, which also houses a full 3D scanning centre and a performance capture space where many of the game’s cutscenes and combat animations were recorded. I found particular enjoyment in watching my colleague, Matt Purslow, experience the latter for himself, as he stepped into a mocap suit and swung a foam sword around, which was then mirrored in real-time on a neighbouring screen. It’s all very impressive tech, even if Matt could admittedly do with a little weapons training to fully take advantage of it. The pen is mightier than the sword and all that, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This tech fuels Pearl Abyss’ creative ambitions, with each boss fight in Crimson Desert not only posing a challenge to the player, but also pushing the limits of the studio’s creativity. The design team wanted to “find out their boundaries and limitations,” and Golden Star presented a particular conundrum due to its sheer bulkiness and ability to fly around at speed. That was very much a problem for a ground-bound, human-sized player to take down. This David vs Goliath effect was desired by the developers, though, who explained that they “wanted to make you feel overwhelmed by the overall size and force of the Golden Star”. To take it down, you’ll need to find its weakness.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/golden-star-arrow-1760102138540.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As with many of the bosses in Crimson Desert, there is a method to defeat this beast proficiently designed into the encounter, although it’s not the only way to achieve victory, as to incubate that feeling of being able to approach this world’s combat in any way you want to. You can brute force your way through this fight, reading its attack patterns and dealing damage to its gleaming head whenever it rears it. But Golden Star’s true Achilles heel is the power of an EMP blast. Though not strictly a puzzle boss, there are some elements of that style in this fight, such as luring the dragon into breathing fire onto pillars dotted around the arena, which heat up and, in turn, power machines that generate EMP bullets for your arm cannon. Fire enough of these into its body, and the Golden Star will be stunned, allowing you to wail on its collapsed skeleton. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crimson Desert combat team revealed that they didn't want to make the boss into too much of a puzzle. While there are certain conditions that you need to fulfill in order to get the EMP to work, there are definitely other ways to defeat it. The team specified that you can damage the dragon using a bow and arrow, or your combat skills. They hope that players will work out interesting strategies and eventually share them with others when Crimson Desert is finally available next March. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The EMP method is certainly an effective one, and something the team made sure was seeded on the path up to the fight. Earlier skirmishes in this quest were designed to show off the capabilities of an EMP, as you take on an army of robotic fiends. The idea, the team explained, was to ensure that the mechanic was a consistent theme in the run-up to the Golden Star battle, and so that when you reached the boss itself, using the EMP would be second nature. You’d understand that Golden Star was a robotic enemy affected by your EMP devices and instinctively know what to do. This approach required focus on the placement of mechanics and gimmicks, ensuring the creation of a natural learning curve up to the boss fight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Variety is very much the name of the game in Crimson Desert, as our story that took <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-combat-explained">a deep dive into combat</a> explained, and that variety permeates through everything, especially boss design. Nowhere else, outside of a pilotable battle robot, have we seen EMPs utilised in this adventure in our several hours of hands-on with it. It's a further example of how each mission, each moment spent in this world, is aiming to be different from the last.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While mechanical variety is clearly important, the team also noted that variety was inspired by the bosses being considered as characters within the world. The team explained that they tried to put themselves into the shoes of each boss and really consider what their motives would be. That inspired their moves and overall design, and helped generate diversity among the dozens of bosses present in the game. It’s a philosophy that is certainly on full display when you place all of the bosses we’ve seen so far in Crimson Desert alongside each other. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-has-brought-absolute-cinema-back-to-multiplayer.1326928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capturing the point is the backbone of many multiplayer games, and it’s often the most exciting moment of a match. It’s when Zarya drops a Graviton Surge that glues the entire enemy team together, ready to be obliterated by D.Va’s Self-Destruct. Or when your Super gauge finally fills and you’re able to unleash your Guardian’s point-clearing powers. Or when you unlock the perfect Killstreak that rains down a warehouse-worth of munitions, obliterating the opposition seconds before they can capture the zone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But no one does capture points like Battlefield. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I recently played a Conquest match of Battlefield 6 that saw a point on Operation Firestorm gradually attacked and seized over a couple of minutes. At first it was just on-foot soldiers, charging in and popping smoke to conceal their assault. Then the tanks turned up. Cannons roared, chunks of masonry scattered. Sparks fizzed as engineers patched up armour. And then, like some kind of finale fireworks, a jet screamed overhead, its deployed payload securing the objective from the final enemies who were holding out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As this was happening, the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/absolute-cinema" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet’s favourite Scorsese meme</a> came to mind. “Absolute Cinema.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield’s large-scale, combined arms, destructive multiplayer is unlike anything else. “Cinematic” is a quality that typically feels antithetical to multiplayer shooters, which are generally required to be more clean and precise. Clear sightlines. Hard counters. Precision-engineered, three-lane maps. Intense competition. There’s no room for spectacle, which is reserved for single-player campaigns. Not in Battlefield, though. To play Battlefield 6 is to be an actor in a war movie. And what a feeling that is, especially after years of sweaty battle royales and esport tactical shooters ruling the charts while prior, lesser accomplished Battlefield games languished on the sidelines. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6-jeep-chase-1760623275852.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6's vehicles are a vital part of creating its war movie-like feel. | Image credit: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle royale has reigned supreme for almost a decade now, and it’s not difficult to see why the fight-to-the-last-player format has endured. Sure, the never-ending churn of brand crossovers that feeds Fortnite and Warzone plays more than a small part in keeping the masses entertained, but it’s undeniable that every match has the potential to tell a story of nail-biting survival. The one-life-only, you-versus-everyone nature of battle royale makes it an inherently tense experience, a trait the genre shares with the extraction shooter’s breakout successes – the pressure that builds across a match of Hunt: Showdown or Escape from Tarkov is unrivaled. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That kind of stressful, hyper-competitive design is also the fundamental fuel of Counter-Strike, the most-played game on Steam, and Valorant, Riot’s incredibly popular tactical shooter. Their tightly designed maps, painstakingly calibrated balance, and high-stakes, single-life matches are the ingredients for exhilarating digital sport. And while sport can indeed tell stories – the epic highs and lows of high school football, to reference <a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/337640108/epic-highs-and-lows-of-high-school-football" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another meme</a> – there’s a significant difference between those stories of clutch victories and “cinema”.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Battlefield’s design allows emergent stories to happen in every match, and every time it feels like a scene from Black Hawk Down. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is the complete opposite of games like Valorant and Fortnite. While it certainly has rules and parameters, Battlefield is equally dedicated to immersion. Where Counter-Strike’s maps are clearly artificial constructs designed to promote the most competitive play, Battlefield aims to ship you off to war… or, more accurately, a war movie set. Each map’s pathways may have been laid out by a level designer with multiplayer engagements in mind, but they feel like slices of crumbling conflict zones rather than sport arenas.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those maps, and the objectives within them, create moments of big, loud, messy drama. Yes, that drama may often be rooted in clutch victories similar to what we see in the big esports games, but they’re made from the components of explosive action movies rather than streamer skirmishes. Battlefield’s dramatic because a tank is unloading shells into the building you’re trying to hold, and the walls are creaking and the whole thing is about to collapse, but your squad’s medic has finally arrived to resuscitate a nearby engineer, who’s able to fire off their RPG just in time to destroy that tank and save us all. That kind of combination just doesn’t exist in Counter-Strike or even Fortnite, despite the latter’s attempt to throw everything in existence onto its deadly island.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6-drag-revive-1760623339106.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The new drag-and-revive mechanic creates heroic moments. | Image credit: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield’s design allows emergent stories like these to happen in every match, and every time it feels like a scene from Black Hawk Down. The squad and class systems only reinforce that. You’re all characters in a war movie, each doing their part. Laying down covering fire. Repairing a tank you’re huddled behind. Scoring a headshot on the sniper that’s got your group pinned down. The new drag-and-revive mechanic is perhaps the best example of this. Having my broken body pulled to safety, bullets striking the ground around my legs and explosions ringing in my ears, is one of the most heroic, brothers-in-arms things I’ve ever experienced in a game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the competitive-focused shooters that dominate the charts are seemingly governed by “the meta” – viral builds and strategies that threaten to make every match feel the same. It’s a phenomenon that really cements them as online video games rather than, say, counter-terrorism simulators or superhero showdowns, and in turn further divorces them from Battlefield’s sense of messy spectacle. And while we all know that the meta will eventually infest Battlefield 6 in one way or another, it can never truly control Battlefield, because its greatest strength is those emergent, cinematic moments, not its weapon stats or KDA ratios. No wonder “only-in-Battlefield” moments have been a core part of the series’ marketing for many years now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in the summer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-preview">I wondered if Battlefield 6 was playing it too safe</a>. As fun as its preview demonstration was, I had concerns that EA wasn’t pushing the series in any interesting new directions. And while it’s true that the final product is the very definition of classic Battlefield, and often feels like a game I’ve played for hundreds of hours before, I’m enjoying it more than I have any other PvP multiplayer game in years. In many respects, that’s simply because, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer">our glowing multiplayer review</a> explains, Battlefield 6 is fantastically layered and smartly designed. But more than that, it’s those emergent stories. Those player-created, war movie-like sequences that simply don’t happen in any other game. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6-beach-landing-1760623407330.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The campaign attempts to recreate the intensity of Saving Private Ryan's D-Day landings, but fails to make it as exciting as a multiplayer scramble. | Image credit: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a shame none of that can be found in the single-player. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-review">campaign review</a> quite rightly criticised it for not just being incredibly dull, but also for making next to no use of Battlefield’s iconic components. There’s no interesting squad dynamics, limited use of vehicles, and its destruction is all too frequently scripted rather than improvised. It doesn’t feel anything like Battlefield. Rather, its linear mission design makes it all too clear that it’s using Call of Duty as a blueprint. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why Call of Duty? Put the multiplayer suites of these series’ side-by-side and it’s clear they have almost nothing in common beyond their military theming. While there’s long been a rivalry between the two franchises, it's because they’re both fighting for different visions of the post-Medal of Honor FPS, rather than scrapping over the same idea. And so you’d think the same would apply to the campaign, that Battlefield’s single-player would be a distinctly different beast to Call of Duty. But they’re not. They’re the same tightly-controlled, linear shooters. Well, almost the same. Call of Duty is, more often than not, pretty good at this kind of thing. Battlefield… less so. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an alternate timeline, things may have been different. Back in 2022, EA established Ridgeline Games to develop Battlefield 6’s campaign. The studio was led by Marcus Lehto, one of the co-creators of Halo. With that history, you can see how Battlefield would have benefitted from his guidance. Halo’s campaigns are, afterall, built on a bedrock of wide open levels that allow smart use of infantry and vehicles – some of Battlefield’s vital building blocks. But the studio was struck by industry restructuring woes and shuttered in 2024, leaving Criterion Games and Ripple Effect Studios seemingly scrambling to piece something together in time for Battlefield 6’s 2025 release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hollow results left me wondering how Battlefield could have captured the cinema of its multiplayer without resorting to copying Infinity Ward’s homework. Considering its trademark  components, Battlefield seems like an ideal place to recapture the ideas of EA’s own, long-abandoned Mercenaries. With their sandbox open worlds, vehicles, artillery, and completely destructible buildings, Mercenaries seems an ideal template for what a modern Battlefield campaign could look like. But I’d take anything that actually reflects the series’ long-established identity. We can only hope that the development pipeline for Battlefield 7 is less troubled and more ambitious.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for now, we have Battlefield 6 and its joyously destructive, noisy multiplayer. The game where every objective is the stage for a war movie, packed with explosions, smoke, sparks, and the rattle of a dozen rifles. Where jeeps screech around the corner carrying much-needed reinforcements, and jets scramble to drop tide-turning payloads. Battlefield is most definitely back, and it’s absolute cinema.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-brought-absolute-cinema-back-to-multiplayer]]></content:encoded>

We're enjoying it considerably so far, and it's got its own interesting story of a group of young adults learning to love and protect their city and all the people and Pokémon in it. But there's one moment in Z-A that's got us thinking about another story entirely, one contained in Pokémon Legends: Arceus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, there's a museum in Lumiose City that you can visit in Z-A that includes an exhibit on the land of Hisui, which is where Arceus takes place. While most of the exhibit is made up of fun easter eggs for Arceus, there's at least one exhibit that resolves a dangling plot thread left over at the end of Arceus. It's a big one, too, as it gives one character's tragic story a happy ending at last.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I won't say more without warning you of spoilers. We won't include any spoilers for Z-A here, but we will spoil what the museum exhibit is, as well as the entire story of one of Arceus' supporting characters. Read onward at your own risk:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm talking about the story of the character Ingo. Let me catch you up, first. Ingo actually appears in Black and White, where he's a boss in the Battle Subway along with his twin brother, Emmet. Ingo isn't a particularly critical character in these games, but his importance grows significantly when he shows up in Arceus. You see, Arceus takes place in the distant past, but the Ingo we meet there is definitely the same guy, as he talks about having fuzzy memories of a brother and the time period he came from. But Ingo also doesn't know how he got to Hisui, or how to get back home to his brother and the Pokémon partners he left behind. As best as we can infer, the god of the Pokemon world, Arceus, likely transported Ingo back in time the same way it transported the main character back in time at the start of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frankly, this sucks! Ingo clearly misses his brother and partners, but doesn't understand how this happened to him or why. He's super depressed the whole game. And this just...never gets resolved. At the end of Arceus, Ingo is still stuck in ancient Hisui, with no way home. But fortunately, Z-A appears to finally give Ingo a happy ending via the museum.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, there's a diagram in the museum of the Training Grounds, which is where Ingo hangs out in Arceus. The diagram has the following caption: "There are records of a man named Ingo providing guidance in the ways of Pokémon battle, but it is said that he simply vanished one day after stating, 'It's time for me to return.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's not definitive, this seems to imply that at some point after the events of Arceus, Ingo was spirited back home in explicably, finally getting to reunite with his brother and Pokémon. We'll never know for sure, but the museum exhibit clearly wants to prompt the player to imagine he was finally freed from Arceus' time traveling torment. I'm personally thrilled by this, as the god Pokémon Arceus' kidnapping spree was one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-arceus-tragic-story">most baffling bits of that game's plot for me</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/20251016100740-01k7h8mj1y8vvn1n25jvfw1dr5-1760627388298.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/20251016100743-01k7h8mwqjrz9qyzth7q4evtyq-1760627388299.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">My <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">review-in-progress of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is now live, if you want to check out my impressions of the first 24 hours, with a full review coming next week.

If you happen to miss out on the seasonal savings this year, though, have no fear. There are a couple of different times throughout the year where you can find good savings on some of the very <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Below, we’ve broken down some of the best times to buy board games during the year. Alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a>, you can also find killer deals during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-2024">Amazon Prime Day</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/prime-big-deal-days">October Prime Day</a>. Most retailers also frequently have board games on sale throughout the year, and we’ll point you towards some of the best ones to check out.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">For the Best Time to Buy Board Games, Keep in Mind…</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="#blackfriday" data-cy="styled-link"><strong>Black Friday and Cyber Monday</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="#prime" data-cy="styled-link"><strong>Amazon Prime Day</strong></a><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="#octoberprime" data-cy="styled-link">October Prime Day</a></li></ul></li><li><strong></strong><a href="#retailers" data-cy="styled-link"><strong>Retailer Sales</strong></a></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2" id="blackfriday">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/11/26/bfnewgloomhaven-1637938137595.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best times to pick up discounted board games is during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a>, which occur at the end of November. It’s not just on the day that sales will pop up, either. You’ll usually find sales at a variety of different retailers during the entire week of Black Friday and the following week after Cyber Monday. Some retailers even start up their sales as early as the first week in November like what is happening with .</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Major retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target are all great places to look for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals">board game deals</a> and will often offer up 2 for 1 deals that make it worth buying multiple games. It’s also worth keeping GameStop on your radar during this time as they’re likely to have plenty of discounts on board games, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For these sale event, it’s also a good idea to plan ahead for what you want. Board games, in particular, can sell out during this period of time, so make a list of the ones you want before diving into the discounts. It’s also worth keeping multiple tabs open to compare prices at various retailers. Sometimes, you’ll find a 30% discount at one spot and 40% off at another, so you want to make sure you get the best deal possible before hitting that 'Buy' button.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon Prime Day</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/07/06/boardgames-br-1657138523925.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Black Friday, Amazon Prime Day is another sales event that’s worth keeping in mind for board game deals. This usually occurs earlier on in the year, around the end of June or start of July, so if you missed a board game deal during one sale you can plot to pick it up at the next. However, unlike Black Friday, Prime Day only occurs at Amazon and is only for Prime members. The only time you'll see competing deals is if another retailer, like Best Buy, counters the sale day with their own selections. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-vs-black-friday-deals">Prime Day is similar to Black Friday</a>, you’ll want to make a list of which board games you want to buy for your collection. This will help you figure out what to look for but also helps with setting a budget. Another helpful planning tool is using a website like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>camelcamelcamel</u></a>, which shows the price history on a product that’s listed on Amazon so you can see how often it goes on sale and at what price. This can help you figure out if it’s a better buy during Prime Day or if you should wait until Black Friday rolls around again to pick it up.</p><h3 data-cy="title3" id="octoberprime">October Prime Day</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon also has a second Prime Day in the year – called Prime Big Deal Days or Prime Day 2, for short – that occurs in October. During this 48-hour sale event, they give a little preview of what’s to come during Black Friday, making it another good time to check out board game deals and see if something you missed in the first Prime Day popped up again here. It’s also just a good time to scope out the Black Friday deals and see what’s in store for you then. This year, Prime Big Deals Day took place on October 7 and 8, with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/board-game-deals-october-prime-day-2025">particularly awesome spread of board game deals</a> we hope return for Black Friday. </p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="retailers">Retailer Sales</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/13/amazon-2-blogroll-logos-1699901424350.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The nice thing about board games is that you can find deals on them fairly frequently at a variety of stores all throughout the year. Amazon, in particular, has random deals on them often. And, as mentioned previously, it’s worth using a tool like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>camelcamelcamel</u></a> so you can see when the best time is to pick up a board game you want there. Their helpful price history chart can show you what times of year their prices drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other retailers, like Target, will usually match Amazon’s board game deals throughout the year as well. Alongside those two spots, it’s worth keeping an eye on stores like GameStop, Walmart, and even Barnes and Noble to find board game deals. We’ll always keep you updated on the latest board game deals as well, whether that’s during big sale events like Black Friday or on a regular basis in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals"><u>best board game deals</u></a> roundup.
