Popular mods include turning Iron Man into Vegeta from Dragon Ball and Mantis into a goth. There’s even a mod that turns Jeff the Land Shark into Pochita from Chainsaw Man.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/10/mr-1736510188657.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Vegeta as Iron Man mod for Marvel Rivals has been downloaded over 60,000 times.

Despite the risk of getting banned, Marvel Rivals mods remain hugely popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until now. Players are reporting the Season 1 update has added asset hash checking, which in turn has disabled mods. The official Marvel Rivals Discord is starting to fill up with questions from bemused players who are asking why their mods aren’t working, and social media is now bubbling up the explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase told IGN: "It is not recommended to modify any game files, as doing so carries the risk of getting banned."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some have suggested mod makers may be able to issue workarounds for their creations, but as it stands Marvel Rivals is a mod-free game. And the crackdown perhaps comes as little surprise. NetEase generates revenue from the free-to-play hero shooter through the sale of premium skins. If modding threatens that revenue in any way, NetEase will have taken a dim view.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve seen a similar crackdown from other developers who sell premium skins for their games. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-bans-mods-from-public-servers-says-official-mod-tools-are-coming">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive and publisher Focus Entertainment at one point disabled mods for the game</a>, although later reversed its decision.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-signals-single-player-only-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-on-pc-requires-a-psn-account-3-months-ahead-of-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has signalled that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> on PC requires a PSN account three months before the game’s release on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>, the Steam page for Naughty Dog’s single-player adventure includes the now-standard Sony requirement for a PlayStation Network account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PC gamers had little hope that Sony would budge on the PSN requirement for its Steam releases, and so it has proved with The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered. As a result, PC gamers in over 100 countries won’t be able to buy the game on Steam because Sony does not operate PlayStation accounts in those markets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PSN is available in just 73 countries, leaving many out in the cold. The Baltics, including states that are part of the European Union (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), and the vast majority of countries in Africa are also excluded. For years, some players in these countries have created a PSN in a supported region to get around the restrictions, but there are concerns that Sony could ban the accounts of those who do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s PC push has been controversial to say the least, with most of its games suffering negative Steam reviews as a result of the PSN requirement regardless of whether the games themselves are great or run well. In September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnark-launches-to-mixed-steam-user-reviews-with-most-complaining-about-the-playstation-network-account-requirement"><u>God of War Ragnarök</u> met with a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam following its PC launch</a>, with most of the complaints revolving around the PSN requirement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-mod-removes-controversial-psn-requirement-and-its-creator-has-vowed-to-maintain-it">One disgruntled fan even created a <u>God of War Ragnarök</u> mod that removed the requirement</a>, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nexus-mods-says-creator-of-god-of-war-ragnarok-psn-bypass-mod-has-pulled-it-offline">it was pulled down out of fear of reprisal from Sony</a>. Exacerbating the backlash is that Sony has doubled down on this policy even for single-player games, such as God of War Ragnarök, Until Dawn, and now The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s PSN account requirement for its PC games was thrust into the limelight with the release of Arrowhead’s explosive PC and PS5 co-op shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> earlier in 2024. Helldivers 2 suffered a review bomb campaign on Steam after Sony made PSN accounts mandatory for PC gamers on Valve’s platform (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-psn-review-bomb-cape-mia-as-arrowhead-awaits-clarity-on-game-being-sold-in-more-countries"><u>Arrowhead subsequently decided to turn the user review history graph into a cape, which is ready for launch but has yet to release</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-reverses-course-on-helldivers-2-psn-account-requirement"><u>Sony eventually backed down and reversed Helldivers 2’s PSN account requirement</u></a>, but the game remains unavailable in the many countries that lack PSN. And indeed all Sony’s games on PC now suffer from this problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it announced the PSN requirement for Helldivers 2, Sony said it had to do with player security. “Account linking plays a critical role in protecting our players and upholding the values of safety and security provided on PlayStation and PlayStation Studios games,” Sony said in a statement issued at the time. “This is our main way to protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling the banning of players that engage in that type of behavior. It also allows those players that have been banned the right to appeal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps bracing itself for a backlash it knew was to come, Sony added: “We understand that while this may be an inconvenience to some of you, this step will help us to continue to build a community that you are all proud to be a part of. “Many thanks for your continued support of Helldivers 2!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered likely faces a similar backlash on launch that Sony’s other PC games have seen, despite the Steam warning months in advance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
