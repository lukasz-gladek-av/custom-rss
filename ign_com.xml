            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprise! A brand new Nintendo Direct focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> will land tomorrow, Tuesday August 19 at 6am Pacific, 9am Eastern, or 2pm UK time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, Nintendo revealed the show first via its Nintendo Today smartphone app, and promised the broadcast would feature 45 minutes of information about the upcoming Switch 2 game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders is notable for being the first new project in years from Masahiro Sakurai, the famed director of Nintendo's smash hit Super Smash Bros. series. Tomorrow's deep dive look at the game is also intriguingly timed, suggesting it may finally be playable at this week's Gamescom event in Cologne.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To date, Nintendo has kept details of Kirby Air Riders close to its chest, though has said the pink puffball-staring racer should be expected to launch on Switch 2 later this year. It seems likely tomorrow's Direct will provide a firmer release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced earlier this year alongside further details of the Switch 2 itself, Kirby Air Riders will be a sequel to the 2003 cult classic Kirby Air Ride for GameCube. Production on the game began in earnest back in 2023, following the end of Sakurai's time overseeing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's lengthy schedule of downloadable content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no suggestion tomorrow's show will include any other Switch 2 games beyond Kirby Air Riders (sorry, Metroid fans). Still, more information on what's next from Sakurai and his talented development team should suffice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience," claims modder.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A modder has created a solution for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers"><u>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</u></a> PC players unhappy with the recent changes introduced in Patch 1.5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, developer Leenzee Games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/update-wuchang-fallen-feathers-dev-admits-performance-issues-should-never-have-occurred"><u>promised fans</u></a> that a number of performance and optimization issues plaguing the game since launch were on the way. And while Patch 1.5 does address many of these issues, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-performance-patch-makes-drastic-changes-to-enemies-and-story-and-players-arent-happy"><u>it also made sweeping, and unexpected, changes to many of the game's enemies, dialogue, and story</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we explained at the time, prior to the patch, you were able to target and kill certain human NPCs you encountered throughout the game. These characters were passive and didn't attack you, but murdering them affected your character's "madness" mechanic. That's no longer the case, however — the NPCs are untargetable and unkillable, effectively removing the ability to choose to interact with the madness mechanic in that specific way, and you cannot kill boss enemies any longer, but only "exhaust" them into surrendering. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect, the changes have not been well received, and many players have taken to Steam's discussion forums and user review section to share their disappointment. And within days of 1.5's release, a modder has already created a mod that rolls back the changes wholesale, be they for the better or worse, to version 1.4.1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience - Most late game bosses, NPCs and enemies now get exhausted instead of dying and give you meaningless banter instead of story-advancing dialog from the original game," the modder <a href="https://v/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a>. "Basically, patch 1.5 has ruined the game's story and immersion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mod creator themselves admitted it's a "fairly complex mod that modifies game files," and as it also undoes some of the QoL improvements introduced in Patch 1.5, they point some players who want to rollback the story changes but keep QoL changes to additional mods like <a href="https://https//www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/136" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fast Vertical Traversal</u></a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/146" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Improved Recovery</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/124" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fast Item Pick Up</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is a Soulslike action-RPG set in the land of Shu during the dark and tumultuous late Ming Dynasty. You play as a mysterious warrior afflicted by a horrific feather disease, who uncovers hidden secrets and battles supernatural enemies in an ancient empire teetering on the edge of collapse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is yet another great soulslike to add to the ever-increasing pile, featuring excellent combat, wonderful level design, an incredible skill tree, and fearsome bosses. Just watch out for some steep difficulty dips and spikes, and a reliance on cheap-feeling 'gotcha!' ambushes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
